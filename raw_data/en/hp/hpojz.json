At the Tibetan exile cen-tre of Dharamsala, Westerners could be seen attending the Tibetan Tra- ditional Medicine hospital while Tibetans could be seen attending bio- medical Delek hospital. Despite this empirical observation, the existingliterature concerning 'Tibetans' and 'medicine' dealt almost exclusivelywith Traditional Medicine. Given that this use of biomedicine wasclearly common throughout the Tibetan cultural world, a study of howthat pattern of resort arose was an obvious lacuna in the field. This study was undertaken in the UK, the Netherlands, US, India, and Bhutan, with the financial and institutional support of a Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London research fellowship. I wish to thank Centre Director, Professor HalCook, administrator Alan Shiel, secretary Emma Griffin and colleaguesVivienne Lo, Rhodri Hayward, Michael Neve, and Professors ChrisLawrence and Roger Cooter for their support, and for sage assistancein matters Indic and Sanskritic over a number of years, Dominic Wu-jastyk.

The discovery that most common in-fections were caused by biological agents (''germs'') led to the develop- ment of entirely new therapies and curative strategies. That finding also underpinned the development of invasive surgery as a major armof medical practice, something which only became possible when theneed for aseptic conditions was recognised. A host of other developments during that period helped fuel the medical revolution. Among major advances were the emergence of reli-able anaesthetics that prefaced major surgery becoming routine in themetropolis, and the manufacture of improved technological aids to di- agnosis, such as microscopes and X-rays. These enabled specific dis- ease-causing agents to be identified and subsequently countered. With-in a few decades of the breakthrough in understanding disease causa-tion, many of the epidemic diseases that had plagued mankindthroughout recorded history had been largely eradicated from Westernsociety. Scientific and technological advances in medicine were mirrored in the social sphere both by environmental transformations in individual and group practice - clean houses and streets for example - and by a growing professionalisation of the medical world. Medicine in the Westbecame an organised body of knowledge and practice, with profes-sional journals to disseminate agreed norms and new research. Stan-dardised training and qualifications were instituted and these were re-cognised and regularised at state level. Medicine became part of theapparatus of the state, which sponsored research and structural im-provements in both civil and military spheres. These developments greatly enhanced the formerly low status of the medical profession. It became increasingly dominated by practitioners from the middle andupper classes, which extended its social authority and strengthened itslinks to the state and political power. As a result of this process, from around 1870 onwards, medicine in the West became increasingly distinct from the non-Western medicalsystems with which it had earlier shared numerous concepts, practices,and historical links. It also became almost entirely distinct from its own earlier understandings and practices. The new form of medicinedid build on existing structures, and there were certain elements ofcontinuity such as a shared ethical basis as encapsulated in the Hippo- cratic oath. But medicine in the West now became a full-fledged 'medi- cal system ', in the sense that it was both an organised body of knowl-edge and practice concerning diagnosis and therapy, and a dynamic en-tity situated within socio-political, historical and economic processes. The systemisation of medicine was part of a wider post-Darwinian process of scientific and technological modernisation that transformedWestern society on the basis of new secular scientific worldviews. Theauthority of the new medical system primarily derived from its scienti- fic basis, and while it inherited the general designation of 'medicine' from its predecessors, if further distinction was needed the term 'scien-tific medicine' was used. But the emergence of this system in an era ofEuropean colonial rule meant that its theory and practice were rapidlytransmitted to colonial territories such as India, where the British hadestablished a dominant presence in the 18 thcentury. There it was com- monly known as 'Western medicine' in acknowledgement of its originsand to distinguish it from the local medical practices. ('Western medi- cine' is used here for the pre-1900 period or in an oppositional con- text. 1It later acquired other names including 'biomedicine' - used here to indicate associations with systemisation and modernity. 'Westernbiomedicine' is used to refer to the totality of these meanings.) By the beginning of the 19 thcentury, the British East India Company was the leading power in Bengal and it was increasingly drawn into en-gagement with their northern neighbours as the century progressed.Major wars were fought against the Nepali, Sikh and Bhutanese king- doms, as well as minor campaigns against lesser Himalayan principali- ties, until the British controlled the entire northern frontier of Indiafrom Burma to Afghanistan. Across the Himalayas, behind each of thestates they had conquered, lay Tibet. That mountainous land had beenvisited by East India Company emissaries in the 1770s but had, since1793, followed a policy of isolation from European influence. BritishIndia was determined to establish diplomatic and trading links withthe Tibetan state, whose exact political relationship with China, its nominal suzerain , remained unclear to the British. That determination increased with fears that Russia, Britain 's great rival in Central Asia, might gain influence at Lhasa. After effectively taking over Sikkim in 1888-89, a British mission un- der the diplomatic control of Colonel Francis Younghusband invadedTibet in 1903-04 and forced them to accept diplomatic ties with BritishIndia to the exclusion of Russia. In the wider context of the 'GreatGame', the even-then romanticised contest between Britain and Russia20 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINfor control of Central Asia and the passes to India, the Younghusband mission was a major initiative. The Tibetan frontier was thus at theforefront of imperial strategies at the time, and a personal concern ofthe Viceroys of India, particularly the great pro-consul, Lord Curzon (1899-1905). Like trade, medicine followed the flag. British physicians accompa- nied both diplomatic and military missions beyond the expanding boundaries of British India. Their primary purpose was to maintainthe health of the imperial forces, but they also treated all comersamong the indigenous population, including those wounded by imper-ial armies. This was a deliberate policy. While there was a significanthumanitarian aspect to their work, its political value was recognised as being of primary importance to the interests of the colonial state. It was observed that: The peaceful and civilizing influence of the work done in thedispensaries and by regimental surgeons on the frontiers of In-dia, has been in political importance equivalent to the presenceof some thousands of bayonets ... no amount of military coer-cion or of purity of administration could have exercised the same pacifying effect ... produced by the sympathetic care and successful treatment of diseases, many of which had previouslybeen considered incurable. 2 Biomedicine thus formally entered Sikkim and Tibet along with the in-vading British forces in 1888-89 and 1903-04 respectively, and it wassubsequently developed under imperial authority. But there were otherforces that played a part in the spread of the new medical system into the Tibetan world. A significant contribution was made by a separate if loosely linked force; Christian missionaries. The success of their evan-gelical efforts in India had hitherto been limited, but missionariesfound the new medical technologies a powerful tool for gaining in-creased access to local society. As a result, there was a rapid growth inthe number of medically-qualified missionaries in the last years of the19 thcentury. Many were attracted to service in the Himalayan regions and as the Government of India spread its influence northwards to the Tibetan frontier, the missionaries too became increasingly focussed on that land. They established a chain of medical centres around Tibet'sfrontiers with India and China in the hope that this would lead to theirbeing allowed to enter, and ultimately to evangelise in, Tibet. Govern-ment and missionary medical initiatives thus advanced in conjunction,though not necessarily or always in co-operation. Although itinerant dispensaries were suggested at a late stage, both missionary and government medical initiatives followed the dispensaryINTRODUCTION 21model of small biomedical centres; 'one of Western medicine's most distinctive and effective institutional forms'.3The dispensary system model provides a structural example of the many continuities in colo-nial and post-colonial medicine in South Asia. It remains paramount to this day, and has also been adopted by systemised Traditional Medi- cine. The impact of the new medical system on the indigenous population of the Himalayas was initially very limited and its uptake slow and no-tably selective. But as it became increasingly popular with the local peo-ple aspects of biomedical practice were adapted to local conditions andcultures and its structures and personnel were gradually indigenised inthe later 20 thcentury. In most Himalayan states, this process was only completed in the post-colonial period, when India and China gave pre-dominancy to biomedicine in the provision of public health services.But in at least one state - Sikkim - the process was virtually completeby the end of the colonial period. The origins of the systematic transfer of Western medicine to the Hi- malayas are to be found, therefore, in three factors which began to con-verge in the 1870s. Firstly, the conjunction of scientific and medical ad-vances in the metropolis; secondly, the political circumstances in Brit- ish India; and, finally, the increasing use of medicine as a conversion strategy by missionaries. In the 20 thcentury, the influence of the mis- sionaries slowly faded, but the imperial government continued to usemedicine as a political weapon in the region until the British withdrewfrom South Asia in the late 1940s. Their role was then inherited by thenew governments of India and China. Regional scope In this work we follow the introduction and development of biomedi-cine in the wake of British imperial movements through Sikkim tocentral Tibet and Bhutan, and discuss issues arising from that process.'Tibet', unless otherwise specified, refers here to the traditional centralprovinces of U \u00a8and Tsang, and in particular to the areas around the British medical dispensaries at Yatung, Gyantse, and the Tibetan capi- tal, Lhasa. We are concerned here with the biomedical system, rather than with earlier European medical practice in the region. By the 1870s, when at least the theoretical aspects of the new medical system were becomingestablished, imperial efforts to create political links to Lhasa throughNepal or the western Himalayas had been largely abandoned. 4Thus, while there were medical initiatives in those regions with many simila-rities in form and process to those of the eastern Himalayas, develop-22 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINments there were structurally and strategically separate from the pro- cess examined in this work. While noting, therefore, some relevant as-pects of developments in the western Himalayas and the medical ef-forts of 18 thcentury Catholic missionaries in Tibet, the arrangement of chapters and the regional focus of this narrative reflects the post-1870movements from Kalimpong-Darjeeling, through Sikkim towards theTibetan capital. We thus trace early biomedical developments in the frontier districts, particularly Kalimpong, in chapter one, before considering Sikkim inchapter two, and Tibet in chapters three and four. Chapter five dis-cusses Bhutan, a state much neglected by the British and one wherethe development of biomedicine was largely a post-colonial process. In chapter six, we discuss the problematic issue of how and why biomedi- cine was taken up, established, and indigenised among Himalayanpeoples with pre-existing cultural forms of healing. This discussion isfollowed by our conclusions. It is important to remember that the region with which we are con- cerned was not formally part of British India. It was, in the contempor-ary view, the northern frontier of that empire and the primary imperialconcern with that frontier was in the context of British India's security. Tibet, Sikkim, Bhutan and other Himalayan states were seen as a stra- tegic 'buffer' protecting British India from the Russian and Chineseempires. For the British, in the absence of any great economic impera-tives, actual political control over these regions was only needed to theextent necessary to ensure British predominance over the foreign pol-icy of those states, and the consequent exclusion of Russia and Chinafrom any influence there. These states were culturally distinct from the Indian plains, and were not generally treated by the British as an integral part of the Indiathey constructed. Politically, Tibet remained entirely independent of In-dia during the colonial period, while Bhutan and Sikkim were broughtunder variations of the 'Princely states' system. 5Under that model, lo- cal rulers maintained at least nominal control over the internal affairsof their realms. The result was that the British had little or no directimpact on the lives of the majority of the people there. But the local ru-lers agreed to be influenced - and were often firmly controlled - by a British Resident appointed by the Foreign and Political Department [hereafter; the Political Department 6]. This Department was, in effect, the diplomatic corps of the Government of India, concerned with rela-tions with neighbouring and Princely states, and it was directly answer-able to the Viceroy. A single Resident, locally designated (after 1905) as the 'Political Of- ficer Sikkim, Bhutan and Tibet', acted as the Government of India'sdiplomatic representative to these Himalayan states. There were nu-INTRODUCTION 23merous distinctions between them and British India. European settle- ment there was generally forbidden, for example, and even Europeanprivate travellers were subject to strict controls or entirely excluded.This political model meant that the imperial encounter on the Indo-Ti- betan frontier was a very different one to that which occurred in those regions subject to direct rule by the Government of India. As a resultthe histories of processes in these states often differ considerably fromthose of British India. In the absence of an established designation, I have used the term 'Indo-Tibetan frontier' to describe the primary region under considera-tion here. While in the general sense indicating the northern frontierof India bordering on Tibet (although we exclude from consideration Nepal, with its distinct historical trajectory), 7it should be understood specifically as indicating that frontier medical zone that included Ka- limpong-Darjeeling, Sikkim, Bhutan and the trade route from Yatungvia Gyantse to Lhasa. Contemporary political and strategic theory recognised that while states were separated by a political border demarcated by lines on themap, there was also a much broader transitional zone on either side ofthat border. That broad frontier was made up of a series of overlapping zones not only of local cultural influences, but also of European expan- sion. Elements such as missionaries, private travellers, technologiesand modern infrastructure might all be restricted to zones short of theactual border, but others groups such as explorers, scientists, tradersand the military might all advance to points beyond the border. Thus,at any particular time, there was a missionary frontier, a trading fron-tier, a frontier of exploration, and so on, which marked the extremelimit of operations for that group. 8In British colonial perspective and process, as the Younghusband mission demonstrated, Lhasa was themost advanced point of their military frontier with Tibet. Lhasa alsomarked the extreme limit of British-Indian government medical inter-vention, and was thus both the military and the medical frontier. The Indo-Tibetan frontier, as we define it, was one where the domi- nant cultural forces had been historically shaped by Tibetan Buddhismrather than by those of the Indic or Islamic traditions. In the medicalcontext, it was a major setting for the encounter between Western bio- medicine and indigenous medical practices. As will be seen, these indi- genous practices were in some sense associated with Tibetan Bud-dhism, for by the late colonial period structural support for the elitemedical traditions of the Indian plains - A \u00afyurveda and Unani-Tibb - was limited to the courts of rulers such as the Maharaja of Chamba inthe western Himalayas. Despite the size and significance of this region, its biomedical his- tory has not previously been analysed. This work is primarily intended24 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINas an opening narrative of that process, outlining the main develop- ments and identifying the agencies involved from the perspective ofWestern sources. Attention is drawn to particular themes and issuesthat those sources indicate are significant and worthy of a more in- depth analysis by future scholarship, while consideration is also given to those elements which appear to relate to existing studies, models,and understandings in the field of South Asian and wider medical his-tory. The use of Western sources dictates, however, that there are many is- sues not dealt with here. These include pathologies of endemic condi-tions such as enteric fevers, pharmaceutical and medical technology is-sues, And matters relating to globalisation or post-colonial public health policies. In addition, the colonial sources rarely touch on issues relevant to questions of gender or reveal patient perspectives other thanthose illuminated through the thickest of colonial lenses. Most notablyperhaps, they almost entirely ignore the indigenous medical world. In India, as David Arnold has noted; 'Confidence in the transform- ing, modernising power with the viceroyalty ofLord Curzon ', 9and given that the British advance into Tibet was largely due to Curzonian initiatives, it was to be expected that contemporary biomedical doctors, both official and missionary, were convinced of the superiority of their system. As was the case in China,10they were so confident that biomedicine would overcome indigenous medical prac-tices that they did not actively seek to combat them. Indeed, in the ab-sence of any specifically 'Tibetan diseases' that might have stimulatedcommunication, the European physicians apparently took no interestat all in local medical knowledge; this was not a cultural exchange. Dr.M.V. Kurian, for example, an Indian Christian who served as Gyantse Medical Officer in the 1940s and made two visits to Lhasa accompany- ing British Political Officers, did not recall ever specifically meetingany Tibetan medical practitioners. 11 Dr. W.S. Morgan, who served in Lhasa in 1936-37, does quote ap- provingly the opinion of his colleague, the Sikkimese sub-assistant sur-geon Bo Tsering, who while extremely dismissive of the Tibetan mon-astic practitioners' medical knowledge and skills, 'conceded them cer-tain limited powers of observation, a readiness to use new and effective drugs and medications, and, above all, an anxiety to learn more'. 12But it appears that none of the colonial doctors who served in this part of the Himalayas ever seriously studied the indigenous medicine. TheBritish did not consider that they were facing an alternative system;they saw the Himalayan medical field as terra nullius - an empty land.INTRODUCTION 25Significance of the period In this work, we trace the earliest foundations of Western medical in- fluence in the region, and examine in more detail the late 19thcentury developments in Kalimpong and Sikkim. We also discuss aspects ofthe post-colonial period that reflect issues emerging from the colonialera in order to illuminate continuities in such areas as structural fra-meworks, or individual and group histories. But our primary focushere is on the first half of the 20 thcentury, the period from the open- ing of Tibet to British influence in 1903-04 down to decolonisation inthe late 1940s. This period embraces not only a critical fracture in Ti-betan history but also the florescence of biomedicine, for it was an era in which the system 's boundaries were, at least in the popular imagina- tion, seemingly limitless. The focus on this period is of considerable significance in regard to the wider historiography of colonial medicine in South Asia. By thetime Western medicine became a significant factor in our region thebiomedical revolution had advanced considerably. Bacteriological dis-ease causation was understood, effective anaesthetics were available, x-rays, stethoscopes, thermometers and microscopes were in use, and improved treatments were emerging for venereal diseases, typhoid, tu- berculosis, and a host of other major diseases. 13There were generally effective means to prevent the great scourges such as smallpox andcholera, while surgical intervention now offered an almost unimagin-able advance on earlier practice. These advances continued and by the1940s innumerable conditions that were once almost inevitably fatalwere routinely, and even promptly, curable. The British dispensaries on the Indo-Tibetan frontier, both govern- ment and missionary, were not at the forefront of this medical pro-gress. They did not, for example, have regular X-ray facilities in Gang-tok until the 1920s or in Tibet until the 1940s. In addition, the dispen-saries were poorly funded and poorly equipped, and the quality of themedical staff there varied. Yet the doctors there were a part of thatwider body of new knowledge and practice and could send favoured pa-tients for treatment in better equipped medical institutions in India. Existing studies of medical history in colonial era South Asia have focussed overwhelmingly on the 19 thcentury, before, or in the early trial stages of these great biomedical advances. Such studies are there-fore, describing a very different world from that in which Westernmedicine developed in the Himalayas. Many lessons had been learnedby the British from their successes and failures in introducing newmedical theory and practice in India during the 19 thcentury and those lessons were applied in our region in the 20thcentury. The conclusions advanced here are consequently often very different from those reached26 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINby existing scholarship in the field (as discussed below). Those differ- ences are, however, frequently attributable to the distinct periods andplaces under examination. The comparative neglect of the later era is unfortunate. The 1870- 1950 period is an enormously exciting one. It was a time of realachievement in which real benefits accrued not only to the traditionalindigenous elites or to the supporters of empire, but to non-elitegroups and individuals. The most humble members of Himalayan so-ciety - beggars, outcastes, tribal peoples, landless labourers, and so on- generally did not receive the same standards of care that imperialgovernment servants or local aristocrats did (for the latter were treatedin private consultations). But they were nonetheless immunised against smallpox with the same vaccines and dosages that the elites re- ceived, and gained equal protection. Their wounds were treated withmodern pharmaceuticals and imperial surgeons removed cataracts andrestored sight regardless of social class. It is doubtful that in 1850 Wes-tern medicine was more efficacious overall than the indigenous prac-tices; by 1900 it was distinctly so. In analysing biomedical developments, we may acknowledge that no other advance in human history has saved or improved so many lives at all levels of society. But in presenting a narrative of biomedical pro- gress it is not intended to obscure those aspects of colonialism in thisregion that do not reflect well on the British - the ill-treatment of bothSikkimese royalty and labouring classes, the massacre of Tibet's medie-val forces by Younghusband's machine-gunners, the neglect of Bhutanand Himalayan districts such as Chamba, or the post-1947 abandon-ment of Tibet to its fate. But if the introduction of biomedicine wasneither unproblematic nor uncontested, it was almost invariably of- fered rather than imposed. In addition to saving or fundamentally im- proving countless lives that would have been lost under the existing re-gime, 14biomedicine gave lasting empowerment to non-elite indigen- ous groups and individuals within the new medical structures. It wasnot a justification for colonialism, though it was and is often claimedas such, but overall, medicine was a fundamentally benign and gener-ally beneficial aspect of that process. Motives While the initiatives of the colonial state and Christian missionarieswere the major forces which stimulated the development of biomedi-cine in this region, two other forces must be briefly noted. Firstly, thereare indications that a considerable private trade in biomedical productsdeveloped. In the early period, for example, the missionary Annie Tay-INTRODUCTION 27lor took advantage of the 1893 Trade Regulations to open a shop across the Sikkim-Tibet border in Yatung in 1895, where she sold pharmaceu-tical products, 15while new health understandings may also be indi- cated by the record of 720lbs of soap and 6,694 towels being exported to Tibet in 1899.16While the significance of commercial imperatives is difficult to judge without access to pharmaceutical company archives, the use of Penicillin and other injectable medicines was notoriouslywidespread by the late colonial period. This suggests the existence of amedical world outside of both indigenous and colonial authority, amedical market place that reflects both a frontier zone where stateauthority was limited and mediated through local structures of power,and a period in which medical knowledge was in a fluid, transitional, and contested phase. European travellers who used medicine as a means to gain the good- will of their hosts are also a factor to be considered, although the sig- nificance of their medical interventions is more problematic. It has,however, a long history. Even before the discovery of bacteriological dis-ease causation heralded the great scientific advances of biomedicine, 'itwas taken as a matter of course that every European was skilled inmedicine'. 17In that they travelled in areas beyond the reach of official initiatives these travellers may be assumed to have helped spread aknowledge of European medical practice. We may, however, draw a simple distinction between the medical un- dertakings of European travellers and those of missionary societies andgovernment bodies. The travellers' aims were short-term. Some carriedspare medicines, but as one recalled: We had never refused a request for medical attention; but we had neither the skill nor the drugs to cure anyone ... perhaps we had given some temporary relief with the psychological benefitof a pill. It did not matter greatly to us, because the next day wewere on the road again and were miles away before it was dis-covered that our medicine was useless. 18 In contrast, the aims of both the Government of India and the mis-sionaries were long-term. As the earlier quotation indicates, there was a clearly articulated political context to the imperial power's support for medical developments on the northern frontiers of British India: Medi-cal services were intended to win indigenous support for the Britishpresence. Yet the existence of other motives and agencies spreadingbiomedicine, and the complex processes of medical promotion and re-ception cannot be reduced to fit a simple model of colonial imposition.While medicine was in many senses a powerful 'tool of empire', 19it was also a power that the imperial government was keen to hand over28 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINto the indigenous peoples, not least because the colonial state lacked the financial resources necessary to meet the growing consumer de-mand for biomedical services. In the wider sense, the introduction of biomedicine is part of the his- tory of the encounter between non-Western cultures and Western mod-ernity. Medicine was one of a number of modern systems, sciences,and technologies that were introduced into the Himalayas during thisperiod. Its history provides a specific example of how that encounterproduced stresses and fractures in existing socio-cultural, political, andeconomic structures and processes, and how it resulted in far-reachingtransformations in indigenous worldviews and the production of radi-cally new systems and authority structures. Biomedical beginnings are also a part of imperial history in that the initial agents of change were mainly European colonial officials orChristian missionaries, and this work demonstrates an important pointoften neglected - the extent to which imperial power was fragmentedat local levels. The British lacked the personnel, the financial resources,and the desire to constantly enforce their will in the face of resistance.The application of force was thus reserved for extreme cases, whilethere were constant displays of symbolic power designed to foster an impression of overwhelming imperial strength. This included the de- liberate cultivation of British prestige, which was seen as a weapon in the struggle to convince the indigenous people that resistance was fu-tile. At the same time, the British attempted to gain their consent, withvarious strategies of ''improvement'' aimed at winning support fromdifferent social groups, particularly, but not exclusively, the eliteclasses. 20This need for consent, and existence of different ideas and schools of policy within British administration, meant that ideas and policies implemented by the centre were constantly mediated at all le- vels of the administration. This process engaged imperial and local of-ficials in complex cultural dialogues and political negotiations in thesearch for locally acceptable applications of government policies. The need to take local opinion into account was particularly pro- nounced in those areas of British influence and operation that wereoutside the direct authority of the Government of India; the ''Princelystates'' and neighbouring polities such as Tibet. Because we are here concerned with those areas, it should be reiterated that conclusions reached by studies of medical developments within British India can-not necessarily be applied to our region. ''Resistance'', for example,needs to be contextualised within the complex historical processes ofcultural and state formation that occurred on this frontier during theperiod under consideration. This history is also a narrative embedded in the local annals of the Himalayas. In places such as Sikkim and Bhutan what was once a for-INTRODUCTION 29eign medical system is today indigenous in practice, personnel, and power (and it is for this reason that I have described biomedicine as''indigenised'' rather than the more common term ''adapted'').Through interaction with local cultural premises it has also, like the In- dian railways, taken on a distinct local or national character. Its foreign roots point to a historical fracture, but its memories are primarily pre-served in local traditions. The imperial pioneers of the system are char-acters on a local landscape whose lives and works are remembered inlocal history and memory and whose influence is manifest there. Asone Himalayan medical officer consulted during research for this workrecalled; 'Their feet are gone, but their footprints remain.' 21 The historical context of medicine in the Tibetan world Although the early biomedical proponents had assumed that their sys-tem would supplant and eventually eliminate local medical traditions,that did not occur. Far from being eliminated, the indigenous traditionsresponded to the new challenge, surviving and even prosperingthrough strategies of adaptation, systemisation, and reinvention. While it is not the intention of this work to focus on such issues, they are considered in as much as they relate to the biomedical world. We lack a comprehensive critical history of indigenous medicine in the Tibetan cultural world and it is not the intention of this study toprovide that history. We do, however, briefly survey post-colonial devel-opments in this regard, as they are fundamental to an understandingof what is popularly known today as ''Tibetan medicine''. The followingoutline is given, therefore, to problematise that term and to locate the British period within the wider history of the Tibetan medical world. Just as we lack a standard term for the colonial medical system, the indigenous medical practices and understandings prevailing in the Ti- betan cultural world during the colonial period cannot be properly sub-sumed under the term ''Tibetan medicine'', which implies a systemisa-tion that was largely absent at that time. There did exist an elite medi-cal tradition, which drew on textual sources and was in some wayslinked to state structures. But that was just one aspect of the indigen- ous medical world and the extent to which it was accessible to the ma- jority of the population is questionable. The elite tradition was termed sowa rigpa (Tibetan: ''the science of healing''), which was a branch of Buddhist learning. Following the firstof the ''Four Noble Truths'' proposed by the historical Buddha - that''All Existence is Suffering'' - healing in the Buddhist understandinghad wider implications than the purely physical. Sowa rigpa was thus practised by Buddhist monks or in lineage traditions rooted in Bud-30 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINdhist authority. Its core texts, which were included in the Tibetan Bud- dhist canon ( Tengyur ), include a considerable amount of material that in Western understanding is religious rather than medical. Although mundane causation might be recognised, as with drunken falls and brawls, religio-philosophical understandings of affliction cau-sation predominated in Himalayan societies and most curing strategiesinvolved some form of ritual resort, whether to Buddhist monastic, orto spirit-medium or other healers. 22But there were methods for treat- ing conditions such as hydrophobia and snakebites that were consid-ered rational according to biomedical understanding, 23and the use of mercury in the treatment of syphilis was known as it had been in 19th century Western medicine.24In addition, there was an extensive phar- macology, primarily herbal, but also containing animal and mineralelements, including such exotica as bear's bile, elephant gallstones,snake meat, and rabbit hearts. 25Curing was thus generally a bipartite strategy involving curative substances and religio-magical resort,including such variations as pilgrimage, but it was not necessarily spe-cifically connected to the teachings of sowa rigpa or even to Bud- dhism. 26 The Himalayas were richly endowed with plants considered medic- inal and their collection, distribution, and transportation were impor-tant elements in both local and long-distance trading economies. 27But while a knowledge of medicinal herbs seems to have been wide-spreadin Himalayan societies, at the non-elite level the availability of all butthe most basic curing elements such as butter and salt cannot be pre-sumed and healing practices must have often been far-removed fromany links to elite procedure. In areas where professional doctors werenot available, religious aspects of curing might be at best tenuously linked to regional forms of ''world religions'', with other-worldly curing strategies based almost entirely on local beliefs and practices. Even ifsuch peripheral and local medical worlds were dynamic and open to in-novation, they were far removed from sowa rigpa and limited resources must have been their dominant element. While a great variety of localised practices appear to have been uti- lised by village level healers (and this medical realm may have been aless patriarchal field), any reconstruction of the history of these non- elite traditions is problematic. The history of sowa rigpa , however, may be outlined. Studies indicate a long and dynamic period of develop- ment prior to the establishment of a canonical medical tradition. Thattradition, it should be noted, presents its teaching as authentic revela-tions of the Buddha in his manifestation as Sangye Menlha, the ''Medi-cine Buddha''. The earliest Tibetan historical sources date from the 7 thcentury CE, when a nascent ''Tibetan '' state emerged and rapidly established a Cen-INTRODUCTION 31tral Asian empire that lasted down to the mid-9thcentury. This was a cosmopolitan empire. At its height, Tibetan forces ranged from Samar- kand in the west to present-day Xian in the east, opening Tibet to for-eign elements such as Buddhism, which became increasingly influen- tial at court level. In the medical field, although Indian, Chinese and other influences were present, it was, as Christopher Beckwith has fa-mously revealed; 'Greek medicine [that] was initially the most impor-tant medical tradition in the early Tibetan Empire.' 28 After the collapse of that empire, a Tibetan state was gradually recon- structed. Late Indian Mahayana and Tantric Buddhism was made anintegral part of the cultural and political organisation of this state, withthe transmission and translation of a vast corpus of Sanskrit texts and oral lineage teachings forming the basis for the future development of Tibetan Buddhist culture. The teachings of sowa rigpa were in some form part of that culture, which subsequently spread to become thedominant ''high culture'' of much of Central Asia and the Himalayas.Sowa rigpa thus reached peripheral regions such as Mongolia, 29La- dakh, and Kalmykia that were, or later became, distinct polities inwhich sowa rigpa continued to be the basis of their elite medical prac- tice. The primary textual basis of sowa rigpa was, and remains, the Gyu\u00a8 Shi(''The Four Medical Tantras''). This work, of some 156 chapters and 5,900 verses, is, along with later commentaries, central to any exposi-tion of the subject. While its origins are disputed within both the Tibe-tan and Western academic traditions, the Gyu\u00a8Shiis most probably a post-11 thcentury Tibetan compilation of earlier works from Indic, Per- sian, Chinese and indigenous medical traditions.30 During the 17thcentury, numerous aspects of Tibetan administration were systemised under the rule of the 5thDalai Lama [reigned; 1642- 82]. His centralising policies established many of the political and cul-tural characteristics of the Tibetan state that were to survive into the20 thcentury. Among the first elements subject to these policies was medicine, with attempts made to found medical institutes in Lhasaand Shigatse from 1643 onwards. 31Although the Dalai Lama actually ''passed to the heavenly fields'' in 1682, his death was concealed foraround fourteen years, during which time Tibet was ruled by the Re- gent Sangye Gyatso. The Regent was himself a scholar of sowa rigpa and the author of major commentaries on the Gyu\u00a8Shi. In 1696 he founded a monastic college which became the Chakpori (''Iron Hill'') medical institute in Lhasa. This institute drew together the diverseteaching lineages, standardising and systemising medical educationand practice within monastic traditions, thus linking medicine into thestructures of the religio-political state. 32This incidentally ensured that32 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINelite medical practice was an exclusively male preserve, as was, to a great extent, the non-monastic practice of sowa rigpa . The foundation of Chakpori was a significant step towards the sys- temisation of medical practice within Tibet. But it is surely an exag- geration to describe its founding as 'the beginnings of Public Health in Tibet',33given that no preventative health strategies seem to have fol- lowed, and that no state-wide bureaucracies or other structures appearto have been associated with the institution. Medical students at Chak-pori were monks, 34and the best students generally became personal physicians to various religious and political leaders throughout Asia.Others were posted to monasteries and are thus unlikely to have hadtime to deal with the general public, 35particularly women (with whom any intimate association was a breach of monastic codes). Even theconcept of public health would seem foreign in this period, which pre-dates the rise of the Nation-state system and its associated assumptionof state responsibility for the health and welfare of its citizens. Chakpori monastic college remained the premier medical institute in Tibet until its destruction by Chinese communist forces in 1959. Itattracted students from throughout the Tibetan cultural world and pro-vided the model and the personnel for medical centres subsequently established at regional monasteries such Gyatso apparently in- tended that each major regional monastery should have the services ofa Chakpori graduate. But it remains uncertain how many practitionersofsowa rigpa actually graduated from that institution, which seems to have gone into decline in the 19 thcentury before being revived under the 13thDalai Lama ( reigned; 1895-1933).37 Outside of these monastic circles there existed not only local practi- tioners such as bone setters or ritual healers, but amchi , medical work- ers whose practice was, historically, outside of institutional settings.The authority of these individuals derives from their knowledge of thecanonical medical texts of sowa rigpa and receipt of traditional teaching lineages of medical practice (deriving from famous physicians of thepast, or transmitted in more localised and family traditions). Amchi may be distinguished from other practitioners by their knowledge oftheGyu\u00a8Shi. 38They were not necessarily professionals and it appears that many amchi understood their medical skills as a gift and their usage as a religious offering or obligation.39But while increasingly subject to contemporary anthropological investigation, historical stu-dies of their role are lacking. 40While never forming 'a homogenous socio-professional group',41and inevitably greatly varying in their medical knowledge and skills, it would appear that in the absence of astate sector, amchi filled an important medical role in Himalayan societies. 42INTRODUCTION 33The Tibetan medical world was not, therefore, an integrated system. Tibetan medicine was practised in complex and diverse ways and ex- isted on a number of levels, with the elites and monastics (at least inmajor centres), having access to sowa rigpa , remote villagers and no- mads resorting to local curing strategies loosely if at all linked to sowa rigpa , and the amchi' s practice situated somewhere in between these poles. Sowa rigpa and other practices were not, historically, termed ''Tibe- tan medicine'', nor was their range restricted to Tibet. The term wasused throughout the Buddhist Himalayas for the elite traditions deriv-ing from the Gyu\u00a8Shiand just as the term ''Chinese medicine'' was of Western derivation, 43so too did the term ''Tibetan medicine'' develop only after the encounter with the European powers. It was never a termin common use during the British period - indeed I have not seen itused in official documentation - and its employment to denote the ex-istence of a specific system of medicine actually appears to be a post-colonial development. Given that both the term ''Tibetan medicine'' and its implication of a historical existence as a medical system are highly problematic out-side of the modern era, I have avoided the use of the term wherever possible, although it remains a convenient shorthand that should be understood to indicate all facets of medical practice in the region. I re-serve the use of the term sowa rigpa to refer to the elite textual tradition of medicine in the Himalayan Buddhist world, and I use the term 'Tra-ditional Medicine' (i.e., capitalised), in reference to medical traditionssystemised in the context of global modernity. Sources; primary and secondary The primary source records of the British colonial state that are pre-served in the Oriental and India Office Library (London), the NationalArchives of India (New Delhi), and various Indian state and local ar-chives form the main basis for this work. In addition, relevant privatepapers, correspondence, and published or unpublished memoirs byboth Westerners and subject peoples were utilised, along with mission- ary archives, particularly those of the Church of Scotland Mission (Edinburgh). These archival sources have been supplemented by a ser-ies of interviews with relevant physicians, medical officials and their fa-milies carried out in India (particularly in Sikkim), and in Bhutan. The usual caveats apply particularly in regard to the reading of colo- nial sources, which must be critically analysed not only through an un-derstanding of the ideologies and perspectives they represent, but alsoof the bureaucratic and personal career strategies manifest there. Offi-34 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINcial British-Indian reports are a particular genre. Optimistic in tone, and assuming a classical education, they allow scope for both discus-sion of problematic issues and possible solutions as well as subtle self-promotion by the writer. Taken together, the reports of a particular in- dividual or school of thought can advance a consistent line of policy; equally, as will be seen, they can perpetuate myths and stereotypes. While including attendance figures from the Gyantse and Yatung (Tibet) dispensaries as an appendix of lasting interest, we must cautionthat the available statistics are unreliable and provide little more than ageneral guide to conditions there. Previous studies have indicated theextent to which this is the case with other British colonial records andthat unreliability was accentuated by conditions on the frontier. 44In addition to the usual problems of context and doubts over the reliabilityof the information-gathering process, it should be noted that the avail-able medical records rarely distinguish between genders, new and re-peat patients, or races and classes. Furthermore, some of the localelites were treated in private consultations at their homes rather thanin the British dispensaries and it is unclear whether these private con-sultations are included in the dispensary statistics. As will be seen, therecords must be also read particularly critically in regard to indications of resort for particular conditions. In the wider context, the poor state of medical record-keeping problematises any close association of medi-cine in this region with the colonial knowledge-gathering project,which was otherwise prominent in regard to Tibet. There is a considerable range of relevant secondary literature regard- ing Western medicine in Asia. Our current understanding of the pro-cess by which it developed in South Asia primarily derives fromanthropological and historical studies undertaken since the late 1970s. Prior to that time Traditional Medicine was characterised as a largely static reservoir of archaic knowledge and practice that would inevitablybe superseded by the scientific logics of the biomedical system. 45 In the late 1970s, anthropologists began to challenge both this con- ceptual model and the dominant narrative of biomedical progress. Par-ticularly influential was the work of Charles Leslie, who establishedtwo fundamental considerations; firstly that, evolving'; was historically characteristic of medical encountersthere. 47These conclusions were confirmed by studies showing the ex- tent to which Traditional Medicine practitioners and their supportershad responded to the encounter with Western medicine through strate-gies of both adaptation and systemisation. Notable in this regard wasPaul Unschuld, who examined the political and nationalist imperativesthat historically determined the reconstructions and reinventions of''Chinese medicine''. In concluding that, 'the alleged antagonism a holistic-individualistic Chinese medicine and an ontological-lo- calistic Western medicine is a drastic and misleading historical simpli-fication of both traditions', 48Unschuld's work highlights a process of reinvention and reconstruction with parallels in Tibet, India, and else- where.49 In demonstrating the contradictions and paradoxes within Tradi- tional Medicine and its growing articulation and expression within na- tionalist systems, such studies provided a balance to the many critiquesof the Western biomedical system that developed in the post-colonialperiod. They drew attention to universal tendencies such as claims toauthority and efficacy, commercial and status imperatives, and increas-ing systemisation, which were shown to be characteristic of allmedical systems. This wider perspective reflected the anthropologists' engage-ment within the actualities of South Asian medical worlds. But withinthe historical discipline, studies of modern South Asian medicine weredominated by more theoretical nationalist and post-colonial critiques. In 1981, Daniel Headrick famously asserted that medicine was a cru- cial 'tool' for the expansion of British empire. 50His conclusion was seminal in locating the newly-emerging historical study of imperialmedicine in a political context from which until recently it has rarely emerged. This was accentuated by the work of Ian Catanach, David Ar- nold and others who demonstrated the contested reception of biomedi-cine in studies of indigenous 'resistance' to smallpox vaccination cam-paigns and to anti-plague measures in Bombay in the 1890s. 51Arnold's work specifically explored the 'developing relationship between indi-genous e \u00b4lites, subaltern classes and the colonial state', 52and actually demonstrated the complexities of the indigenous reception of Westernmedicine and the many local variants in action and response through- out India. 53But a tendency arose in less-nuanced studies to assume that resistance to biomedicine was a universal Indian phenomena. That conclusion, in conjunction with clear evidence that the imperial medi-cal services in India were primarily concerned with the health of Eur-opeans and their military forces rather than the needs of the generalpopulation, 54situated South Asian medical histories in a highly politi- cised context. Biomedicine became a central feature of post-colonial cri-tiques of empire that drew inspiration from the ideas of Foucault and Said, which emerged, specifically in the South Asian field, in the dy- namic theoretical work of the ''Subaltern Studies'' school. 55 These constrictive theoretical boundaries excluded the wider vision provided by the anthropologists' comparative studies of processes with-in indigenous traditions and as a result analysis of Western biomedicaldevelopment in the colonial setting commonly reached negative con-clusions. Ignoring fundamental aspects of imperialism such as culturalexchange and individual encounter, Andrew Cunningham and Bridie36 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINAndrews, for example, used what they admitted was a 'relatively nar- row' definition of imperialism ('the use of state power against foreigncountries, for the purpose of winning economic advantage'), to defineWestern medicine as being 'imperialist as a form of knowledge and as a practice'. 56They ignored studies demonstrating that Traditional Medi- cine is also used as an imperial device,57and failed to take into account the fragmented nature of the actual application of colonial power and the constant negotiations with indigenous interests that it demanded atevery level of government. Consequently they formulated the introduc-tion of Western medicine to South Asia as a process of 'confrontation 'and 'contestation '. 58 In this ideological construction the earlier paradigm of a static Tradi- tional Medicine was inverted to portray a static Western medicine, de-fined as a system 'not open to alternative views', which could 'be prac-tised only by true believers'. 59Such narrow definitions, however, do not survive critical analysis because they ignore elements and processescommon to all medical systems. They are also contradicted by studiesdemonstrating the willingness of Traditional Medicine practitioners toco-opt biomedical practices such as the taking of blood pressure, 60the evidence that follows here for the recognition by the IMS officers of the necessity to make concessions to local cultural understandings, and by the growing acceptance by biomedical physicians in both Europeand Asia of the efficacy of ''alternative'' practices such as acupunctureand dietary restrictions. Taken to their logical extremes, these tendencies to subjective theo- rising could result in findings that de-personalised the Asian subject interms that recalled the Orientalist, if not racist ideas of the archetypalVictorian imperialist of popular imagination. Fre \u00b4de\u00b4rique Appfel Mar- glin, for example, contended that rather than upsetting medico-reli-gious customs associated with the 'smallpox goddess' S \u00b4\u00aftala\u00af, 61by intro- ducing vaccination and consequently eliminating smallpox from theplanet, it would have been better if 'smallpox could have been success-fully controlled rather than eradicated'. 62Even in the context of a pro- vocative 'challenge' to 'the entire project of modernisation ',63it is diffi- cult to understand this contention as either representing indigenousperspectives or acknowledging the cross-cultural reality of suffering. 64 While acknowledging the lack of historical sources concerning the perspectives and experiences of South Asian patients, the approach ta-ken here is to regard illnesses as real sufferings for which peoplesought relief and cure. While a ''grey area'' exists in which definitionsof illness and suffering are problematic or rest on cultural definitions,this was less apparent in the initial stages of the development of Wes-tern medicine on the Indo-Tibetan frontier. The focus then was on uni-versally accepted medical conditions such as wounds, fractures, infec-INTRODUCTION 37tions and epidemic diseases, conditions at what might be called the ''core'' of the new medical system. The use of a simplistic domination-resistance model of imperialism in medical histories does of course support certain nationalist interests and mythologies. But an exclusive focus on the many evils and exploi- tations of Western colonialism in Asia not only obscures parallel exploi-tation within indigenous societies, but also continuities between colo-nial and post-colonial medical policies and their application. 65In addi- tion, as this work will indicate, areas such as the Himalayan Buddhiststates by no means necessarily associated themselves with a concept of''India'' during the colonial period. Resistance to local and national in-digenous elites there may have been as, if not more, common than anti-colonial resistance. As indicated by studies such as those of Helen Lambert (also concerning a former Princely state), even today Westernmedicine's impact is limited in India, and patient's choices of therapyare based on a range of considerations which do not appear to include'contesting' any particular system. 66 Like British imperial authority, studies of South Asian medical his- tory began with a focus on developments in the great metropolises;Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, and later New Delhi. As centres of both the European and indigenous populations these cities were the obvious lo- cation in which to concentrate medical structures, and as centres of co-lonial authority they were important sites for Indian nationalism tocontest political power in a great variety of forums, including the medi-cal. They were also bureaucratic centres of empire, generating the greatbulk of what are now the archival sources for the study of British colo-nial India and its immediate neighbours. While these are all factors en-couraging scholars to focus on developments in the urban centres of empire, the analysis of Indian medical history has, as an understand- able result of this tendency, developed a centrist perspective. The corefocus of enquiry has been on such issues as structural developments(in both Western and indigenous medical systems), epidemics as meta-phors for colonialism, imperial medical ties with the British medicalworld and wider international debates over such issues as trade andpublic health. While there is a growing body of anthropological studies on South Asian medical worlds outside of the urban centres, medical historianshave neglected the imperial periphery. However, the frontiers of BritishIndia, particularly the northern frontier, were by no means peripheralto the colonial state. There was considerable economic and political in-vestment in those regions to protect India from external threats - realor imagined - from Russia, and to a lesser extent from China, as wellas localised dangers such as tribal raiders. Secure frontiers were alsoseen as necessary to develop not only trade but also national identity,38 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINwhich was seen as a part of both the modernisation process and itself a factor contributing to secure frontiers. Socio-political and environmental conditions on the frontier were very different to those at the imperial centre and the form which im- perialism took there was specific to the region. As will be seen, the frontier was recognised as being a distinct region outside of India bothin official attitudes and by the imperial officers who served there. Man-ners were less formal there, structures less bureaucratic, and individualrelations with the local people less constrained by cultural considera-tions. As one of the architects of British policy in the region observed: A man, efficient in administrative work in India ... is not always the best for Tibet. We do not want the administration in these outlying diplomatic Agencies to be too bureaucratic, too muchgiven to rules and regulations framed to meet ... Indian condi-tions. Tibet is very different from India, ... Tact and sympathy,and a capacity for getting on well with them, are the prime re-quisites for an officer serving among the people of Tibet. 67 Analysis of these frontier regions is therefore, of crucial importance to a balanced history of the British presence in South Asia. This work at- tempts to counter the tendency to see the urban centres of empire ascentral or typical overall of what is now modern India (and neighbour-ing states). It does not necessarily contest existing understandings de-riving from the centrist perspective, but rather seeks to indicate addi-tional perspectives by taking into account the complex cultural and po-litical negotiations and multilayered encounters that occurred on thefrontiers of empire during the processes of biomedical development. Despite continuing preoccupation with resistance, new approaches to modern South Asian medical history have recently emerged. 68A ser- ies of studies have explored the history of specific diseases such assmallpox, 69kala-azar,70and goitre.71These demonstrate the complex negotiations involved in preventative and curing strategies, disagree-ments within government about the blanket implementation of policy,the environmental issues involved, and the contributions of bothimperial and indigenous individuals to the countering of these dis- eases. 72In a wider sense, however, these narratives have also trans- gressed the existing divide between colonial and post-colonial studies, drawing attention to the many continuities in South Asian medical his-tory, which will also become apparent in this work. An understanding of the social processes involved in the adoption of biomedical practices in South Asia is still developing. But in the regionunder consideration, biomedicine in its early phase will be seen to havebeen adopted as an empowerment strategy by marginal groups such asINTRODUCTION 39Eurasians, native Christians, and tribal peoples. Those marginal groups that were able to embed their members in powerful positions in theearly phase of biomedical development were frequently able to estab-lish their clan 's continuing association with a medical occupation. In a hierarchical society influenced by notions of occupational caste group status, these clans were able to enhance their status on the basis of thisestablishment of ''traditional'' (albeit recent), occupational authority. But in later phases of development, biomedicine became part of the existing elite's corpus of what we might call ''useful'' modernity. Thiscomprised those innovations that came to be seen as specifically bene-ficial to the indigenous authorities, (or elements among those authori-ties), whether for personal or wider social benefit, or as a means of strengthening the social order. The elites who could afford to educate their children at the best schools in India were then able to establishthemselves at the highest levels of the new system. In addition, theconversion of these elite groups resulted in their patronage of the sys-tem, which, while relieving the imperial power of financial burden alsorelieved it of responsibility. The indigenous elites (primarily the Hima-layan Buddhist aristocracy), thus gained power with their acceptance ofresponsibility, but the non-elite groups were in many cases well-estab- lished by that time. In embedding their new status within traditional occupationally- based social divisions, these groups enabled biomedicine to become an indigenous occupational category within Himalayan societies, just assowa rigpa was an indigenous category. The result was that decolonisa- tion neither fractured nor hindered biomedical development; groupswho enjoyed growing medical power and prestige in the colonial periodcontinued to do so after 1947. In the case of Tibet, the Chinese inva- sion in 1950 produced major fractures, but the pre-1950 aristocratic class has to a very large extent replicated its former authority in the In-dian exile community. Missionaries One other development of considerable relevance to this work has been the recent emergence of studies focussing academic attention on the vast reservoir of sources available in missionary archives. Much of thismaterial concerns local politics and society, and non-elite and marginalsocial groups otherwise greatly under-represented in the historical re-cord. In that the biases and worldviews represented in the sources arefrequently explicit, their interpretation and analysis is in many waysless problematic than official sources. But the overwhelmingly secularapproach of Western academic historiography, which has relegated reli-40 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINgion to separate disciplinary status, has been one of a number of fac- tors that have made missionary studies deeply unpopular within acade-mia. There is, however, a growing body of analysis concerning the politi- cal context of missionary medicine, 73to which this work contributes. In regard to Tibet, John Bray's work (see bibliography) has demon-strated how that ''Forbidden Land'' became a particular target forChristian missionaries, who established a chain of mission stationsaround Tibet's borders in preparation for a time when they would beallowed to evangelise there. These missionaries, however, tended to clo-sely associate themselves with British or Chinese government attemptsto gain control of Tibet, seeing that as the key to their access. That very association with external powers only increased Tibetan mistrust of their intentions. Of particular significance in regard to medical missions in India is the work of Rosemary Fitzgerald, who has demonstrated that from the1870s onwards, medicine increasingly became the key missionary con-version strategy. 74Her work also brings out the missionary influence on the nursing profession in India; at the beginning of World WarTwo, 80% of Indian nurses had been trained in mission hospitals and around 90% of all nurses were Christian. 75The consequences of this seem significant. David Arnold pointed out that in the transmission of; 'western ideas and practices ... to the indigenous peoples [the] doctor'srace, sex and demeanour could matter as much as the therapies heproffered.' 76Fitzgerald confirms that 'indigenous staff ... gave mission dispensaries and hospitals a less forbidding appearance; a hint of thefamiliar that might make these alien places more acceptable to poten-tial patients'. 77Thus it appears that the indigenisation of structures and personnel by the missionaries significantly enhanced the uptake ofbiomedicine. While we may accept that the majority of missionary doctors were motivated by Christian compassion, 78locating them as a bridge be- tween races is problematic. They were not intermediaries translatingone culture to the other. Rather they held strong prejudices againstmany aspects of local culture. Nor did they approach the local peopleas equals. Fitzgerald shows, for example, that the 'notion of a 'nursing sisterhood' was revealed as deeply flawed in its failure to transcend dif- ferences of class, race and nationality'. 79 Yet missionaries were in daily contact with the indigenous peoples to an extent unmatched even by colonial officials. Unlike the IMS offi-cers, who usually relied on translators outside of the Hindi-Urduspeaking regions, missionaries were required to be fluent in the localvernacular. They also held to an ideal of indigenisation and could re-present indigenous perspectives to the colonial power, as Andrew Por-INTRODUCTION 41ter has shown in regard to the extent to which missionaries actively re- sisted the late 19thcentury dominant ideology of European racial super- iority.80 One approach to contextualising the missionaries' position in local society is to focus on the ethical context of doctoring and the constructof the ideal doctor in both cultures. The medical missionaries' charita-ble provision and (generally) high ethical and professional standardsappear to have matched those of Buddhist ideals of the doctor. Thatshared understanding may have enabled the medical missionaries tobe more easily integrated into local understandings than physicianswho were secular agents of the state, for the latter context was un-known to indigenous culture. Here I suggest that in many senses long- serving medical missionaries of particular character could become a part of the indigenous histories and understandings of a region,whether their religion was acceptable or not. Considerable work remains to be done on the missionaries, includ- ing critical analysis of their writings, before we can hope to reach con-clusions concerning such complex issues as their relationship to im-perialism. 81We need to consider, for example, such diverse factors as their shared interests in modernity and ''progress'' on the Western model and the common projection of their casualties in the ''heroic mode''. But we may analyse the role of Christian medical missionaries(principally those associated with the Church of Scotland), in introdu-cing and developing biomedicine in the Buddhist Himalayas. The mis-sionaries were the initial force behind the introduction of biomedicinein places such as Chamba and Kalimpong and were also influential insouthern Sikkim in the early period. Yet while they had provided edu-cational and medical services there that Government was not prepared to finance, they were subsequently excluded from Bhutan and Tibet. While this was certainly in agreement with the wishes of those states,the missionaries could be forgiven for thinking that they had been ef-fectively exploited by the imperial Government. The Indian Medical Service and the Subordinate Medical Service The key agents in the introduction of Western medicine into Tibet inthe early 20 thcentury were officers of the Indian Medical Service. That service only came into being at the end of the 19thcentury, although it had long antecedents. When East India Company vessels began sailingto India at the start of the 17 thcentury, they employed ''ship's sur- geons'', some of whom established themselves in South Asia wherethey treated both EIC personnel and local people. In 1645, for example,ship's surgeon Gabriel Boughton successfully treated a daughter of the42 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINMughal emperor Shah Jahan82(then occupied with the building of the Taj Mahal). But European and Asian medical practitioners then shared many understandings, such as humoral theory, and specialised foreignand indigenous types of knowledge were in communication. While the Europeans' novelty and areas of specialisation might attract local pa- tients, these newcomers at best enhanced rather than challenged theexisting Indic medical world. Many of the Company's personnel feltthat Indian illnesses were best treated by Indian doctors, and as theship's surgeons were generally of lower class origin, they were oftenlooked down on by their fellow Europeans. Given the EIC's status as a trading body, there was initially no ques- tion of the Company becoming involved in organised medical practice. But the growing military and political power of the British brought the need for such structural support, and in 1763 the Bengal Medical Ser-vice was established. Similar services were also founded in the Madrasand Bombay presidencies, and in 1788 these services were reconsti-tuted as primarily military agencies. After the events of 1857-58 (the''Indian Mutiny'') they were brought under Crown control and sepa-rated into civil and military branches. Finally, in 1896, the three presi-dential services were amalgamated to form the Indian Medical Service, which employed around 600 medical officers at the beginning of the 20th century. 83 Admission to the IMS was by examination, with candidates required to be British subjects aged 21-28, licensed under the Medical Act of1858 to practice medicine and surgery. The service had an essentiallymilitary character. Its officers held military rank and were always liablefor recall to military duty in times of war. New entrants were requiredto serve in a military post for at least two years before becoming eligi- ble for a civil position, or for employment with other Government of India services. The Political Department was one such service, employ-ing medical officers at dispensaries attached to the various diplomaticposts it maintained. IMS officers joined the Political Department knowing that 'medical officers are attached to our Consulates and Agencies in remote local-ities primarily on account of political considerations'. 84Their primary duty was to gain the goodwill of local societies by providing free medi- cal services to all classes of people in the indigenous state. This use of medical officers in political and diplomatic roles actually had a longhistory in India, with the Mughals having used eminent hakim s as en- voys, as did the EIC, 85and even in the 20thcentury the Political De- partment occasionally used its medical officers to fill diplomatic posts.With the growing knowledge resources of European medical science,the IMS officers were increasingly seen as an important element of im-INTRODUCTION 43perial power and prestige. Given these requirements, it was to be ex- pected that a particular type of officer would apply for this service. Mark Harrison has carefully analysed the social origins of European recruits to the IMS in the 1859-1914 period. He demonstrates that they were similar to those of other imperial services in that they included a disproportionately high percentage of Scots and Irish, frequently hadfamily members in Indian service, and often followed the common im-perial pattern of being Indian-born and British-educated. But IMS offi-cers tended to be of more lower-middle class origin than their contem-poraries in the Indian Civil Service or the officer class of the IndianArmy, and in terms of social status in India as measured by the war-rant of precedence, they ranked below those institutions. 86Social sta- tus was of course a fundamental concern in British Indian society andHarrison concludes that while the IMS officer's lesser standing waspartly a reflection of their comparatively lower class origins, the keyfactor reducing their prestige was that while 19 thcentury ICS and In- dian Army officers were Europeans, the IMS included Indians in itsranks. 87 Qualified Indians were first accepted into the presidential services after 1855, but as the examinations were held in London there were few such applicants. Just eleven of the 376 IMS entrants in the 1896-1905 period were Indians.88Following the introduction of a quota system in 1905, the number of Indians in the IMS increased, and after the pas-sing of an Indian Medical Registration Act in 1912, the requirement totravel to London for examination was soon abolished. 89By 1938, In- dians made up 37% of the IMS roll.90Yet Harrison presents evidence for a pervading anti-Indian prejudice in the service, which, as will beseen, is supported by the fact that Indian IMS officers were excluded from service in areas such as Tibet on the grounds that they could not maintain imperial prestige. But Harrison 's study is concerned with the pre-World War One peri- od, and naturally his conclusions cannot necessarily be applied unpro-blematically to a later period. By the 1920s, all of the official imperialservices accepted Indians into their ranks, destroying all but the histori-cal aspect of the notion of a ''purely European cadre'' as a status basis.In addition, the status of the British medical profession in the early decades of the 20 thcentury was considerably enhanced by both greater professionalisation and scientific progress, with the surgical skills re- quired of IMS officers in Political employ particularly prestigious.These factors increasingly impacted on the social ranking of the biome-dical physician in India in the 20 thcentury and the extremely high so- cial status of indigenous biomedical doctors in post-1947 India wouldappear to reflect certain continuities with the late colonial period.44 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINOf considerable relevance to the status of the IMS officers discussed here was their association with the Political Department. While IMS re- cruitment from Britain declined after WW1, the ''Politicals'' were stillable to attract some highly regarded physicians. Certainly in Tibet their status appears to have been higher than is suggested by Harrison 's de- scription of the post-1905 Indianisation policy as 'the final blow to theservice'. 91In the 1930s, for example, the long-serving Sikkim Political Officer Basil [later Sir Basil] Gould, whose concern with status was le-gendary, 92rated very highly the IMS officer who accompanied him to Lhasa, Dr. Morgan. He described Morgan as, 'equally liked and re-spected by the greatest in the land and by the most lowly ... second tonone of the Political Doctors I have met'. 93 In concluding that the IMS was characterised by a 'pervasive anti-in- tellectualism, ... a climate in which innovation in theory and practicewas positively discouraged' and that the 'narrow outlook of many of itsofficers encouraged fatalism and indifference to the plight of the In-dian people', 94Harrison 's assessment of the IMS is reminiscent of Ian Copland's critique of the Political Department.95But the picture, in re- gard to the later period, may be more complex than these studies sug-gest. Just as I have argued in a previous work that Copeland's conclu- sions cannot be applied to the Political Officers who served in Tibet, 96 the medical officers with whom we are concerned in this study overall appear to have been more open-minded, intellectual in outlook, andprofessionally skilled than Harrison 's conclusions would allow for IMSofficers in general in the earlier period. This study deals, however, only with a small group of IMS officers who were accepted into the Political Department and posted to Tibet.By the 20 thcentury, the Politicals, both in their own view and in terms of precedence, enjoyed the highest status of any of the imperial ser-vices. Its officers were almost invariably educated at the best Britishpublic schools and universities or military colleges before serving, gen-erally with some distinction, for at least five years in the Indian Armyor the Indian Civil Service. The service attracted ambitious and adven-turous men with great faith in the concept of British empire. Whilegenerally outdoorsmen, skilled in riding and fond of hunting, they alsopossessed the necessary social skills for diplomatic intercourse and in- tellectual abilities for intelligence-gathering. They saw themselves as an elite, and recruitment was characterised by nepotism; a reference froman experienced member of the Political Department was almost essen-tial for consideration. Each individual selection for the Department waspersonally approved by the Viceroy of India, which further enhancedtheir status. Thus in joining the medical corps maintained by the Political De- partment, IMS officers may have been actively seeking to improve theirINTRODUCTION 45social status, as well as opting for a more unusual or adventurous ca- reer setting. The IMS officers who served in Tibet did deliberately culti-vate their status through such symbolic actions as wearing military uni-form as their normal apparel. Dr. Kurian, for example, recalled that the 'concern with status in the IMS could be compared to that of the In- dian Political Service, with maintenance of prestige an important factorin their work'. 97 Of course British-Indian concepts of prestige did not necessarily reg- ister with the Tibetans. One recalls that British prestige was enhancednot by uniforms but because a medical officer was a very fine swimmer and had a reputation for this all over Lhasa. He was the only man who dared to dive into the turbu- lent waters of the Tsangpo river during the summer month,when it is swollen by melting snows. Thus he did much to en-hance the prestige of the British people. 98 One notable characteristic of the doctors who sought Political Depart-ment service was that in stating their preferred choice of four possibleareas in which to work, the 'Upper Provinces', which included the Pun- jab, was the most popular choice, with Bengal and Assam the least popular. 99This mirrored Political Department traditions in which the Punjab ranked as the highest status posting, with what P.H. van denDungen termed 'The Punjab Tradition ' firmly part of the greater Politi-cal Department identity. 100This preference for the Punjab suggests a search for enhanced status as well as a desire for the active and adven-turous service that by the 20 thcentury was to be found largely on In- dia's frontiers. This is in contrast to Harrison 's findings that the most popular pro- vince for IMS recruits generally was Bengal, 'until 1911 ... the hub ofEuropean culture', and the province offering 'the most lucrative oppor-tunities for private practice'. 101While the comparison is not an exact one, it is nonetheless an indication that the Political doctors differedfrom the norm in seeking more exotic society. Given that in postingssuch as Tibet they had little or no opportunity for private practice, italso suggests their lesser concern with financial gain. These qualities did not necessarily equate to a higher than average professional perfor- mance, but of greatest importance to the Political Department's assess-ment of them was their performance in the political sphere; their abil-ity to ''get on '' with the Tibetans and to project British prestige in thedesired manner. Finally, in regard to status, the question of race in the Political De- partment was more complex than concerning other services. On theone hand, it was a determinedly European service with indigenous re-46 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINcruits excluded for as long as possible.102In selecting IMS officers for Political employment the Department had, in the latter part of the 19th century, required candidates to sign a declaration that both of their par- ents were of 'unmixed European blood'.103On the other hand, as an ex- plicitly elitist service charged with dealings with local and neighbour-ing state elites its ranks had always included individuals who were em-ployed on account of their expertise in regard to particular remoteregions rather than racial qualification. Historically, this had meantthat Eurasians were occasionally employed, and in the 1904-47 periodseveral Eurasians and Himalayan Buddhists were given Political De-partment posts on the Tibetan frontier, while the Civil Surgeon inGangtok was usually, if not always, a Eurasian. However, for most of the 1904-47 period, the senior medical posts in Tibet remained in Brit- ish hands and even in the junior positions Hindus and Muslims wereexcluded from employment there. This policy was clearly articulated interms of status, as will be seen. In addition to the IMS officers, the Subordinate Medical Depart- ment's less medically-qualified sub-assistant surgeons (known until1910 as hospital assistants), were employed in Sikkim and Tibet in asupporting role. These men generally held a Licensed Medical Fellow- ship obtained after three years of study, raising them above the ranks of compounders, the lowest level of qualification. The SubordinateMedical Department evolved from the EIC's use of Indian medical as-sistants and was developed in both civil and military sections in theBengal, Madras, and Bombay presidencies until the three departmentswere amalgamated in 1895 to form the SMD. While the majority of theearly recruits seem to have been Eurasian and native Christian youths,the Department also included Indian-born Europeans and increasingly became the primary outlet for most Indians taking up biomedical prac- tice. 104In the region under consideration, SMD personnel were em- ployed at all of the government dispensaries. Sikkimese Buddhists es-tablished something a monopoly on the Tibetan positions, as will beseen, and were able to use their positions as intermediaries to advancetheir social status under colonial rule. Frontier medicine Surgery can be seen as a separate system to biomedicine; one of directbodily intervention in contrast to non-invasive curing strategies. It canalso be seen as a higher system; when biomedicine fails, surgery is thefinal resort. Certainly, during the period under consideration, the prac-tice of surgery enjoyed a particular heroic status; it was, we might say,at the cutting edge of biomedicine. What W.F. Bynum termed 'the cultINTRODUCTION 47of the surgeon '105had developed during the 19thcentury when an un- derstanding of the need for aseptic conditions rapidly improved survi- val rates and opened up new possibilities for advanced surgery. Thiswas of obvious relevance to the military, and the IMS officers with whom we are concerned were qualified surgeons aware of the value and status of that practice. It was 'the ultimate weapon and the mis-sion doctor's greatest tool' and without it medical practice could befound 'unexciting and even uninspiring'. 106If their diplomatic employ- ers were primarily concerned with the IMS officer's political perfor-mance, their surgical abilities were a major factor in their fellows' as-sessment of their professional performance. The frontier environment in which the IMS officers practised only enhanced this focus. Christopher Lawrence has described how contem-porary American surgeons considered their art had been perfected by'what they considered quintessential American traits; individualism,democracy, inventiveness and heroism '. 107But in British India these were not seen as American traits , but characteristic of frontiersmen ingeneral. By quietly emphasising their 'heroic traits' in reports and cor-respondence the IMS officers improved their status by associatingthemselves with the ideal of the frontiersman as understood by their Political Department employers. European medical discourse was also linked to the frontier ideal through the existence there of medical practices that were outside of both Western and Asian systems. Those practices, or 'roadside medi-cine', 108cannot be subsumed under either the category of 'traditional' nor of 'scientific' medicine, though they might embrace elements ofboth. Yet neither can they be classified as 'quackery' in that their appli-cation apparently derived entirely from empirical evidence of efficacy. Floating free of conceptual boundaries, their remedies were not found in textbooks, nor was their application restricted to medical practi-tioners. This form of medicine, embracing both human and veterinarysubjects, appears to have escaped academic attention, at least in theAsian context. Roadside medicine as a form of curing was characterised by the pragmatic use of whatever materials might be available. Examples in-clude garlic to cure the ammonia poisoning induced by the smoke from yak dung and bone fires, or butter and salt as a cure for gingivi- tis. 109While these may have been traditional Tibetan remedies, the products of Western modernity might also be medically utilised withconsiderable ingenuity. Muleteers, for example, broke open old torchbatteries and used the residue to treat saddle sores on their mules, 110 although a British officer preferred Vaseline mixed with iodoform - 'anabsolutely perfect dressing for horse's sore backs'. 11148 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINRoadside medicine could also involve some element of risk, as in the case where the American medical missionary Dr. Albert Shelton suc- cessfully treated a fellow missionary for typhus by stimulating his heart'with injections of whiskey behind his breastbone'. 112Less dramatic, and simpler in application was, 'a very simple and effective remedy forsnow blindness ... a few drops of castor oil into the eyes and the reliefis almost instantaneous'. 113 Such treatments were specific, and as such were distinct from the kind of generalist treatment suggested by the missionary epitome, 'anaspirin for all pains above the waist and Epsom salts for all below'. 114 They were also wider in application than is implied by the term'Household medicine'. Nor was the efficacy of roadside medicine de- pendent on the authority of a national medical tradition or cultural power. European travellers frequently reported the popularity of almostentirely spurious medicines they dispensed, as in the case of one whohad only liver pills to treat patients, but found; 'Amazing cures werewrought by this means. Sufferers with anything from rheumatism toAsiatic sores returned to say how much better they felt.' 115Roadside medicine, however, was cross-culturally efficacious. While difficult toconceptualise under existing models of medical systems, it may be best located within the concept of 'the Frontier' as a liminal zone charac- terised by its inhabitants' qualities of self-reliance and innovation. 116 Environment In a document dating to around the 9thcentury C.E., Tibetans de- scribed their land in the following terms: This centre of heavenThis core of earthThis heart of the worldFenced around by snow mountainsThe headland of all riversWhere the peaks are high and the land is pure. 117 The understanding of Tibet as a land of 'high peaks, pure earth ' ( ri mtho sa gtsang ),118acquired a Buddhist framework in the 7ththrough 10thcenturies, in which Tibet was understood as a protected 'field' of the Boddhisattva Avalokites \u00b4vara. The auchtononous spirits of place were reconceptualised as having been converted to the service of thenew faith, and a network of sacred Buddhist spaces was overlaid on anearlier sacralised landscape, forming a complex pattern of places em-powered by both local and trans-regional deities. But despite their sub-INTRODUCTION 49jection within a Buddhacised realm the capricious spirits still required propitiation, without which they might induce illness and disease.119 Yet, alongside this concept of other-worldly disease causation, envir- onmental determinism was recognised in such popular understandings as the Indian plains as a reservoir of infections. A similar situation ex- isted within Indic culture, where indigenous understandings of the en-vironment seem to have centred more on a conceptual divide betweenthe purified 'known ' and the impure 'wilderness'. 120While the concept of other-worldly disease causation was widely embraced, an associationwith climate, season, and environment was recognised in the classicaltexts of A \u00afyurveda. The early Europeans in India understood the environment as a pri- mary factor in disease causation. 121This was manifested in the recogni- tion of a distinct tropical environment, one which included healthy andunhealthy localities. This construction was closely associated with thewider issue of whether India was suitable for long-term European set-tlement. It was also linked to the need to maintain healthy militaryforces, something which became of particular concern during the 19 th century. It was in the context of these issues that imperial political andcultural centres ('hill stations'), began to be established in what were regarded as the healthier mountainous regions of India. 122It was be- lieved that the mountains offered a place where troops could remain healthy and European settlers might thrive; of Darjeeling it was saidthat the, 'thin, pallid and peevish child is not long [there] before be-coming fat, rosy and active'. 123 The discovery of bacteriological disease causation transformed ideas of the role of environment, bringing, as David Arnold put it, 'a shiftaway from the environmental paradigm that had dominated nine- teenth-century medical thought'. 124But environmental determinism lingered 20thcentury and the Himalayas retained specific imaginal and clinical disease associations throughout and after the co- lonial period. Certain paradoxes were inherent in both imaginal andclinical understandings. From the time of the earliest explorations there in the 18 thcentury, imperial officers described the Himalayas as a healthy environmentwhere one might find a climate that was 'decidedly beneficial', 125with 'an abundance of very pure water'126and plenty of fresh air.127This en- vironment was conceptualised as productive not only of a physicallyhealthier race, but of peoples whose morality and culture was superiorto those of the plains. Believing that there was 'assuredly morality inthe oxygen of the mountains', 128the British contrasted what they saw as the 'feeble bodied and meek spirited native of Bengal' with 'their ac-tive and Herculean neighbours' in the mountains. 129Overwhelmingly, those who served there preferred the environment, peoples, and cul-50 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINture of the Himalayas to that of the Indian plains, and they drew a sharp distinction between the two; they did not consider the Himala-yan states to be part of India and saw themselves as diplomats servingbeyond the Indian frontier. 130 This positive view of the Himalayas was a sentiment that became more, rather than less pronounced in the 20th century. A major factorin that change was the carnage of the 1914-18 war, which raised doubtsabout the value of Western civilisation when contrasted to the appar-ently pastoral calm of Himalayan Buddhist societies. 131(Three of the five Sikkim Political Officers in the 1921-47 period had seen active ser-vice in World War One, as had a number of the medical and militarypersonnel.) As a consequence, by the 1940s the British were as con- cerned with preserving the existing Himalayan culture as they had been in the earlier years with modernising it. 132 Accentuating this understanding of our region was its status as a frontier. While there was an alternative discourse of degeneration ascharacteristic of frontiers, the concept of 'the frontier' in British Indiaimplied a healthy location both physically and morally. These under-standings were shaped both by ideas of the American 'West' and by aheroic mythology of empire, both of which privileged the frontier as a location where individual initiative and character were more important than bureaucratic rules and regulations. In this construction, not onlywere the local people superior to their equivalents on the Indian plains,but so too were the imperial frontiersmen superior to their more bu-reaucratically inclined colleagues in the urban centres of India. There was a political context to this construction. As a part of their strategy of alliance with the Himalayan elites, the British frontier offi-cers cultivated a positive image of the region, particularly in the case of Tibet. 133Both the presentation of that image, and the generally favour- able impression of Tibetan people and society formed by the officers who served there, meant that the 'disease=backwardness' equation wasnot located in a political context as it often was in British India. Whilevenereal conditions were something of an exception, disease was notgenerally associated with Himalayan Buddhist culture in the negativemanner in which, for example, cholera had been linked to Hindu pil-grimage practices in 19 thcentury India.134 We may see biomedicine as a symbol of colonial relations in the Hi- malayas. With little or no need for the physical separation arising from'fear of catching native diseases', 135after the Younghusband mission, there was a distinct Himalayan form of imperialism that appears lessexploitive and culturally confrontational than in British India. The Brit-ish relationship with the Himalayan peoples in the 20 thcentury may be best described as 'paternal'.136There was considerable admiration for many aspects of the local society and social relations with the indi-INTRODUCTION 51genous people could be far less formal without the barriers to social in- tercourse created by Hindu caste restrictions and Islamic purdah .N o r were relations with Tibetans, or even Sikkimese and Bhutanese, subjectto the same colonial and racial power relationships that characterised social intercourse in British India. In the course of the 20 thcentury, the rise of anti-colonial feeling was particularly marked in Bengal, and the British found their reception in the Himalayas, where the indepen-dence movement had little strength, a welcome contrast to the hostilitythat prevailed on the plains. Yet paradoxically this mountain idyll had particular dangers. Aside from bears ... very numerous and exceedingly destructive'.138There were floods, landslides, and earth- quakes such as that in Kangra in 1905, which destroyed the small McLeod Gang hill station and nearby cantonment, while soldiersneeded bamboo huts, not tents, to cope with an annual rainfall of 300inches in Sikkim. 139On the Younghusband mission there were 202 deaths 'due to climate', while only 161 were killed or wounded in ac-tion. 140Nineteen deaths were directly attributable to altitude, with the sickness which had once been understood according to miasmic the- ories as due to 'bad air' recognised by the end of the 19thcentury as being due to the decreasing amounts of oxygen available on ascending the mountains. In Tibet, the paradox seemed even more extreme. The high altitude and the bitterly cold winters took their toll of European visitors. AnAmerican traveller who died of pneumonia at Gyantse shortly after aBritish post was opened there in 1904 was only the first of a numberof Europeans who died in Tibet. 141Several of those who served there also left on medical grounds, despite having passed a strict medical ex-amination before appointment to Tibet. While the natural environmentseemed pristine, Phari, the first town on the Tibetan plateau en routefrom Gangtok to Gyantse and Lhasa, stunned European travellers withits streets, 'so choked with the accumulated garbage of centuries thatthey are many feet higher than formerly', and it was invariably de-scribed in such terms as the 'filthiest town in the world'. 142 While it was not considered noteworthy in the 18thcentury, by the 20thcentury the fact that Tibetans rarely bathed had become notable, indeed, another clique in traveller's accounts of that land. However,after the Younghusband mission, Tibet was not represented in medicalor other literature as a dangerous or unhealthy environment in termsof disease. On the contrary, it was observed that the Tibetans appeareda healthy race, and that many of the diseases that ravaged India wereabsent there. This was partly due to ignorance of the apparently extre-mely high child mortality rates there. But it was also due to 20 thcen-52 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINtury biomedical understandings of disease causation which recognised that the cold helped, 'the defence against infective illnesses, by render-ing garbage innocuous and making life hard for bacteria and parasitesat large'. 143 In the absence of associations of disease with Himalayan culture and with the prevailing belief in the region as a healthy environment,there was a growing emphasis on the Himalayas as presenting a logis-tical challenge to biomedicine. There was a necessary dependence thereon outside products and technologies, and it was, for example, extre-mely difficult to bring safely from Calcutta medicines that had to bestored at a particular temperature. Equally, it was a major challenge totransport sensitive medical equipment across the Himalayas and oper- ate it without technological support systems, not least established elec- trical supplies. Such logistical problems encouraged a practical ratherthan theoretical approach to biomedicine, stimulating phenomena suchas Roadside medicine and encouraging the indigenisation of biomedi-cine through the blurring of its boundaries. The environment also imposed a clinical frontier of distinct zones of disease. Approaching the Himalayas from the south, the travellerpassed through the 'fever-ridden terrai', where malaria and kala-azar were endemic. 144As the Himalayas were ascended, the risk of these fe- vers diminished with the increased altitude, malaria was not foundabove 5,000 feet, and kala-azar too reached only into the foothills. But new diseases appeared in the hills, goitre, for example, was endemic inmany of the mountain valleys of the Himalayas, 145and tuberculosis be- came increasingly common. Above 10,000, feet travellers were liable tobe afflicted by altitude sickness, snow blindness, and severe sunburn.Thus a correlation between disease and location was demonstrated, although this was increasingly shown to be related to a variety of diet- ary, economic, and social conditions, as well as climatic and ecologicalfactors. 146 It is difficult to isolate Himalayan parallels to studies demonstrating the 'fatal impact' of European expansion on local populations in suchplaces as the Pacific islands and the Americas. 147Nor are there obvious parallels to those showing how in British India the spread of diseasessuch as malaria was stimulated as a consequence of environmental changes induced by canal-building. 148A.K. Datta notes that kala-azar was known in the Garo hills as 'British Government disease',149but on the Indo-Tibetan frontier a negative imperial impact on indigenous health patterns, while difficult to assess in the absence of any pre-colo-nial statistics, seems limited. There are no indications that new dis-eases developed in this region as a consequence of European contact.Although the influenza pandemic of 1918-19 affected the entire region,Tibet was crossed by trade routes that linked it into a wider economicINTRODUCTION 53world, and any or all of the trading groups could have been the causa- tive agents of its introduction. While the development of forestry resources had long-term environ- mental consequences, if we are to isolate a negative European health impact in this region, it would be the growth of tobacco smoking. This aroused elite cultural opposition in the Buddhist Himalayas, with thesmoke considered offensive to deities, and as early as the 1640s, Bhu-tan became the first state to attempt to restrict its use. 150But while both Tibet and Sikkim sought to ban tobacco in the 20thcentury, its use there had rapidly been indigenised and incorporated into local eco-nomic networks. Only in the controlled environment of the monas-teries was it possible to effectively suppress its use, and its popularity among the lower social classes despite elite religious objections may hint as much at class tensions in Himalayan societies as it does at theaddictive nature of tobacco. 151Interestingly, despite their own tobacco addictions, British officials in the Himalayas supported a ban on tobac-co, seeing it as an unwanted consequence of modernity. In contrast,they had little to say about indigenous use of cannabis or opium, bothof which were sold legally in Sikkim and Darjeeling during the colonialperiod, albeit their use was almost unknown among Tibetan Buddhist groups. While cannabis and opium use have subsequently been crimi- nalized, tobacco-smoking persists in the Himalayas, albeit in the faceof social sanctions and, in Bhutan, determined efforts to eliminate thepractice.54 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAIN1 Missionary Medicine and the Rise of Kalimpong Christianity recognises no worldly boundaries to the spread of the Faith and its missionaries' dreams of converting the Tibetans can be tracedback to the late 8 thcentury. The then Patriarch of the Nestorian Chris- tians, Timothy 1 of Baghdad, considered that little-known land to be under his jurisdiction and moved to appoint an apostolate to Tibet.1 But while Nestorians, and later Catholic emissaries to the court of the Mongol Khans, may have reached the fringes of the Tibetan world, thefirst recorded direct encounters between Christian West and BuddhistTibet were not until the 17 thcentury. Following rumours of a lost Christian kingdom in the Himalayas, Je- suit monks made concerted efforts to penetrate Tibet and they estab-lished a mission at Tsaparang in western Tibet from 1624-40. Two Je- suits also travelled through Bhutan to Shigatse in central Tibet in 1628, and in 1661 the Jesuits Grueber and d'Orville became the firstEuropeans known to have visited Lhasa. In the early 18 thcentury, the Jesuit Ippolito Desideri remained in Lhasa from 1716-21, by which timethe Capuchins had established a mission there which functioned inter-mittently between 1707 and 1745. 2As will be seen, the Capuchins found their rudimentary medical knowledge a useful means of gainingsupport from their hosts, although more than a century was to pass be- fore this became an explicit missionary strategy. Tibet was then open to any foreigners able to overcome the logistical difficulties of travel there, and in the 18 thcentury, Dutch and French traders reached Lhasa, while British East India Company emissaries were entertained in Shigatse. But the closing decades of that centurywitnessed the increasing suspicion in Asia of the growing power of theEuropean nations. When the Nepalese invaded Tibet in 1788 the Brit-ish were suspected of aiding them, and in 1793, after the Qing Emper- or's armies had expelled the Nepalese, the Manchu dynasty establish its political authority over Tibet and closed its borders to Europeans. 3 While Chinese authority over Tibet weakened over the next century,the two governments co-operated in maintaining this policy of isolationuntil it was temporarily ended by the Younghusband mission of 1903-04.Paradoxically, Tibet's policy of isolation only served to increase its ap- peal to the West. The 19thcentury was a 'Golden Age' of European ex- ploration in which a genuine spirit of enquiry combined with scientific, technological, and imperial advances to enable Europeans to reach the remotest corners of the globe. Explorers became the subject of a heroic discourse expounded in the popular media, winning both fame and for-tune through their endeavours. In this milieu the 'Forbidden Land' ofTibet became an increasingly attractive goal. Its very isolation fosteredthe development of 'Mythos Tibet', an imaginative construction of aland of mystery and magic, a place where esoteric knowledge was pre-served and cultivated. New spiritual movements such as the Theosoph-ists drew on and enhanced this construct, which only added to Tibet's appeal to European explorers. 4 In conjunction with these imperatives, political and economic inter- ests also stimulated approaches to Tibet. Protecting the commercial in- terests of the East India Company increasingly drew the British into amilitary and political role in the Indian sub-continent. Within thewider context of European ideas of the benefits of free trade and com-munication between nations, Tibet's isolation increasingly came to beseen in India as anachronistic. As British power over India reached its heights towards the end of the 19 thcentury, Tibet's isolation, and refu- sal to enter into diplomatic intercourse with British India seemed an insult to the prestige of an increasingly confident Empire, while theideology of 'free trade' demanded that Tibetan markets be opened toIndian goods. With the construction of a 'Russian threat' to British In-dia via Tibet, the stage was set for the Younghusband mission to endTibet's isolation. No group more eagerly supported this opening of Ti-bet than the Christian missionaries, who viewed it as the key to obtain- ing access to the 'Forbidden Land'. While Christianity in India had a long history and had been firmly established in Goa under Portuguese colonial rule, it was not until after restrictions on their activities in Company territory were relaxedin 1813 that significant missionary activity developed in British India.While there was an early Evangelical influence on imperial govern-ment, the revolt of 1857-58 in north India was an indication of how fi-nely balanced was the Indian social system, and imperial officials were subsequently more cautious in the explicit promotion of Christianity. Fearing civil unrest, even serving officials who were practising Chris-tians would often resist any expansion of the Faith in their domain, aswill be seen. But the imperial government often discovered that mis-sionary and imperial interests coincided, while missionaries coulddraw on considerable moral and financial support at 'home' and wereskilled at exploiting the political advances of the European powers tofurther their interests. The relationship between missionaries and the56 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINimperial government and its officers was thus a complex and varied one, effectively negotiated at the local level. As Rosemary Fitzgerald has demonstrated, missionary endeavours were focussed on preaching the Gospel until at least the mid-19thcen- tury. But it became increasingly apparent that the evangelical approachwas failing to produce significant numbers of converts and there was agrowing debate among missionary strategists over the most effectivemeans of winning converts. 5Healing the sick had been an important part of Jesus's ministry and service to the suffering was an establishedChristian ideal. There was, therefore, a tradition of healing associatedwith Christian mission that began to take on a particular context in thelight of this debate. Drawing on the practical experience of missionaries in the field, mis- sions began to focus on two 'tools'; education and medicine, and in thelast decades of the 19 thcentury these systems were accepted as an inte- gral part of the missionary enterprise.6By the end of the century, it was a firmly established principle that schools and hospitals made up,with preaching, 'the trio of great evangelistic agencies', 7and pioneering missions inevitably established schools and hospitals alongside theirmission stations. While our focus here is on medicine, it is important to remember that the two 'tools' were closely related, not least because those who had received a Western education at mission schools wereto be at the forefront of the indigenous development of Western medi-cine. Pupils at mission schools were not only taught the conceptual frame- work that underpinned the new medical system, they were able to ob-serve its efficacy (or otherwise!), first-hand, for they had their illnessestreated under that system and their behaviour shaped by its under- standings. They learned about hygiene and preventative medical strate- gies such as public toilets, boiling water, and the use of mosquito nets,innovations that produced changes in indigenous domestic and publicspace practices, bringing them more in line with European norms. In-digenous cultural understandings and practices were thus challengedand fractures in cultural transmission induced, a necessary precursorto the adoption of both Christianity and Western modernity. But whilethese pupils were subject to a coercive regime (particularly at boarding schools), it must be remembered that they did not necessarily respond to any or all of these teachings, just as they did not necessarily convertto Christianity. Perhaps the most significant understanding they gainedwas that the power of Western medicine was not an exclusively Eur-opean colonial possession, but a universally applicable power obtain-able through advanced education. 8 In order to spread the message most widely the vernacular lan- guages were considered the most appropriate for Christian instruction,MISSIONARY MEDICINE AND THE RISE OF KALIMPONG 57but English was also taught, and became the language of advanced in- struction for the more promising pupils. Curriculums varied accordingto the expertise of the teachers, but tended to be broad, and conceivedof in terms of evangelical impact. Christianity could be imparted as an implicit element within that instruction; English lessons could, for ex- ample, be centred on Biblical texts, while the teaching of history intro-duced dating on the Christian calendar. These were not only conver-sion strategies but elements in a new lifestyle. Christian missionariesattempted to build up a complete social system in which converts em-braced a new worldview imparted by their education and entered pro-fessions associated with Christian society and ideals - the church, edu-cation, and medicine. In an early example from the region under con- sideration, for instance, Dingbu, a local convert (probably Lepcha), was trained as a compounder at the Charteris hospital in Kalimpong withthe support of the St Stephen 's Guild in Edinburgh. He was later em-ployed as both a compounder and a catechist at Nimbong and Pemlingin Kalimpong district. 9 While comparative studies are lacking, the Christian worldview im- parted at mission schools may be distinguished from the secular scien-tific modernity that was increasingly being made available through gov- ernment educational initiatives. The missionaries mediated that moder- nity through a religious worldview and social framework which mayhave proved particularly appropriate for the outcaste and tribal groupsthat made up the overwhelming majority of Himalayan Christian con-verts. These groups were able to advance their social status consider-ably as a result of their knowledge of Western systems, which qualifiedthem for employment at the schools and dispensaries established bythe missions and government. Similarly, the education of women pro- duced a new class of literate females who were to create new economic spaces in Himalayan society as nurses, teachers, and clerical workers.Existing gender relations were thus irrevocably altered by the new mis-sionary strategies, with women able to enter (comparatively) powerfulpositions in biomedical structures. In conjunction with similar develop-ments, predominantly in urban areas, where education and publichealth initiatives were introduced by colonial government, the indigen-ous spheres of education and health were radically, indeed totally, transformed. While these radical developments had begun earlier in the urban centres of colonial India, they were late 19 thcentury phenomena in the Himalayan regions under missionary influence, as indeed was the de- velopment of the category of 'medical missionaries'. Missionariesposted in remote regions had always been expected to treat themselvesand their families when they fell ill, just as they were expected to edu-cate their own children. 10But while there had been early missionaries58 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINwho happened to be physicians, the advantages of specific medical mis- sionaries seems to have been first articulated by Elijah Bridgeman, anAmerican missionary in Canton in the 1830s. Impressed by the abilityof European physicians to gain access to Chinese society through their medical work, Bridgeman appealed for an eye surgeon to be sent to a mission dispensary in Canton, resulting in the arrival of a Dr. PeterParker in 1834. 11Parker was then involved in the establishment of the Medical Missionary Society in China in 1838,12and also in what be- came the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society. The first of its type inthe UK, the Edinburgh Society was founded in 1841 after Dr. Parkerhad lectured there. 13 The first qualified British medical missionary appears to have been William Lockhart of the London Missionary Society (LMS), who wassent to China around 1838-39. 14But medical missionaries took time to win acceptance. Not only was the missionary movement divided overthe appropriateness of fully embracing medical work, but Westernmedical knowledge at that time was insufficiently advanced for the sys-tem to be clearly superior to indigenous practices. The earliest anaes-thetics, for example, only came into use in the 1840s. Yet a demand formissionaries to provide medical services was clearly apparent; at a con- ference in 1889 a missionary testified that; 'I was forced to be a Medi- cal man as a Missionary in Burmah by the people themselves ... thepeople came and demanded that they should have medicines for theirdiseases.' 15 The frequency with which such statements appear in missionary ac- counts from all parts of Asia indicated to the missionaries that a genu-ine demand for their medical services existed, although it may equallyreflect indigenous understandings of the role of religious functionaries, which in the local cultures embraced healing practices. But the exten- sion of medical services to their host communities was also a practicalresponse to isolation by the missionaries when there seemed no otheravenue from which to penetrate local society. It was the effectiveness ofmedicine - and education - as tools for gaining access to the indigen-ous peoples that alerted the missionaries to their use as a conversionstrategy which was within Christian ideals of charitable service. Yet this was an era of growing professional specialisation; in Britain for example, the Medical Act of 1858 enforced the registration of medi-cal practitioners, and medically unqualified missionaries were increas-ingly conscious of the amateur nature of their practice. As Westernmedicine developed, and, in the wider context, growing power differen-tials between coloniser and colonised emerged, indigenous medicalpractices were increasingly stigmatised and missionaries, themselvesanxious to avoid accusations of quackery, recognised the need fortrained physicians to provide medical services at the missions. 16MISSIONARY MEDICINE AND THE RISE OF KALIMPONG 59The demand for medical practitioners was also stimulated by the missionaries' desire to contest power with indigenous religious specia- lists, who, in the local medical worlds were consulted in cases of sick-ness. Missionaries believed that on an empirical field they could prove the superiority of the medicine of the Christian West, a victory that would equate to a religious victory, a demonstration of the power ofChrist over local deities. Furthermore, they considered that patientsthus cured would be more likely to accept Christianity after witnessingthat power. 17This desire to engage indigenous religions in the medical field increased as the rapid development of medical science from the1870s onwards greatly expanded the efficacy of Western medicine, in-creasing the 'power' available to the missionaries. The importance of these late 19 thcentury developments in Western medicine cannot be overstated here. The discovery of bacteriologicaldisease causation fractured humoral understandings once shared withAsian medical thought, and enabled the conquest of infectious diseasesthat had formerly decimated local (and European) populations. Westernmedicine already had considerable appeal, but the enormous advancesin curative power in that period transformed the competition with localpractices. As a consequence of these new powers and strategies, the number of medical missionaries rapidly increased in the late 19 thcentury. In 1858, there were just seven from all denominations in India and China.By 1882 there were 28 in India from Protestant denominations alone,and by 1895 there were 140, a figure that doubled in the next tenyears. 18This was also a period in which women became increasingly prominent in the field. When the American Dr. Clara Swain arrived inIndia in 1869, she was the first fully-qualified female medical mission- ary there, 19and the first British woman followed only in 1880. But by 1900, female medical missionaries outnumbered males in India and twelve years later 217 of the 335 medical missionaries in India were wo-men. 20While women were not generally socially excluded in the east- ern Himalayas, elsewhere in India these doctors played an importantrole in providing medical care in the harems and zenanas of Islamic and high-caste Hindu society. In the Himalayas they were particularlyprominent in regard to pre- and post-natal care, which (in the Western sense of medical intervention) appears to have been almost entirely ab- sent in the local societies. While tensions remained between evangelising and medical branches of the missionary enterprise, medical missionaries enjoyedthe support of many who otherwise questioned missionary work, andthey were portrayed in a heroic mode not only in Church discourse,but also in popular media outlets. Their endeavours were supported bya network of sympathisers and patrons both in India and the UK, and60 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINmissionaries on furlough made speaking tours of these support groups, describing their work in the field and appealing for additionalfunds and manpower. One result of this was to stimulate a globalisedconsciousness, with individual donors in, for example, a small village in Scotland, being made aware, via the missionaries, of individuals in India helped by their donations. In turn, the beneficiaries were madeaware of their participation in a wider Christian community. In remo-ter regions such as the Himalayas, these trans-national links predatedthe development of an Indian national consciousness and may haveacted as a factor preventing the development of the close associationbetween nationalism and medical systems that occurred in India. Ultimately the use of Western medicine did not produce the mass conversions that missionaries had hoped for. Patients proved able to se-parate Western medicine from Christian teaching and the optimistictone of late 19 thcentury missionary discourse faded, as did 'Home' support for medical missions.21This can be seen within the wider con- text of Orientalism; a na \u00a8ve assumption that some element - be it com- mand of information, religion, or indigenous language - was the keyto understanding South Asian societies. Early missionary approaches to Tibet through the western Himalayas Just as the imperial Government was increasingly drawn into involve- ment with Tibet, so too were the missionaries. Protestants were fore-most in this development in India; there were few continuities withthe earlier Jesuit and Capuchin activities in the region, which were al- most forgotten in India. 22But Catholic efforts to proselytise in Tibet continued in China after the Vatican transferred responsibility for mis- sion work there from the first SME missionary visited east- ern Tibet in 1847 and a mission was established at Bonga in southeast-ern Kham in 1854, 23one link in a chain which would, within two decades, encircle Tibet. As will be seen, numerous other missionarieswere also to base their efforts around the eastern approaches to Tibet, while still others sought to reach Tibet from the north and northeast- ern approaches. But in India, initial attempts to approach Tibet weremade from the western Himalayas. In the same year that the SME established their mission at Bonga, Protestant missionaries of the Moravian community reached the cultur-al Tibetan region of Ladakh soon after it came under British overlord-ship during the First Sikh War of 1846. The Moravians actually hopedto use Ladakh as a stepping-stone to reach the Tibetan Buddhist Mon-MISSIONARY MEDICINE AND THE RISE OF KALIMPONG 61gols (to whom Moravians had ministered in Russian territory in the 18thand early 19thcentury). But in 1856, having been repeatedly turned back by the Tibetan border guards, they opened a mission station atKyelang (Lahul), intending to carry out missionary activities on the frontier until Tibet opened. Their efforts were sanctioned by the Gov- ernment of India, which provided land for the mission. 24The Mora- vians subsequently established further mission stations in 1865 at Poo,the last village on the Indian side of the Tibetan border along the Sutlejroute, and at the Ladakhi capital of Leh in 1885, in addition to shorter-lived endeavours at Chini and Simla. As centres with existing Tibetantrading communities, these stations offered the Moravians access to Ti-betans, if not to Tibet itself. 25 The late 19thcentury debate over medicine as a missionary strategy was highly relevant to the missionaries stationed around Tibet's fron-tiers because Tibetan Buddhists proved remarkably resistant to evange-lical approaches and very few converted. But medical missions openedpreviously closed areas of the Himalayas. The Church Missionary So-ciety, for example, made several attempts to establish a mission inKashmir from 1854 onwards, but faced opposition from all levels of so-ciety. But the missionaries still had significant support from the imper- ial government in this period and around 1863 the Maharaja was pres- sured by the Viceroy to accept a mission dispensary in Srinigar. Thiswas financed with 'liberal private assistance' from British officials, 26 who covered the expenses of a Scottish medical missionary, Dr. Wil-liam Elmslie. That opposition to his presence remained is suggested bythe rumour that his death in 1872 was due to poison, 27but the dispen- sary continued to develop and by the 1890s was averaging over 30,000patients annually. 28Many came from considerable distances29and the dispensary paved the way for the extension of biomedicine in that state.By 1922, in a symbol of the transformation, the Maharaja begged theGovernment of India to allow the then medical officer, a Colonel HugoIMS, to remain in Srinigar as, 'my life has been saved twice under hisable treatment and I would naturally desire to retain him with me aslong as possible'. 30 The opening of the dispensary in Srinigar was followed in 1867 by the appointment of an Officer on Special Duty in Ladakh - the prede- cessor of the British Joint Commissioner there. They specifically sought out a medical man, and selected one Dr. Cayley. In his reportthe following year, he added his voice to those who saw the advantageof medical provision to the local people, concluding that the opportunity the dispensaries afforded me of communicatingwith the traders and others, and of conversing freely with them,were very great, and this I found of the greatest advantage in en-62 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINabling me to pick up information; and there is no doubt that the merchants have many of them returned to Central Asia, feelinga very lively gratitude for the benefits they have received; andsuch a feeling is calculated to spread abroad a spirit of friend- ship towards India among the races beyond the Himalayas, and thus indirectly promote future trade. 31 The Moravian mission also found medicine useful, and the establish-ment of hospitals and schools was central to their activities in Lahuland Ladakh. 32The first Moravian missionaries, August Heyde and Eduard Pagell, had basic medical training. Pagell's skill became sowidely admired that in February 1867, when smallpox broke out in western Tibet, he was invited across the frontier to vaccinate. Pagell vaccinated 639 people in twelve villages in Tibet and while he wasnever allowed to return (and he and his wife died of typhus in 1883),this was a significant indication of how useful medical practice couldbe in enabling the missionaries to penetrate Tibetan society. 33 Pagell's invitation seems to have been a unique initiative that was en- tirely contrary to Tibetan policy in that century and the invitation pre-sumably came from local officials rather than the Lhasa-appointed re- gional governor (who was frequently absent). But this first recorded in- stance of vaccination inside Tibet not only suggests the demand thatexisted for efficacious medical treatment if the political barriers to itsintroduction could be removed, but also indicates the important role infacilitating biomedicine played by pragmatic local officials - with theirvested interests in people's health. The Moravians continued to focus on Lahul and Ladakh, where the dispensary they inherited from Cayley and ran with government assis- tance was held in high repute. However, the sparsely populated region provided, according to a 1921 report, 'insufficient work for one doctor',with just 1,500-2,000 a year, 60-70 inpatients and 50-60 op-erations. 34But such considerations were not the main issue for a mis- sion hospital and as late as 1940 they concluded that, 'there isconsider- able missionary value derived from the hospital'.35By that time, how- ever, that 'value' does not seem to represent increased conversion toChristianity, rather it referred to the geographical expansion of areas in which the Gospel was made known. This was, however, part of the Christian intention, deriving from the messianic belief that Christ's re-turn could not occur before the entire globe had had the opportunity toknow and accept Christianity. In what is now Himachal Pradesh, a 'Himalaya Mission ' was estab- lished as early as 1840 by European residents of Simla. This was latertaken over by the Church Missionary Society, which opened missionsin Simla around 1848, and in Kangra in 1854. In Chamba district, theMISSIONARY MEDICINE AND THE RISE OF KALIMPONG 63Rev William Ferguson arrived to serve as an independent missionary soon after the British had first appointed a Superintendent (Major BlairReid) to the state in January 1863. Fergusson, a former Indian Armychaplain who had resigned to become a missionary, founded a church in Chamba and remained there until he fell ill in 1873. 36He was appar- ently a somewhat eccentric figure. One observer recorded that 'as a Christian faqir he wore a distinctive garb, his gown and bands',37and, in contrast to the increasingly common biomedical missionaries, hewas a homeopathic practitioner. 38As he informed the Allahabad Mis- sionary Conference of 1872-73, he would sometimes 'take his stand un-der a tree, ring a bell, and offer medicine to any willing to receive it.' 39 In 1900, Ferguson, having spent most of the intervening years in Cy- prus, returned to Chamba while his successor went on furlough, and he died there in 1904 aged 83.40 While these missions were all aimed at Himalayan communities within British India, many of the individuals that served in them wereprimarily attracted to the Buddhist lands beyond the frontier and therewas considerable optimism that medicine would enable them to reachbeyond that frontier. Thus they became strong proponents of medicalservices, a view that was increasingly accepted in mission circles. Dr. John Hutchinson added his voice to the predominant mood of the Cen- tenary Conference on the Protestant Missions of the World in 1889when he stated that: 41 Wherever the Medical Missionary goes, the poor, the halt, theblind, the leper, the fever-stricken, in short, all forms of diseaseand suffering daily present themselves before him ... Labouringfor many years as I have been in a native State, where our Mis- sionary operations are viewed with not a little jealousy by the authorities, I can bear emphatic testimony to the powerful influ-ence which this agency [medicine] has exerted ... in disarmingopposition and in gaining for us the goodwill and friendship ofall sections of the community. 42 Hutchinson was a medical missionary with the Church of Scotlandwho, after three years in the Punjab, had taken over Fergusson 's inde- pendent Chamba mission in 1873. 43When he died at nearby Dalhousie in July 1936, aged 88, he had spent an extraordinary 65 years as a mis- sionary, most of it in Chamba where he is now buried. His funeral wasattended by most of the town 's population. 44 The opposition Hutchinson hinted at in his conference speech does not appear to have been from the political authorities there as develop-ments in Chamba state suggest a close alliance of interests betweenimperial government, missionaries, and local elites. Maharaja Sri64 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINSingh had requested British assistance after coming of age and owed his power to their presence, while after his death in 1870, in the ab-sence of a direct heir, his elder brother Gopal Singh was recognised bythe British above the claims of a younger sibling. In 1873, Gopal Singh stood down in favour of his seven-year old son Sham Singh, who was given a Western education and ruled until 1904. Thus, from the time aBritish representative arrived in Chamba, the interests of the ruling fa-mily lay in alliance with the imperial power that supported their rule,and the succession of Maharajas were generous in sponsorship of var-ious imperial projects. Maharaja Sri Singh provided Ferguson withland in the town for mission use and later provided land for the mis-sion dispensary. 45Sham Singh, who in the traditional role of a Mahara- ja also sponsored the building of temples, mosques, and a Sikh gud- wara , gave land for a church, paid for its building and even financed the pulpit, church organ, and a memorial plaque for Ferguson.46This patronage was to continue into the 20thcentury, with the housing of the Hospital Superintendent, another long-serving medical missionary,Dr. W.S. Robertson, still being provided by the Maharaja in the1920s. 47 Administratively, Chamba, as a state within the Punjab, was required to be self-financing. Major Reid, following the usual model of imperialdevelopment in these regions, stabilised Chamba state's finances andinstituted revenue-raising measures that would finance modernisation.The Chamba ruling family do appear to have been strongly supportiveof the kind of educational and medical initiatives promoted by the colo-nial state and missionary organisations. With the Maharaja providingthe land necessary, a state primary school opened in 1863 and a medi-cal department was inaugurated in 1866, with a hospital opened in De- cember that year. This was headed by the Kashmir missionary Dr. Elm- slie, who was sent to Chamba by the Panjab Medical Missionary So-ciety at the request of the Maharaja. Dr. Elmslie was provided by theMaharaja with a salary supplement of 200 rupees a month, plus ex-penses, and a free house. 48But Elmslie returned to Kashmir in March 1867 and the Chamba hospital closed again until February of the fol-lowing year, when it was then reopened under a Hospital Assistant,Barkhurdar Khan, who remained there until at least 1906. In 1891 an improved hospital with beds for 40 inpatients was built and named after Maharaja Sham Singh. 49In 1902, this hospital treated 11,720 pa- tients, which, given that the population of Chamba was then only6,000, supports the claim that, 'patients come in considerable num-bers from the out-lying parts of the State'. 50 The missionaries' medical efforts complemented those of Chamba state and in 1873 the Sham Singh hospital was taken over by theChurch of Scotland for a period. 51During that time Hutchinson ap-MISSIONARY MEDICINE AND THE RISE OF KALIMPONG 65pointed a member of the Brahmin caste, a Mr Basu, as a compounder in order to assuage the opposition that his report to the 1889 Centen-ary Conference hinted he faced from that most influential caste. 52 Hutchinson actually spent much of his time touring the district, ven- turing as far as the Moravian mission at Kyelang,53although the Church of Scotland authorities preferred his services as a physician to his itinerant preaching.54 The CSM mission eventually established its own Chamba dispensary and this proved almost as popular as the state hospital. In 1906 theSham Singh hospital attracted 9,729 new patients and 421 operationswere carried out there, while the CSM dispensary attracted 6,080 newpatients and carried out 383 operations. By that time, both institutes were separately funded, with the Chamba state Medical Department's costs being 12,520 rupees for the year 1906. 55 The popularity of their medical endeavours did enable the mission- aries to overcome opposition to their presence and allow them to estab-lish local church structures. They worked closely with the imperial gov-ernment in the western Himalayas, and also succeeded in gaining thesupport of the indigenous elites, rapidly in Chamba, more slowly inKashmir. Yet that elite support benefited neither the CSM nor the Mor- avians in their efforts to gain lasting access to Tibet, which remained their ultimate goal. Meanwhile, the London Missionary Society (LMS)were no more successful in their approaches to Tibet from Almora,where they established a mission in 1887. In 1890, Rev G.M. Bulloch and two local evangelists, including the medical missionary Tara Datt, travelled north from Almora to the trad-ing centres of Mansiari and Milam (which had a summer populationof ca. 3,000). There they ministered to the local traders, whose main economic ties were with western Tibet. From 1893, indigenous Chris- tian schoolteachers and medical missionaries established schools andtemporary dispensaries there every summer and from 1896, a series ofLMS female missionaries catered to the women there. The local medi-cal evangelist Babu Silong reported that he treated the unbelievablenumber of 12,000 patients during the summer of 1897, and that, withthe assistance of Miss Ethel Turner, 10,887 patients were treated thefollowing summer, principally 'accidents and ailments due to expo- sure'. 56Several of the European missionaries were able to use this chain of mission centres as a base for brief excursions across the bor- der, but just as the imperial government failed in its endeavours toopen Tibet via the western frontiers, so too were the missionaries un-able to make any headway from that direction. Towards the end of the19 thcentury, however, the efforts of both parties were refocused to- wards the eastern Himalayan approaches to Tibet.66 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINDarjeeling and the development of Kalimpong After the establishment of diplomatic relations with Nepal in the early 19thcentury, and the posting of a British Resident in Kathmandhu, the Government of India accepted Nepal's right to exclude Christian mis-sionaries. But a chain of mission stations was established along Nepal'ssouthern borders, and in the east, on territory occupied by the Nepa-lese state at the height of its expansion in the early 19 thcentury, the Government of Bengal established the town of Darjeeling. With itsneighbour Kalimpong, this centre became a major stepping-stone forboth political and missionary advances towards Tibet. Darjeeling was part of territory restored to Sikkim by the British after the Anglo-Nepalese war of 1814-16, but in 1829 the first imperialofficers to actually see it reported that it was the ideal location onwhich to establish eastern India's first hill station. It was also consid-ered of strategic value as the key to a pass to Nepal, and the British de-termined to annex it. In 1835, the ruler of Sikkim was given a tokensum of 3,000 rupees per annum as compensation for ceding the terri-tory and the British then began to develop Darjeeling, which became aNon-Regulation District under the Government of Bengal. From a po- pulation of approximately 100 in 1835, it grew to over 10,000 people by 1849 57and provided, as Alastair Lamb stated, 'a constant reminder' of nearby Tibet.58 In its early years as a hill station, Darjeeling attracted an indepen- dent Baptist missionary, the Rev William Start, who arrived in 1841and founded the Darjeeling Mission, aimed at the local Lepcha, 59Bhu- tia,60and Nepali populations. Start was joined by a German, Rev Carl Niebel, and in 1846 they published the Gospel of St Matthew in Lepcha, the first of a number of such Bible translations. Start retired in 1852,but Niebel carried on until his death in 1865, when an Anglo-IndianBaptist, the Rev J.C. Page, arrived and took over the mission until heleft the district in 1875. 61The Roman Catholics also established a pre- sence in Darjeeling after 1846 and a Jesuit mission was founded therein 1885. 62 Start and Niebel had made some efforts to introduce primary school education among the Lepchas,63but the initial educational emphasis in the Darjeeling district was aimed at Europeans and the children oflocal elites. Among the first schools established in Darjeeling was StPaul's High School, which was relocated from Calcutta in 1864, andwith the advent of the Jesuits, St Joseph's High School opened in1888. 64But it was the Church of Scotland Mission that were the fore- most initiators of primary schools in the region and although the Gov-ernment of Bengal did finance schools in the plains districts at the footof the Himalayas, in 1906 it was reported that the governmentMISSIONARY MEDICINE AND THE RISE OF KALIMPONG 67has had such confidence in the Mission ... that up till this year all the Government contributions to primary education ... havebeen entrusted to the Mission ... for it has been found that prac-tical solid educational work on broad lines has been obtained through the Mission at a minimum cost to Government. 65 As an imperial hill station serving the Government of Bengal, Darjeel- ing became a centre for various manifestations of imperial power andpresence, with permanent British residents, military cantonments,Christian churches, and libraries and schools on the European model.Yet despite the importance of medical understandings in the establish-ment of hill stations and the appointment of Dr. Archibald Campbell IMS as Superintendent of Darjeeling in 1839, the development of civil medical facilities there appears to have been slow. While the Army can-tonment medical facilities were available to Europeans and there appar-ently was an earlier government dispensary, 66the first medical institu- tion to be established in Darjeeling with inpatient facilities was theEden Sanitorium, opened in 1883. This was erected by the governmentat a cost of 200,000 rupees and named after the Bengal Governor SirAshley Eden, a prime mover in the development of Darjeeling. The 64- bed hospital was maintained (during the 1891-1912 period) at an an- nual cost of 40-50,000 rupees. 67While originally intended as a conva- lescent home for Europeans and Eurasians, the Sanatorium increas-ingly served as a hospital, 68catering to the hill stations' many visitors. It attracted a steady flow of patients; annual admissions varied between349 and 507 patients during the years 1891-96, and between 109 and159 operations were carried out annually. 69 The Lowis Jubilee Sanitorium for Indian patients was opened in 1887, but in contrast to the government-financed hospital for Eur-opeans and Eurasians, this establishment owed its origins to an initialdonation of 90,000 rupees from Maharaja Gobind Lal Roy of Rangpur(a Bengal district adjacent to Bhutan), with additional funds raised bypublic subscription and the land provided by the Maharaja of CoochBehar. Their patronage may be explained by the fact that both Mahara-jas had benefited from the British imperial presence. There had been aBritish representative in the trading centre of Rangpur since at least the time of Warren Hastings, and it was Hastings who had ensured the restoration of the throne of Cooch Behar after a Bhutanese incur-sion. While the L.J. Sanitorium was maintained by the Government of Bengal, the annual provision for the 118 bed hospital, which treatedaround 650 inpatients per annum, was only 25,000 rupees. 70The fi- nancial disparity between the two institutions is notable; roughly twice68 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINas many Indian patients were treated at around half the cost of patients in the European-Eurasian hospital. While a small number of beds at these two institutions were reserved for charity cases, both charged patients fees. Universal free medicine does not seem to have been available there until the opening in 1888 of a third institution, the Victoria Memorial Dispensary, in ef-fect the Darjeeling Municipal hospital. Funded by both governmentand private donors, it originally had facilities for 45 inpatients and by1903 this figure had increased to 70. In 1905, when Darjeeling had apopulation of between 17 to 24,000, depending on the season, the hos-pital treated over 10,000 outpatients, with 390 operations carried outthere. 71 Missionaries were not a significant influence in Darjeeling. The local elites were Europeans and the Christian churches were primarily con-cerned with the European and Eurasian Christian communities. But in1866, the Darjeeling district was expanded to include areas newly an-nexed from Bhutan. While primarily comprised of the Duars, this newterritory also included the Lepcha hamlet of Kalimpong. Situated on aridge at a height of around 4,000 feet, some 30 miles from Darjeeling,Kalimpong was to become the centre of missionary activities in this re- gion, while Darjeeling remained the political centre. The differing char- acter of Darjeeling and Kalimpong was summed up by an Americanobserver in the early 1920s: Darjeeling is essentially an official post, and there the mission-aries play a very minor and subdued part even in the social lifeof the place. In Kalimpong, on the other hand ... the mission-aries reign supreme. All the important buildings belong to the Scotch [sic ] Presbyterian mission, which also owns large tracts of land in the district. The senior missionaries, therefore, form the local aristocracy, overawing even the British-Indian officials; andDr. Graham, the head of the mission, is the uncrowned king ofKalimpong, the arbiter and dispenser of justice even to thosenot inside the Christian fold. 72 Kalimpong was not a traditional centre of trade, nor was it of any stra- tegic importance, and its early development as a missionary centre - indeed as a town - was due to the efforts of one man; Rev WilliamMacfarlane. Born at Strathbraan in Perthshire in 1840 and educated atSt Andrews University, Macfarlane was first sent by the Church of Sco-tland's Foreign Missionary Committee to Bodh Gaya, in what is nowBihar, where he remained from 1865 until that mission closed in 1870.In Bodh Gaya Macfarlane met several Lepcha youths who had beensent to the church orphanage there by a tea planter in Darjeeling. AfterMISSIONARY MEDICINE AND THE RISE OF KALIMPONG 69the difficulties of mission work among urban Hindus, he was im- pressed by the Lepcha's 'more child-like simplicity in receiving theteaching of Christ.' 73Accompanying the youths to their homelands in June 1870, Macfarlane travelled through the district and recorded that, 'there is a place called Kalimpong [which] will be a suitable place to open a new station of the church among the Lepchas.'74 Obtaining a transfer to Darjeeling, where he apparently worked with Page to develop Start and Niebel's initiatives at the mission there, Mac-farlane soon began to focus on Kalimpong. With financial supportfrom both the Bengal government and local tea planters, he opened asmall school there in 1873 and erected the first mission buildings thefollowing year. 75Within three years of his arrival in the district Macfar- lane had established 25 primary schools with a total roll of 615 maleand female pupils. Most significantly in our context, Macfarlane, hav-ing raised over \u00a3 2,000 in supporting funds, then established a Train-ing Institute at Darjeeling in 1886. 76 While this Institute was primarily designed to prepare Lepcha Chris- tians to preach in Sikkim, it was also intended to train schoolteachers.Within months the Institute was moved to Kalimpong and by the endof 1887 it had 36 students in residence. 77The Kalimpong Institute be- came a highly significant centre for the dissemination not only ofChristianity, but also of Western modernity through education. An in-dication of its influence was that by the end of the century eleven of itsgraduates were teaching over 300 pupils in Sikkim, 78and until well into the 20thcentury a disproportionate number of Christians were employed in this region as teachers and as medical compounders79fol- lowing training in Kalimpong. Mission histories record that; From the early days the Kalimpong Mission was to be looked onas a mission with its sights set on the closed Buddhist countriesof Sikkim, Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet. It was hoped that some daythose countries ... would open their doors to missionary endea-vours and the Kalimpong Mission, right on the doorstep of eachof them, would be the springboard from which entry could bestbe launched. 80 It is notable that Macfarlane's educational initiatives coincided with theopening of a government school in Darjeeling in 1874. This was theBhutia Boarding School, which was intended to provide a body of Wes-tern-educated Tibetan-speaking youths to assist in future British con-tacts with Tibet. 81Imperial government and missionary educational in- itiatives towards Tibet thus coincided, and if there is no evidence ofany explicit links between their projects nor is there evidence of ten-sion between them. Government and missions shared aims and meth-70 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINods and benefited from each other's activities during this formative per- iod. The Church of Scotland Mission While there were a number of other missions established around theDarjeeling-Kalimpong region, 82the Church of Scotland Mission was the most significant group, not least in regard to medical work. Theywere part of a well-organised network controlled from Edinburgh. Theyhad an established career structure, with a starting salary of 3,500 ru-pees per annum, rising to 5,500 rupees after fourteen years service, and had free accommodation. After serving for 21 years, they were eli- gible for a pension of at least \u00a3100 a year, although those who chose tostay on and serve a 30-year term went on to receive 6,000 rupees ayear and retired on an annual pension of \u00a3200. In 1912, in implicit re-cognition of the improved health conditions in India, a 30-year termbecame standard. 83In the late-19thcentury these wages and conditions were adequate to support a comfortable middle-class lifestyle, both inIndia and in retirement. By way of comparison, the British Trade Agent in Yatung was appointed by the Political Department in 1908 on a sal- ary of around 5,000 rupees per annum, including an entertainment al-lowance. 84But with the declining value of the rupee and increasing costs of living, missionary salaries became increasingly inadequate inthe 20 thcentury. Before he first left Scotland in 1865, CSM missionary William Mac- farlane firmly believed that Christian missionaries should proclaim theGospel, and he insisted on being sent to India as an evangelist and not as a teacher. But practical experience of the difficulties of attracting converts convinced Macfarlane of the need for new approaches to reachthe indigenous peoples of India. 85A later missionary quoting his ac- count of taking medicines from Darjeeling to Kalimpong during a cho-lera outbreak in June 1876 refers to the medicine as 'part of the regularequipment of our mission pioneer', 86and Macfarlane himself de- scribed how, as a result of his efforts during that outbreak, local sentiments towards the Mission at this time underwent acomplete change. At first it was viewed with deep suspicion.Now they began to come daily in twenties and thirties for medi-cines. We were welcome in their houses, and allowed to readand pray where no one would previously have permitted us toenter. 87MISSIONARY MEDICINE AND THE RISE OF KALIMPONG 71Macfarlane's change of heart reflected the wider shift within mission- ary circles as to the best means of winning converts, but Macfarlane'sprimary concern was with schools rather than medicine. His major le-gacy was the Training Institute at Kalimpong, which was of immense significance for the future of education in the region. Medical struc- tures were only developed after his death in 1887, aged just 47. It wasJohn Graham and particularly his wife Katherine, a nurse, who were tobe the real pioneers of medical initiatives in the district. Graham, bornin London in 1861, grew up in Dunbartonshire, attended GlasgowHigh School, and took an MA at Edinburgh in preparation for the min-istry, later being awarded a doctorate in divinity. He and his family ar-rived in Kalimpong in April 1889. 88 Soon after their arrival, Mrs Graham started a girls' school89and then a small dispensary in the Kalimpong mission grounds. With thefinancial support of the Woman 's Guild in Scotland the 25 bed Char-teris hospital was built, named after the Edinburgh university professorwho had first inspired Graham with the missionary impulse. The foun-dation stone was laid by a local tea planter and mission patron in Octo-ber 1892 and the hospital was formally opened early in 1894. A quali-fied medical missionary, Dr. C.F. Ponder, arrived in August 1893 and is recorded as treating 1,588 patients in the temporary dispensary in Octo- ber 1893 alone. 90 Ponder had been a tea planter in Darjeeling district before returning to the UK to study medicine in Edinburgh, and was already equippedwith local language skills. He began training three local assistants soonafter his arrival, and in 1895, they passed their government examina-tions and received their compounder diplomas. That year Dr. Ponder'ssister, a missionary nurse, arrived to assist him and the new hospital treated 13,446 patients, including, it was proudly noted, a Sikkimese Buddhist monk. In 1897 a branch dispensary was opened in Pedongunder one of the compounders, and it treated 4,159 patients that year,with 21,918 treated in Kalimpong. 91Mrs Graham and Miss Ponder, who were assisted by a Bengali nurse, began nursing training aroundthis time. 92The Charteris hospital thus became the medical training centre in the district while the Kalimpong Institute continued to trainpreachers and teachers. The Charteris hospital drew on numerous sources of funding. In ad- dition to various Church of Scotland supporters in the UK, it receivedassistance from both the Government of Bengal and local sponsors,who included both European and indigenous tea planters and philan-thropists. 93Graham 's biographer noted that, 'Government was only too happy to permit the Charteris Hospital to be completely responsiblefor all medical care in the district.' 94But the government actually con- tributed half the cost of building the Charteris hospital and made an72 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINannual grant towards its expenses, as well as supplying housing and fi- nance for dispensaries such as the one at Pedong.95While the amounts involved were limited, Kalimpong was just a small town in a Bengaldistrict, and these official contributions must have owed something to Graham 's personal influence. The missionaries (and the imperial government), were keen to devel- op indigenous patronage for the medical establishments, just as they were to keen to indigenise education, medical practice, and Christianityitself. Each was an element in the culture they sought to implant. Pa-tronage of good works was certainly customary for rulers in Indic tradi-tion, and one example of this being applied to the new medical struc-tures was provided by the Bhutanese Prime Minister, who then resided in Kalimpong during the summer months. He endowed a bed in the Charteris hospital, while his sister 'also made large gifts'. 96But it was hoped that this tradition would be extended and take root among thenew middle classes who were seen as benefiting from the imperial pre-sence. In an 1895 Urdu/Hindi medical language handbook, written bya medical missionary, the selected phrases for use in dealing with In-dian patients included the plea; 'Rich Indians should help us morethan they do.' 97 Whether in a culturally acceptable extension of traditional practice or as a pragmatic response to British wishes, local figures did increasinglycement their alliance with imperial interests by contributing to mis-sionary educational and medical endeavours. We read, for example,that in 1904 a new dispensary was opened in Kalimpong bazaarfunded by Ram Chandra Mitra, a local supply and transport contractorwho held the British endowed title of Rai Bahadur. 98 Fund-raising was an important part of missionary activities. In India itself, while encouraging indigenous patronage and seeking to establishself-supporting local churches, missionaries also appealed to wider net-works of support among the European Christian community. In seek-ing to build the first (Macfarlane Memorial) Kalimpong church, Gra-ham, for example, sought contributions not only in Calcutta and Dar-jeeling but from as far away as Bombay and Bangalore. 99Their home countries were, however, the main target of missionary appeals and, asnoted, while on furlough they could spend much of their time touring mission supporters to raise funds; Macfarlane, for example, addressed 329 meetings while in Scotland in 1882-83! 100Successful missionaries tended to be successful fund-raisers; with household names such asDr. Livingstone attracting widespread support. Graham was one suchmissionary who had 'realised that money could be raised more quicklyfor God's work by gaining the interest of the influential andwealthy', 101and after his arrival, donations to the Kalimpong mission increased from \u00a3379 in 1889 to \u00a31,146 in 1896.102The level of influen-MISSIONARY MEDICINE AND THE RISE OF KALIMPONG 73tial people he cultivated is indicated by the fact that the foreword to his book was written by the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, Sir Charles El-liot. This need to attract funding meant that accounts of missionary activ- ities that were released to the public sphere were shaped to appeal todonors. While internal correspondence with the missionary societiesdealt frankly with problems, literature aimed at the public unsurpris-ingly articulated a vision of progress and glossed over difficulties. TheChristian religion did progress in Kalimpong district during the late19 thcentury; from the first baptism in 1874 the number of Christians rose to 1,386 by 1897.103But the great majority of converts were Lep- chas, or low-caste Nepali Hindus. Both here and in other parts of the Himalayas converts from the Tibetan Buddhist community were al- most unknown, as were converts from an elite class background.104 The need to appeal to supporters also meant that missionary litera- ture emphasised conversion and the development of the church, forthere remained a sense that that was the proper priority of mission-aries. Medical work was not emphasised, but located in the context ofconversion, explained as a means of overcoming 'superstition ' and at-tracting converts. Additional regulations laid down early in the 20 th century for medical missionaries in Kalimpong certainly appear to sug-gest lingering tensions over their role. It was decreed that: The Medical Missionary at Kalimpong shall make it his supremeduty to co-operate with his colleagues at Kalimpong in extendingChrist's Kingdom in the Guild Mission-field, and particularlyby means of his mission work in (1) the Charteris Hospital and(2) the Dispensaries. His medical work is ever to be used as a means of leading his patients to the knowledge of the Sa- viour. 105 The question of how closely the mission should be associated with theGovernment was also subject to debate; their differing interests wererecognised but the missionaries were well aware of the advantages ofcollaboration and it was decreed that: The question of co-operation with Government in medical workis left an open one, to be decided by the Medical Missionary andthe Kalimpong Local Mission Council after experience and dueconsideration of circumstances. Government work should, how-ever, not be allowed to be a hindrance to the purely Missionarywork, nor should it form a distraction to the Medical Missionaryin this work ... All fees received ... for medical work done for74 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINGovernment or private persons shall be passed through the Mis- sion Account Books ...106 The government, however, had little impact on Kalimpong at that time. It was the missionaries who had established the Training Institute and Charteris hospital and they were primarily responsible for Kalimpongbecoming the centre for the spread of Western medicine not only inthat district, but, as will be seen in succeeding chapters, to Sikkim andeven Bhutan. 107Yet they did enjoy the moral and financial support of the Bengal government, and were broadly acting within its interests. Dr. Ponder departed in 1898 and was succeeded by a succession of missionary doctors as the Charteris hospital was gradually improved, with an operating theatre added around 1904,108and a leprosy hospital added soon after.109The hospital attracted a growing number of patients, as indicated by the following statistics from the 1903-13 peri- od:110 Table 1.1 Charteris Hospital Attendance, 1903-1913 Year Inpatients Outpatients Operations performed 1903 292 13,995 147 1904 298 16,291 148 1905 323 18,569 156 1906 [Not given] -- 1907 472 13,399 1909 338 17,868 - 1910 331 15,924 264 1913 547 18,219 286 The Charteris hospital remained the district centre of medical activitiesthroughout the colonial period and provided training to many medicalstaff who later served in Sikkim, Bhutan and Tibet. But with the Brit-ish political advance into Sikkim in 1888-89, Kalimpong and Darjeel-ing ceased to be at the forefront of the either Christian or biomedical advance towards Tibet, and in the next chapter our narrative thus moves to follow the developments in Sikkim. However, the Kalimpong missionaries never lost hope that they would be able to use medicine to lead the Christian advance into Tibet.A new initiative came in as late as 1930, when an Australian CSMmedical missionary, Dr. R.B. Knox, established the 'Tibetan Dispensary'at the 11 thmile district of Kalimpong. That area was primarily popu- lated by the growing numbers of Tibetan traders involved in the woolMISSIONARY MEDICINE AND THE RISE OF KALIMPONG 75trade, for which Kalimpong had become the centre. The new dispen- sary attracted 2,328 and 2,220 outpatients in 1931 and 1932, respec-tively (all of whom were given Christian tracts), and its success wasfurther indicated by the fact that Tibetan traders and visitors to Kalim- pong became major donors to the Kalimpong medical institutions pro- viding for them. 111But while the number of patients increased, the missionary presence in Kalimpong gradually declined in the years lead-ing up to Indian Independence. While the 11 thmile Dispensary func- tioned until the 1970s, by that time the Tibetan population haddwindled and most patients were Nepali. 112 Having served the local community for more than 80 years, the Charteris hospital, with the exception of the surgical ward, was finally demolished in 1972. A World Bank funded replacement was built, which passed to Indian government control in August 1973. By thattime just one medical missionary, Dr. J.C. Duncan, remained in thetown the missionaries had built; none remain today. 113Both medicine and Christianity have been entirely indigenised there. Dr. Shelton and the eastern Tibetan frontier While the missionaries in the northeastern frontier districts of Indiacontinued to hope for access to Tibet from their base in Kalimpong,other missionary groups established themselves on Tibet's easternfrontier with China. The earliest group appear to have been the FrenchCatholics previously referred to, and in around 1897 they were joinedby the China Inland Mission, which established a centre at Tachien-lu. 114While the missionaries hoped to proselytise in Tibet, most of their converts in this region were actually Chinese or mixed race, andseeing Chinese control over Tibet as their best chance of being able toevangelise there, the missionaries tended to ally themselves with theChinese authorities (some of whom were Christians). In a region oftenbeyond effective control of either the Chinese or Tibetan government,few missionaries were able to avoid a degree of political involvement.But some went further and actively engaged in espionage and otherquestionable activities in support of what they saw as missionary inter- ests in the triumph of the imperial powers over Tibet. 115 As had been the case in India, evangelical efforts had little success on the eastern Tibetan frontier, and medical work came to be an impor- tant activity. Perhaps because he was the only qualified surgeon, themost significant medical missionary on this frontier was probably theAmerican, Dr. Albert Shelton. 116Born in Indiana in 1875, Shelton grew up in Kansas and after graduating from Kentucky University medicalschool he joined the Foreign Christian Missionary Society, sailing to76 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINChina with his wife in 1903. After five years at Tachienlu, Shelton es- tablished a mission further west at Batang in 1908.117 Shelton, like Dr. Graham in Kalimpong, was a successful fund-raiser who sought to gain local elite support for his work while also appealing to American sponsors. Fortuitously, his first patient was a local digni- tary with a needle stuck in his hand.118Shelton removed it painlessly using local anaesthetic, and throughout his career he was careful to es-tablish good ties with local authorities, whether government officials orbandit chiefs. He also displayed the initiative of the ideal frontiersman;when smallpox broke out in 1918, Shelton made his own vaccine, test-ing it on himself before successfully vaccinating 1,200 people in Ba-tang despite local monastic opposition. 119 His most notable achievement was the construction of a hospital in Batang, which opened in July 1917; 'a near-incomprehensible expres-sion of Western technology ..... a temple of western medicine, the onlymedical facility for a region the size of California.' 120Named (as was becoming characteristic of biomedical hospitals in the Indo-Tibetanworld) in honour of a patron, Susan M. Diltz, the hospital was a three-storey building of rammed earth. It had beds for more than 50 pa-tients, the first of whom was an old man who broke both legs when he fell off the balcony at the opening ceremony. 121In an attempt to over- come local opposition to his work and shed light on Western medical practice, Shelton 's operating theatre had glass walls so that all comerscould see what he was doing, an initiative that attracted largecrowds. 122 The hospital flew the American flag to indicate when Shelton was available and it attracted both Chinese and Tibetan patients.123But while Shelton was successful enough to be able to charge those who could afford it for their treatment, it is difficult to gauge the medical impact of his work. He was apparently a fairly reluctant physician whokept short clinical hours and was frequently absent because he wastouring, with evangelical and language work taking most of his time.However, he did train eight local assistants in the hope some wouldsucceed him, although there is no record of their fate. 124He recog- nised, however, that while called upon to treat sword cuts, brokenbones, and gunshot wounds, in cases of fever and suchlike the local people regarded their own treatments as efficacious, 125and he also found that while the Tibetans might accept his medicine, they would not accept Christianity. His experiences were thus very similar to thoseof missionaries on the Indo-Tibetan frontier. Shelton did become widely known in Tibet. Consumed by the dream of reaching Lhasa, where he hoped to train young Tibetans in simplemedical practices, 126he received what he interpreted as an invitation from the Dalai Lama in August 1919. But the wording of the letter wasMISSIONARY MEDICINE AND THE RISE OF KALIMPONG 77ambiguous, and when Shelton attempted to use it to reach Lhasa in 1922 he was soon turned back by the Tibetan authorities. He was thenkilled, apparently by bandits, on the return journey. 127While the Ba- tang hospital continued under a fellow medical missionary, the mis- sion itself declined after Shelton 's death, and the hospital was de- stroyed in Sino-Tibetan fighting in 1932.128Ultimately, Shelton left no apparent long-term medical impact, though he had clearly spread theknowledge of biomedicine in the region. Conclusions Following the establishment of a European hill station in Darjeeling,which became the local political centre, the Church of Scotland mis-sionaries developed the town of Kalimpong and were primarily respon-sible for the introduction and establishment of Western medicinethere. In the absence of government structures, the Kalimpong mis-sionaries were effectively the local administrators. Through the devel-opment of schools they produced a body of youths, initially mostlyChristian converts, who went on to be trained at the Kalimpong Insti- tute in church ministry or teaching and as compounders at the Char- teris hospital. These medical personnel were subsequently employed atmission and government dispensaries throughout northeastern Indiaand in Sikkim and later Bhutan, contributing to the development andindigenisation of Western medicine in those regions. These developments resulted from a conjunction of three processes in the missionary and the wider world, as noted in the Introduction.Firstly, by 1870, when Macfarlane began the CSM's activities there, missionary organisations were recognising the very limited results ob- tained by purely evangelical activities and increasingly turning to edu-cation and medicine as a means to reach those who had proved imper-vious to the evangelical message. Secondly, new scientific understand-ings of disease causation meant that Western medicine was becomingincreasingly distinct from, and more efficacious than, indigenous med-ical practices, thus offering the missionaries a more powerful tool withwhich to propagate Christianity. Finally, the political and geographical advances of the imperial government in the 1870-1905 period were in- creasingly directed towards Tibet, allowing the missionaries to enterand evangelise the lower Himalayan territories in the wake of thenorthern advance. The missionaries foresaw the imperial penetration of Tibet and be- lieved that they would continue to follow the imperial flag. Totally con-vinced of the righteousness of their cause, they saw themselves as, 'theshock troops of a thriving church reaching out the hand of Christian78 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINbrotherhood to the conquered'.129Such military metaphors were in common use - Graham described medical missions as 'the Church's sappers and miners'130- and the missionary advance towards Tibet took on the mantle of a siege in the words of another contemporary mission chronicler: This apparently impregnable Gibraltar of modern missions is now invested on all sides but one, and the siege is being prose-cuted with vigour by several societies, working independently ofone another, but directed by a common aim and all cheered bythe not distant hope of scaling the impenetrable walls and gain-ing the confidence of the people. 131 Although missionaries recognised that their interests did not alwayscoincide with those of government, the willingness of officialdom to al-low them to take responsibility for organising public health and educa-tion in places such as Chamba and Kalimpong must have given themconfidence that they would fulfil a similar role in Tibet. They had pro-vided services that were in the interests of the government without thegovernment having to meet the full cost of them, while creating indi- genous Christian communities that were natural support bases for the British Empire. But as the imperial presence advanced into the Hima-layas the missionaries were left behind. As will be seen, their presencein the Buddhist heartland was considered likely to be counter-produc-tive by influential frontier officials, and they were largely preventedfrom operating there. Ultimately, while the missionaries could callupon influential supporters at Home and in India, their relationshipwith the government was an unequal one, and when their interests di- verged, the missionaries were largely abandoned. While some missionaries seem to have been better than others at so- liciting government support, the missionaries relied heavily on dona- tions from supporters in the UK and European philanthropists in In-dia, and also sought patronage from local sources. While treatment re-mained free for the poor, grateful patients with sufficient means to paydid become an important source of income. This demonstrated thepossibility of self-supporting medical institutions, but most of the schools and hospitals established by the missionaries were eventually taken over by either the imperial, or post-1947 Indian Government,and patronage (while it does continue today), might thus be seen as anintermediate step between missionary and state medical provision. Missionaries targeted both elite and non-elite social groups. Converts were easier to find among the lower classes, yet mass conversion wasdifficult to imagine without elite support and elite conversion was valu-able propaganda for the missions to use in their appeals for support. 132MISSIONARY MEDICINE AND THE RISE OF KALIMPONG 79But, although the Himalayan elites did adopt Western medicine and send their children to Western schools, those who converted were al-most invariably members of local minority and outcaste groups. 133 Thus most early converts in the Kalimpong region were Lepchas or members of the growing Nepali community, and these converts were among the earliest medical graduates at compounder level. But theelite groups soon began to perceive the advantages of Western educa-tion and medicine. Once satisfied that religious conversion would notbe enforced, they increasingly sought to place their children into train-ing institutes such as the Charteris Hospital. This situation prevailedthroughout the colonial period, and allowed the traditional elites toslowly reproduce more usual social patterns within biomedical struc- tures, something that may well have assisted its indigenisation. 134 While missionary medicine provided the initial impetus towards bio- medical development and accustomed people to Western medicine, pa- tients, as Rosemary Fitzgerald observed 'proved adept at disentanglingthe medical and evangelistic threads that were interwoven in medicalmissionary work'. 135The adoption of biomedicine brought neither mass conversion, nor, as will be seen, did it eliminate the indigenousmedical world. Initial missionary optimism over the impact of Western medicine proved unjustified, but with the 20 thcentury decline of evan- gelical fervour, educational and medical works continued to be seen as appropriate Christian activities. There was a decline in explicit empha-sis on either the likelihood or the desirability of immediate conversionas a result of both practical experience and increasing understandingof Asian religion and society. In a series of studies (see bibliography), John Bray has identified cer- tain themes common to the various missionary groups around Tibet. He has highlighted the fact that they required the protection of the European powers, (and of the Chinese government in regard to easternTibet), in return for which they provided a range of benefits to the gov-ernment. The provision of educational and medicinal services to the in-digenous peoples also included information and intelligence. He hasalso highlighted the point that while close personal relations were es-tablished between Christian missionaries and individuals in HimalayanBuddhist societies, those individuals were selective with regard to the aspects of missionary offerings that they wished to adopt. Schools and hospitals were generally accepted, the Christian religion was generallynot. Ultimately, the missions were identified with foreign power, andthat fatally weakened their efforts to contest the indigenous socialpower and influence enjoyed by the Buddhist monasteries. It wouldseem that even the indigenisation of Christianity made little differencein this situation; in the absence of elite converts, the social status of80 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINthe indigenous Christians was not sufficient to provide leadership or to challenge existing hierarchies. In regard to the character of the missionaries, Douglas Wissing has concluded on the basis of work on the eastern Tibet missions that, although; 'Christianity was central to their worldview, missionary vo- lunteers were seldom religious zealots. Rather they were often enthu-siastic young people who were attracted to an exciting life in a far-offland.' 136His work draws attention to the extent to which missionaries were liable to become preoccupied with other activities; exploring, ser-ving as guides and interpreters for other travellers, collecting and trad-ing in artefacts and cultural relics - or even horses and guns - and act-ing as spies and political intermediaries. 137 Taken in conjunction with the evidence of a number of missionaries who became psychiatrically disturbed or began to act contrary to mis-sionary norms, 138we may conclude that missionaries, medical or other- wise, lived in conditions of considerable mental and physical stress.Not only were they exposed to isolation, danger and physical hardship,but both their failures to win substantial numbers of converts and thecomplexities of their cultural encounter with indigenous faiths mustalso have induced doubts in the minds of many over the value of their missions. Extreme behaviour was a manifestation of those stresses. Ul- timately the missionaries were a group of diverse individuals looselybound together by shared faith and, in most cases in the Himalayanmissions, a vision of evangelising Tibet. Their reactions to circum-stances naturally varied widely. In some senses, however, missionaries fit into an established social archetype in Himalayan society. The figure of the religious renunciate(sannya \u00afsi) arriving from some far-off place and settling among a parti- cular community was a common one there. Hindu and Buddhist re-nunciate frequently settled near a community and gradually built asmall shrine while ministering to and being supported by that commu-nity. Such figures were expected to act in a moral fashion, to advise in-dividuals on both worldly and spiritual matters, and to have some com-mand of the healing arts. The more they lived up to the ideal and thebetter they performed their ministry, the more they were supportedand admired. 139 Christian medical missionaries could be located and accepted in that traditional context. The understanding of the extent of Christian mis-sionaries' renunciation actually grew as the differentials between Eastand West became more widely known and missionaries were seen ashaving given up a great deal in order to help others. 140Missionaries living up to the ideal and fitting this traditional model could therefore,be widely admired in their community. In making concessions to localpractices and understandings, they could increase that support and of-MISSIONARY MEDICINE AND THE RISE OF KALIMPONG 81ten transform opposition into at least ambivalence. Missionaries often developed more ecumenical views and a few even completed a personaljourney that transformed them into Hindus (although not, apparently,Buddhists). 141But even Christians such as Ferguson and Hutchinson in Chamba, and Macfarlane and Graham in Kalimpong could be as clo-sely associated with a Himalayan district in popular memory as indi-genous religious practitioners. To achieve that status, however, a missionary not only had to live up to behavioural and moral standards, but also to survive. Illness and pre-mature death were constant companions. Not only did the missionariesdie, so too did their wives and children. In Kalimpong alone in the per-iod 1870-1910, aside from the premature death of Macfarlane, the dead included his early companion Duncan Campbell; and later a nurse, Jeannie Campbell; along with the Rev T.E. Taylor; a schoolteacher, LilyWaugh; and children of both Rev Mackenzie and Dr. Ponder. Dedica-tion was thus characteristic and it remained so. In the 1950s, for exam-ple, the Jesuit William Mackey had all his teeth pulled out before heleft for Bhutan, knowing he would have no access to a dentist there. 142 This dedication to service, and high standards of professional perfor- Grave of Rev. William Macfarlane, founder of the Church of Scotland Mission, Kalimpong82 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINmance and ethics were instilled in those trained by the missionaries and remain an acknowledged legacy of their presence. Ultimately, however, missionary medicine was a paradoxical weapon. While it was initially a powerful means for gaining access to the local communities and was one of a number of factors attracting converts, the teaching and training processes which the missionaries institutedled to the indigenisation of biomedicine. Once that process of indigen-isation took root, biomedicine ceased to be a significant means of at-tracting converts as it became clear that its power did not derive from,or require belief in, Christianity. By the mid-20 thcentury, a religious context to biomedicine had been indigenised, with Himalayan Budd-hists taking up biomedical practice with the understanding that it was a good Buddhist practice; that fited in with the 'right livelihood' re- quirement of the historical Buddha's 'Eightfold Path ' to enlightenment.MISSIONARY MEDICINE AND THE RISE OF KALIMPONG 832 Sikkim: Imperial Stepping-stone to Tibet The introduction of biomedicine to Sikkim provides a number of con- trasts to the rather ad hoc processes that occurred in the Kalimpong- Darjeeling and western Himalayan areas. The Buddhist state's reluc-tance to admit European missionaries into its realm restricted their in- fluence on medical development in Sikkim. Missionary medicine was still a significant force in the first two decades of British rule, and Ka-limpong-trained local staff played a major role in spreading biomedi-cine from the dispensaries there. But the missionaries were not able todominate medical initiatives in this Himalayan state as they had in Ka-limpong. Instead it was the Indian Political Department's appointees,the Sikkim Political Officers and their medical staff, who played thekey role. Sikkim was, however, primarily of importance to British India as the gateway to Tibet, and little finance - or effort - was devoted to develop-ing it. Under the Princely state system, Sikkimese medical develop-ments were largely funded from state revenue and the medical officersposted there were not of the highest status. But Sikkim did in manyways provide a model which the British hoped the Tibetans wouldemulate, not least in the medical sphere. It was a secure and stablestate, where steadily growing numbers of Sikkimese resorted to biome- dicine. There was no apparent resistance to the new system, and its structures and personnel were so rapidly indigenised that within twodecades of the introduction of biomedicine, Sikkimese medical staffwere being employed in British dispensaries in Tibet. Sikkim, which became the 22 ndstate of India on 26 April 1975, is si- tuated on the northern border of the Darjeeling district of Bengal. It se-parates the kingdoms of Nepal to the west from Bhutan to the east,while to its north and north-east is what is now the Tibetan Autono- mous Region of China. Lying on the main trade route from Calcutta to Lhasa via the Chumbi Valley, Sikkim today occupies an area of 7,096square kilometres, ranging in elevation from 300 to 8540 metres. Itshighest point is the summit of Kangchenjunga, the third highestmountain in the world, and with much of the territory consisting ofsteep, jungle-covered inclines or snow-covered mountains, only 20% ofits total area is considered habitable. 1The earliest known inhabitants of Sikkim were the Lepcha and Lim- bu tribes, but from at least the 13thcentury onwards Tibetans began to migrate southwards into Sikkim. Often referred to as 'Bhutias' but more correctly known as the Lhopo,2they came to form the bulk of the elite class. In the 17thcentury, refugee monks of the Nyingma sect of Tibetan Buddhism founded a kingdom there, enthroning PhuntsogNamgyal as Chogyal ('Maharaja' or 'King') in 1642. This dynasty ruledSikkim until 1975, 3but their power gradually declined as a result of Nepali immigration, which began in 18714and accelerated under Brit- ish influence. People of Nepali origin now form a majority of the 1997population of 406,457, 5but in 1891 Sikkim was home to just 30,458 people.6Among that number was John Claude White, the British re- presentative in Gangtok who was appointed to the newly created postof Political Officer Sikkim in May 1889. 7 British relations with Sikkim began as a consequence of the East In- dia Company's rivalries with the growing power of the Nepalese stateand they developed as a consequence of the British interest in openingTibet. In 1815, British forces entered Sikkim, much of which had beenconquered by the Gurkhas in 1788-89, and gained Sikkimese supportagainst Nepal in return for the restoration of their rulers and much of their lost land. By the time of the Treaty of Titalia in 1817, imperial in- fluence over Sikkim 's foreign relations was formally acknowledged inreturn for British protection against Nepal. After 1835, when the reluc-tant Chogyal was persuaded to cede the Darjeeling hill tract to the Brit-ish, relations between the two powers deteriorated, culminating in Brit-ish forces again entering Sikkim in 1861. The Sikkimese were forced tosign a treaty that gave the British increased access to Sikkim, andforced to agree to assist in the building of roads up to the Tibetan fron- tier. In return, the Chogyal received an annual British subsidy. While Sikkim remained free of resident British officials, imperial influenceon Sikkim henceforth increased. But indigenous opposition to the Brit-ish grew and to the north the Tibetans became increasingly concernedby the expansionist European power to the south. In the Tibetan understanding, Sikkim was a state within its sphere of influence, and numerous religio-political and cultural links existedbetween the aristocracies of the two states; the Sikkimese rulers, for ex- ample, traditionally took Tibetan brides. Threatened by the northward advance of British power, the Tibetans finally acted in 1886. Theymoved troops to the frontier and fortified a position which in the Brit-ish understanding was in Sikkim. After lengthy negotiations failed, theBritish assembled a force termed the 'Sikkim Expedition ', which ex-pelled the Tibetans in March 1888. The Chinese, who claimed Tibetand thus Sikkim as part of their empire, then entered into talks withthe British over the status of this frontier. These talks between the Brit-86 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINish and the Chinese (without Tibetan or Sikkimese participation) cul- minated in the Sikkim-Tibet Convention of March 1890, which definedthe border and confirmed British authority over Sikkim. In terms of size and population, Sikkim did not actually warrant a permanent British Resident. In the western Himalayas, 30 states, sev-eral larger and more populous than Sikkim, were then grouped to-gether administratively as the Punjab Hill States under a single Resi-dent. But a Political Officer was posted to Sikkim because of its strate-gic significance 8and its potential role as a 'stepping-stone' to Tibet. White, a Public Works Department engineer in Darjeeling, had beenthe Bengal Political Officer A.W. Paul's deputy on the Sikkim campaignand with Paul involved in the Anglo-Chinese negotiations, White was appointed to the Sikkim post and stayed on until his retirement in 1908. At that time Sikkim did not have a fixed state capital in the Eur-opean sense, with the politico-religious authority of the state repre-sented by the Chogyal's palaces at Gangtok and Tumlong and the net-work of Sikkim 's 36 monasteries. 9Having located a suitable plot of land on which to build a Residency, which was near to (and above!),the palace at Gangtok, White effectively created Gangtok as the perma-nent capital of Sikkim. While he was the dominant figure in this period of Sikkimese his- tory, White was not highly regarded even by his employers. Thoughserving on the Younghusband mission as nominal second-in-com-mand, and later given official charge of British relations with Bhutanand Tibet in addition to Sikkim, he was mistrusted by Viceroy Curzonand effectively ignored in regard to policy. That he was allowed to re-main in Sikkim suggests the state's insignificance to the imperialgovernment. White acted there, as one observer put it, 'like a little God'. 10He treated the Sikkimese ruler abominably, exiling him from his capital for a number of years, and his successor as Political Officer admitted that: There can be little doubt that our relations with Sikkim weremismanaged at this time; too little tact the ... [in Bhutan and Tibet] people said 'Sik-kim mud'. 11 a Durbar ('Ruling Council' or 'Assembly of Ministers'), thathe appointed White effectively ruled Sikkim; as he putit, 'everything was in my hands', and the Durbar's insignificance is un-derlined by the fact that it did not meet at all in 1905-06. 12But he had very little support there in terms of finance or manpower and Sikkimstate was impoverished and lacking in most of the structures of mod-ern government. In 1889, there were no police, courts, or public works,SIKKIM :IMPERIAL STEPPING -STONE TO TIBET 87and no secular education or public health system. Imperial govern- ment subsidies for Sikkim were limited to 12,000 rupees per annum.This was originally paid to the Chogyal, but after his banishment byWhite the subsidy went 'towards the expense of management of the State by a British officer' 13; meaning White used the money as he chose.14 To counter the shortage of state funds, White initiated revenue-rais- ing measures to obtain the finance necessary to create state structures. A land revenue settlement was made, forestry excise measures were in-troduced and, acting through the Durbar that he dominated, Whitewas able to introduce the unpopular measure of increasing immigra-tion from Nepal in order to expand the tax base and raise agricultural production. Within a decade, Sikkim state revenue had increased from just over \u00a3500 to \u00a3150,000 per annum. 15This income enabled White to begin instituting the development of state structures on the Britishmodel and to encourage the introduction of modernity by financingthe education of Sikkimese youths in British India. Although White praised his office staff and their 'efficiency and good order', 16his correspondence was invariably tardy and his record-keep- ing was poor.17It appears, however, that the first expenditure on medi- cal matters from the Sikkim budget came in 1895-96; 1,330 rupeeswere allocated, presumably to build the civil dispensary that opened inGangtok the following year, when 974 rupees were spent on its upkeepand 145 rupees for 'sanitation '. 18White's role here is uncertain. He noted in his memoirs that he was responsible for all of the depart-ments - police, education, revenue, and so on - normally under thecharge of a specialist imperial officer and staff, 19but he does not men- tion public health, where White did, at least initially, have the assis- tance of a European medical officer. On the Sikkim Expedition, which remained in the field from January 1888 to January 1890, a Surgeon-Major R.H. Carew was attached to the British forces and a Surgeon Major G.H. Peevor was in charge ofthe Native Field Hospital. 20The biggest health problem the mission faced was not with men, but with the mules, up to half of which fellill. 21The Army had expected harsh conditions and ordered that only those 'capable of standing continuous hard work and exposure in a cold climate' were to be selected for the mission.22Imperial battle ca- sualties were light,23and although there is no record of the military providing medical services to the local peoples, the mission doubtless treated Tibetan battle casualties and local 'conscripted' labourers as wellas Indian troops and their British officers. When White first took up his post in Gangtok, the military medical staff who had served on the Sikkim campaign remained there on activeduty, now under the command of Dr. J.K. Close. 24After the departure88 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINof the bulk of the Expedition, a Surgeon-Captain Dr. D.G. Marshall25 was posted to Gangtok in 1891 to act as White's medical officer, and he was replaced the following year by Surgeon Captain Dr. A.W.T. Buist-Sparks. 26In Gangtok until at least 1895.28There is no record of any European physician having replaced Ewen, and it seems likely that anIndian-trained medical assistant served in the Gangtok dispensary. By1905 it was certainly under the control of the hospital assistant H.N.Mitra, who remained there for some years. 29 These medical officers were the first Western physicians to reside in Sikkim, and given that two of them later reached the rank of Lieute-nant-Colonel, and that Marshall had topped the examinations in his in- take, they must have been among the better-than-average physicians in the imperial service. Yet there is little evidence of their making anygreat impact on the medical world of Sikkim and it is likely that theirservices were given only to the army and to White and his staff. WithWhite effectively exiling the Chogyal from Gangtok until late 1895, itwas impossible to implement the usual imperial medical strategy offirst impressing the ruling elites. Certainly in 1892, the Chogyal's two-year old daughter treated indi- genous 'propitiatory rites, such as burning of incense', when very ill. 30 The early physicians did endure primitive conditions. White refers to an unnamed medical officer and his wife in this period, 'who lived in a two-roomed hut built of wattle and dab' [sic ], where their wooden furni- ture was liable to sprout in the rainy season!31The civil dispensary that opened in Gangtok in 1896-97 must have been very basic, given thateven in the 1960s a Sikkim dispensary was described as; 'usually ...housed in small sheds. Half of the space is occupied by the medicine racks and table for dispensing. The remaining portion with a partition wall is being utilised by the compounder as his residence.' 32However, such crude structures were only remarkable by European standardsand their very simplicity may have encouraged patient resort. R.C. Cro-zier has noted that in China, the 'humble buildings and crude wardsof the early hospitals probably helped by not intimidating simple pea-sants with an alien and too antiseptic environment.' 33 Biomedicine did make some irregular progress in these early years as the daily average number of patients at the Gangtok dispensary de-monstrates: 34SIKKIM :IMPERIAL STEPPING -STONE TO TIBET 89Table 2.1 Daily average attendance, Gangtok clinic Year Daily average attendance 1896-97 6.5 1897-98 7.4 1898-99 7.4 1899-1900 5.9 1900-01 5.3 1901-02 12.8 The sudden increase in 1901-02 is difficult to account for though it may be a rise related to the regional smallpox epidemic of 1900. But inJune 1902, another state dispensary was opened in Chidam, 35and around this time a third dispensary opened at Rungpo. The latter wasunder the charge of the Public Works Department, suggesting White,following a common imperial officer's administrative strategy of divert-ing funds allocated for one department to another, more needy area,was able to use PWD funds for medical purposes. Before proceedingfurther, however, we may consider the existing indigenous medical si-tuation in Sikkim. Sikkimese traditional medicine Sikkim in the 19 thcentury lacked any state health structures as was the case elsewhere in the Himalayas. There was also no distinct or system- ised medical tradition that might be termed 'Sikkimese medicine',36or any institutionalised centre for the dissemination of medical knowl-edge. Instead, there existed a wide range of healing practices and un-derstandings, many of which were associated with particular commu- nities. The Lhopo aristocracy (who made up the bulk of the monastic population), had access to the wider Himalayan medical traditionknown as sowa rigpa, which was practised there by monks and less commonly by amchis . 37These practitioners were often trained in Tibet, or followed Tibetan lineages of instruction. But in rural areas, whereeven today 90% of the population still resides, 38such knowledge was less accessible and various forms of local healing were the primarytreatment option. Knowledge of medicinal herbs was widespread, while most villages had a bone setter who applied herbal treatment allied to the use of bamboo splints. 39Amulets against injury and disease were also common, along with charms and spells that are reminiscent ofthose in the Atharvavedic traditions of the Indian plains, 40although A\u00afyurvedic medicine was not known to have been practised there until more recently. As these latter devices suggest, understandings of disease causation among the various communities in Sikkim were generally linked to a90 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINbelief in supernatural intervention as a primary cause of human suffer- ing. Thus there existed a range of community or ethnically based ritualspecialists who operated in the religio-magical sphere to divine causa-tion and propitiate the illness-causing spirits. These included the Bong- thing orMuns of the Lepcha tribes and the Nepali Jankrispirit-med- iums (who became increasingly important figures in the Sikkimesemedical landscape as the Nepali population grew in the 20 thcentury41). But there were similar practitioners among the Sherpa communitiesand among the Lhopa, many of whom were non-elite villagers with 'avery limited understanding of Buddhism '. 42The Sikkimese seem to have moved easily between these various practitioners. One other prominent feature of medical practice among the Bud- dhist population of Sikkim was the emphasis on pilgrimage as a reme-dy for particular complaints. 43Pilgrimages were, and continue to be, undertaken to medicinal hot springs that are understood to be locatedwithin a Buddhist sacred landscape. 44 Missionary medicine in Sikkim The posting of a Political Officer in Gangtok marked a significant stepin the northern advancement of imperial power towards its ultimate re-gional goal, Tibet. It was also of considerable significance to Christianmissionaries, for whom expansion into Sikkim en route to Tibet was alogical consequence of their work in Kalimpong. But while a missionwas established in Sikkim soon after the establishment of Britishauthority there (just as it had been in places such as Ladakh, Chambaand Darjeeling), the advance into Sikkim demonstrated the Political Department's increasing reluctance to support Christian missionaries in their domains. In the wider context, the spread of Christian civilisa-tion was part of the ideological impetus behind the growth of Empire,but, in practice, a complex relationship existed between missionariesand imperial government agents in this region. Events in India - not least the 'Indian Mutiny' in 1857-58 - had de- monstrated the potentially disastrous consequences of policies and ac-tions affecting indigenous religious structures and practices. By the late 19 thcentury, Political Officers, even when they were practising Chris- tians themselves, recognised that missionaries were liable to disturb and radically change indigenous societies. While that might be accepta-ble in a 'tribal' society among groups such as the Lepcha who lackedwider political organisation or links to state and national identities, inwider society of frontier states such as Sikkim the missionaries' workcould create unwanted political instability. The presence of mission-aries was also strongly opposed by the local authorities and in acquies-SIKKIM :IMPERIAL STEPPING -STONE TO TIBET 91cing to their exclusion, the Political Officers strengthened the alliance of interests with those authorities. Thus, while the missionaries hadbeen the key agents behind the introduction of biomedicine in Kalim-pong, in Sikkim they found their efforts restricted by an alliance be- tween the Sikkimese authorities and the Government of India. The missionaries responded to those restrictions by making greater use of local Christians as medical missionaries, with important conse- quences in regard to the indigenisation of biomedicine. In the earlyyears, the missions were able to establish three of the first six biomedi-cal dispensaries in Sikkim and missionary medical efforts were onlysurpassed by government initiatives after the first decade of the 20 th century or even later. The first concrete step in the missionary approach to Sikkim came in 1880, when Rev William Sutherland arrived in Kalimpong to jointhe Church of Scotland mission and was allocated Sikkim as his parti-cular mission field. 45After several missionary visits to southern and eastern Sikkim, Sutherland travelled to the Chogyal's palace at Tum-long in 1883 to seek permission for a missionary to reside in Sikkim.But there was no response to his appeal or to a similar request fromRev William Macfarlane, who travelled through southern Sikkim in November 1885. 46The Sikkimese government were presumably wary of provoking further British intervention by restricting the movement of Europeans and thus reluctantly permitted missionaries to travel inSikkim, 47but held out against the permanent presence of Christians. Macfarlane encouraged another approach. The Lepchas, who were mainly followers of a 'Folk' religion, had proved amenable to conver-sion in Kalimpong district, 48and the new political borders had not ser- iously fractured their tribal structures. So he began to train Lepchas in Kalimpong to spread the Gospel among their fellow tribesmen in Sik- kim. The project had some success because in 1886 (when Macfarlanedied) there were 26 Christians in Sikkim and by 1888 their numbershad doubled. 49 But the Chogyal was unable to prevent the missionaries establishing a base in Sikkim in the new political conditions after the 1888 war.Gangtok itself remained out-of-bounds, but Sutherland selected a sitein Chidam, in southern Sikkim just a day's journey from Darjeeling, and a mission house was completed there in 1890. 50This was the same year that White moved into the new Residency in Gangtok and the significance of this symbolic convergence of imperial political andreligious power cannot have escaped the attention of the Sikkimese. Sutherland's initiative was supported by the Scottish Universities Mission (SUM) and was administratively separate from the CSM in Ka-limpong (while numerous individuals worked for both missions the in-terests of the two groups did not always coincide). 51The Reverend R.92 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINKilgour was the first of a series of Sikkim-based SUM missionaries, but like Sutherland he was an evangelist and not a medical missionary. During the 1880s, Sutherland had ascertained that while the Chogyal was opposed to Christian missions he was prepared to allow the establishment of schools in Sikkim - if these were staffed by indi- genous teachers. Local Christians who had been trained in Kalimpongwere thus employed and by the end of that decade they had foundedseven schools in southern Sikkim. In addition, many Sikkimese wereeducated at the CSM's Training Institute in Kalimpong; in 1891, for ex-ample, seventeen of the Institute's 37 students were Sikkimese. 52These initiatives produced a body of youths educated on the Western model,who were thus equipped to become the first generation of Sikkimese to serve in the new state institutions such as schools and medical dis- pensaries. The existence of this group was to be crucial to the establish-ment and indigenisation of biomedicine in Sikkim. The missionaries' efforts to gain a foothold in Gangtok continued to fail. An application for permission for the SUM to be allowed to movethere was made by the Political Officer Sikkim in 1901, but was not ap-proved by the Durbar. 53Given that White controlled the Durbar, it is clear that he did not favour a missionary presence in Gangtok (a con- clusion implied in his autobiography),54and he presumably made the request simply to satisfy local Christians. In 1910, Gangtok Christians themselves drew up a petition requesting that the Maharaja allow themto build a church there, but again without success. 55 After its initial florescence, Christianity seems to have made little impact in Sikkim, with the number of believers declining between 1913and 1922. 56The Church blamed the lack of progress on the 'manifest hostility' of the Chogyal's heir, Sidkeong Tulku, who was reportedly pressuring local landlords to close the mission schools.57But despite his early death, the hostile climate continued and when the Rev Mack- ean left Sikkim in January 1921, after a total of fourteen years there, itproved difficult to find a replacement for this apparently unpromisingposition. But Mackean, frustrated by the lack of progress, suggested anew means of stimulating the Sikkim missionary enterprise; he 'firmlybelieved a medical man would be best suited to be his successor'. 58 Mackean 's conclusion drew on his experience of the medical dispen- saries established in Sikkim. In 1901 he had described the mission-aries' main activities in Sikkim as 'evangelistic, educational, and voca-tional training', with no mention of medicine. 59But in 1897, the SUM had opened a medical dispensary at Chidam staffed by a compounder,Elatji Matiyas, a Lepcha convert to Christianity. 60That it was successful is indicated by the fact that by 1906 further dispensaries staffed by lo-cal Christian compounders had been opened at Rhenock, Seriyong,and Dentan. In 1906, dealt threeSIKKIM fol- lowed and by 1923-24 there were a total of eleven mission dispensaries in Sikkim, including one in Lachung in northern Sikkim opened bythe Scandinavian Alliance Mission, which established a base there with two female missionaries in 1894. 63 It appears that as in so many other regions, the missionaries discov- ered that medical services were the most effective way to reach the lo- cal populace. But whereas in Kalimpong there were Europeans in dailycharge of the biomedical facilities, in Sikkim virtually all of the dispen-saries - and the schools - were under indigenous control from thetime they were opened. While the indigenisation of Christianity (andits associated teaching and medical programmes), was the missionary ideal, in practice Europeans tended to retain charge of the missions they had established, with local converts restricted to managing periph-eral or isolated mission outposts. But the Sikkimese opposition to thepermanent presence of European Christians hastened the rise of indi-genous Christians to control over the church and its social institutions,and meant that Sikkimese were the primary agents and public face ofmissionary medicine there. In this early period, Sikkimese Christians educated on the Western model seem to have been 'generalists', who moved easily between postsas teachers, preachers, or compounders, while those who had not con-verted were similarly liable to be employed in a variety of posts, includ-ing the growing colonial and state government bureaucracy. 64After the initial period there was a growing specialisation typical of the processesof modernisation, and the move to state hegemony in regard to healthand education was reflected in the way in which government employ-ment began assuming greater status than employment among the mis- sions. There was thus a gradual reversion to traditional social norms within the state system, something that can be seen as part of the indi-genisation process along with the assumption of local control over re-cruitment, training programs, postings, and public health policies. After Mackean 's departure, a missionary willing to serve in Sikkim was eventually found; the Honourable Mary Scott. Just as the ReverendGraham assumed the David Livingston role in Kalimpong, so too did shefill the 'heroic' role in the histories of the Sikkim Church, with her arrival described as 'the most important watershed in the history of Christianity in Sikkim '. 65Born in Scotland in 1877, a daughter of the 8thLord Pol- warth, Miss Scott accompanied Rev Graham and his wife to Kalimpongin 1905 when they returned from home leave. She remained there foreighteen years and received the Kaisar-i-Hind medal for her medicalservices to villagers during epidemics such as the influenza outbreakof 1918-19. She was clearly a strong individual, one Political Officer re-ferred to her working, 'in what some of us considered to be 'insubordi-94 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINnate co-operation ' with the Church of Scotland Mission '.66Miss Scott eventually offered to fill the vacancy in Sikkim, and although her medi- cal skills seem to have been self-taught, her aristocratic backgroundand established reputation for good works stood her in good stead when she arrived in Sikkim in April 1923. She was permitted to live in Gangtok, 'a great concession by the Sikkim Maharaja', 67that seems to have been a personal tribute to her character and reputation ratherthan a result of any initiative by the Political Officer. 68 Mary Scott remained in Sikkim for sixteen years, where she was re- sponsible for all missionary and church activities. Despite her lack ofqualifications, she carried a medical kit and devoted much of her timeto medical matters, supervising the mission dispensaries, organising medical camps, nursing and relief programs during epidemics, and caring for the sick in her own home. 69Where Macfarlane and Suther- land had tried to spread Christianity into Sikkim through the Lepchas,Miss Scott used a different strategy. While identifying herself with theSikkimese to the extent of wearing local clothing and living in simplequarters in the Gangtok bazaar, she also deliberately set out to gain thesupport of the local elites. Doubtless helped by her aristocratic back-ground, she became a friend of the Maharani, accompanied Sikkimese royalty on a tour of India, and even acted as a hostess at the palace. 70 Before health problems with the altitude forced her to leave Sikkim, her efforts were rewarded when the Chogyal allowed the opening of aChristian Church in Gangtok in 1936. 71The Rev Gavin Fairservice and his wife Ruth replaced her, but were not permitted to reside in Gang-tok as missionaries, 72and a 1938 regulation requiring Sikkimese to ob- tain permission from the Durbar to convert to Christianity suggeststhe Church 's gains in Sikkim owed more to Mary Scott's personal influ- ence than to any great enthusiasm for the new faith by the Sikkimese rulers. In the absence of dispensary records or relevant writings by Mary Scott it is difficult to gauge the impact of missionary medical initiativesin Sikkim. It does appear that, during the first two decades of a Britishpresence there, in terms of structures, medical standards, and patientsattracted, the missionaries played at least as significant a part in the in-troduction of biomedicine as imperial government efforts. Both govern- ment and missionary clinics were staffed by compounders trained by the missionaries in Kalimpong and standards, facilities and resourcesmust have been very similar. The major difference was, as noted, thatEuropean missionaries were largely absent from the Sikkim dispen-saries, which were staffed by Sikkimese or other local people. While eventually overtaken by state structures, the missionaries con- tinued to be important agents for the spread of biomedicine, particu-larly in remote areas, into the 1930s and '40s. As in Kalimpong andSIKKIM :IMPERIAL STEPPING -STONE TO TIBET 95elsewhere, their influence on professional standards and the moral and ethical boundaries of the medical profession was also significant. De-monstrating a strong work-ethic and dedication to service, they set highstandards of professional care that their Sikkimese trainees were re- quired to emulate, although the Christian construct of the 'compassio- nate doctor' and ideals of service to the poor translated without diffi-culty into similar Buddhist ideals. 73In a small and autonomous state, isolated from the extremes of Indian society, such standards and idealsproved easier to maintain in the post-colonial period than they did inIndia itself. State development of biomedicine In the early years of the 20thcentury, Sikkim became an important sta- ging post for the Tibetan Frontier Commission, popularly known asthe 'Younghusband mission '. John Claude White was preoccupied withthe mission from 1902 until he returned from Lhasa in the autumn of1904. Gangtok was increasing in size and population and the presenceof numerous military units, each with their own medical officer, in and around Sikkim as a consequence of the Younghusband mission, was a reminder of the unsettled state of biomedical development there. Thematter of appointing a permanent European medical officer to overseepublic health in Sikkim was raised in a series of proposals White madeearly in 1906. But the discussion over whether the resulting chargesshould fall on the military or civil department, which lasted for morethan two years, was not helped by White's characteristic tardiness inanswering correspondence. 74He initiated the discussion by reporting that the want of an administrative medical officer over both civil andmilitary matters for the Agency is being more and more felt.There are many pressing questions such as the developmentand supervision of existing dispensaries, the opening of newones, vaccination, sanitation, etc., and the organization of medi-cal aid generally, which require special knowledge and which are now suffering from the fact that there is no medical officer attached to this Agency. ... All of ... [the dispensaries in Sikkimand Tibet] are under separate management and, although I canvisit them occasionally, I am unable to say if the work in each isbeing properly carried on without a medical advisor. New dis-pensaries are required to be opened in Sikkim and without prop-er medical advice it is difficult to say where and how they should96 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINbe opened. If all the dispensaries were brought under one con- trol they would be worked more advantageously.75 White requested the appointment of an Agency Surgeon to administer both civil and military medical matters in Sikkim. He wanted 'a man of experience and tact', holding at least the rank of Major.76The Gov- ernment of India eventually agreed to establish a new IMS position ofAssistant Civil Surgeon at Gangtok to supervise all medical matters inSikkim. These included responsibility for the state and missionary dis-pensaries, jails, schools, and 'personal attendance on the Chogyal andhis family'. 77 This latter duty was a regular charge in the various states under a Political Officer and does not indicate whether Sikkimese royalty hadadopted biomedicine at that time. The Chogyal Thubtob Namgyal wasnow reconciled to British authority, and his Private Secretary, LobsangChoden, had served as a British medical interpreter on the Younghus-band mission. He had been given the British Indian title of Rai Baha-dur and might be presumed to have spoken well of biomedicine. Butas the Civil Surgeon was given extra allowances (that nearly doubledhis regular pay of 300 rupees a month) in order to compensate him for the fact that there was 'practically no private practice in Gangtok', 78 it appears that at that time few if any of the Sikkimese elites had adopted the new medical system. The first Civil Surgeon appointed to Gangtok was not of the status White had hoped. There was a wider context to this. After the Young-husband mission the British Government reversed the Curzonian poli-cies of the Government of India, securing agreements with China in1906 and Russia in 1907 that were intended to stabilise international relations in Central Asia. China was allowed to regain power in Tibet and when White retired from Sikkim in 1908 he was replaced byCharles (later Sir Charles) Bell, an austere and reserved officer who ap-peared likely to achieve Whitehall's aim of 'keeping things quiet' onthe northeastern frontier. 79That frontier thus became an imperial backwater, with ambitious officers preferring postings to locations,such as the northwestern frontier, which were more at the forefront ofimperial attention. In such circumstances, the post of Civil Surgeon Gangtok had little allure. The state physician appointed to Gangtok was the Indian-born Assis- tant Surgeon 2 ndclass John Nelson Turner (1871-193?), a member of the Subordinate Medical Department, and not a qualified doctor. Turn- er, who was probably (like his successors), a Eurasian, has left littlemark in the records. He took up his post on 20 August 1909 and re-mained in Sikkim until he retired with the rank of senior assistant sur-geon early in 1920. During World War One, when the IMS suffered aSIKKIM :IMPERIAL STEPPING -STONE TO TIBET 97considerable shortage of manpower that it alleviated through the use of the Subordinate service officers, Turner was given the honorary rank ofCaptain. But his comparatively low status was underlined by the factthat he was outranked by the IMS officers then serving at Gyantse dis- pensary, a potent symbol of the greater importance of Tibet in British thinking. Only when the Gyantse post was given to a Sikkimese sub-as-sistant surgeon in December 1915 was that position reversed. Turner does appear to have overseen a continuing development of biomedicine in Sikkim. In 1901-02, the government dispensary atGangtok had treated around 4,500 patients. In 1908-09, the figure wasapproximately 7,500 (including 218 inpatients). 80The reports for the 1912-15 period show 'a very steady increase'81in patients at Gangtok to over 8,000 cases in 1915. Other dispensaries also seemed popular. Thegovernment establishments at Chidam and Rungpo treated a total ofsome 6,500 patients in 1908-09, while the three missionary dispen-saries (to which the state government contributed an annual sum of250 rupees), treated more than 9,000 patients. 82Peripatetic dispen- saries were subsequently introduced, which were set up at the fairs thatserved as the meeting grounds for Himalayan populations, while theSUM opened new dispensaries at Vok and Rinchenpong. It was, how- ever, forced to close Richenpong and Dentam on the dismissal of the compounder in charge of these sites. 83 By 1915, considerable progress had also been made towards the indi- genisation of biomedicine in Sikkim. The introduction and develop-ment of biomedicine was a process, one that in the Himalayas requiredat least a generation, but from this time on it was firmly rooted in Sik-kim. This was in sharp contrast to Tibet and Bhutan, which did not de-velop any significant indigenous biomedical tradition during the Brit- ish period. While Sikkim state's closer treaty links to British India and the political alliance that developed between the British and the Sikki-mese aristocracy fostered this process, the key factor appears to havebeen the number of Sikkimese who had received a Western education.The government and mission schools in Darjeeling and Kalimpong,and in Sikkim itself from the 1880s, provided a small but regular sup-ply of youths from either the Lhopo aristocracy or the Lepcha and Ne-pali Christian communities, who were educated in the Western sys- tem. 84Such an education was an essential precursor to the biomedical training process, imparting the modern scientific worldview necessary for the understanding of biomedicine. The fact that this education was,in state schools, essentially secular, and did not require conversion toChristianity made it more easily acceptable to the Himalayan Buddhistaristocracy, who from the 1920s onwards came to increasingly occupythe more powerful positions in the developing medical structures. The'native Christians' and other Christian-educated youths from tradition-98 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINally lower status social groups continued, however, to fill the lower ranks of compounders, dressers, and nurses in disproportionate num-bers. During White's residency no Sikkimese appear to have progressed beyond compounder qualifications. But his successor Charles Bellproved to be an astute thinker who sought to encourage indigenousmodernisation in the Himalayan states as a means of strengtheningthem, and consequently, the security of British India's northern border.He therefore encouraged the education of Sikkimese medical students,albeit - as will be seen - with the primary aim of employing them inTibet. Thus, of the first three students sent from Sikkim to TempleMedical College in Patna, two were immediately posted to a Political Department dispensary in Tibet when they graduated. These men were Tonyot Tsering and Bo Tsering (who were not closely related), both Ka-limpong educated Sikkimese who graduated as sub-assistant surgeonsin 1913 respectively. 85Their contemporary Bhowani Das Pra- sad Pradhan, however, a member of the Nepali community, remainedin Sikkim after completing his training in Patna. He was placed incharge of the Chidam dispensary in 1913. 86 Thus, as the structures of a state medical system began to be devel- oped in Sikkim, vacancies were filled by emerging Sikkimese medicalgraduates. Their training was financed from the Sikkim state revenues;we read, for example, that in 1924-25, 'Lobzang Mingyur, a studentwho was sent to the Campbell Medical School, Calcutta, at the expenseof the Durbar, finished his course of studies and was entertained at theGangtok hospital as an extra compounder.' 87Associated aspects of the development of a modern state public health bureaucracy similarlyaided the growth of a Western-educated administrative class by offering employment opportunities in the new spheres. During the 1920s, for example, registration of births and deaths was made compulsory, whilea Civil Veterinary Department was established with a dispensary atGangtok. Dog licenses were also introduced, with orders given to de-stroy dogs without the appropriate tags. 88In addition, sanitary mea- sures were introduced in the Gangtok bazaar.89 As had been the case in Chamba, the steady development of biome- dicine in Sikkim was stimulated by its patronage under the state's tra- ditional ruler. The 9thChogyal of Sikkim, Sir Thutob Namgyal, had outlasted White and even generously praised him in the History of Sik- kim that he compiled.90With the less dictatorial and more persuasive Charles Bell as the Political Officer, Thutob Namgyal was increasingly supportive of modernisation. After his death in 1914, Sidkeon NamgyalTulku, who had been groomed for the post by the British, succeededhim but died after ruling for just 10 months. 91His younger half-broth- er, Tashi (later Sir Tashi) Namgyal, who had been educated at St Paul'sSIKKIM :IMPERIAL STEPPING -STONE TO TIBET 99and Mayo College in India, then became Chogyal in 1915 and ruled Sikkim until his death in 1963. Tashi Namgyal was, according to British reports 'deeply interested in medical affairs'. In the early 1920s, he and his wife ('the Maharani' in British records), made a number of visits to the hospital in Gangtok, 'and rendered every help possible'. The Maharani even joined the Poli-tical Officer's wife in organising classes at which local ladies might pre-pare garments for patients and so forth. 92This type of patronage con- tinued into the post-colonial period.93 These symbols of royal approval for, and association with, the new medical developments had considerable symbolic significance in Sikki-mese society, bestowing royal authority on the new medical system and successfully encouraging others to support it. As early as 1905, for ex- ample, three beds in the Gangtok dispensary were subsidised by theIndian merchants Jetmull and Bhoraj. 94The landlord class also fol- lowed their ruler in supporting biomedical expansion and assisted inits indigenisation. By 1913, it was reported that the Kazis (the predomi- nantly Lepcha land-owning aristocracy) and thikadars (the Nepali land- owning aristocracy), were willing to build suitable dispensaries if theGovernment would stock them. 95 Royal patronage was clearly articulated in the naming of a new Gangtok hospital built to replace the existing dispensary there. On 24September 1917, the new Chogyal, Tashi Namgyal, officially openedthe Sir Thutob Namgyal Memorial Hospital. 96Situated on a ridge over- looking Gangtok,97it opened with beds for 10 inpatients,98and charge of the new facility was given to a state medical officer of Sikkimese na-tionality. 99The hospital became the centre of biomedicine in Sikkim, although it was initially poorly-equipped, not until 1923-24, for exam- ple, did it have a microscope.100But additional specialist wards were gradually added; a tuberculosis ward in the late 1920s and, after a trained midwife was first posted to the hospital in 1929-30, a maternityward was constructed in the late 1930s. 101 The new hospital did not immediately affect patient numbers at Gangtok. In 1923-24, just under 8,000 patients came to the hospital,only a few more than a decade earlier. But in the ensuing decade until1933-34, Gangtok outpatient numbers doubled to just over 16,000, although inpatient numbers were inconsistent. They varied from a low of 317 in 1929-30 to highs of 465 in 1924-25 and 455 in 1933-34. 102The reasons for the increase in outpatients are not stated in British ac-counts, but the increasing population, biomedical advances, and per-sonnel changes must all be considered as factors along with a growingacceptance of biomedicine by Sikkimese. On 1 November 1922, John Turner was replaced as Civil Surgeon Gangtok by the senior assistant surgeon, Dr. John Charles Dyer of the100 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINSubordinate medical services. Although a Eurasian, as a fully-qualified medical practitioner, Dyer was of a higher professional status thanTurner and he was a well-regarded medical officer. 103In November 1920, he had accompanied Sir Charles Bell to Lhasa and remainedthere for several weeks until Bell's old friend, the Tibetan-speaking Lt-Colonel Robert Kennedy IMS was able to join him there. When Dyer left Sikkim in January 1928, his replacement was sub-as- sistant surgeon Dr. Kenneth Percival Elloy DCM, 104who remained in Gangtok until February 1932, when he was replaced as Civil Surgeonby Dr. W. St. A. Hendricks. Like Dyer and Elloy, Hendricks was a Eura-sian. But he was described by the Political Officer's wife as 'a very fineGP', 105and significantly, he was a member of the IMS, the first officer of the higher service to hold the Civil Surgeon position in Sikkim. Theincreased status of the post was a recognition of the fact that Gangtokwas not only growing in population, but was also becoming a place ofsome political importance again as the Sino-British struggle for control over Tibet intensified. The arrival of Basil Gould as Political Officer Sir Thutob Namgyal Memorial Hospital in GangtokSIKKIM :IMPERIAL STEPPING -STONE TO TIBET 101Sikkim in December 1935 saw the Gangtok post upgraded to a 2nd class Residency, and in August of the following year, Gould led a mis- sion to the Tibetan capital that became a permanent British Mission inLhasa. Gould placed considerable emphasis on the maintenance of British prestige as a means of government, and these increases in status wereno coincidence. The political role of the Sikkim medical officers wasnow more obvious after some decades of lingering in abeyance. Thus,the emphasis on the modernity of medical practice in Sikkim in re-ports on kala-azar, the fever which became an epidemic in Sikkim every 15-20 years; it was noted in 1939 that treatment of the fever inGangtok 'was in every way in accordance with recent teaching' and that the advice of a specialist from the Tropical School of Medicine in Cal- cutta was being followed. 106 Yet Sikkim remained an economically insignificant state. Kala-azar was believed to be spread by sandflies, but it was noted that, 'to carryout efficient anti-sandfly measures in one village would absorb thewhole revenue of the state'. 107Most of Sikkim 's medical costs were borne from local revenue, including contributions to the mission dis-pensaries. The contribution of the imperial Government was small; in 1917-18 they gave just 1,500 rupees for medicine, in addition to cover- ing indirect costs incurred by the PWD dispensary at Rungpo. 108These economic restrictions acted as a considerable brake on biomedical pro-gress in Sikkim. One possible source of income was to charge for medical services and a step in this direction was taken in the 1920s. Initially, as was thecase throughout all of those regions where British authority was repre-sented by the Political Department, biomedical services were provided free of cost (as they were at missionary dispensaries). It was stated in regard to Sikkim that the 'established policy of the State is to placemedical aid within the reach of all classes of people in the State'. 109In the case of the Chogyal and his immediate family, the Civil Surgeon,as we have seen, received an additional allowance to compensate himfor providing private treatment to the royal family, while all otherscould receive free treatment at the dispensaries and hospitals. But justas the wealthier Sikkimese might choose to consult privately with the Civil Surgeon on a fee-paying basis, so too, in the 1920s, was there a demand for private treatment at the Gangtok hospital. A ward origin-ally built as a TB ward was converted into a paying ward, whichcharged a rupee a day for the bigger room and 8 annas (sixteen annas= 1 rupee) for the smaller. This was made possible by converting the le-per ward into a TB ward and transferring Sikkim 's lepers to existing fa-cilities in Kalimpong - with 200 rupees per annum given to that hos-pice in return. 110102 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINPrivate medical practice was never forbidden in Sikkim and several individuals who had trained as compounders in Kalimpong established practices after initial experience in dispensaries in the region. It wasnot, however, until the 1970s that fully-qualified doctors set up private practice there. Until that time, any Sikkimese qualifying as a doctor would be absorbed into government service. 111 Health conditions in Sikkim There were distinct local characteristics to the pattern of medical condi-tions encountered in Sikkim. In the first breakdown of medical condi- tions given in 1908-09, it was stated that at the state dispensaries, worms formed around 40% of the caseload. Malaria (15%), skin diseases (12%),goitre and ulcers (both around 5%), were the other common conditionsrecorded. 112Those conditions continued to provide much of the doc- tor's caseloads although there were regular outbreaks of epidemicssuch as smallpox and kala-azar. But a report in 1913 that 20 Lepchas in the Ringem Valley had died due to 'eating excess of raw fruit andjungle roots owing to a slight scarcity of food grains', 113hints at the economic status of rural areas and the extent to which epidemic deathsmay have been swollen by those already to some extent malnourished. Sikkim certainly suffered heavily in the great influenza pandemic that followed the First World War and with India also badly affected, it proveddifficult to obtain outside medical aid. Reaching its peak in October andNovember of 1918, influenza killed 2,767 people in Sikkim. This wasmore than 3% of the population, and the Civil Surgeon reported that 'itmay safely be said that no one in Sikkim escaped a mild or severe attack'. Among the dead was the sub-assistant surgeon at Chidam. 114 A notable feature of public health in Sikkim was that in contrast to neighbouring Bhutan and Tibet (as will be seen), venereal diseases were not a significant part of the medical caseload. Primary and sec-ondary syphilis and gonorrhoea provided around 1% of the medicalcaseload in Gangtok until the late 1920s, when it increased to around2%. But it apparently remained relatively uncommon, and by the mid-1960s the figure had declined to 0.1%. 115 Imperial biomedical priorities were life-threatening conditions, thus iodine deficiency disorders were not seriously dealt with in the colonialperiod. All of Sikkim falls within an iodine deficient zone and it wasnot until 1984 that iodised salt was made compulsory. But even todayaround 15% of the population, particularly the poorer rural dwellerswho are less likely to eat imported foods, are still liable to goitre. 116Si- milarly, as was to be the case in Tibet and Bhutan, no provision seemsto have been made for psychiatric conditions. These were generallySIKKIM :IMPERIAL STEPPING -STONE TO TIBET 103treated within the local community and not regarded as a medical pro- blem. After 1947, mental illness cases could be sent for treatment atan Indian mental hospital in Ranchi, West Bengal, but there remains asense that such conditions bring disgrace to a family, and mental pro- blems were often kept hidden by families. 117 Vaccination against smallpox, which will be discussed in depth in the following chapters on Tibet, was an immediate medical priority for the British in Sikkim. Despite its comparative isolation, Sikkim lay as-tride the main trade route from India to Tibet and its borders were alsoopen to east-west traders from Nepal and Bhutan. Thus it remained li-able to outbreaks of smallpox introduced from neighbouring regionsand could act as a 'gateway' for outbreaks of smallpox to spread across the Himalayas. Sikkim had little or no protection against the regular outbreaks of this devastating disease, 118and vaccination was among the earliest biomedical initiatives there. It appears to have begun in the late1890s. In a report on medical developments in Kalimpong for the year1899, one of three local students who had completed medical trainingthere was stated to be 'vaccinating in Sikkim ', while the Rev Macarawas sent to vaccinate people in Sikkim during the major regionalsmallpox outbreak of 1900, when, 'over 100 deaths were reported in one area alone'. 119Funding for this does not appear to have come from Sikkim state revenues and may therefore have been part of the Bengal state vaccination program, with missionary assistance. White stated in 1906 that 'I started vaccination in Sikkim a few years ago and am doing all that can possibly be done',120but it was not until 1908, after his departure, that vaccination was made compulsoryin Sikkim. 121Vaccination uptake seems to have been stimulated by the 1900 outbreak and subsequent local epidemics for 4,391 persons were vaccinated in 1900-01, and 2,331 in the following year (although no de- tails are given regarding revaccination or success rates).122 Around 1904, Sikkim state revenues began to be used for funding vaccinations on a systematic basis. The state was divided into eight cir-cular areas, each with a licensed vaccinator operating there for the five(summer) months of the year when smallpox was most prevalent. Thenew system produced a gradual increase in the numbers vaccinated,from 3,220 persons in 1904-05 (when there were 182 deaths from smallpox in Sikkim) and 3,578 in the following year, 123to 5,935 persons in 1907-08. But in 1908-09, the number declined to a total of 4,884 primary and 768 revaccinations, a decline attributed to 'the reluctanceof the Bhutias to have themselves revaccinated'. 124No mention is made of any reluctance to undergo initial vaccination, and it was observedtwo decades later in the Sikkim annual report that 'it is noteworthy thatthere is little or no opposition to vaccination ', a statement repeated thefollowing year. 125104 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINWhile such statements need to be treated with some caution, for the reports were designed to be optimistic and reflect well on the medical of- ficers writing them, resistance to vaccination was noted in medical re-ports from Tibet. The absence of such references here suggests easier ac- ceptance of vaccination in Sikkim than in Tibet. But any indigenous cul- tural resistance may have been overcome in the under-reported 1890s,and the Sikkimese, in any case, had had close dealings with the Bengaldistrict of India since the early 19 thcentury and thus had a greater awareness of Western medicine than the more isolated Tibetans. Whatmay have affected vaccination uptake was the fact that it was not free.The vaccinators charged two anna s per treatment until the charge was abolished in 1929-30, at which time the number of vaccinator's posi- tions was increased and they were made full-time salaried posts. 126 Figures for the numbers of persons vaccinated in Sikkim do show considerable annual fluctuations that to some extent reflect smallpox occurrence patterns. In 1912-13, fourteen cases of smallpox were re-corded in Sikkim, including two in the military barracks in Gangtok.Six deaths resulted from the outbreak, which was traced to aristocraticpilgrims returning from Nepal. The number of dead was considerablyless than the regular annual totals of over a hundred just a decade be- fore. But the efficacy of vaccination was now well-known and the out- break acted as a stimulus to preventative treatment; 9,580 person werevaccinated with lymph that year, and 11,195 the following year. In 1914-15, more detailed figures began to be given. 8,043 people were vacci-nated (including 5,615 under six year olds), of whom 7,925 were vacci-nated for the first time, 49 cases failed to react and in 206 cases the re-sults were 'unknown ', 118 cases were revaccinated, of which 32 failed,and in eleven cases the result was 'unknown '. 127 Available figures for the ensuing years are as follows:128 Table 2.2 Sikkimese smallpox records 1917-1934 Year Smallpox Vaccinations recorded 1923-24 5 6,676 not recorded 1925-26 2 7,010 1926-27 23 7,137 1,957 108 17 not recorded 1928-29 75 19 7,884 not recorded 1929-30 120 41 recorded 1930-31 3 8,379 cases cases ' 4,677 not recordedSIKKIM :IMPERIAL STEPPING -STONE TO TIBET 105As these figures indicate, the annual medical reports from Sikkim did not consistently provide a breakdown into primary and re-vaccinations.Nor did they always indicate the percentage of these vaccinations thatwere successful, the figure for years when they did are as follows: Table 2.3 Smallpox vaccination success records 1917-1931 Year Total Vaccinations Unsuccessful Result unknown 1917-18 'most were revaccinated',129 while those where the result was unknown were presumably traders, nomads, and others who did return for monitoring. What is clear is that the vaccinators focussed on children. In 1917-18 two-thirds of thosevaccinated were children; the following year the figure was 50% and insubsequent years it often exceeded that figure, 130suggesting that most Sikkimese adults had been vaccinated and that their children werebeing systematically vaccinated. Nor does any particular social groupappear to have been excluded. Uniquely, in 1917-18, vaccination figureswere broken down on communal lines. Of the 6,163 persons vacci- nated, ten were Christians, 4,678 were Hindus (primarily of Nepali ori- gin), and 1,475 were 'Bhutiya' and Lepcha, figures roughly representa-tive of the communal diversity. In 1923 and '24, it was reported that 'Every endeavour was made to push on vaccination throughout Sikkim ', 131yet its eradication was a long way off. It persisted, particularly in remote districts or those ex-posed to immigration, trade and pilgrimage. In as late as 1956 therewere still 142 smallpox patients in Sikkim and the disease was not en- tirely eradicated until the 1970s. 132 The post-colonial generation The indigenisation of biomedicine in Sikkim meant that the departure of the British had little medical impact there. The last of the imperialCivil Surgeons, Dr. G.F. Humphreys IMS, was an experienced doctor.106 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINHe had served in Tibet as the medical officer in Gyantse from October 1940-May 1944, and visited Lhasa in 1942-43 as accompanying physi-cian to two American emissaries. A Eurasian, he remained in Gangtokuntil the mid-1950s, providing continuity through the transitional peri- od. The Sikkimese sub-assistant surgeons who had served in the im- perial dispensaries in Tibet withdrew back to Sikkim during the 1950sas the Chinese takeover of Tibet intensified, increasing the pool of ex-perienced medical practitioners available to the Sikkim state, which re-tained its semi-independent status from 1947-75. Biomedical patient numbers continued to increase in post-colonial Sikkim, the state-wide figures available for the 1954-63 period being asfollows: 133 Table 2.4 Sikkim biomedical patients 1954-1963 Year Total patients 1954 115,060 1955 120,637 1956 168,301 1957 176,395 1958 173,083 1961 167,649 1963 188,526 But throughout the 1950s and '60s, biomedical development was re-stricted by the limited state revenues available, and continued to relyon Royal patronage to fund many routine items. 134During this period the Sikkimese health services were heavily reliant for specialist serviceson the variable commitment of Indian doctors employed on short-term contracts. At the time of the Indian takeover in 1975, there were just four district hospitals in addition to the STNM Hospital in Gangtok.The bulk of biomedical consultations took place in rural dispensariesand primary health care centres staffed by compounders, who thus re-mained the principle interface between biomedicine and local pa-tients. 135But an indigenous class of medical specialists capable of ad- ministering and operating Sikkim 's medical services was developing.Rather ironically, more indigenous Sikkimese occupy the higher ranks of the public health service today than was the case in independent Sik- kim before 1975. The first generation of Sikkimese biomedical practitioners were not fully qualified doctors. Men like Bo and Tonyot Tsering held sub-assis-tant surgeon rank in government service. But by the 1940s, a new gen-eration of qualified doctors began to emerge. They were largely fromthe small group of Western-educated Lhopa Sikkimese who formed abureaucratic class serving the Chogyal colonial governments. ThisSIKKIM :IMPERIAL STEPPING -STONE TO TIBET 107class had come to an accommodation with the British, and with their primary identity being Sikkimese and Buddhist, they were not a part ofthe nationalist struggles and religio-political divisions developing in In-dia. As a cosmopolitan elite at home in British or Tibetan society they were able to benefit from the crucial role they played as intermediaries between their neighbouring powers, Tibet and British India. Thus indi-viduals such as Bo and Tonyot Tsering (who will be discussed in moredetail later), were vital to the British medical project in Tibet, and in re-turn they gained advanced social status at home through their activitiesand employment with the leading regional power. Among the new generation of medical practitioners to arise from this class were Tonyot Tsering's son Dr. Pemba T. Tonyot, who became the first Sikkimese anaesthetist. Others from this social class were Dr. Kazi Tendup, who may have been the 1 stSikkimese to qualify as M. D.,136and Dr. Tsewang Paljor (a descendent of Raja Tenduk Paljor, whose estates had extended to Darjeeling), who was the first Sikkimeseto qualify as a surgeon. The close links between members of this classare illustrated by the fact that the wife of Bo Tsering's son, Dr. Leki Da-dul, was the first female doctor in Sikkim, graduating from Calcuttaaround 1955. 137 The careers of these individuals tended to follow a similar pattern, and they shared ideals of duty and service that had been reinforced bythe educational and professional structures of British imperial rule. Dr.Pemba T. Tonyot, for example, was educated at the Gangtok TashiNamgyal school. His father had hoped he would follow him into medi-cine and he did so, 'being religious minded and seeing it as a nobleprofession '. After matriculation Dr. Tonyot obtained a BA in science be-fore going on to qualify as MBBS in Madhya Pradesh. In 1966, he graduated as an anaesthetist and was posted to STNM Hospital in Gangtok, replacing an Indian doctor. He later became a medical advi-sor to the Government of Sikkim before retiring in 2003. 138 His near-contemporary, Dr. Tsewang Paljor, was similarly schooled in Gangtok and then St Joseph 's school in Darjeeling where he studiedscience. Recognising the shortage of medical personnel in his nativeland and the opportunity he had to serve there, he then applied to gov-ernment and was selected for medical training in Andhra Pradesh, graduating MBBS in 1968. After returning to Sikkim to serve in the STNM Hospital, he was sent in 1972 to take a masters degree in sur-gery at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Researchat Chandigarh, then returned to Gangtok as the first Sikkimese sur-geon, again replacing an Indian serving on contract. 139 But Sikkimese from other social groups also found careers in medi- cine. Sonam Dorji was not from such a privileged background, but wasselected by the Political Officer Basil Gould to study at High School in108 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINGangtok. Then, in search of adventure, he headed off to join the Gur- khas, fighting at Imphal against the Japanese forces in 1942 alongsideVictoria Cross winner Ganju Lama. On his return to Gangtok, he re-members that, in recognition of his services, the new Political Officer Arthur Hopkinson offered him any position he wanted, and he opted for medical training at Campbell Medical College. He went on to serveat the dispensary attached to what were now the Indian Governmentdiplomatic posts in Tibet during the early 1950s and subsequentlyserved in north Sikkim, before retiring with wife Namgay Dolma in1989. 140 Dr. Lobsang Tenzing, a nephew of Dr. Norbu who was killed in theGyantse floods in 1954, was from a somewhat different background.Originally from the village of Mangan in north Sikkim, he was the son of the Christian pastor there, although himself a Buddhist. The Tenz- ing family placed great emphasis on modern education, and after fin-ishing second on the merit list in his matriculation at Gangtok , hewas sent to NRS Medical College in Calcutta, completing his MBBS in1963, the first of his Lepcha-Bhutia community to do so. He wasposted to the STNM hospital that year, and then became medical offi-cer at the Mangan hospital from 1967-1971. Dr. Lobsang eventually re-tired as Director-cum-Secretary of Health in 1995, having been the first local doctor to reach this position. 141 Dr. Sonam Dorji IMS and his wife Namgay DolmaSIKKIM :IMPERIAL STEPPING -STONE TO TIBET 109Along with the doctors and licensed practitioners, the (until recently all-female) profession of nursing also developed in Sikkim, albeit that the profession is still not of particularly high status. One example of anursing career in this period is that of Nurse Sonam Eden ('Phigoo'). In 1954, having reached 7 thgrade in Mary Scott's school and then at some fifteen years of age, she and her contemporary Pabita Pradhan were sent to Kalimpong under the state Five Year Plan to train asnurses. They trained under the Scottish missionary Dr. Albert Craig, aman of very high standards who Phigoo remembers as strict and short-tempered in contrast to the 'Mother Theresa' figure of Mary Scott. Onher return to Gangtok, Phigoo was posted to the STNM Hospital whereshe remained until retiring in 1995 after 40 years service. 142 The modern Sikkimese medical world In Sikkim today, the Sir Thutob Namgyal Memorial Hospital straddlesa main Gangtok intersection. As of 2000, it was a 300 bed hospital,with 78 doctors on staff including 36 specialists. In 1999, 351 majorand 984 minor surgical operations were carried out there. Plans have been advanced for a new 500-bed hospital as patient numbers continue to increase; to around 140,000 in 1999. 143While Sikkim is part of In- dia, most of its medical personnel are born in Sikkim. For medical pur-poses, the state is divided into four districts, each under a Chief Medi-cal Officer who is also head of the central hospital in that district. Anetwork of primary health care centres and sub-centres exists in eachdistrict, 144and medical services remain largely free.145A subjective jud- gement considering patient-doctor relations, service morale, non-elite class access, and not least financial probity, as well as numerous statis- tical indicators,146would suggest the Sikkimese today enjoy among the best biomedical services in India. However, while biomedicine has been indigenised both in terms of structures and personnel, it has not displaced the local medical prac-tices, which continue to be the first resort for much of the popula-tion. 147While medical reports from the colonial period in Sikkim make virtually no mention of the indigenous practices, as late as 1969 it was noted of the Sikkimese that, 'of late they have started realising the effi- ciency of the scientific treatment as evidenced by their ready accep-tance of injections and vaccinations and the rising attendance at hospi-tals and dispensaries'. 148Such optimistic rhetoric is, as will be seen, ty- pical of biomedical reporting, particularly by newcomers to a region. Inpractice, however, medical pluralism is characteristic and in Sikkim ithas been driven by an unexpected source. We have noted the influenceof the compounders as agents of biomedicine, but they may also repre-110 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINsent traditional medical knowledge and practices; a report from 2001 describes how compounders are very often also traditional faith healers. In a typical blend of tradition and modernity; they work in a hospital or health centre during the day, but perform the traditional tasks of a faith healerin the evening. 149 One other 'blend of tradition and modernity' emerges from the use oftechniques from one system by practitioners of another. Thus 'tradi-tional' village bone setters may use x-rays, while biomedical practi-tioners incorporate local cultural understandings by, for example, al- lowing patients to choose an auspicious date for elective surgery in consultation with the appropriate Buddhist monks. Biomedicine con-tinues to gain acceptance, with modern technologies such as CAT scansand ultrasound improving diagnosis, and thus treatment and accep-tance, but non-biomedical systems are unlikely to die away. During thelast decade, medical pluralism has been institutionalised in Sikkim, al-beit not to the extent known in contemporary Bhutan. But the STNMHospital does have an amchi , and outside of the state sector there is now, in addition to Ayurvedic and Homeopathic clinics, a branch ofthe Dharamsala Men-ze-khang. 150This opened in 2004 offering 'Tibe- tan medicine', and there are also private practitioners offering servicesin this tradition. Medical pluralism is thus established, but Sikkimesetraditions are under pressure from both Tibetan and Indian TraditionalMedicine as well as biomedicine! Conclusions Christian missionaries did make a significant, albeit limited, contribu-tion to the introduction of biomedicine into Sikkim. During the latterpart of the 19 thcentury, with the imperial government clearly intent on breaking down the isolation of Tibet and missionary dispensaries beingestablished in Sikkim, the Himalayan missionaries' dream of evangelis-ing in the 'Forbidden Land' must have seemed a realistic one. But the opening of Sikkim and later Tibet did not bring the expected results. Missionary access to Sikkim was restricted and the Government of In-dia refused to allow them to cross the frontier into Tibet. 151The CSM missionary Rev Evan Mackenzie, for example, who had been in Kalim-pong since the mid-1890s, was allowed to accompany Tibet's second-highest religious figure, the Panchen Lama, on his tour of India in1906-07 to advise on matters pertaining to the Christian religion. Butin 1908, when he requested permission to reside near the Political De-SIKKIM :IMPERIAL STEPPING -STONE TO TIBET 111partment's post in Gyantse, it was refused.152Their continuing exclu- sion from all but the southern districts of Sikkim must have made it clear to the missionaries that the imperial government opposed theirpresence in the frontier districts, and with the Political Department making its own educational and medical initiatives in Tibet, the mis- sionaries services in this regard were not required by the imperial gov-ernment. Subsequently, in regard to Tibet, the Political Officer Charles Bell in 1921 recommended that the number of European visitors to Tibetshould be gradually increased, although as any 'Christian missionarycriticising Buddhism would', he claimed, 'be attacked and possiblykilled', it was agreed that 'sportsmen, missionaries, and undesirables' should continue to be excluded. 153But after the Rev Mackenzie had been permitted to cross the frontier to Yatung in 1922 for the wedding of the British representative David Macdonald's daughter,154and then to travel on to Gyantse, missionaries were occasionally allowed into Ti-bet. Mackenzie returned on several occasions, Dr. Graham travelled toYatung in 1927, and later Drs Knox, Craig, and others were permittedto travel on the trade route to Gyantse. 155They were not, however, per- mitted to evangelise or to establish any permanent structures or insti- tutions in Tibet, and there is no record of their carrying out any medi- cal work there. With the greatly reduced missionary influence, the colonial state played a greater role in Sikkim than it did in Kalimpong. But havingalienated the local elites in the early years, John Claude White was ableto make little or no political use of medicine. In the absence of any sig-nificant imperial government funding for Sikkimese public health de-velopment White had to first transform Sikkim into a revenue-raising state. Only when internal funding sources were created could the devel- opment of government structures such as a public health system be-gin. This meant that biomedicine made little impact on Sikkim in thefinal decade of the 19 thcentury. More sophisticated Political Officers such as White's successor Charles Bell recognised that biomedical services could gain support forthe colonial project. Bell followed a policy of befriending the local elitesand encouraging them to gradually transform their state through the development of modern institutions such as schools and hospitals. The royal patronage dating from this period provided an important symbolof Sikkim 's acceptance of biomedicine, and the indigenisation of medi-cal structures and personnel was to provide a firm foundation for laterdevelopment. The existence of a body of Sikkimese educated on theWestern model was crucial to this process, which was to fail in Tibetwhere such individuals were virtually non-existent until the late 1940s.112 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINThe initial appointment of a low-ranked SMD Civil Surgeon to Gangtok when the medical officers in Tibet were IMS officers effec- tively separated medical developments in Sikkim from those in Tibet,to which the Government of India always devoted greater resources. Their respective status was also expressed in racial terms; at least from the time of Dr. Dyer, and probably earlier, the Gangtok Civil Surgeonwas a Eurasian. But in focussing the work of the Civil Surgeon moreon medical rather than political issues, the development of biomedi-cine in Sikkim may have been stimulated. It was less obviously a for-eign system, and Sikkimese were, as a result of their education, betterinformed as to its conceptual universe than their Tibetan and Bhuta-nese neighbours. While there was a significant contribution from the missionaries, it was the Sikkimese state that largely funded the biomedical develop-ment process and it was only their shortage of funding that limited -and indeed continues to limit - the spread of biomedicine. But whilethe continuation of traditional medical practices is in part due to thestructural restrictions on biomedicine, it is also a reflection of culturalsurvival among the various groups making up Sikkim today. But na-tionalism, or the nationalist struggle for independence from European rule, does not appear to be a medical issue that has hindered the spread of biomedicine in Sikkim. The complex issues of identity in amultiracial society manifest in many areas, but turning to biomedicineapparently transcends ethnic and national identities. This may reflect British colonial understandings and policies in Sik- kim. With the establishment of an alliance of interests between theBritish and the Sikkimese elites, the Sikkimese became something of afavoured class. They were both liked and rewarded by the British for their role as intermediaries in Tibet and the Sikkimese found little at- traction in the Indian independence movement, with their eventual ab-sorption into India deriving from demographic changes. With the Ne-pali community owing their presence to British patronage and thenon-elite Lepcha and Limbu largely left to their own devices by the co-lonial government, biomedicine did not become a political issue in Sik-kim. As will be seen in the ensuing chapters, the central themes that arise from the biomedical encounter in Sikkim were repeated in Tibet andBhutan, but only in Sikkim was biomedicine indigenised in the colo-nial period.SIKKIM :IMPERIAL STEPPING -STONE TO TIBET 1133 Biomedicine and Buddhist Medicine in Tibet Missionary beginnings On Sunday 12 June 1707, two Capuchin missionaries arrived in Lhasa, which was then a cosmopolitan city,1albeit with little or no knowledge of the far-off European powers. Granted an interview with Tibet's Re-gent, the missionaries stated that they, 'were doctors and wherever theywent they practiced medicine for God's sake'. 2The pair were allowed to stay in Lhasa and Friar Francis Mary of Tours, who unlike his com-panion actually did have some medical experience, began to treat pa-tients. His reputation grew rapidly; among those who came to him for treatment was the personal physician of the Regent and the Dalai Lama, 3and his achievements were reportedly even mentioned in the Peking Gazette .4After Friar Mary returned to India, his successors con- tinued the practice of medicine in Lhasa, finding it a ready means togain the local peoples' trust, something that was essential to their ef-forts to convert the Tibetans to Christianity. A Friar Dominic, who for ten months in 1710-11 was the sole Capu- chin in Lhasa, treated 80-90 patients a day, including both the Re- gent's wife and the Chinese representative in the Tibetan capital. Friar Dominic's success was apparently such that both the Chinese and theMongols wanted him to accompany them to their homelands, andeventually he had to flee to India to escape their demands. 5Before his departure, however, he taught his medical skills to Friar Joachim ofAnatolia, who soon came to enjoy similar success and status, and whenJoachim left for India in 1733 he received a letter of thanks from theRegent. Later Friar Joseph Mary of Gargnano continued medical prac- tice in Lhasa, but the Capuchins had made few converts and were be- coming increasingly unpopular as a result of their intolerance to Bud-dhism. The mission closed for the last time in 1745. 6 Despite their failings in the religious sphere, the Capuchins' medical achievements would seem to have been considerable. Even allowing forthe fact that their accounts doubtless accentuate the positive, it appearsfrom their patronage by Tibetan, Mongol, and Chinese elites that themissionary doctors gained a high reputation. While there are few men- tions of the actual conditions successfully treated by the Capuchins, itappears that in general terms, even in this period when European med-ical knowledge had little scientific basis, Western medicine could suc- cessfully compete with indigenous Asian medical systems. We know that this success was not based on a superior European pharmacology, for we read that; 'Luckily medical herbs grew in abun- dance around Lhasa or could be easily procured from the local market... This enabled the missionary doctor to continue his practice evenwhen the supply of medicines brought from Europe ran out'. 7The Ca- puchins' success apparently derived from knowledge or practices super-ior to, or at least different from, those of the indigenous systems, and an ability to cure illnesses for which there was no known local cure. Their strengths included more advanced technology, for we know thatthe Capuchins possessed simple surgical tools and that their presentsto the Dalai Lama in 1724 included a microscope. 8While evidence is lacking in European sources, the Capuchins may have contributed toTibetan medical knowledge, and it seems likely that their success in-itiated some Tibetan understanding of Europeans as possessing a highdegree of medical skill. Early Western medicine in Tibet Thirty years after the Capuchin 's final departure from Lhasa the firstemissaries of the British empire arrived in Tibet. After receiving corre-spondence from the Panchen Lama over the status of Cooch Behar (ly-ing between Bengal and Bhutan), the Governor-General in Warren Hastings, despatched an envoy, the Scotsman George Bogle, to the Panchen 's Shigatse court. Bogle was accompanied by a surgeon,Alexander Hamilton, whose major role was a diplomatic one, some-thing that was to be characteristic of later British medical officers inthis region. Hamilton did, however, in regard to Tibetan medical prac-tice, conclude that: I am ... afraid [medical] science will benefit but little by any knowledge of the Tibetan practice as the inhabitants of that country seem to be much further behind the Europeans on theprogress they have made towards the advancement of medicalknowledge than in most other arts or sciences. 9 However, Hamilton acknowledged that the Tibetans were skilled at cat-aract operations, something that was later to be a British speciality. Inan interesting indication of the relative states of knowledge at that time116 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINhe credited this to superior common technology rather than technique, concluding that: Though their method of treating some disorders of the eye is more successful than the one we follow, we cannot infer from thence that they have a more powerful knowledge of the natureof the disorder or are better acquainted with the structure of theorgan upon which they operate than we are; in reality they areentirely ignorant of both, this remarkable success which attendstheir method of couching the cataract being solely owing to theirinstruments being much better calculated for that purpose thanthose we use. Enclosed I send you the only two instruments used in the operation. The copper one, for depressing the crys- talline lens ... and I should be happy to have two or three lancetslike the enclosed which is used for dividing the external coats ofthe eye. Any of your sircars could get both in the [Calcutta]bazaar. 10 Bogle and Hamilton actually found much in Himalayan society thatthey admired and their encounter with the Tibetans was largely free of the colonial power contexts that later arose in relations between Britain and Tibet. The Panchen Lama was then a powerful regional leader andhe was also an agreeable host with a considerable interest in the out-side world. At one point, he held a lengthy discussion with Hamiltonabout smallpox and although its contents were not recorded, 11Hamil- ton may well have introduced him to the Western concept of vaccina-tion. Certainly Bogle gave the Panchen Lama a written account of Eur-ope including a section on Western medicine which described how English physicians were trained and practised a form of public health. He noted: The smallpox used formerly to be fatal in England. About 70years ago inoculation was introduced by a person who had tra-velled in Turkey. Since that time all the better sort of people in-oculate their children. Not above one in a hundred dies of it. 12 Bogle's work was translated into Tibetan, and was 'for many years thestandard Tibetan account of Europe', 13but Bogle, Hamilton, and the Panchen Lama all died within a few years of this mission. AlthoughHastings sent a new envoy, Samuel Turner (accompanied by the physi-cian Robert Saunders), to Shigatse in 1783 to meet the new incarnationof the Panchen Lama, these exchanges had little long-term effect andAnglo-Tibetan contacts subsequently lapsed.BIOMEDICINE AND BUDDHIST MEDICINE IN TIBET 117During the 19thcentury, just three Europeans were able to reach Lhasa. Two were French Lazarist missionaries, while the third was Charles Manning, an English aristocrat who posed as a monk-doctor.His medical abilities gained him the patronage of a Chinese general in whose party he travelled to Lhasa in 1811. Manning gained such repute that, like the Capuchins, he was called on to treat the Dalai Lama's per-sonal physician, but the encounter proved an unfortunate one. Thephysician declined to take the medicine provided on the grounds of itsunpleasant taste and smell, and subsequently died. 14Manning left few details of his medical work, however, and was an eccentric individualwhose visit was of no lasting significance. While no other Western medical practitioners reached central Tibet during the 19 thcentury, European travellers and missionaries were treating Tibetans in the border areas and some Tibetan traders and pil-grims doubtless encountered Western medicine while travelling in In-dia and other lands, in addition to which, as noted, some private im-port and use of Western medical pharmaceuticals seems to have com-menced. But at the dawn of the 20 thcentury, Tibetan knowledge of Western medicine must have been a miscellany of empirical impres-sions and often dated hearsay. Medical work on the Younghusband mission (1903-04) By 1903, Lord Curzon had decided to force the Tibetans to enter intorelations with British India and he selected a Political officer, ColonelFrancis Younghusband, to lead an imperial mission to establish Britishinfluence at Lhasa. The modern weaponry of the imperial army over- whelmed Tibetan resistance and in August 1904 Younghusband's forces entered Lhasa. The Dalai Lama had fled north into Mongolianexile, and Younghusband forced the remaining Tibetan authorities tosign a treaty opening their state to British trade and diplomatic com-munication. The mission then withdrew to India. During the Younghusband mission, the primary medical concern for the British was of course the health of the imperial forces - men andanimals - who suffered badly from the cold and hostile conditions on the Tibetan plateau. But while leading what was in effect a military in- vasion, Younghusband was conscious of the ultimate need to transformTibet into a British ally. He thus endeavoured to use military force onlywhen necessary, and within the practical limitations of an armed inva-sion he sought means to convince the Tibetans of the ultimate good in-tentions of the British. One obvious means of doing this was throughthe provision of free medical services and a travelling dispensary ac-companied the mission to treat Tibetans. 15118 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINThe chief medical officer on the Lt-Colonel L. Austine Waddell (1854-1937). A Glaswegian IMS offi- cer and veteran of numerous military campaigns, he had served as amedical officer in Darjeeling for seven years. Waddell's concerns were actually more academic, as befitted the author of the then highly re- garded The Buddhism of Tibet, or Lamaism (1897). As the oldest mem- ber of the mission, Waddell devoted himself to collecting artefacts andmanuscripts and there is no record of his ever practising medicine inTibet. But Waddell, who was not highly regarded by most of his con-temporaries on the mission, did join the other medical officers in atour of the Chakpori medical college in Lhasa. He recorded that thehead of the college responded to his enquiries into the underlying phi- losophy of the Tibetan medical system with answers that were 'satu- rated with absurdity'. 16 Waddell left the IMS after the Younghusband mission. By 1906, he was considered 'too eccentric and impracticable' to act as a Tibetan lan-guage examiner in the Political Department and his academic outputbecame increasingly concerned with Aryan race theory. By the 1930s,he had embraced fascism, 17and his accounts of Tibetan Buddhism are most notable today for the repugnance he expressed for many aspects of his subject. Yet his account of meeting the Abbot of Ganden monas- tery, who was then acting as the Tibetan Regent, is more sympathetic.Waddell repeated the Regent's trenchant criticisms of the British, per-haps because the reluctant physician Waddell liked the Regent's con-clusion that 'except [for] you doctors, of whose humane work I haveheard; ... all the others [on the mission] are utterly devoid of religion '. 18 The context suggests the story was true and that the mission dispen-sary had gained at least some goodwill. With Waddell otherwise engaged, it was actually left to another of the fifteen medical officers on the mission, 19Captain H.J. Walton IMS, to run the Tibetan dispensary. The necessary equipment was receivedin March 1904, and the dispensary moved with the mission on its wayto Lhasa. It found few civilian customers at Khamba Jong and Tuna,where Walton only, 'managed to persuade a few of the residents ... tobring their children to camp and vaccinated about eight of them '. 20 They were more successful in Gyantse, treating 81 Tibetan civilians there,21but with the Tibetan army now resisting the British, their work was mainly with Tibetan battle casualties. The Daily Mail correspondent, Edmund Candler, reported that, 'for nearly two days, Lieutenant G.I. Davys, Indian Medical Service, was op- erating nearly all day', with 168 wounded treated, of whom 'only 20died'. Candler, who later lost a hand to a Tibetan sword swipe, wrotethat; 'I think the Tibetans were really impressed with our humanity,and looked upon Davys as some incarnation of the medicine Buddha.'BIOMEDICINE AND BUDDHIST MEDICINE IN TIBET 119He also expressed the regard the British developed for their opponents, noting that; 'Everyone who visited the hospital ... left it with an in-creased respect for the Tibetans and their bravery.' Candler told of;'One man, who lost both legs ... [and joked that] 'In my next battle I must be a hero, as I cannot run away.'' 22 Tibetan perspectives were doubtless somewhat different. But British accounts of the Younghusband mission invariably note how wounded Tibetan soldiers taken prisoner by the British expected to be executed,and how they were amazed at being given medical treatment by theircaptors. 23That this did create a good impression was confirmed by the American missionary, Dr. Shelton in Batang, who met one such officertreated by the British. Shelton described British efforts as having 'made an indelible impression on the whole country', and as having influ- enced the leading Tibetan official in eastern Tibet, the Kalon Lama, tosubsequently care for wounded Chinese prisoners. 24But while treat- ment of wounded prisoners probably did make a positive impression(and was culturally compatible with Buddhist understandings of com-passion), the treatment of wounded prisoners by Tibetans was not, his-torically, necessarily brutal. Certainly accounts of Sino-Tibetan conflictssuggest prisoners were frequently executed. But after Zorowar Singh 's unsuccessful invasion of western Tibet in 1841, some of his Sikh troops were apparently so well treated by their captors that they chose to re-main in Tibet after being freed! 25 That British medical endeavours did win goodwill is also suggested by Captain Walton 's report in regard to the biggest British military re-verse of the campaign, a night attack on the Younghusband missionheadquarters at Gyantse. Walton states that the British were preparedfor this thanks to a warning given 'the preceding day by patients of the dispensary', apparently implying a specific warning from grateful pa- tients. The London Times correspondent, however, only refers to a sud- den exodus of patients arousing Walton 's suspicions and makes nomention of a given warning. 26Tibetan civilians were certainly begin- ning to take advantage of the British medical facilities. A woman whohad been operated on for cataracts prior to a two month period of inter-mittent fighting in Gyantse returned as soon as the fighting ended inorder to receive the spectacles she had been promised. 27 The British opened their medical dispensary in Lhasa on 16 August 1904, thirteen days after Younghusband arrived there. It remained inoperation until 22 September, the day before the mission left Lhasa.During that time it treated 615 patients (259 men, 211 women, and 145children), and carried out 34 major operations, including thirteen forcataracts. 28Captain Walton 's report states that the dispensary 'was very popular from the beginning, all classes of people attended: Tibetans,Chinese, Nepalese, and Kashmiris', and he also noted that, 'Lamas120 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINfrom the Monasteries formed quite a large proportion of the total num- ber'. News that all races, classes, and most importantly the socially in-fluential monks were turning to British doctors was just what Walton 'ssuperiors wanted to hear, but there were apparently some reservations on the part of the Tibetan authorities. While no restriction was placed on the general populace and even the monks attending the dispensary,Walton noted that: Three Tibetans of high rank pitched their tent in the compoundof the dispensary and remained there for several days while un-der treatment. It was necessary for these three men to obtainspecial sanction from the National Council before they were al- lowed to seek advice and treatment.' 29 Unfortunately there is no British record of the precise identity or status of the officials concerned. Thus it is difficult to ascertain if Tibetan ob-jections here were based on opposition to Western medicine, or simply,as seems more likely, to their high-ranking officials associating withthe invaders during negotiations. Throughout the mission Walton was assisted in his medical duties by medical officers from the 8 thGurkha and 40thPathan regiments, among others. In view of later developments and understandings, onenotable feature of Walton 's report was the stress he laid on the goodperformance of an Indian hospital assistant, Hira Singh. Walton statedthat: I consider that the popularity of the Civil Dispensary ... was verylargely due to the great kindness, patience and tact displayed by this Hospital Assistant and to the very painstaking and conscien- tious manner with which he devoted himself to his work. 30 As Younghusband's forces withdrew south to India, the British tookthe opportunity to despatch a small party of officers on a survey mis-sion that travelled west to the remote hamlet of Gartok (near MountKailas), where the Government of India planned to establish an out-post. Hira Singh accompanied the four British officers on the mission as their medical assistant, and it was reported that he had; 'rendered excellent service throughout. By the energy he displayed, the skill withwhich he treated Tibetan patients, and his ever cheerful and pleasantmanners, he proved himself a valuable man.' 31Yet despite Singh 's per- formance, Indian medical staff were soon to be excluded from Tibet.BIOMEDICINE AND BUDDHIST MEDICINE IN TIBET 121The Gyantse dispensary The treaty Younghusband signed in Lhasa gave the British the right to station representatives in Tibet and Younghusband's trusted assistant, the Tibetan-speaking Captain W.F. O'Connor was selected as the first British agent there. In deference to the Tibetan desire to maintain theirisolation, and with the British Government at Whitehall reluctant tosanction any continuing imperial involvement in Tibet, O'Connor wasleft not in the capital city, but at Gyantse, 120 miles southwest of Lha-sa. There the Government of India opened a so-called 'Trade Agency',which, as the selection of O'Connor as 'Trade Agent' indicated, was infact a diplomatic post. For O'Connor was an officer in the Political De- partment, and their concern was diplomacy, not trade. Smaller Trade Agencies were also opened at Gartok and at Yatung in the Chumbi Valley just across the frontier from Sikkim. 32The Gyantse Trade Agency became the centre of British activities in Tibet for the next thirty years because no British officer was permitted by Whitehallto visit Lhasa until 1920, and a permanent mission was only estab-lished in the Tibetan capital in 1936-37. The Gyantse and Yatung posi-tions were under the authority of the Sikkim Political Officer in Gang- tok, while the Gartok Agency, a remote and peripheral affair of little more than symbolic importance, was under the control of the PunjabHill States until the 1930s, when it also came under the Sikkim Politi-cal Officer's control. In Gyantse, O'Connor was housed in a fort with a 50 man military escort of Indian troops under a British officer, as well as European cle-rical and communications staff. In addition, it was decided to establisha medical dispensary under the command of an IMS officer. The first medical officer appointed to Gyantse was Lieutenant (later Lt-Colonel) Robert Steen, who had served on the Younghusband mission (althoughhe does not appear to have travelled as far as Lhasa). His backgroundwas typical of British IMS officers. Born in Ulster in 1874, the son of afarmer, Steen had been educated at Queens College Belfast and tookhis MBChB at the Royal University of Ireland before entering the IMS.Steen presumably knew his fellow Ulsterman, Trade Agent O'Connor,when he was appointed and when he applied to transfer from the mili- tary to the political cadre, O'Connor provided a reference stating that Steen was 'exceedingly' popular with the British, and 'wonderfully pop-ular with all classes of natives'. Overall, it concluded, Steen was an offi-cer 'decidedly above average'. 33 O'Connor's main task in Tibet was to befriend the Tibetans, to influ- ence them to follow policies beneficial to the interests of British India.Although he was based in Gyantse, the main target of his attempts toform an alliance with the Tibetan elites was actually the Panchen Lama122 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINat Shigatse. In the absence of the exiled Dalai Lama, the Panchen was the highest authority in Tibet, and within days of the opening of theGyantse Trade Agency on 1 October 1904, O'Connor set off to visithim. Steen accompanied O'Connor and established a temporary dis- pensary in Shigatse which treated 'between 500 and 600 cases' in the eight days of its operation. After returning to Gyantse, Steen filed a re-port that listed nine common conditions reported at the dispensary, ofwhich eye diseases and rheumatism were the most common. Notingthat he had already been consulted by two patients from Lhasa whohad previously been treated there by Captain Walton, and that heexpected patients to follow him from Shigatse, he concluded that; 'Itwill be seen ... what a large field there is for medical and surgical work.' 34 A large house in the bazaar was rented for use as the Gyantse dis- pensary. It officially commenced operations on 1 November 1905, open- ing daily from 9-11 a.m. for outpatients. The medical establishmentthere during the 1905-10 period consisted of the British IMS officer, aHospital Assistant (Dhyan Singh), compounder and dresser (MunaSingh), a translator and a Khalassi (vet), along with a sweeper and acoolly. The status of the British officer was clearly expressed in finan- cial terms. He received an annual basic salary of 7,200 rupees, while the indigenous employees received 1,400 rupees between them. 35 The medical officer's primary duty was the care of the British staff and the Indian Army personnel and his day began with the militarydetachment's 'sick parade'. Only soldiers in medical category 'A' (thevery fittest men), were posted to Tibet, and the environment was gener-ally far healthier than in most of India. But the cold and constant dustmeant respiratory diseases were common and several soldiers died there. Treatment was rudimentary, there was a five-bed hospital in the military section, but it was only equipped for routine medical work. 36 Medicines were supplied to Gyantse by the Government of India, but financial considerations were always paramount in the imperial ad-ministration of the posts in Tibet. That meant that there could be largediscrepancies between the equipment and medicines requested by theGyantse medical officers and the actual supplies received. In 1907, forexample, a precise and detailed list of 60 required specialist surgical items was submitted, but a greatly simplified and considerably more economical list of fifteen items was actually sanctioned. 37 The political purpose of the British dispensaries was clearly articu- lated from the start. Providing free medical treatment to all classes ofthe local people was intended to engender indigenous goodwill towardsthe British that could be translated into diplomatic advantage. WhenO'Connor first submitted a proposal for the dispensary (which had ob-viously been discussed earlier with Younghusband), an official notedBIOMEDICINE AND BUDDHIST MEDICINE IN TIBET 123that 'the dispensary will doubtless be politically advantageous' and Younghusband himself certified that 'it is extremely desirable on politi-cal grounds.' 38O'Connor subsequently described the valuable political effect produced by the medical treatmentof the natives of the country by our doctors. It is a revelation toa backward ignorant race like the Tibetans to find that their con-querors carry humanity to such as extent as to provide themwith free medical attendance, and that such marvellous curescan be effected (as for instance cataract, etc.) in the case of dis-eases and disfigurements which they regarded as incurable andpermanent. 39 The political value of the medical officer's presence was to be a con-stant refrain in reports from Tibet throughout the British period. Theirwork was described as being 'of great political value' and the dispensaryas, 'doing useful work both from a medical and a political point ofview'. 40It was explained in internal correspondence that although the Gyantse medical officer was 'officially only M.O. to the [military] escorthere his work is largely political', 41and on several occasions the politi- cal nature of the medical officer's work became explicit. As noted, in1909 Tibet was no longer a significant issue in British Indian diplo-macy and so ambitious Political Officers preferred service elsewhere.From June to December 1909, in the absence of a suitable diplomaticcandidate for the position as Gyantse Trade Agent, Captain Robert Ken-nedy, 42Gyantse medical officer from 1907 to 1910, actually served as both Trade Agent and medical officer, a situation which recurred whenthe medical officer Captain R.L. Vance acted as Trade Agent for the last six months of 1926. Even the remote Gartok Trade Agency and its Indian medical staff had an explicit political role. In 1928, Dr. Kanshi Ram, for example, at- tracted favourable attention by capturing a bandit who attacked hisparty, which included a British officer on an inspection tour. At the of-ficer's suggestion, Dr. Ram was made Gartok Trade Agent in 1929 andhe served in that post until 1941. 43In addition, after Indian indepen- dence, Dr. M.V. Kurian, a Gyantse medical officer in the 1940s, was of- fered the position of Gartok Trade Agent, but having recently married, he declined the remote posting.44 The attributes necessary for a medical officer to be considered a poli- tical asset in the imperial system were similar to those considered de-sirable for a Political Officer. Indeed in the 1930s the Sikkim PoliticalOfficer J.L.R. Weir said of one medical officer (Dr. M.R. Sinclair), that,'as a political asset I have found him of more value than any of theBritish Trade Agents during the past four years'! 45To some extent, the124 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINBritish believed the necessary qualities were provided by the imperial selection process, with both Political and medical officers in this periodalmost invariably selected from youths educated in British publicschools such as Winchester, Marlborough and the Edinburgh Academy. Family ties to imperial service in India were common, as was a sense of 'mission ' allied to confidence in the righteousness of the imperialproject. Both groups required individuals with personal qualities thatincluded tact, the ability to get on with all classes of people, and physi-cal fitness. Recommended candidates were described in such terms as'cheerful', 'temperate', 'a man of strong personality and physique', and'popular with all classes of Tibetans'. 46 This last attribute was crucial. Gyantse was remote from the centres of both imperial power and social life. The conditions under which themedical officers lived and worked were primitive, and whereas theTrade Agents could advance to the senior position of Political Officerin Sikkim, a posting to Tibet offered little in terms of career advance-ment for the medical officers until the creation of the senior post of Ci-vil Surgeon Bhutan and Tibet in 1940. Thus it was necessary for bothpersonal and professional reasons that medical officers enjoyed thecompany of Tibetans and the challenges of medical practice in the pre- vailing culture and conditions. A successful medical officer, such as Major James Guthrie, who served in Lhasa from 1945 to 1949, was the type of person who, 'had a great respect for many of the lamas ... and became personal friendswith several'. 47He also found, as his wife described, that disease was seen at almost every stage of progression as notfound in Britain nor the West where it would have been ar- rested. Of course, this was medically interesting and James once said to me that many Western professors would be thrilled to see many cases that they had only read about themselves. 48 Yet while a number of Political Officers devoted the majority of theircareer to Tibet and became specialists in its history and culture, few ofthe IMS officers seem to have displayed that level of commitment. Ofthe seventeen British doctors who served in Gyantse, only four re- mained for more than the usual two year term and none served longer than three years. In contrast, Political Officers such as Sir Charles Belland Sir Basil Gould remained on the Tibetan frontier for many years.It was not difficult for medical officers to obtain a transfer to a less iso-lated post and as nine of the medical officers served less than the stan-dard term it appears that at least some of them were keen to getaway. 49BIOMEDICINE AND BUDDHIST MEDICINE IN TIBET 125That medical officers' career prospects were unlikely to benefit from service in Tibet may have been a factor here, for doctors such as Steen and Kennedy in the early years, and Sinclair and Morgan in the 1930sappear to have enjoyed their service there and performed well. With the creation of the senior Civil Surgeon position, two officers did re- main for longer than two-year terms. The first was Lt-Colonel JamesHislop, who served as Gyantse medical officer for eighteen months in1923-24 and accompanied the Sikkim Political Officer F.M. Bailey toLhasa in 1924. After being mauled by a bear in 1929, he returned toserve in the senior position from January 1942 until he retired in June1944. 50His terms in Tibet were marked by increases in patient num- bers at the IMS dispensaries and in the amount of work carried out by the medical officer, as well as in greatly improved record keeping. Hi- slop was described by one Gyantse Trade Agent as having 'surviveddrinking more at high altitude than was previously thought possible', 51 and he did not get on well personally with Gould, the Sikkim PoliticalOfficer. But his interest in and concern for Tibet is indicated by thenumber of suggestions he made for improving the biomedical and so-cio-medical situation there. Major [later Lt-Colonel] James Guthrie was also particularly enam- oured of Tibet. Like Hislop, Guthrie was a Scot. Born in Glasgow in1906, he was educated at Strathallen School near Perth and after ayear's preliminary study at the University of Lausanne, he enteredEdinburgh University and graduated with an MBChB in medicine in1930, being commissioned into the IMS the following year. 52Guthrie's first term in Gyantse from September 1934 to November 1936 wasmarred by the death of the Political Officer Frederick Williamson dur-ing a mission to Lhasa in 1935. But Williamson had already been ad- vised by Dr. Hendricks, his personal physician in Gangtok, that he was suffering from uraemia. Although Guthrie had tried to persuade himto return to India when his condition deteriorated, Williamson felt ithis duty to continue. Guthrie was in no way to blame, therefore, andeven the reputation of biomedicine may not have suffered in Tibet ifwe accept the account of a later visitor. The Italian Fosco Maraini re-ported that the Tibetans believed Williamson 's death was due to hishaving angered powerful deities in a Lhasa shrine by photographing them. 53 Guthrie seems to have learned a certain amount of Tibetan during this first posting, something few other medical officers appear to have done, and returning to Lhasa in March 1945 as Civil Surgeon he be-came fluent. This skill must have assisted Guthrie, who was particu-larly successful both in terms of gaining the goodwill of the Tibetansand in advancing the reputation of biomedicine there. For much of hisfirst year in Lhasa he was the only European there, and the friendships126 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINhe developed, particularly with the monastic powers, were of consider- able political importance. Hugh Richardson, the Political Officer whoheaded the Lhasa mission for around eight years in total during theperiod 1937-50 wrote of Guthrie: An apparently growing readiness to undergo operations, andsigns of genuine trust in western medicine on the part of somehigh officials bear witness to Major Guthrie's ability and hardwork. He has the advantage of a fluent command of Tibetan andan understanding of Tibetan customs which add to his popular-ity in a large circle which includes several persons of consider-able political importance. 54 Both Hislop and Guthrie were joined in Lhasa by their wives, anotherfactor that appears to have assisted their social relations with the Tibe-tans, and Mrs Rosalie Guthrie, who had nursing experience, was ableto assist her husband in the Lhasa dispensary. Lhasa was a more con-genial posting than Gyantse, however, being a more cosmopolitan andless windswept location, and this may also have encouraged the CivilSurgeons to remain for longer periods. Issues of race and class As we have seen, the British Raj placed considerable emphasis on themaintenance of prestige, which was seen as a powerful weapon for thedefence of empire. Imperial strategists believed that manifesting animage of power and authority would help deter indigenous resistance and group and individual behaviour was governed by this belief. Given this understanding, the ideal type of officer for service in Tibet wasconsidered to be an individual able to project British prestige, therebyfurthering the political objective of convincing the Tibetans that theirbest interests lay in an alliance with that power. Thus it was consideredthat; 'a good doctor in Lhasa can do a tremendous lot for British pres-tige and no mediocre person should ever be sent there.' 55 To the Political Department, a 'good doctor', one who did well in a political role, had to be of a certain class. The prestige of empire couldonly, it was believed, be properly represented by the officer class; thosewho had been educated in particular codes of behaviour inculcated byBritish social upbringing, public schools, and universities or militarycolleges. Once in British India, such officers learned additional codesof behaviour considered essential to manifest the necessary prestigeand one important skill in this regard was command of the relevant lo-cal language(s). A British imperial officer was expected to be able toBIOMEDICINE AND BUDDHIST MEDICINE IN TIBET 127communicate to the indigenous people in their language, rather than the reverse. Effective medical treatment obviously required physicians who were able to communicate with their patients, but, although IMS officers were required to have learned an Indian language, they were not ex- pected to learn Tibetan. Steen had some command of the language,but engaged a Hindi-speaking Tibetan as an interpreter and, after hissuccessor Captain F.H. Stewart 56reported that neither he nor his hos- pital assistant spoke any Tibetan, the interpreter's position was made apermanent one. 57The choice of an interpreter was no simple matter, mere competence in Tibetan and Hindi or English was not qualifica-tion enough. As Stewart explained: It is ... highly desirable for the extension of friendly relationswith the people that the Medical Officer should be in a positionto be consulted by the better class of Tibetans. To have to em-ploy a man of the coolie class as interpreter in regard to theirprivate affairs would be sufficient to entirely prohibit such con-sultation. 58 O'Connor's request for a permanent interpreter therefore stressed thathe be 'of respectable birth, and attainments'. 59Karma Paul, a clerk for the Deputy Commissioner of Darjeeling who had been educated bothat Ghoom monastery and the Darjeeling High School, was appointedto the post. 60 While class was fundamental to the imperial construction of pres- tige, race was also highly significant, particularly in the early 20thcen- tury. As a result, despite the acknowledged talents of the Younghus- band mission medical assistant Hira Singh, even qualified Indian doc- tors were excluded from Tibet in any but the most junior posts (e.g., ascompounders). The Political Department objected strongly when it wassuggested that Steen 's replacement in Gyantse should be one CaptainD.P. Goil, an Indian. It was claimed that; 'On political grounds it is im-portant that the Medical Officer in a pioneer post like Gyantse shouldbe a European.' 61Goil's appointment was thus cancelled and Stewart, a Scotsman, replaced him. In rejecting 'Indians', the Political Department were actually refer- ring primarily to Hindus, who made up the vast majority of the popu-lation of British India (with numerous Muslims being in Princelystates). The Himalayan Buddhists were not regarded as 'Indians', ascan be seen from subsequent recruitment policies. In 1909, claimingthat the Indians hitherto used as hospital assistants in Tibet were,'handicapped by their inability to speak Tibetan, by the difference oftheir religion and by their ignorance of the habits of the people',128 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINCharles Bell, the Political Officer in Gangtok, recommended training youths from Sikkim to replace them.62 While a belief in the racial inferiority of 'Indians' was common at the time, Bell's apparent prejudice may have reflected the belief that Hindu caste restrictions made the essential diplomatic task of socialis- ing problematic for them. Bell certainly displayed no prejudice againstEurasians, who many in the Empire saw as inferior to racially pure In-dians. He was a friend of the Anglo-Sikkimese Trade Agent in Yatung,David Macdonald, and in 1920 he was accompanied to Lhasa by theEurasian Dr. Dyer, until Lt-Colonel Kennedy became available. Tracesof the prejudice against Eurasians may be detected in Kennedy's damn-ing Dyer with the faint praise that he was; 'quite good professionally - quite above the average of his class ... quite sound as a G.P.' 63 A bias against Hindus guided the imperial deployment of manpower in Tibet until the 1940s, when it became increasingly clear that India would become independent, and that it was thus necessary to developa cadre of Indians with experience in Tibet to succeed the British. Butno Indians were ever employed as Political Officers in central Tibet,and even in the medical posts Indians were kept from occupying thesenior positions. 64After 1940, when Lhasa became the effective centre of the British medical project in Tibet and the importance of Gyantsewas reduced, there was a transitory period after Captain C.W.A. Searledeparted Gyantse in October 1940, with the Eurasian Christian Dr. G.F. Humphreys serving there until March 1944, and then an IndianChristian, Captain M.V. Kurian, taking over. Only when he left in No-vember 1945 were Hindu Indians posted to Tibet. Bell's suggestion that Sikkimese be trained as medical assistants fol- lowed the failure of efforts to recruit suitable Tibetans, something that had long been an issue of concern to the British. Communication be- tween the two peoples required the use of local intermediaries whowere familiar with both cultures, and who could explain one to theother. Attempts to develop suitable intermediaries had begun as earlyas 1874, when the Bhutia Boarding school was established in Darjeel-ing to train local Tibetan-speaking youths as 'interpreters, geographersand explorers, who may be useful if at any future time Tibet is openedto the British '. 65The Bhutia school project did not prove to be a suc- cess, however. None of the youths from the school were 'found to be ofany real service, either as interpreter or in any other capacity' on theYounghusband mission, and when O'Connor was posted to Gyantse hesuggested employing suitable local Tibetans and training them to servethe British. 66 Both the practical needs of day-to-day operations in the Gyantse hos- pital and the wider aim of modernising Tibet required that Tibetansshould take up the practice of biomedicine. In Tibet, as in Sikkim,BIOMEDICINE AND BUDDHIST MEDICINE IN TIBET 129Bhutan and elsewhere, the British frontier officers wanted to see indi- genous youths trained in Western medicine. They understood medicalscience as a beneficent and universally applicable system of truths andthe modernisation of Tibet, seen by the British both as inevitable and as a process to be encouraged, required the indigenisation of biomedi- cine. Local practitioners, once trained by the British, could then inau-gurate the development of a state medical system, with medical educa-tion and training itself becoming indigenised. As early as December 1904, O'Connor reported that he had dis- cussed the idea of medical training for Tibetans with the PanchenLama. When the Lama 'cordially agreed, but said the Lhasa Govern-ment would have to be consulted', O'Connor asked his government for permission to take four youths, two from Lhasa and two from Shigatse, who would work at the Gyantse dispensary for a year, receive furtherschooling in Darjeeling, and then be trained in medical work 'as far asconsidered feasible'. He went on to point out that; 'Apart from the prac-tical good which real Tibetans so trained should be able to effectamongst their countrymen, the political results would also ... prove va-luable to us.' 67 Imperial government, however, was rarely as enthusiastic about such grand schemes as its 'men-on-the-spot'. Both financial considerationsand wider global concerns acted as a brake on such plans and the Gov-ernment of India was evidently reluctant to sanction the increased in-volvement in Tibetan affairs implied by O'Connor's proposal. It wasfive months before they replied that; 'you should avail yourself of anyopportunity that may occur for encouraging the Tibetan authorities tosend [medical] students to India without appearing to press them to doso'. 68Although O'Connor took this less than enthusiastic response as sanction for his proposal,69the fact that he was almost entirely out of contact with the 'Tibetan authorities' in Lhasa meant that he couldmake no real progress in this regard. The Gyantse dispensary did em-ploy some Tibetan youths for 'menial duties', 70and it was doubtless hoped that they would be attracted to a biomedical career, but appar-ently none of them were. At that time, however, Tibetan trainees were hardly likely to be of immediate value in the medical field because training in Western bio- medicine essentially required a Western education. Educated Tibetans learned an entirely different worldview to that inculcated even by Brit-ish education in India and at that time there were probably no residentTibetans with a Western education. The processes by which biomedicalpractitioners were trained in Kalimpong-Darjeeling and Sikkim weretherefore absent, and an essential first step towards producing Tibetanbiomedical practitioners was the introduction of Western education toTibet. A series of rather unsuccessful initiatives in that direction were130 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINthus promoted by the British during the ensuing decades. The Yatung Trade Agent David Macdonald and his wife ran a small primary schoolin Yatung, but the missionary schools in India and Sikkim did not at-tract Tibetans in the early years, and although four Tibetan youths were sent to Rugby School in England in 1913, the experiment was not a success. 71An English school existed in Gyantse from 1923-26, but was closed as part of a general Tibetan movement against modernisation atthat time, 72and another operated in Lhasa for a few months in 1944 but also foundered on conservative opposition.73Although some Tibe- tans did send their children to Western schools in India in the 1930sand '40s, only a handful of Tibetans were ever educated in the Westernsystem. With no Tibetan candidates emerging, Bell made his proposal that two young 'Bhutias' [i.e., Tibetan-speaking Buddhists] from Sikkim betrained in in Tibet. 'There will', he ar-gued 'be considerable political advantage to be derived from showingthe people of Tibet people of their own race doing medical work afterbeing trained in a medical college in India.' 74As a result of Bell's in- itiative, the young Sikkimese, Bo and Tonyot Tsering, were sent from aBhutia school in Gangtok to Temple Medical school in Patna to train as sub-assistant surgeons. Tonyot proved the more able pupil, with Bo initially failing both his second and third year examinations, and To-nyot was posted to Gyantse in March 1913 to assist the medical officerthere, Captain G.B. Harland IMS. 75Bo Tsering eventually qualified and was posted to Gyantse in October 1915, with Tonyot then transferringto take charge of the dispensary at Yatung. As Harland left soon afterand was not replaced due to wartime shortages, 76Bo Tsering was effec- tively the Gyantse medical officer until a British IMS officer arrived in September 1922.77 Although the British maintained a monopoly on the senior medical positions in Tibet down to 1949, Bell's initiative in recruiting Sikki- mese to the assistant posts was an extremely significant one. The Tser-ings served in Tibet for around 30 years and it appears that the Tibe-tans, at least initially, preferred to consult these Sikkimese, who spoketheir language and shared much of their culture. As Charles Bell notedin 1916; 'the two Sikkimese sub-assistant surgeons ... have both done well. ... Being of Tibetan stock, they are trusted by the people'. 78 While Tonyot generally remained in Yatung, where he was effectively in sole charge of the small dispensary there, Bo served in Gyantse and, after 1936, was usually based in Lhasa, which both he and Tonyot hadpreviously visited with missions by the Sikkim Political Officer. From1937-40 and on occasion later, Bo was in medical charge at Lhasa,otherwise serving under the Civil Surgeon there. 79Although the Brit- ish privately referred to sub-assistant surgeons as 'sub-assistant assas-BIOMEDICINE AND BUDDHIST MEDICINE IN TIBET 131sins',80they probably shared the joke with the anglophile Tserings, who were highly regarded by their superiors. Both men were awarded the titles of Rai Sahib and then the higher Rai Bahadur, and in 1943the Sikkim Political Officer credited Bo Tsering with maintaining the Gyantse and Yatung hospitals in better condition than the Lhasa hospi- tal, which was then under Lt-Colonel Hislop's command. 81But paper- work was not their forte. Bo Tsering's annual reports from Gyantse were sometimes less than half a page, and after Captain Morgan de-parted in February 1937, no medical records were kept in Lhasa until1942. 82But administrative skills were traditionally not of great concern to Political Officers, what was of considerably more significance wasthat Bo's, 'popularity with the Lhasa people is immense'. 83While what was considered as the innate quality of manifesting prestige was an es-sential foundation for British officers to serve in Tibet, it was that abil-ity to 'get on ' with Tibetans that was vital when stationed there, andwhich in the British understanding equated to political capital. An alternative perspective on Bo Tsering can be found in the account of an American aircrew that crashed in central Tibet in December1943. After ten days, they were met by a party under Bo's commandthat had been sent from Lhasa to assist them. The Americans were im- pressed with neither Bo's medical skills nor what they described as his 'high-handed' attitude toward the Tibetan villagers. 84But under the conditions that then existed in Tibet, medical practice was probably notup to US Air Force standards, and Bo's behaviour towards the villagersmay have been typical of that of Tibetan and British officials at thetime, and only 'high-handed' from the more egalitarian American per-spective. It may also reflect an autocratic behaviour that the Britishconsidered consistent with the maintenance of prestige. On the Indo-Tibetan frontier, these issues of race and class were highly complex processes and cannot easily be reduced to fixed modelseven at a given point in time. A blurring of identities and a less formalsociety than that which existed at the imperial centres was characteris-tic of the frontier, which accommodated a wide range of characters. In-dividuals surmounted general prejudices, attitudes changed, and prag-matism generally ruled over ideology. But it does appear that in thissetting class was a more significant historical agent than race. In the Himalayas, the British found an environment and a Buddhist society that they generally liked and admired, in great contrast to their com-mon view of the Indian plains. After initial hostilities, the British fron-tier officers, who held high rank in the imperial social structure, goton well with the Himalayan aristocracies, particularly the Sikkimese,but also the Tibetans and Bhutanese. Men like the Tserings were justthe kind of cosmopolitan individuals the British hoped their encounterwould produce. The British attitude toward these people was, as Lionel132 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINCaplan concluded in regard to their relations with the Gurkhas, 'pater- nal',85but their shared class interests with the local elites united them more than race (and religion) separated them. While encouraging aspects of modernity the British had no desire to disrupt the traditional Himalayan class structures, and although atti-tudes changed in the last years of the British presence the elites contin-ued to be seen as the key class in local society. As an IMS officer in the1940s put it; 'as much as we may dislike autocracy ... one must culti-vate the powers in the land if one is to have any influence.' 86The Brit- ish did seek to appeal to all classes of the indigenous people, but theirprimary concern was with the formation of alliances of interest withthe local elites in pursuit of political consent. Thus the democratic rhetoric associated with the medical modernisation project masked a two-tier system of biomedicine in Tibet. As Captain Kennedy de-scribed, most of the patients coming to the hospital belong to a lower so-cial scale ... the better class people naturally dislike minglingwith the poorer classes in hospital but they frequently eithersend for medicines or come and see me privately. 87 This system, which also pertained in the Indian Princely states, wasmaintained throughout the British period. While the rest of society at-tended the dispensary for treatment, the Himalayan elites were able tohave private consultations. 88For both the Tibetans and the British, such social gradations were perfectly normal, but the two-tier systemmust also have served to indicate to the elites that modernisation didnot necessarily threaten their traditional social position, an understand- ing that assisted in implanting the new medical system within Tibetan society. The British certainly encouraged the idea of biomedical development as part of the imperial efforts to guide Tibet along the path of moderni-sation on the Western model. Bell and his fellow frontier officershoped that they could institute the training of Tibetans in biomedicine,and saw the use of the Sikkimese as a step in that direction. While theyhad few lasting successes the Tibetans do appear to have favoured the concept of a state public health system centred on hospitals and medi- cal dispensaries. In the period 1910-13, when the 13 thDalai Lama was in exile in India he had frequent discussions with Charles Bell andmust have been made aware of the benefits of the system under devel-opment in India. After he returned to Tibet, a public hospital - theMen-ze khang - was opened in Lhasa in 1916. The treatment system at this hospitalwas, however, sowa rigpa .BIOMEDICINE AND BUDDHIST MEDICINE IN TIBET 133The general concept of a free hospital was clearly appropriate to Bud- dhist ideas of compassion, and its establishment appropriate to the ac- tions of a leader seen as an emanation of Avalokites \u00b4vera. The choice of indigenous medicine rather than biomedicine as the system practised at this hospital might be seen as a nationalist gesture, but we lack sources here, and that decision may have been based on a number offactors, including economics, the availability of personnel, and the poli-tical need to gain the support of the monastic powers, whose voice theDalai Lama would only reluctantly ignore. There were few other such developments. Public toilets were con- structed in Lhasa in the 1920s, but rather than a Tibetan public healthinitiative this seems to have been at the behest of Rai Bahadur Laden La, a Sikkimese Buddhist police officer in Darjeeling who was sent to Lhasa to institute a police force. 89Tibetans did not take up biomedi- cine as a profession in this period, and it was to remain the preserve offoreign practitioners down to the Chinese takeover of Tibet in 1950.But there are occasional references suggesting individual Tibetans tak-ing an interest in biomedicine, a monk in the 1920s, for example, re-questing that the British medical officer teach him surgery, 90and in Lhasa in 1920-21, Dr. Kennedy established links with the Men-ze khang hospital. He imported equipment for preparing calf lymph, pre- senting this to 'the Chief Tibetan 'medico', Men-tsiba Lama, whom I in-structed ... how to vaccinate a calf and to collect and prepare the lymphin due course.' 91Little or nothing came of these links in the short term, but Geoffrey Samuel has suggested that the founding of theMen-ze khang in Lhasa was a significant step; 'from the spiritual tothe pragmatic in the practice of Tibetan medicine. In entering a statesystem, Tibetan doctors were pre-adapted to the pragmatic encounter with Western biomedicine in India.' 92 Smallpox vaccination in Tibet While the Government of India established medical dispensaries there for political reasons, the British did have one serious public health con-cern in regard to Tibet: smallpox. Throughout recorded history, out- breaks of smallpox had regularly devastated Tibet, where the crowded conditions in monasteries and urban centres favoured the rapid spreadof the disease. 93 It appears that the Tibetans did have a knowledge of variolation as a means of preventing smallpox. Ahmad Shah, an Indian Christian wholived in Ladakh, reported that the 'scab of the small-pox is dried andswallowed', 94and Sarat Chandra Das (see below) reported that, 'the lymph taken from an infected child and mixed with camphor was in-134 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINhaled though the nostril'.95But given that both Dalai and Panchen La- mas (who presumably received the highest standard of indigenous medical care) were among those who had suffered or died of the dis-ease, efficacious indigenous treatment must be in doubt. 96 It appears that once the disease manifested itself, the Tibetans had no real treatment for it except isolation. The Jesuit Desideri, writing inthe 18 thcentury, noted: Every ten or twelve years an epidemic of smallpox carries offmany people. It is so deadly because anyone showing symptomsof the malady is driven out of his house into the country, whereunder a tent, exposed to the bitter cold and the bad weather he is shunned by all save perhaps some relation who has had smallpox. 97 Chinese records indicate that; 'In 1794, the Tale \u00b4[Dalai] lama, under or- ders from the Emperor, erected special hospitals for small-pox patients,in which they were supplied with food and every necessary, and whichwere under the care of a special officer'. 98European accounts, however, imply that hospitalisation was unknown in Tibetan society and this in- itiative must have been short-lived. Bogle and Hamilton 's visit had meant the Shigatse authorities were at least aware of vaccination by the 1770s, although there is no record of its use in Tibet until the visit of the Moravian missionary Pagell in1867 (noted in chapter one). During the 19 thcentury, when the British introduced vaccination against smallpox into their Indian empire, thespread of its renown was stimulated by imperial agents such as SaratChandra Das, the Bengali headmaster of the Bhutia Boarding school in Darjeeling. A British intelligence agent who twice visited Shigatse and reached Lhasa in 1881, he cultivated the friendship of the Panchen La-ma's Prime Minister who arranged for him to make a semi-clandestinevisit to Lhasa. There was an outbreak of smallpox in Tibet at the time,which fatally infected the then Panchen Lama, and the Bengali's hostwas keen to introduce vaccination. Chandra Das arranged for suppliesof vaccine to be sent to Shigatse from India, but the batch was spoiledand after the Lhasa authorities discovered Chandra Das's mission the Shigatse Prime Minister was executed for assisting him, ending this particular chapter of cross-border initiatives. 99 In India, however, the vaccination project was gradually achieving its clinical aims in regard to the prevention of smallpox. These aims werethreatened, however, by external sources of the disease and it was re-cognised that the trade route from central Tibet to Sikkim and easternIndia could as easily become a route for the passage of smallpox. In1900, following an outbreak in Tibet that spread to the Chumbi Valley,BIOMEDICINE AND BUDDHIST MEDICINE IN TIBET 135the Government of India closed the Jelap la route from Chumbi to In- dia until, 'arrangements were made for vaccinating all those whocrossed the border into Sikkim and every bale of wool was fumigatedat Kalimpong as it arrived there in order to prevent the disease reach- ing India'. This caused 'considerable loss and annoyance to traders,' with the annual cross-border trade declining by a third. 100Given that trade was the most public rationale for the opening of Tibet, and thatpromoting the interests of local Indian cross-border traders was part ofthe strategy for ensuring the security of the frontier, it was importantto avoid such disruptions. Therefore, after the British established a position in Tibet, they were keen to encourage smallpox vaccination there. The Political Officer Sik- kim advised that 'a proper and unified system of vaccination should be carried out all along this frontier as well as in Tibet and Bhutan ' 101and with the economic need implicit, the Director-General of the IMSpointed out the humanitarian, medical, and political benefits. He statedthat vaccination seems to be very desirable from a humanitarianpoint of view, and will in some degree protect our own territory from the introduction of smallpox. It is also a means of impress- ing the natives. 102 A 'bridge-head' for vaccination at an elite level in Tibet already existedin that most of the ruling elites in the British-controlled Himalayan re-gions had already accepted vaccination. The half-brother of the Mahara-ja of Sikkim, for example, was a British ally with estates in Tibet wherehe resided, and such individuals must have assisted in promoting an understanding of the benefits of vaccination to their Tibetan counter- parts. Apparently only a handful of Tibetans were vaccinated during and immediately after the Younghusband mission, 103but in May 1905, Steen firstly vaccinated the Tibetan servants and followers attached tothe Gyantse Trade Agency and then instituted a vaccination campaignfor local children. He recruited three 'intelligent Tibetans' and in-structed them in the necessary procedure, while approaching the Gyantse 'Jongpon ' [rdzong dpon : District Administrator] and 'all the leading men ' to explain the benefits of vaccination. Steen later reported that they, 'were unanimous that it would be an excellent measure andall promised to assist in bringing children forward'. These 'leadingmen ... rendered great assistance' and by the end of 1905, 1,320 chil-dren in the Gyantse area had been vaccinated. 104 It is interesting that Steen was at pains to point out:136 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINNo compulsion of any kind, it is needless to say, was resorted to. When the people saw that the application of the vaccine causedlittle or no discomfort and when they understood that the mea-sure was intended to prevent small pox the children were brought forward quite voluntarily. 105 Given that obtaining the support of the indigenous elites was a crucial aspect of British political strategy in regard to the imposition of imper-ial authority, the most significant medical initiative of this period in-volved the Panchen Lama. As the focus of the political agent CaptainO'Connor's attempts to obtain an alliance with the Tibetan authorities,the consent of the Panchen Lama to vaccination was critical. Late in 1905, O'Connor persuaded him to visit India, and Tibetan tradition dic- tated that several hundred members of the Panchen 's court accompanyhim. Before they departed in November 1905, the entire party of Tibe-tans, including the Panchen Lama himself, were vaccinated againstsmallpox. An account of the event by Steen 's interpreter, Karma Paul,hints at the important role these intermediaries played in the medicalencounter: At first He [the Panchen Lama] was afraid of an injection, placedHis hands on my forehead and then asked me about my experi-ences regarding this matter. Having shown Him the marks onmy arm (dating from my schooldays), I was injected before Hisvery eyes. Now no longer reluctant He sat down on the verychair I had just risen from. 106 Steen accompanied the party to India and on its return in February 1906, he escorted the Panchen back to Shigatse and remained there for a fortnight, presumably in case any diseases contacted in Indiashould manifest during that period. That was a very real danger asamong the many members of the Tibetan 's party who had became illon the journey to India was the Panchen Lama's uncle, who died ofmalaria in Darjeeling. He had, however, failed to take the preventativesprovided by Steen and the Gyantse diary, in headmasterly tone, claimsthat; 'The Lama and other Tibetans thoroughly understand that his death was due to his neglect to follow Captain Steen 's advice, or to take European medicines'. 107 In a farewell conversation prior to his departure from Shigatse, Steen conversed with the Panchen 'chiefly about medical topics and ri-fles'. In regard to the former, Steen reported that the Panchen Lama'expressed a wish that I might introduce vaccination into Shigatse'. 108 However, we need to treat these British reports with some caution; itwas common practice for the imperial officers to persuade indigenousBIOMEDICINE AND BUDDHIST MEDICINE IN TIBET 137rulers to agree to, or to adopt a particular policy favoured by the imper- ial power, but to attribute the credit for the initiative to the local rulerin order to avoid any charge of interference in internal affairs. The in-itiatives in fact developed from a complex interplay of personal rela- tions, aims, ideas and circumstances. But by October 1906, when Steen left Tibet, the British vaccination project appeared to be developing well. The vaccination of the Panchen Lama was regarded as a clear signal that the Tibetans viewed the pro-cess favourably (and in later years this precedent was regularly cited asevidence of that). But the British medical initiatives in Tibet then suf-fered a serious setback. In occupying, but then withdrawing from Lha-sa, the British had left a power vacuum in Tibet. Whitehall refused to allow the Government of India to strengthen the British position there, and Russia had proved to have no power there at all. So, with the DalaiLama in exile and a politically weak Regent as the nominal head of theTibetan state, the Chinese were able to fill the power vacuum in Lhasa.They considered Tibet as part of their empire, and although by 1900their position there had declined to the point that they lacked any realpolitical power, their authority over Tibet was recognised by the Britishgovernment and represented by diplomatic representatives (the Am- bans), who were stationed in Lhasa. After the Younghusband mission withdrew, the Ambans slowly began to reassert their former power. As a part of their strategy, the Chinese sought to weaken or elimi- nate the British positions in Tibet. They posted a skilled diplomat, MrGow, to Gyantse while O'Connor was on leave and his replacement,Lieutenant (later Lt-Colonel) F.M. Bailey, although a highly promisingofficer and a veteran of the Younghusband mission, lacked diplomaticexperience. Gow set about creating various difficulties, including filing a complaint that British vaccination campaigns constituted interference in the internal administration of Tibet, which was forbidden under theterms of the Anglo-Chinese Agreement of 1906. Gow also claimed thatthe British were making vaccination compulsory. 109British officials in India, temporarily bemused, checked with Bailey that vaccination wasnot compulsory, but were clearly uncertain as to whether the medicalinitiatives were technically in breach of their Agreement with China.When Gow asked Bailey 'as a personal favour' to stop all vaccination until further orders were received, Bailey acquiesced, and the campaign was stopped, although no official orders were passed. 110 In April 1907, however, the imperial authorities in the north Indian town of Almora (who were probably unaware of the related events incentral Tibet), received an unexpected request. The Jongpon and the'Head Lama' of Taklakot (in western Tibet, near Gartok), asked for In-dian vaccinators to assist in combating an outbreak of smallpox there[a request with echoes of Pagell's visit in 1867]. The Tibetans pointed138 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINout that the outbreak would affect cross-border trade in the region, and 'expressed their willingness to pay all of the expenses'.111The Deputy Commissioner in Almora promptly sent two vaccinators to Taklakot,and then sought retrospective sanction from the Government of India. Government approved the action, noting that the, 'request on the part of the Tibetan authorities is very satisfactory, as it ... shows they have abelief in our medical skill'. 112The vaccination of the Panchen Lama and his followers was cited as prior evidence of this, and the IndianForeign Secretary observed that the Tibetans appear to realise fully the advantages of vaccinationand this last incident confirms us in the opinion that Mr Gow's action in stopping vaccination at Gyantse was entirely opposed to Tibetan sentiment in the matter. 113 Gow, having effectively established Chinese paramountcy, departed inmid-1907 and Bailey soon raised the issue of resuming vaccination inGyantse with the local Tibetan Trade Agent. Two months later, no ob-jections having been made by any party, the vaccination campaign re-sumed. Confirmation that the Chinese objections were part of a wider agenda and not actually aimed against vaccination per se came the fol- lowing year when China's Amban in Lhasa issued an order that all Ti- betans should be vaccinated. 114 China's support for vaccination in Tibet is evidence of the essential similarity of British and Chinese aims in that region. Both sought toencourage the modernisation of Tibet under their influence but withChina herself following the Western model of modernisation duringthis period, there was no dispute over the model both parties sought to impose. The dominant Western model of development included a state public health system, and so both China and Britain sought to developpublic health structures within Tibet. 115But the prevailing tendencies of the Tibetan government had always been anti-modernist except forthe decade from 1913-23, when there were cautious experiments withaspects of Western modernity. This meant that British and Chinese in-novations in various areas, including medicine, met with conservativeresistance from powerful elements within Tibetan society. As was char- acteristic of Tibetan government, the conservative tendency, or political strategy, emerged in a failure to act, rather than in acts of active resis-tance of the type that are recognised in this context in India. Resistance is indicated by British sources for the first time in the Gyantse dispensary report for 1910. 116When the British resumed their vaccination program in 1907, it was carried out by two Tibetans theyhad trained (probably the men trained by Steen). In the period of 1909to 1910 this pair performed 389 vaccinations, 117and the Gyantse medi-BIOMEDICINE AND BUDDHIST MEDICINE IN TIBET 139cal officer confidently reported that the next outbreak of smallpox would demonstrate the efficacy of vaccination.118So it proved. In the following year there was an outbreak of smallpox which caused numer-ous deaths in Lhasa and Shigatse, but few in Gyantse. The number of vaccinations carried out that year leapt to 2,131, as might be expected. The medical officer's report recorded that: Many vaccinations were performed in the dispensary, when theoutbreak was at its height locally. In addition to this, many Tibe-tans and Chinese officials and gentlemen got me to procurelymph for them on payment to be sent to all parts of the coun-try. The people much appreciate the benefits of vaccination. 119 But along with this positive news the report also noted: On arrival here I found the old vaccinators (2) had been de-manding money to let the people escape vaccination. These menwere dismissed. Only one suitable candidate presented himselffor the post of vaccinator, and I regret to record his death whilevaccinating at Shigatse during a serious outbreak there in De- cember. 120 Earlier indications that the vaccination campaign had not proceeded entirely smoothly may be detected, however. It is interesting that Steenfound it necessary to emphasise the voluntary nature of the vaccinationcampaign a year before Chinese allegations to the contrary, while thefact that the vaccinators were being bribed not to vaccinate people alsolends weight to the Chinese allegation that some form of coercion was used in the process. Of relevance in this regard is an obituary of Dr. Kennedy, Gyantse medical officer in 1907-10 (which was apparentlywritten by his Gyantse contemporary, F.M. Bailey). It notes that Kenne-dy 'vaccinated a large number of the local inhabitants, at first by guile and persuasion , but later at their urgent request'. 121 The British sources do generally paint a bright picture of Tibetans keen to embrace vaccination. Thus in reports around the time of thisoutbreak we read: Tibetans are very appreciative of the value of vaccination; duringone month representatives from villages, many of them five daysjourney from Gyantse, came to hospital to say that smallpox wasraging with them, and asking that the vaccinator be sent out. 122140 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINBut a subsequent report clarified the nature of the Tibetans' enthu- siasm for vaccination. They were, it stated, 'reluctant to undergo vacci-nation unless the disease is actually amongst them '. 123 But the efficacy of vaccination was becoming apparent, with small- pox becoming increasingly rare in Gyantse, where large numbers ofpeople had been vaccinated, and in the Chumbi Valley, where by 1911,the majority of the population had been vaccinated. 124In Shigatse and Lhasa, however, and other parts of Tibet where vaccination had notbeen widely introduced, smallpox was still common. To those who hadbeen vaccinated, the efficacy of the vaccine must have been empiricallyestablished, and Tibetan and Chinese officials were thus, as we haveseen above, already requesting the British to provide them with lymph with which to institute their own vaccination programs. One final indication that vaccination was becoming accepted by the Tibetans came in 1913, when a group of Nepalese vaccinators found it profitable enough to travel around vaccinating people for a small fee. 125 While there were cultural and traditional links between the Tibetansand the Nepalese, relations between the two countries were historicallyhostile and we cannot necessarily conclude, therefore, that the Nepa-lese were in any sense more welcome than British. What was welcome was vaccination. In 1922, a case of smallpox occurred among Tibetan troops in Gyantse and the garrison was subsequently vaccinated in its entirety, the first recorded case of the Tibetan state's personnel being systemati-cally vaccinated. 126In 1925-26, when a smallpox epidemic broke out in central Tibet,127the British vaccination services were greatly in de- mand. Not only were 3,525 people vaccinated in Gyantse, a total prob-ably larger than the population of the town itself at that time, 128but it was noted that none of those previously vaccinated were among thosewho died there. The Tibetan state again signalled its acceptance of vac-cination when they requested the Sub-Assistant Surgeon in Gyantse besent to Shigatse, where he vaccinated a total of 1,379 people. In addi-tion, the Tibetan government 'and various influential officials' receivedfree vaccine from the Government of India. 129 These officials were playing a key role in mediating the introduction of biomedicine into Tibet, lending their local authority to its uptake in and around Gyantse. Some were doubtless involved in this process ear- lier, but with the approval of the Tibetan state their numbers probablyincreased. While those involved in the 1925-26 distribution are notnamed, the 1931 Gyantse annual report identifies Tsarong Shape \u00b4as one such individual. 130Tsarong, a powerful and outward-looking lay aristocrat who had served as Commander-in-Chief of the Tibetan army,was regarded by the British as their key ally and while a strong nation-BIOMEDICINE AND BUDDHIST MEDICINE IN TIBET 141alist he was in some ways a modernist. His support for vaccination is unsurprising. The 1941 Gyantse annual report,131however, indicates that suppor- ters of biomedicine now included important monastic figures. Those receiving vaccine included unnamed Gyantse officials and landlords, along with the Jongpon of Shigatse, confirming local lay political sup-port. But there was also vaccine for the powerful monk-official DzasaLama, and for the Sakya Rinpoche. As head of the Sakya sect of Tibe-tan Buddhism the latter's influence was considerable, and the Britishhad considered him a supporter of biomedicine since he visited theGyantse agency in 1926, and, with 'charming manners', requested vac-cination from the medical officer. 132Support at such a high monastic level must have been essential to the Tibetan state's acceptance of vac-cination. There are some indications of lingering resistance, however; Frank Ludlow, headmaster of the English school that existed in Gyantse from1923-26, noted a woman with smallpox whose family had refused vac-cination on the advice of their lamas. 133But in general the Tibetans had, by the mid-1920s if not earlier, accepted vaccination against small-pox as a medical practice. It was noted that in this sense vaccination was something of an exception; 'Though other forms of European medical treatment are often looked on with suspicion, vaccination isgreatly appreciated by Tibetans of all classes'. 134 It is notable that the Tibetan state's adoption of vaccination came at a time when the confrontation between tradition and modernity wasreaching a climax. After a crisis in 1923-24, the Tibetan state turnedaway from modernity, 135yet against the prevailing tendencies of the era, this aspect of medical modernity was eagerly embraced. By the 1930s, references to smallpox in the British records are devoid of any indications of resistance, and demonstrate an increasingly wide distri-bution network of lymph from the British to outlying areas of Tibetsuch as Poyul and Kham in the east. 136 During the final decade of the British presence in Tibet, tens of thousands of Tibetans were vaccinated annually at the IMS dispen-saries. With virtually the entire population of Gyantse and the ChumbiValley having been vaccinated by the 1940s, 137smallpox was effectively eliminated from central Tibet, saving countless lives. The acceptance ofvaccination was a process and, as we have seen, there were examples ofresistance to it, but we cannot conclude that this was characteristic.The Tibetans' cautious approach cannot necessarily be read as resis-tance. In the final analysis, there was a characteristic learning phasebefore the demonstrable efficacy of the system led to ever-increasing in-digenous demands for vaccination.142 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAIN4 Medical myths and Tibetan trends While they are a unique source for the study of public health in Tibet, the annual reports from the British dispensaries tended to be brief andformulaic. They also reflect the impact of individual medical officers, some of whom were far more active than others in terms of both medi- cal practice and record keeping. These annual reports seem hastilycompiled, with numerous errors and inconsistencies clearly apparent.Conditions reported as common in one report may not be mentionedin the next, and there are also wide fluctuations in dispensary atten-dance figures that are not always explicable in terms of known histori-cal developments and events. These medical records do, however, enable us to analyse specific as- pects of biomedical practice and its reception in Tibet. They indicate,for example, the emphasis that the IMS officers placed on surgery.This partly reflected their participation in the heroic 'cult of the sur-geon ' discussed in the Introduction, and in their complaints over theconditions in which they had to operate there may be detected a noteof pride in their capacity to achieve successful outcomes under suchadverse circumstances. Dr. Kennedy, for example, wrote from Lhasathat; 'I have done 41 cataract operations here and a number of other operations as well - not bad for a singlehanded effort.' 1But this em- phasis also reflected the fact that surgery - at least in the non-invasive form - was a practice known to indigenous medicine, but one in whichthe British were confident their abilities were superior. 2It was thus a field in which the IMS officers could demonstrate the superiority ofWestern biomedicine. Thus we read that on the Younghusband mis-sion, Captain Walton, 'by preference ... selected cases requiring surgicaltreatment'. 3 The conditions under which they operated there made it difficult for the IMS officers to carry out major invasive surgery or other advancedprocedures. This was particularly true of the early period, thereforethey restricted surgery to such operations as correcting hare-lip condi-tions and removing growths. But there was a particular emphasis oncataract surgery, which had the advantage of being a simple operationrequiring only local anaesthetic, but producing spectacular results.These operations were the source of considerable personal satisfactionfor the doctors. For Major Guthrie, for example, it was 'the surgery that he enjoyed most of all'. After restoring a patient's sight he, 'delightedin watching their faces when the bandages were removed and they rea-lised they could see once more'. 4But it was also recognised that the re- storation of a person 's sight had an immediate impact that was of great'propaganda' value for biomedicine. 5Dr. Morgan, for example, recounts how a patient whose sight he restored subsequently treated the hospitalas a shrine, prostrating before it and encouraging others to do so. 6 Although few patients are identified in British records, this was an operation of particular appeal to the literate classes, primarily compris-ing the monastic and aristocratic elites, and the acceptance of cataractsurgery must have been enhanced by its obvious benefits to Tibetan re- ligious practice. Thus we read that: The master (Ge-gyen) of a former Ti Rimpoche of Ganden was very grateful indeed when, after a successful cataract extraction,he was able to resume his beloved reading with the aid ofglasses. 7 Yet even cataract surgery was not accepted unquestioningly by the Tibe- tans; there were complex elements at play. As Dr. Morgan noted in 1937, while cataract surgery was able to restore sight, nevertheless it is curious to relate that no patient would giveconsent to have more than one eye operated upon: their excusesconcerning the second eye were various - usually that a particu-larly holy lama had told them that they could have one eyecured, but if the other was touched then their life would be shor- tened! But perhaps the real reason was that generally they were so excited at having their blindness relieved, that their enthu-siasm to get back to their village or monastery knew nobounds. 8 A particularly interesting aspect of this issue is that, as Alexander Ha-milton 's report (quoted earlier) indicates, cataract surgery was knownin Tibet, and in Hamilton 's time their surgical instruments had been more sophisticated than those of the EIC surgeons. Why, therefore, did Tibetans turn to British surgeons to restore their sight? While it maybe that the skills of the Tibetan practitioners declined during the 19 th century,9or that reputable practitioners of this operation were always rare, Dr. Morgan explained that the local surgical technique ('couch-ing'), while 'better than nothing', only 'dislocated the lens of the eyerather than removing it ...[resulting in] secondary changes that led topermanent blindness.' 10But there may also have been another local144 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINtechnique, for an earlier British report mentions that 'Many eyes are destroyed by the native method of treatment (firing)'.11What is clear is that Western surgical techniques had improved to the point where cat-aract operations were a simple and routine procedure that was almost invariably successful. The interpreter Karma Paul later recorded that the surgical skills of the IMS doctors were appreciated; after an operation to remove a wo- man 's goitre the Tibetans sang, The British government is very gracious,The hospital is very generous,Kindly let us know, Where has [her] goitre gone? 12 British reports tended to emphasise the distance Tibetans had travelled to seek medical treatment for this and other conditions. Thus it is com-mon to read accounts along the lines of 'a man came fifteen day's jour-ney to have his cataract operated on '. 13Dr. Morgan reported from Lhasa in 1937 that amongst the items of particular medical interest are the cases ofcataract blindness, who appear from all directions : the majorityof the patients are elderly monks ... our first case came fromTsona, a 3 weeks journey from Lhasa on the Assam border andhe had been waiting in Lhasa 3 months for our arrival: he wasinstrumental in sending us another case from the same area.Two other cases came from Khongpo in Northern Tibet - theyhad received news by the traders that they could be cured in Lhasa and immediately came a month 's journey post-haste. 14 Similarly, Mrs Guthrie recorded: I have known patients travel a month 's journey on foot over high passes in order to consult James .. [and] ... On another occasiona monk had walked 5 miles with a sucking wound in his chest.It took some weeks for him to recover but he made it. 15 This emphasis on the distance Tibetans were prepared to travel andwait for biomedical treatment is expressed as evidence of the popularityof biomedicine. 16But this was not necessarily the case, it may actually reflect the virtual absence of any medical practitioners in large parts ofTibet. It also seems that indifference to the length and hardships ofjourneys is characteristic of Tibetan culture. Accounts of pilgrimage,for example, pass over the often long and difficult journeys betweenMEDICAL MYTHS AND TIBETAN TRENDS 145sacred sites. The willingness of Tibetans to travel for biomedical treat- ment may be better read as an indication of a willingness to travel foranymedical treatment. Dr. Morgan also noted another issue: Tibetans have a greater fear of anaesthesia than they have of ra-dical methods - it is only when they feel they are faced with noother alternative that they will give their consent to operation ...one always tried to do the necessary work under local anaesthe-sia if possible: we found that under these circumstances theywere rarely demurred from surgical interference ... numerous tooth extractions were carried out, more particularly since the in- troduction of painless dentistry. 17 This may suggest that while the British regarded surgery as a powerfulweapon in the promotion of biomedicine, its acceptance by the Tibe-tans was hindered by a mistrust of elements that appear to involve is-sues of control. As inpatients, or as unconscious patients, control oftheir body was ceded to the IMS doctor, and just as the Tibetans ac- cepted certain benefits from their relationship with the British in the political sphere, while resisting British control over their affairs, so theywere apparently willing to accept certain biomedical practices but wereresistant to those in which they ceded control over their body. As wehave seen, Dr. Shelton, the American missionary, attempted to solvethis problem by putting up glass walls in the operating theatre, appar-ently with some success, but the IMS doctors employed less radicalmethods. It is important to remember that these difficulties decreased with time and are therefore only characteristic of the early period of interac-tion; a learning phase during which trust grew. During this periodthere were also areas beyond the clinical and the scientific where therelationship between British and Tibetan medical understandingsmight be negotiated, and where the biomedical doctor was bestequipped with a practical knowledge of life that was not taught at med-ical school. For example we read a droll account by a Gyantse Trade Agent of their meeting with a Tibetan monk, whose status meant he was not supposed to drink alcohol, although it might be permitted formedical reasons: During lunch the monk explains to the doctor that he has a painin his back, and enquires whether whiskey would be a goodcure. The tactful doctor rises to the occasion, and says that whis-key is what he invariably prescribes for this complaint, and in-146 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINdeed it was only yesterday that he was obliged to administer some to me for a similar attack.18 The myth of venereal disease in Tibet European accounts of the Tibetan medical environment stress the pre-valence of venereal diseases, which were commonly stated to be ende-mic there. F. Spencer Chapman, for example, the secretary on Gould's1936-37 Lhasa mission, wrote one of the best-selling accounts of Tibetin the pre-1950 period. There he stated that the mission doctor's pa-tients were 'nearly all cases of venereal disease'. 19However, not only was that statement untrue, but analysis of medical reports for the peri-od 1904-47 suggests a very different interpretation of this claimed pre-valence. Walton 's report on the medical dispensary accompanying the Young- husband mission makes no mention of venereal disease, and Steen 'sfirst report from his sojourn in Shigatse states that eye diseases were'by far the most common disease met with '. In listing nine main condi-tions encountered, venereal disease is mentioned only in passing. The category of skin diseases includes 'several probably syphilitic affections' and the last category is; 'Uterine cases, several, and a few venereal.' 20 But in his report for the 1905 year, Steen records venereal diseases asforming 15% of his workload and a similar figure may be deduced forthe following year. 21 In 1910, the Gyantse medical officer recorded that 40 of his 444 out- patients and nearly half of his inpatients suffered from syphilis, whichhe noted was 'very common '. The following year his successor recorded 211 venereal cases - nearly 25% of his workload - and stated that syphi- lis was 'much the commonest disease in Tibet'. But he went on to notethat, 'Chinese troops furnish the great majority of those suffering fromsyphilis'. 22In 1911, however, revolution broke out in China. Her troops in Lhasa mutinied and eventually withdrew to India with British assis-tance after intermittent fighting with the Tibetans. Tibet was then freeof all Chinese officials and early in 1913 the Dalai Lama returned fromexile in India and issued what the Tibetans regard as a declaration of independence. In 1912, there were 167 cases of syphilis among the 748 Gyantse out- patients, and 65 - three of whom died - among the 137 inpatients. But the Gyantse dispensary report for that year noted that; 'With the depar-ture of the Chinese troops [from Tibet] in the autumn corresponded adiminution in the number of patients treated for this complaint.' 23Sy- philis was simply noted as ranking with 'injuries and eye diseases' asamong the commonest complaints; although no precise figures wereMEDICAL MYTHS AND TIBETAN TRENDS 147given. It appears, therefore, that the Chinese troops, who had made up almost 40% of Gyantse's outpatients, were the primary cause of highvenereal infection rates in the early period there. 24 The next year for which figures are available, 1923, was nearly a dec- ade later, when it was noted that the 'majority' of the 51 inpatients and78 of the 502 outpatients were suffering from syphilis, the figure beinggiven in the context of their successful treatment by the new drug Sal-varsan. 25While the 1924 report is missing, in the 1925 report venereal diseases are once again classified as the most common complaint, butsubsequent reports note that; 'Most of the cases [are] andoutlying villages', or from 'Lhasa and Shigatse'. 26The figures indicate that throughout the 1920s and 1930s venereal diseases actually com- prised approximately 15% of the medical officers' workload, although by 1934, it was noted that patients were coming not only from Lhasaand Shigatse, but from as far off as Kham, in the east of Tibet. 27 From 1941 onwards, Gyantse medical reports provide far more de- tailed statistical breakdowns, and it is immediately noticeable that thepercentage of venereal diseases, while remaining significant, declines,suggesting conditions previously registered as venereal were now moreprecisely defined. Thus in 1941, 216 cases of venereal disease are re- corded among a total of 2,736 patients, in contrast to 1940, when there were 174 cases of syphilis among a total of 1,072 patients. Syphiliscases now numbered less than half the number of digestive conditionsand less even than the number for injuries caused by dog bites. Duringthe final years of the British presence in Gyantse, venereal diseases didincrease in number, gonorrhoea significantly so, but remained ataround 5% of cases treated. 28 The far briefer annual reports submitted from the dispensary in Ya- tung do not mention venereal diseases until it was noted in the 1935-36 report that; 'Venereal disease is here, in common with the rest of Ti-bet, very rife.' 29Figures are then given in the 1940s that indicate these conditions made up around 12% of the caseload in 1941-42 and 1942-43, but declined to around 5% the following year and remained at thatlevel until the British departure, and that inexplicably there was nopost-war increase such as occurred at Gyantse. 30 The first medical report from Lhasa after the departure of the Young- husband mission was submitted by Lt-Colonel Robert Kennedy in1921. Kennedy, who had served as Gyantse medical officer when Chi-nese troops formed much of the dispensary's clientele, reported that;'There is no doubt that the most prevalent disease in Tibet is syphilis'(something he attributed to 'the casual worship of Venus'). 31Although Kennedy did not provide figures, the next medical officer to visit Lhasa,Major J.H. Hislop, reported after his 1924 visit with the Political Offi-cer F.M. Bailey that, during his month in Lhasa; 'I treated an average148 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINof twenty new cases a day chiefly syphilis, gonorrhoea and minor septic complaints.' He noted that; 'Syphilis in all stages is very rife in Lhasa.Gonorrhoea is also common ... it is hardly possible to take sufficientKharvasan.' 32 After visiting Lhasa in 1930 with the Political Officer Major J.L.R. Weir, Dr. M.R. Sinclair recorded that; 'venereal disease is the chiefcomplaint met with, and it would be no exaggeration to say that quite60% of the population of Lhasa are suffering from it.' 33However, when the British established a permanent mission in Lhasa in 1936-37,the medical officer, Dr. Morgan, submitted a report on the approxi-mately 20,000 cases treated in the first six-month period in which just1,320 cases of syphilis were included, a figure of around 7%. 34 Although the British maintained a permanent medical presence in Lhasa from this time on, regular medical reports were not submitteduntil 1942, when a report on the first five months of that year empha-sised the continuing prevalence of venereal diseases, which appear torepresent around 10% of the daily caseload. 35That figure subsequently increased. In 1943, cases of syphilis as a percentage of new cases repre-sented 11% of the workload (865 cases), in 1944, the percentage was12.5% (793 cases), and in 1945 it reached 15.5% (822 cases). The per- centage of venereal cases including gonorrhoea among new patients at the Lhasa hospital reached 21%. 36 An analysis of these figures is complicated by the various inadequa- cies and inaccuracies in the records. The most obvious problems withthe statistical basis of the figures in this regard are the numerous varia-tions in the method of record keeping. Divisions between 'new' and'old' patients, and even 'in-' and 'out-' patients are not always clear, andgonorrhoea is not recorded with the attention paid to syphilis. The fig- ures are also complicated by the fact that - as the medical officers regu- larly complained - Tibetan patients were not prepared to undergo thefull course of treatment required for the complete eradication of thesediseases, and it seems likely that many of the 'new' patients reportingwith venereal diseases had, in fact, previously undergone treatment forthe same condition. But it is notable that the earliest reports by the IMS officers in Tibet (those of Walton, and Steen 's report from Shigatse), do not suggest ve- nereal disease was a particularly common infection among the Tibe- tans. While such cases comprised approximately 15% of the Gyantsedispensary caseload during the 1905-12 period, a significant percentageof these were Chinese troops. This is confirmed by the decline in thesediseases after the departure of the Chinese forces, and for the next dec-ade the Gyantse reports simply note venereal diseases, along with gen-eral injuries, skin, eye and digestive complaints, as among the morecommon conditions encountered. In the 1920s and 1930s, however,MEDICAL MYTHS AND TIBETAN TRENDS 149the percentage of venereal cases is again given, and it is in double fig- ures. But many of those patients were not from Gyantse but from otherparts of Tibet. With more accurate record keeping in the 1940s, vener-eal cases dropped to around 5%, which is consistent with the figures obtained from the dispensary at Yatung. In the case of the Lhasa dispensary, the early medical reports do em- phasise the prevalence of venereal disease, with the first workable fig- ures, those submitted for the 1936-37 period by Dr. Morgan, indicatinga ratio of around 15% venereal cases. The next set of figures, for 1942,show a decline to around 10%, and while the percentage figure in-creases in the following years, the actual number of cases remains lar-gely unchanged. Only an increase in the number of cases of gonor- rhoea in Lhasa and Gyantse (although not Yatung) in the immediate post-war period is statistically significant. Thus, taking the figures as a general guide, we may state that, de- spite exaggerated claims such as those of Dr. Sinclair, venereal diseasesactually formed an average of 5-15% of the medical caseload of the IMSofficers in Tibet during the period 1904-47. For a number of reasons,however, these figures do not appear to provide an accurate picture ofactual infection rates. 37The Gyantse reports indicate that the dispen- sary attracted venereal patients from as far away as Kham, the eastern-most province of Tibet, as well as from Shigatse and Lhasa, thus inflat-ing the percentage of venereal patients among those attending. Whentaken into account with the first medical report from the Younghus-band mission indicating Tibetans were resorting to IMS doctors for awide range of conditions (few of which were venereal), this suggeststhat after initial experimentation, the Tibetans rapidly concluded thatthe British method of treating venereal diseases was superior to their own. They were probably influenced in this conclusion by the Chinese, whose troops already had faith in biomedical cures for these conditionsand passed on that faith to the Tibetans. It is notable that in the 1940s, when the Chinese opened a biomedi- cal hospital in Lhasa in competition with the British hospital, Tibetanscontinued to go to British doctors for this particular condition. The Ci-vil Surgeon reported that for some reason the effect of the Chinese hospital was less oncases of syphilis than on other cases, in other words it appearsTibetans lost less faith temporarily in our treatment of syphilisthan of other diseases. 38 The British medical reports thus appear to indicate that venereal dis-ease was not particularly common among Tibetans at the time of theYounghusband mission. Following the establishment of the IMS dis-150 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINpensaries, however, large numbers of Chinese soldiers resorted for this complaint, while those Tibetans suffering from these conditions cameto favour British biomedical treatment in the belief that this offeredthe most efficacious cure. As was the case with smallpox vaccination, therefore, the understanding of biomedical efficacy for a particular complaint was crucial to the Tibetan acceptance of the cure. Those pa-tients suffering from conditions that they considered the indigenousmedical systems could treat effectively were less likely to consult theIMS dispensaries. 39Biomedical efficacy in regard to venereal condi- tions thus affected the attendance statistics and gave the British an un-balanced picture of Tibetan health conditions. Ironically, the willing-ness of the IMS officers to treat venereal diseases may actually have as- sisted their acceptance by the Tibetans, as Dr. Morgan concluded: 'It seemed that as long as we confined our attentions to the lower ordersand functioned as the poor man 's doctor, pox doctor's apothecary andprostitutes' friend, we would be tolerated.' 40 It is notable, however, that whereas there was a period (of around two decades) in which there was some cultural resistance to smallpoxvaccination, the only sense in which any resistance to biomedical treat-ment of venereal diseases can be detected is in regard to the fact that it took several decades before Tibetans gradually came to accept the ne- cessity for repeated treatments to ensure the complete eradication ofthese diseases, rather than simply the disappearance of their immedi-ate symptoms. Although the British attributed this to the Tibetans' ig-norance of biomedical procedures, extended periods of treatment werecommonplace in the indigenous medical understandings. According tothe 18 th-century Jesuit missionary Desideri, this was true of venereal disease treatment for which he records that the Tibetans' remedy, 'cures quickly, but not permanently, and must be repeated often '.41 The Tibetans tardiness in undergoing repeated treatment need not, however, be read as resistance. It appears that from their experience of other aspects of biomedicine they understood biomedicine as havingimmediate effect, and the prompt disappearance of immediate symp-toms of venereal diseases may have reinforced that concept. Reluctanceto undergo continuing treatment may in fact be evidence for faith in abiomedical cure, albeit a faith based on an understanding that biomedi- cine offered immediate cures. One other significant issue is the question of cultural understand- ings of disease. In contrast to the neighbouring civilisations of China and India, sexual relations in Tibet proceeded more on modern Wes-tern lines; virginity was not highly prized or essential to marriageamong any classes. Women enjoyed more economic and social free-dom than those in neighbouring societies and both sexes enjoyed a de-gree of sexual freedom. One consequence of this may have been thatMEDICAL MYTHS AND TIBETAN TRENDS 151venereal diseases did not carry the social stigma they bore in imperial British understandings, which were more in line with those of the elitecultures of China and India. This may be reflected in the British medical reports from Tibet. It is notable that the Yatung reports do not mention venereal disease untilthe mid-1930s, nor do the Gyantse dispensary reports during the 1913-22 period. In both cases, the absence of a British doctor there may havebeen a factor. The Yatung dispensary was staffed for most of this peri-od by the Sikkimese Tonyot Tsering, and his contemporary Bo Tseringtook charge in Gyantse from December 1915 until September 1922.The absence of any mention of venereal conditions during that periodmight suggest that, despite their biomedical training, the Sikkimese medical staff did not regard these conditions as serious enough to be worthy of particular mention. Yet in Lhasa in the 1930s, Bo Tseringran a separate clinic for monks suffering from venereal diseases, 42so the issue is complex. Given the Victorian codes of morality prevailing among the officer class of the British imperial system, some condemnation of the sexualmores of the Tibetans could be expected. Thus one British report de-scribes how: The causes of this distressing prevalence [of venereal disease]are the same as elsewhere, ignorance and promiscuity. In acountry where morals are as loose as almost to be non-existent,prostitutes are unnecessary, it is not a recognised profession andno brothels (unless certain loose-living nunneries can be calledso) exist. Very little is thought of venereal disease but there is acertain fear of it - a small number of cases ask for injections following sexual intercourse with an infected partner and a few parents knowing themselves to be infected fear the conse-quences to their children and bring them for injection. Extra-marital intercourse is condemned [but] it is quite common for ahusband to bring for treatment his wife infected during hisabsence. The prevalence of venereal disease can be said to beanother indication of the backwardness of the country andpeople. 43 It would be easy, however, to take out of context the type of moral jud-gements implied here. While framed with expressions of the prevailingBritish mentality, the report gives an empirical account in a medicalcontext, and the venereal disease issue was not usually stressed in thesort of public forum where opinions of the Tibetans were formed.Knowledge of the prevalence of venereal diseases was kept largely with-in the imperial system, for, as noted in the Introduction, the Govern-152 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINment of India's officers were interested in presenting Tibet in a posi- tive light as part of their policy of strengthening the Tibetan state as asecurity 'buffer' for their northern frontier. After the conflicts of theYounghusband era had given way to an alliance of interests between the British-Indian and Tibetan ruling elites, the imperial presentation of Tibet in press releases and authorised publications was overwhel-mingly positive, and any emphasis on the prevalence of a disease gen-erally regarded by Europeans in a negative context would have beencounter to the prevailing, and politically important, positive dis-course. 44 The influence of Sir Basil Gould, the Political Officer for Sikkim, Bhutan and Tibet during the period 1935-45 may also have been a fac- tor here. While a broad strategic thinker, Gould also characteristically focused considerable attention on specific, although not always signifi-cant, issues. 45As will be seen in the following chapter on Bhutan, Gould became concerned that the populations of his Himalayan stateswere declining, and concluded that that decline was primarily due tothe long-term effects of venereal diseases. Gould's personal concernwith this issue increased its prominence in the records, and may haveinfluenced the medical officers to give the matter more attention than they would otherwise have done. The issue is, for example, only men- tioned in the available Yatung reports after Gould's appointment to Sik-kim, and it is only in the 1940s that the British began active steps ateducating Tibetans in the prevention of these diseases, with the medi-cal officer distributing information pamphlets 'to patients and theirfriends'. 46 Accepting biomedicine in Tibet Imperial confidence in biomedical supremacy fostered the assumptionthat it would rapidly triumph over indigenous medical practices. Earlyreports from Tibet are thus buoyant; Younghusband's Lhasa dispensary'was very popular from the beginning', while 'crowds of sick peopleflocked to Captain Steen 's [Shigatse] dispensary daily'. 47But by March 1906, when he filed the first report on the operations of the Gyantse dispensary, Steen had already identified selectivity in the Tibetan recep- tion of biomedicine. He described how: At first the Tibetans seemed rather afraid of associating them-selves in any way with us and only came to the hospital in twosand threes. This was rather due to fear of their own people andto the unsettled state of the district generally than to dread of us... The confidence of the people has now been gained, I think,MEDICAL MYTHS AND TIBETAN TRENDS 153especially with reference to cases requiring operation or active treatment, wounds, ulcers, abscesses, skin and venereal diseases,etc. 48 Forty years later, the medical officer in Lhasa reported: It is now commonly believed that our treatment of wounds andinjuries including fractures is effective, injections for syphilisare very popular, extraction of cataracts is the only surgical pro-cedure to which the Tibetan will not only willingly submit butactually seek. There is less belief in our 'internal medicine' andpermission to open an abdomen will only be given as a last re- sort. 49 Similar comments abound in all of the periods studied. The Tibetan adoption of biomedicine was selective. Tibetans rapidly identified thoseconditions for which biomedicine seemed most efficacious and soughtout biomedical treatment for them. What the sources do not reveal isthe extent to which Tibetans were simultaneously undergoing indigen-ous treatment either in the sense of physical intervention or through religious rituals. The rapidity with which Tibetans identified certain biomedical cures as more efficacious than their own may well derive from the treatment given to their wounded soldiers during the Younghusband mission.The treatment of wounds was subsequently a mainstay of the IMS doc-tors' work in Tibet. Along with bites from the large and aggressivebeasts that Tibetans kept as guard dogs there were injuries inflicted byhumans, for as one report noted, 'wounds are very common, as the Ti- betans, especially the Lamas have a bad habit of stabbing each other with knives'. 50 Similarly, the biomedical doctors' ability to heal broken bones - also displayed on the Younghusband mission - was rapidly acknowledgedand commonly resorted to. In the summers, Tibetan children flewkites from the rooftops of their houses and there were inevitably ser-ious falls as the excited children followed their kites over the edge.Along with falls from horses, these accidents provided a steady stream of patients at the British dispensaries. It was noted that their treat- ment; 'brought a considerable amount of \"Kudos\" to the hospital as Ti-betans expect deformity and restriction of movement after any frac-ture.' 51Efficacy appears therefore, to have been a critical factor in the Tibetans' acceptance of biomedical treatment for these conditions. The Tibetans did not, however, adopt the complete biomedical 'pack- age', nor did biomedicine necessarily become the patients' first resorteven for those conditions where biomedical efficacy was acknowledged.154 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINThe British sources inevitably explain the Tibetans' reluctance to resort to their dispensaries as due to the opposition of the Lamas, who put obstacles in the way of people coming for treatment. The reason is not far to seek, as the dispensary interferes with the fees of the Lamas who are ex-orcists for all manner of ghosts and demons to whom diseaseand even injury are universally ascribed. 52 Thus the IMS doctors found that; 'in many cases, it is only when these[Tibetan doctors] have experimented and failed that the patients cometo the dispensary. The result is that some of the cases are very ser- ious.' 53This tendency to delay resorting to biomedicine could be fatal. In 1929, for example, the Gyantse dispensary reported: 'One death oc- curred as a result of Septicaemia following a compound fracture of theleg. This was due to a delay of eleven days before arriving at the hospi-tal.' 54For the British, being the last resort was both a medical and a po- litical concern, as they noted: 'Unfortunately many cases seek treat-ment very late in the course of disease making rapid recoveries so use-ful in propaganda, impossible.' 55 It does appear that it was among the monastics, some of whom had a vested economic and social interest in Tibetan medical practice, thatthe main opposition to biomedicine arose, but as we have seen therewas a gradual lessening of clerical hostility. By 1935, while noting thatpatients were still liable to delay resort to biomedicine, the Gyantsemedical officer could state that it 'would appear that the hostility of thelamas to Western medicine is decreasing in as much as many patientsstate that they have been advised by their lamas to come for treat- ment.' 56 An example of the gradual process of change in indigenous elite un- derstanding is provided by two individuals who served as Tibetan Trade Agents in Gyantse (the local officials equivalent to the British TradeAgents). In 1926, it was reported that the then Tibetan Agent sufferedfrom severe rheumatism and was not expected to live; he would not,however, agree to see the Gyantse medical officer. But ten years later,the Tibetan Agent of that time is recorded as having 'always shown a li- vely interest in western medicine'. 57 There are indications that biomedicine gained favour more quickly among the monastic powers in Lhasa than elsewhere, suggesting that while the Tibetan capital was the centre of a conservative culture, theindigenous political model was that that centre enjoyed greater author-ity to instigate or allow social change and development than did theperiphery. Gyantse, it should be remembered, was not a religiously orpolitically significant place and the British had clearly erred in selectingMEDICAL MYTHS AND TIBETAN TRENDS 155it as the site of a Trade Agency. From the first, the Gyantse Trade Agents recognised this, and sought to relocate their diplomatic centreto Lhasa. 58But it was not until 1920 that the British Government per- mitted the Government of India to authorise Charles Bell to accept a long-standing invitation from the 13thDalai Lama to visit Lhasa. Bell's medical officer, Lt-Colonel Kennedy, found that in the Tibetan capital not only did large numbers attend the Dispensary, but I was fre- quently asked to treat senior officials, from the Prime Ministerdownwards, and their wives and families, in their houses. ...The leading Lhasa 'medico' and principal of the 'Medical Col- lege' on Chagpori, Men-tsiba Lama by name, displayed great in- terest in the work of the Dispensary and came to see several op-erations when he asked very pertinent questions and made co-pious notes. 59 That some demand for biomedicine already existed in Lhasa is demon-strated by a report that in 1917 a Chinese doctor was practising medi-cine at Nechung monastery, near Lhasa. He was selling what are supposed to be foreign drugs at high prices. Heappears to give out freely that he studied medicine in Germany.He is about 22 or 23 years of age and has the appearance of thebetter class of Chinese. 60 That others began to respond to that demand is also suggested by a la-ter comment from Dr. Guthrie that, after Bell and Kennedy left Lhasa, the Tibetans had again to rely mainly on their own system of medicine and to a much less extent on the increasing number of patent medi-cines, some reputable, some quack which officials and Nepalitraders began to import. 61 Numerous sources indicate that injections had particular appeal. The Italian traveller Fosco Mariaini, for example, speaks of the Tibetans' injections.62This again suggests the Tibetans' associa- tion of biomedicine with rapid cures; the introduction of penicillin intothe IMS doctors' range of pharmacopeia in the 1940s provided justthose rapid cures that best served as propaganda for biomedicine. Butobviously for some less sophisticated Tibetan patients it was the ritualof injection that was associated with the rapid cure, not the substanceinjected.156 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINBiomedicine at Lhasa After Bell's visit in 1920-21, the Sikkim Political Officers began to un- dertake missions to Lhasa more frequently. Their accompanying medi- cal officers, like Kennedy, seemed to find grounds for optimism over biomedical progress there, with their reports echoing the early reportsfrom the Younghusband mission and Steen 's first weeks in Shigatse.Weir's medical officer reported that, 'long queues formed outside the[British temporary Lhasa] hospital before 5A.M', and further noted that;'I should like to mention the faith which Tibetans have in Westernmedicines, especially Surgery and vaccination.' 63Weir rated his medi- cal Captain M.R. Sinclair, highly, reporting that: Sinclair has ... become very popular with all classes of Tibetansand has won for himself an excellent reputation in Lhasa. Inconsequence the benefits of Western medicine are much moreappreciated than formerly..... 64 After first visiting Tibet with Weir in 1930, Sinclair served as Gyantsemedical officer in 1931-32 and appears to have been the first doctor there since the days of Lieutenant Steen to undertake medical tours of the surrounding districts. 65His personal contribution to the spread of biomedicine must therefore be taken into consideration, and there isno doubt that the differing performances of the various individualmedical officers must have had an effect on the promotion of biomedi-cine. When Basil Gould became Political Officer in 1935, he set out to strengthen the British positions in Tibet in response to China's estab- lishment of a permanent mission in Lhasa following the death of the 13 thDalai Lama in 1933. Among Gould's initiatives was the establish- ment of a permanent British Lhasa mission, and Gould also laid con-siderable emphasis on the imperial medical project. In 1936, he visitedLhasa with a large party that became the basis for the subsequent per-manent British mission there. Among the party was the IMS officerCaptain W.S. Morgan, an experienced doctor who had had his ownpractice in London after graduating from Bart's Hospital and who had served in Quetta during Gould's time there. He was highly regarded by Gould, who described him as 'a man of strong personality and physi-que'. 66Morgan seems to have 'got on ' particularly well with the Tibe- tans. He reported that while dispensary patients were mainly drawn from the lower and middle class in Lhasa ... TheRegent and his Staff, the various Cabinet Ministers, most of theMEDICAL MYTHS AND TIBETAN TRENDS 157ecclesiastical nobles and nearly all of the lesser officials con- sulted us at some time or other.67 While acknowledging that 'whether curiosity in some cases or a belief in us principally prompted their visits one does not know', he con- cluded that: In Lhasa ... the great majority of the inhabitants have acquired afaith in modern medical methods ... one cannot exaggerate thefeelings of gratitude, obviously sincere, that is evinced by pa-tients of all classes. The Te Rinpoche - from a purely spiritualpoint of view, the senior lama in Tibet and one whose influence is immense paid us a compliment worthy of record when he re- marked that 'the poor people tell me that you are as kind tothem as you are to the rich and I am very pleased to hear it'. 68 The hospital which Morgan established in Lhasa was housed in thesame building that had been used by previous British doctors visitingLhasa. Dr. Sinclair had described the old premises as 'an 'Aviary''',wryly adding that 'why the sparrows should choose such dark and insa- nitary [sic ] quarters I cannot imagine.' 69So unsuitable were the condi- tions that there was a reluctance to undertake operations. The building was unheated, which meant that; 'in the cold weather it required agreat deal of enthusiasm to do one's work in an atmosphere almostconstantly below freezing point'; the conditions were such that, 'owingto the appalling circumstances for attempting aseptic surgery, one al-ways had the feeling one was only just 'getting away with it''. 70 But Morgan found a demand for biomedicine, and records that 'Dur- ing the latter part of our stay, and as the result of requests by certainEnglish-speaking Lhasa notables, we fitted up simple medicine chests,with the necessary full instructions for use.' He added that there wasalso a more tangible indication of growing local interest in biomedi-cine; 'a Tibetan lama apprentice dresser ... sent to us at the instigationof prominent Tibetans and with the priestly benediction of the seniorlama-medico'. Morgan was to train the apprentice dresser and the Tibe-tan orderlies, but while 'the Lhasa people were keen that we should do so', Morgan found this was largely 'prevented by time and other cir- cumstances'. 71 The Tibetan apprentice seems to have stayed on at the hospital but the initiative bore little fruit according to the disappointed tone of asubsequent British report: A Tibetan of nursing orderly status was trained in the Missionhospital for 3 years up to 1940. He now works in the Men-tse-158 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINKang or Tibetan Government dispensary where he is said to treat (at a price) a very small number of patients daily with sim-ple Western drugs. He is also capable of stitching wounds. 72 While the British failed to properly train any Tibetans in medical prac-tice, the establishment of a permanent dispensary in Lhasa from 1936onwards did place the British medical project in Tibet on a firm foot-ing. It inevitably meant, however, that there was less emphasis on thedispensary in Gyantse, and patients who had previously travelled therefrom Lhasa for treatment now remained in the capital, although pa-tient numbers in Gyantse continued to increase. The British position was further strengthened in 1940, when at Gould's initiative, a new post, that of 'Civil Surgeon Bhutan and Tibet'was created. The Civil Surgeon had overall charge of the imperial med-ical positions in Tibet and, while theoretically based in Gyantse, be-came in practice the medical officer at the Lhasa mission, undertakingonly occasional inspection tours to the dispensaries in Gyantse and Ya-tung. In addition to their Lhasa medical practice, the Civil Surgeons -Captain W.H.D. 73- were able to devote greater attention to wider re- flections on the problems of introducing biomedicine into Tibet, as willbe seen. Until the arrival of Staunton in February 1940, 74however, one or other of Bo and Tonyot Tsering remained in charge of the Lhasa dis-pensary after Morgan 's departure from Lhasa in February 1937. Theyhad the assistance of two Tibetan orderlies and a local Nepali, who hadpicked up some 'rudimentary' knowledge of dentistry from the Britishand practised it at the mission hospital. In the years that followed, Bo Tsering in particular played a significant part in the success of the Brit- ish dispensary in Lhasa. A 1943 report stated: The [Lhasa dispensary] patients include family of the Lama,shapes [cabinet ministers], Tibetan officials of all ranks, shop- keepers, peasants, and beggars etc. The monks of Sera, Drepungand other monasteries are at last coming for treatment to thehospital. Members of the Chinese, Nepalese and Bhutanese lega- tions frequently come for treatment to the hospital. We have even been consulted by the Chinese Veterinary Officer regardingsheep and stopped an epidemic among merino Australian withM&B and glycerine. The above is largely due to the character and personality of Rai Sahib Bo Tsering. 75MEDICAL MYTHS AND TIBETAN TRENDS 159It is notable that Bo Tsering's achievements were attributed to his de- sire and ability to constantly update his medical knowledge and prac-tice, and to his ability to 'get on ' with Tibetans. The extent to which hiscultural origins and Buddhist religion were a factor in promoting bio-medicine was apparently taken for granted now that the Tibetans weremore routinely resorting to biomedicine. Another important symbol ofits growing state support came in 1942, when the Tibetan Government funded the building of a two-room block alongside the British hospital building. This was intended for the use of sick officials, and while it re-mained largely unused, its symbolic value was highly prized by theBritish. 76The Lhasa hospital now consisted of two separate adjacent blocks. The first has an operating theatrewith a small drug store, a general waiting cum examinationroom for outpatients with an attached dispensary and a small store, a large ward for 5 patients and a smaller ward for 2. The second block is the so called officials' block, which has 2 roomsfor 2 patients each, a small kitchen and store. 77 Along with the construction of a hospital block came other indicationsof the Tibetans' official acceptance of biomedicine. Both of the Regentswho governed Tibet after the death of the 13 thDalai Lama in 1933 con- sulted the Lhasa mission doctors, with the anaemic Reting Regent being a regular patient. His treatment included 'daily exercise, includ- Sikkim's first female doctor, Dr. Leki Dadul and her husband, Rai Sahib Bo Tsering's Commissioner Sonam Dadul (''Yapla'')160 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINing football' to build up his strength.78The young (and current) 14th Dalai Lama had been found in Amdo, identified in the traditional man- ner and brought to Lhasa in 1940, and it was obvious that his resortingto biomedicine would be the ultimate seal of approval. This took time, for while Dr. Staunton apparently treated him for measles in 1943 79- or provided medicine for him at least - there is no mention of either Hislop, Terry or any other biomedical doctors in Lhasa doing so. Dr.Guthrie reported that soon after he arrived in 1945 the young DalaiLama 'is kept apart from all Western influences - to the length it issaid that I would not be called in even though he were dying.' 80But as the only British officer in Lhasa for much of 1945, Guthrie made anumber of ceremonial visits to the Dalai Lama in his political capacity and as he became known to the Tibetans, their attitude began to change. Dr. Guthrie's patients were not all human. In the Tibetan under- standing, a medical practitioner was assumed to be able to apply hisskills to a variety of animals. 81As a keen horseman and fond of dogs, Guthrie was able to double as a vet, although he could do little whenhe, 'was asked ... at a lunch party for some medicine to bleach the faceof a black horse white'! 82 In 1947, however, in a significant indication of biomedicine's accep- tance by the Tibetan elites, Guthrie found himself with an unusual butimportant case. He was called in by the Regent of Tibet to treat theyoung Dalai Lama's peacock, which had developed a cyst over one eye.Guthrie was received with due ceremony and he operated successfullyon the feathered patient. The Dalai Lama watched the operation withinterest and they talked for some time, Guthrie being 'very struck byhis alertness and decisiveness'. Interviewed in 1994, the Dalai Lama re- called that Guthrie had assured him, in the three forms of Tibetan speech; 'Don 't worry, it will not die.' 83The Dalai Lama himself did sub- sequently begin to receive biomedical treatment on occasions, provid-ing the ultimate seal of approval for biomedicine within Tibetan so-ciety. The peacock incident was reported to the Government of India with some satisfaction, but the triumphant tone of British medical discoursein this period was not restricted to official reports. Mrs Guthrie wrote to her mother in 1947, noting: Tomorrow we are to go to one of the DL 's tutors for a meal ... The rimpoches [incarnate lamas] advise many people to consultus when they become ill so apart from the fact that they are of-ten people of interesting character, it is a good thing to get toknow them. 84MEDICAL MYTHS AND TIBETAN TRENDS 161Yet despite these real advances, biomedicine was still not necessarily the first resort or universally accepted. A Gyantse medical officer in the1940s recalled that the Tibetans continued to consult local practitionersinitially, and as late as 1942, the Civil Surgeon reported that 'While all Tibetan civilian officials I have met have been helpful, the same cannot be said for the Lamas.' 85Similarly, in 1945, it was reported from Ya- tung: For one reason or another this hospital is definitely unpopularin the Chumbi Valley where there is undoubtedly a great dealmore sickness and disease than is reflected in the statistics ofthe hospital. The number of inpatients (8) is deplorably low; dif- ficulty is undoubtedly caused here by the lack of a full time sweeper, but this could well be surmounted with a little energyand resources. 86 In some senses, the problems now facing the British were ones of de-velopment rather than of establishment. The fact that Tibetans had,after several decades, accepted vaccination did not mean that new med-ical initiatives would be adopted without similar delays. Several initia- tives were still-born. In 1943, for example, the Civil Surgeon reported that: I have been endeavouring to get some system of child welfarestarted in Lhasa, as well as getting Tibetan girls trained in ele-mentary nursing. All Tibetan officials both lay and ecclesiasticalagree with me but the matter stops there. 87 While the number of outpatients at the dispensaries in Yatung,Gyantse and Lhasa were now each measured in thousands, rather thanhundreds, Tibetans were still reported to be 'hospital shy'. While freelyattending as outpatients they were unwilling to become inpatients. 88 Officers such as Major Guthrie attempted to overcome this by allowing,'the families of patients to bring tents and camp around the hospital ...to encourage and comfort a relative or friend'. 89But the absence of any precedent in the indigenous medical system for incarceration away from the home (aside perhaps from cases involving contagious dis- ease), made the hospital a strangely forbidding place and difficult to ab-sorb into Tibetan culture. As Guthrie admitted in 1946: 'the time isnot yet ripe to submit the average Tibetan to the initial bath, thechange of clothing and the hundred and one little details that the re-gime of a modern hospital demands.' 90162 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINBiomedicine from other nations The British were not the only regional power concerned with Tibet. There was also communication between the medical worlds of Tibet and Russia, with Tibetan medical practices becoming popular there in the last decades of the Tsarist regime. Most famous in this connectionwere Piotr ('Peter') Badmaev and his brother Tsultrim, wealthy andwell-connected entrepreneurs who were originally from the RussianBuddhist enclave of Buryatia. Piotr Badmaev translated what he consid-ered were the medical sections of the Gyu\u00a8-shiinto Russian and the brothers opened a clinic in St Petersburg in the late 19 thcentury. This attracted a number of influential politicians and aristocrats and Piotr Badmaev became actively involved in promoting Russian expansion into the Tibetan regions. His nephew Nikolai Badmaev carried on thepractice in the Soviet era, treating high-ranking officials in Leningradduring the 1920s and 1930s. He eventually opened a clinic there, butdespite treating the OGPU (forerunner of the KGB) commissar, he wasamong the many Far Eastern specialists purged around 1938. While atleast one ethnically Russian physician, Vasily Shestakov, apparently stu-died at the Men-ze khang in Lhasa in the 1910s, it was easier for Rus- sian Buddhists such as the Kalmyk, Dambo Ulianov, to travel in Tibet without attracting international attention. Ulianov travelled to Lhasa in1905, and returned to practice 'Tibetan medicine' in Russia. Heclaimed to have a unique Tibetan formula for curing syphilis, thoughgiven the Tibetan 's keenness to resort to biomedical cures for this con-dition, we may doubt its comparative efficacy. 91 The Soviets also considered using biomedicine to gain closer links with the Tibetans. The Buryat Dr. Sanjimitab Tsybiktarov (1877-1921), a graduate of the Military Medical Academy in St Petersburg, started a small Western medicine dispensary at the Russian consulate in Urga,the Mongolian capital, in 1909. He practised there until he was ar-rested and executed by White Russian forces, although the clinic wasfunctioning again in 1923 when visited by Elizabeth Kozlova (wife ofthe explorer Pyotr Kozlov). There were regular communications be-tween Urga and Lhasa, and the Russian dispensary added an additionallink in the chain of biomedical institutions on Tibet's frontiers. In the 1920s and early 1930s, when there were a number of attempts by So- viet agents to penetrate Tibet, plans were made by the Badzar BaradiinTibet expedition project to promote Western medicine there, includingsmallpox vaccination. But the expedition was cancelled and the Soviet'santi-religious policies alienated them from further contact with the Ti-betans for a number of decades. The Chinese had begun to encourage biomedicine in Tibet in the last years of the Manchu dynasty and even after the expulsion of Chi-MEDICAL MYTHS AND TIBETAN TRENDS 163nese officials from Tibet in 1911-12, they had scored one apparently un- noticed politico-medical victory. On 11 February 1913, just weeks afterthe Dalai Lama had returned to Lhasa and issued a 'Declaration of In-dependence', the Chinese government had signed the International Convention on Opium on behalf of Tibet, thus implying in an interna- tional forum that Tibet was still part of China. By contrast, the Britishdid not sign on behalf of Sikkim until 1920. 92 After re-establishing a diplomatic post in Lhasa in the 1930s, the Chinese mission began building its own hospital, which opened inSeptember 1944. Under civil biomedical Doctor Ge Chengzhi it offeredfree biomedical treatment to all classes of Tibetans just as did the Brit-ish dispensaries, and it soon began to attract as many patients as the British. 93Although Britain and China were then allies in the war against Japan, their missions in Lhasa were in more-or-less open con- flict for influence over the Tibetans. While maintaining the usual diplo-matic courtesies - the two mission heads regularly dined, or playedtennis together - the representatives of both countries competed on allfronts for influence, and given the political importance the British at-tached to their medical project in Tibet, the Chinese hospital was takenextremely seriously by the Government of India. This was not the first time the British had faced biomedical competi- tion in Lhasa. There was an apparently still-born plan in the early1930s by the Swiss monks of St Bernard (famous for their dogs), to es-tablish a hospice in Tibet for Himalayan travellers. 94But more signifi- cantly, a five-man German mission arrived in Lhasa in January 1939,and among its staff (who were known to be members of the S.S.), wasBruno Beger. He was an anthropologist, but acted as the mission 'smedical officer (a task that was to put him off becoming a qualified doctor!). The Germans remained in Lhasa for two months despite the best efforts of the British to get rid off them, and Beger's diary revealsthat he attracted a number of patients from the British dispensary,which was then under Bo Tsering's command (with Tonyot Tseringthen Yatung). 'German medicine' had, Beger claimed, a great repu-tation and he found himself inundated by patients 'from early in themorning until late at night', including one sent by the Chinese repre-sentative. 'To my disappointment', he wrote: I have learned that the Englishmen here and the two Sikkimdoctors are quite annoyed about my activity. Many patients didrun away from them. That didn 't please me, as I had pointedthe patients again and again to these doctors out of considera-tion for them and to be relieved from this kind of work, espe-cially the difficult cases. Unfortunately the inflow is unchanged... 95164 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINHugh Richardson ['the Englishman here'], was a fervent anti-Nazi Scotsman who was then in charge of the British Lhasa mission. Hesteadfastly refused to assist the Germans and Beger's records note thathe requested medicines from the British dispensary in Yatung for use in a particular case, and was refused. 96 While Beger's doctoring had little long-term impact it does raise sev- eral issues. Beger makes no mention of any opposition to biomedicine and stresses the demands on his services, which presumably differedlittle from that on offer at the British dispensary. That he was able toattract patients from the British dispensary may indicate he was seenas a better doctor than Bo Tsering, that he dispensed more up-to-datemedicines, or that was he right about the claim that German doctors enjoyed particular repute. 97 While British opposition to Beger reflected European political events, the competition with China was strictly a local affair, and the British were concerned that patients' attendance at the Chinese hospital indi-cated a political preference for the Chinese. Basil Gould saw the Chi-nese presence as a test of British medical abilities, proclaiming that:'Chinese competition in medical work calls for a high standard of workfrom us.' 98Structurally the British were in a good position. They had had time to build up a patient base and when the Chinese hospitalopened, both Bo Tsering and the Civil Surgeon Dr. Terry were in Lhasa.Gould himself arrived there in November 1944, accompanied by theGyantse medical officer Dr. Kurian, and the British seemed to be win-ning the battle when the wives of two officials from the Chinese mis-sion sought treatment from the British rather than the Chinese hospi-tal. But any benefit to their reputation was doubtless lost when one ofthe women died after a caesarean. 99 Visits to the British hospital did decline dramatically after the open- ing of the Chinese hospital from an average of 42.7 patients per day in1943 to 30.1 per day in 1945. Although one factor in this decline mayhave been due to new British practices. Dr. Terry, who took up the postof Civil Surgeon in Lhasa in July 1944, introduced much fuller physicalexaminations than had previously been made, and this may have alie-nated patients unused to such practices. The only consolation for theBritish was that, as noted, there was little decline in the number of pa- tients attending with venereal diseases. 100 After the departure of the Chinese doctor in August 1947 their hos- pital soon closed, but it is clear that in the 1944-47 period the Chinese did attract a number of patients away from the British.101Given that both hospitals offered free biomedical treatment, it is difficult to avoidthe conclusion that, for historico-cultural reasons, those Tibetans feltmore comfortable dealing with the Chinese doctors than they did withthe British. Whatever conflicts there may have been with the Chinese,MEDICAL MYTHS AND TIBETAN TRENDS 165they had been present in Lhasa for many centuries and there were nu- merous shared cultural understandings between the two peoples. TheTibetans were accustomed to dealing with the Chinese, while the Brit-ish were culturally foreign, and despite the growing links between them, and the increasing Tibetan understanding of European culture, it appears that this preference affected medical choice. Cultural perspectives and concessions Different perspectives on the British medical project in Tibet are pro-vided by the reports of other European visitors to Lhasa in the 1930s and '40s. We have noted the American aircrew's more critical view of Bo Tsering, and we may also note that the diaries of Bruno Beger, whopainted a highly critical picture of the indigenous medical system, indi-cate continuing competition with indigenous practitioners. He de-scribes, for example, one female patient suffering from an abscess un-der the knee, which he treated with an appropriate ointment. The localmonastic medical practitioners, however, diagnosed a demon residingin the knee and replaced the ointment with butter and lambskin and then ensured that the woman was kept awake by the noise of drums, bells and tubas intended to drive out the demon. Their treatment wasunsuccessful. 102 But apparently the only non-British specialist study of medical condi- tions in Tibet was the account of Lt-Colonel Regolo Moise of the ItalianNavy Medical Corps, who travelled to Tibet with Professor GuiseppiTucci in 1948. Tucci's visits were encouraged by the British, who con-sidered the academic study of Tibet beneficial to their interests and those of Tibet, and Moise had access to British medical records. Noting that his own research was cursory, Moise concluded that in Tibet; 'Wes-tern medicine ... had only a superficial influence and its results canhardly be felt.' 103It is, however, notable that he found no evidence of any resistance to biomedicine. He stated that the Tibetans never seemed to have anything against our medicine. Even thosewho plied the same trade and could reasonably be expected to fear competition, showed much tolerance. The sick flocked to us driven by curiosity and faith, a faith so strong as to embarrassus sometimes, as it could not always be satisfied. They sawsomething magical in our medicine too and failed to see thelimitations set to it by pathology, surgery, and the time andmeans at our disposal. 104166 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINThese reports indicate that there was a genuine uncertainty about the boundaries of biomedical knowledge and practice, and that just as another-worldly aspect to indigenous medical practices was understood aspart of the system, so too was there probably a presumption of an other-worldly element to biomedicine. A fear of the power inherent in Western medicine may be reflected in the patients' unwillingness to beanaesthetised or to remain confined within the hospital environment,as well as in the apparently frequent practice of first consulting an in-digenous religious practitioner and remaining guided by their under-standing of the British system. The propaganda value of rapid cureswas recognised by the imperial (and missionary medical) authorities asa means of attracting patients to biomedicine; but it appears that the Tibetans understanding of a miraculous component to medicine led them to reject, or at least be less trusting of, biomedical cures thatlacked that rapid power. We have seen that Dr. Guthrie altered the usual hospital routines in order to accommodate Tibetan cultural understandings. Given the iso-lated location of the British dispensaries in Tibet and the frontier men-tality of the imperial officers there, it was to be expected that therewere certain differences in approach and procedure there when com- pared to the medical institutions in the urban centres of imperial In- dia. At what point those differences were specifically articulated as a re-sponse to Tibetan cultural understandings, rather than environment orcircumstance, is uncertain, and may have begun with the practices ofcompounders or sub-assistant surgeons. But by the 1940s, the IMS of-ficers were consciously altering the practice of biomedicine to incorpo-rate local cultural beliefs and practices. Dr. Guthrie, for example, while attending a birth at the house of one of Lhasa grandest aristocrats, allowed the mother to be given powderedrhinoceros horn, which the Tibetans regarded as beneficial in child-birth. He was said to be, 'acting in his usual way of allowing anythingthat increased confidence provided it would not be harmful'. 105Simi- larly, in the Tibetan understanding, there are preordained lucky andunlucky days for each individual, and Guthrie would, therefore, when-ever possible, arrange for major treatments to be carried out on one ofthe patient's lucky days. He found this produced sound medical bene- fits, for this innovation 'allowed for the maximum faith in the outcome to work in your favour'. 106On another occasion, when called upon to remove a twelve-pound benign tumour which the monks had con-cluded represented the evil collected by and in the patient, Guthrie ar-ranged for a special religious ceremony to be performed over the ex-cised tumour before its burial. 107 We might note here that prior to the introduction of biomedicine, childbirth was not a medical issue in Tibet. Practitioners of sowa rigpaMEDICAL MYTHS AND TIBETAN TRENDS 167did not intervene in childbirth and even the presence of an experienced attendant was apparently rare, although there were remedies such asrhinoceros horn or dried fish from the sacred Lake Manasarovar whichwere considered to assist the process. 108The result was that estimates of one woman in 10 dying in childbirth and an infant mortality rate ofup to 50% were common, 109but there are no reliable statistics in this regard. The presence of British physicians did not affect this situation in the initial stages of the encounter. Even in the 1930s, as Dr. Morgan noted: ... military surgical instrument panniers were ... based on the as-sumption that ... patients would be men and MEN ONLY.... had I had the temerity to mention [obstetrics] I would have been an object of derision. 110 After attending the birth of a child to Kyipup (who had been educatedat Rugby school in England), Morgan was told by the long-serving Sik-kimese Bo Tsering that that was the first instance of medical interven-tion in childbirth in Tibet. 111Not until the 1940s did Tibetans, particu- larly of the upper classes, begin to regularly have their children deliv- ered in biomedical hospitals. Recognition of obstetrics and child care as a medical practice was, however, already developing in Tibet. On theinstructions of the 13 thDalai Lama, Khenrab Norbu, probably the out- standing practitioner of sowa rigpa in the 20thcentury, had formulated a childrens' medicine in 1916, and also wrote a book on the care of in-fants in that year. 112 Post-colonial developments When the British handed over their positions in Tibet to the newly in-dependent Indian Government on 15 August 1947, the policy of exclud-ing Hindus and Muslims from service in Tibet meant that there wereno qualified 'Indian ' staff available. The new UK High Commission inDelhi suggested a British medical dispensary might be maintained inLhasa and Guthrie offered to stay on there. 113But the British Foreign Office, which had always frowned upon the Government of India's pre-sence in Tibet and its effects on Sino-British relations, ruled out a con-tinuing British presence there. 114Early in 1948, Dr. Guthrie received 'a sad blow when the Indian Govt said I wasn 't wanted any more',although it was not until early 1949 that Guthrie and his wife finallyleft Tibet. 115In October 1950, Chinese Communist forces invaded and ended Tibet's de jure independence.168 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINThe Indian Government maintained the former British positions in Tibet until they were handed to China after the Sino-Indian Agreement of April 1954. The Chinese opened a new biomedical hospital in Lhasain 1952 116and until the Indians withdrew the Sino-British medical competition of the 1944-47 period was to some extent repeated. TheSikkimese physician, Dr. Sonam Dorji, who was joined by his wifeNamgay Dolma, served in Lhasa with the medical officer Dr. Tenzingin the early 1950s. He and his wife were among the Indian staff whoescaped the floods which destroyed the Gyantse Trade Agency on 17July 1954, killing Dr. Tenzing, who was then en route to Lhasa. Dr.Dorji recalls that, despite Chinese opposition to the Indian presence,there was some co-operation on a personal level and that the Indian hospital gave the Chinese their medical stocks when they departed. Dr. Dorji was called on to treat the Dalai Lama on occasions, and couldspeak to him in Tibetan, but they were closely watched by the Chinese,who 'accidentally' shelled the hospital compound just before the In-dians' departure. 117 Dr. Dorji recalls that during the early 1950s the Chinese in Lhasa ac- tually preferred what they called 'English medicine', while the Tibetanswould attend the Chinese hospital because 'they are our Lords now'. Unlike the British, Dr. Dorji frequently interacted with Tibetan medical practitioners, and he noted a growing generation gap, with younger Ti-betans tending to favour biomedicine while the elder people resorted totraditional practitioners. 118 During the 1950s, Rai Sahib Pemba Tsering, who had headed the British Mission in Lhasa, was also killed in the Gyantse floods. But hisson, now Dr. Tsewang Y Pemba FRCS, had been educated at VictoriaSchool and sent by his family to the UK in 1949 to study medicine at University College London. While his mother favoured medicine for its Buddhist ethical qualities, and his father saw a university degree asleading to a better career than government service in an independentIndia, Dr. Pemba was most excited by the thought of travel! He becamethe first biomedically qualified Tibetan doctor in April 1955 and wenton to qualify as a surgeon at the Royal College of Surgeons in Londonbefore practising in Darjeeling (where he was Superintendent of thePlanters' Hospital for sixteen years), Bhutan, and New York. He re- mains the best-known Tibetan biomedical practitioner. While a strong proponent of the superior efficacy of biomedicine, like Dr. Guthrie, hecontinues to adapt his practice to Himalayan culture. This means thathe always takes a patient's pulse because they expect it, whatever theircomplaint, and operates on days considered auspicious by the pa-tient. 119 When the Chinese conquered Tibet in 1950, there were no qualified Tibetan biomedical practitioners and no biomedical public health sys-MEDICAL MYTHS AND TIBETAN TRENDS 169tem in Tibet. While the Chinese then began to develop biomedical structures there, Tibetan resistance to their presence grew, and in 1959the Dalai Lama and some 100,000 of his people went into exile in In-dia. The subsequent history of biomedicine in the Tibetan regions of the People's Republic of China (i.e., the Tibetan Autonomous Region and parts of Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu and Yunnan provinces) seems tocontain many parallels with developments in the exile community, withwhich we will be concerned here. 120 For the exiles who established a new centre for Tibetans on land gi- ven to them by the Indian government at McLeod Ganj, above Dhar-amsala in Himachal Pradesh, encounters with biomedicine became vir-tually inescapable. The Tibetan refugee's medical needs were originally met by the biomedical facilities of the Indian military physicians and the civil public health system, with Western aid agencies also comingto their assistance. But the Tibetans set about reconstructing and re-structuring their community and in 1961 a Tibetan medical hospitalwas established in Dharamsala. Named after the Men-ze khang hospi-tal in Lhasa, its staff included medical practitioners who had been atthat institute. A medical herb gathering operation, which suppliedherbs to the hospital had already been established around the Manali district in northwestern India by that time. 121 The Men-ze khang hospital began with the limited goal of providing the refugee community with its familiar medical treatment. But appar- ently to the Tibetans' surprise, they were soon called upon by Indians,the first of whom were high-ranking military officers from the Dhar-amsala cantonment. Some of these officers had served in Ladakh andwere familiar with local medical practice there, which at the elite levelderived from sowa rigpa , and they consulted the Men-ze khang for con- ditions that had not been cured by their army biomedical physicians. 122 In 1962, the Men-ze khang was given a favourable report following an Indian government enquiry and demand for its services continuedto grow. In addition to the development of medical facilities in Tibetanrefugee settlements, Tibetan medical clinics were subsequently estab-lished in most of India's major cities with the support of large Indiancompanies such as Reliance, who contributed funds towards theclinics. 123But the exile government also established a biomedical sys- tem for Tibetans in the refugee communities, and in 1971, the biome-dical Delek Hospital opened in Dharamsala. The Delek was originally a private hospital established with funding from a Tibetan philanthropist and only came under exile governmentauthority on 1 January 1979. 124The founder, Tsewang Rinchen Rishing (1914-1982), was from a Bo \u00a8n-po family and had little formal education, but rose to prominence as a community leader in exile. He proposedthe establishment of a biomedical institution to the Dalai Lama and170 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINwith the Tibetan leader's approval Rishing set out to raise funds for the hospital. It was eventually opened on 4 October 1971 with a staff of justfive, including an Indian doctor working part-time, 125but its repute was such that 50% of the patients were local Indians. Although the De- lek had no inpatient facilities until a 25-bed hospital ward was opened in July 1979, it provided free medical treatment to the poor, and theuse of Tibetan biomedical staff removed the language problems pa-tients faced in the Indian government hospitals. When T.R. Rishing re-tired in 1979, Mrs Kesang Y. Takla became the first administrator forthe Tibetan exile government, 126and the Delek remains the primary biomedical facility in the Tibetan exile community today. In exile, however, the indigenous Tibetan medical world underwent a radical process of development within the wider context of culturalsurvival in exile. Perceiving that traditional Tibetan culture in Tibet it-self could be eradicated as a result of Communist Chinese policies andHan Chinese immigration, and also that the exile culture could be sub-merged by that of their Indian hosts, the Tibetan leadership identifiedspecific elements of their cultural heritage that they wished to preserve.Tibetan medical traditions were identified as one of those fundamentalaspects of Tibetan culture. Exile government support was thus given to indigenous medical traditions, which were primarily defined as those ofsowa rigpa , and there was increasing systemisation of the previously unbounded knowledge. At the same time there was world-wide revival of interest in Tradi- tional Medicine practices, symbolised at a political level by the WHOconference at Alma Ata in 1978, when Traditional Medicine andschemes such as China's 'barefoot doctors' received official support. Asa part of that movement there was a growing interest in Tibetan medi- cal traditions, not only on the sub-continent, but in much of the out- side world. Western studies of Traditional Tibetan medicine - princi-pally centred on the Gyu \u00a8Shi - began in the 1970s and by the early 1980s, 127Westerners began to come to the Men-ze-khang in Dharam- sala. Proper academic studies of Tibetan medicine followed. The open-ing of Tibet to foreign visitors in the 1980s led to allowing medicalfieldwork in Tibet itself. The many issues that arise as a result of these processes are worthy of a separate study, which would reveal many parallels with the recentsystemisation and professionalisation of other regional medical sys-tems such as A \u00afyurveda and Chinese Medicine and their responses to the encounter with global modernity. The processes of Traditional Med-icine, as with those of colonial medicine, are highly politicised and, asWaltraud Ernst has noted:MEDICAL MYTHS AND TIBETAN TRENDS 171Traditional and non-Western systems of healing that have more commonly been seen mainly as victims of Western dominationand arrogance are on their part not immune or averse to profes-sional power play, shrewd global marketing and personal net- working either. 128 While biomedicine continues to be regarded - at least from the point of view of the Tibetan exile government - as foreign, and not as em-bedded in Tibetan culture, 129patients in the exile community today routinely resort to treatment from both systems. But to a greater degreethan in the past, nationalism is a factor in the choice of medical ser-vice. In contrast to medical developments in nations such as Japan, Iran, and the Arab nations, Traditional Medicine in both the TAR and the Tibetan exile community, as in India and China, has had what Cro-zier called 'a powerful appeal to cultural nationalism.' 130Thus, a study of the recent development of Tibetan medicine ironically seems likelyto reach the conclusions made by Paul Unschuld in regard to that pro-cess in Chinese Traditional Medicine. Unschuld observes that in China,'the social ideology supporting the social system of the Imperial ageconstituted ... the legitimising context of traditional medicine'. 131That context was lost with modernisation, as was the internal creative im-petus, with subsequent changes deriving from external impetus. Heconcluded that the defensive restructuring of Chinese medical concepts intwentieth-century publications aims at presenting traditionalChinese medical knowledge as a coherent and stringent systemof thought, matching the coherency and stringency of Western medical thought and terminology ... and through a selection of only one pattern ... the original characteristics of Chinese knowl-edge are lost in the latter's transfer to a modern environment. 132 It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Tibetan medicine has under-gone a similar process, with the Tibetan medical world irrevocably al-tered by the encounter with biomedicine, and that while biomedicineis now a part of that world, the elite traditions of sowa rigpa have tri- umphed over the variety of practices and understandings that existedin Tibet during and prior to the colonial period. Local, regional, andgendered practices have been largely eliminated, while sowa rigpa has become synonymous with 'Tibetan medicine'.172 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAIN5 Bhutan: A Later Development By the late 1940s, biomedicine was firmly established in Sikkim and was attracting ever-growing numbers of patients to the IMS dispen-saries in central Tibet. But in Bhutan, biomedicine still remained lar-gely unknown and it was only in the post-colonial period that any bio- medical structures developed there. As will be seen, Bhutan 's tardy adoption of the new system was due to two factors. Firstly, the statewas closed to Christian missionaries and thus to missionary medicineand, secondly, as Bhutan was of little or no economic or strategic im-portance to British India, it received only minuscule development assis-tance. Bhutan is situated to the south of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China, bordering the Sikkim, Bengal, and Assam regions of India. Covering an area of ca. 18,000 square miles, it has a current popula- tion of ca. 1.2 million people, most of whom are Buddhists. A unifiedBhutanese state emerged as a distinct entity after the arrival of Shab- drung Ngawang Namgyal (1594-1651) from Tibet in a leading figure of the Drukpa Kargyu school of Tibetan Buddhism andbecame the first ruler of modern Bhutan, which has maintained an in-dependent identity and national existence since that time. 2 After visits by the Tibet-bound Bogle and Hamilton in 1774-75, and Turner and Saunders in 1783, Bhutan, like Tibet, closed its frontiers toEuropeans in 1792. 3Relations between Bhutan and the British then de- teriorated and war broke out in 1864-65. The Bhutanese proved hardyopponents, able to repel the imperial forces from their mountainstrongholds and the British were also hindered by the medical environ-ment in which malaria and other fevers were rife. Of the 5,000 menthey dispatched to fight the Bhutanese, 480 died of disease and, 'nearlyas many more subsequently from the effects of the campaign, although 1,300 men were sent away on sick leave'. 4But modern weaponry proved triumphant and the campaign ended with the Treaty of Sinchu- la, which brought Bhutan under British influence. They agreed to referfrontier disputes to the British and ceded lowland territory to the im-perial government in return for an annual subsidy. 5Having secured that section of their northern frontier and with no possibility of themountainous Bhutanese terrain offering passage for modern armies toor from Tibet, the British subsequently left the state largely untouched. In the 1880s, Bhutan 's traditionally devolved power system collapsedand a regional leader, Urgyen Wangchuk, emerged as its effective ruler.His subsequent decision to accompany the Younghusband mission to Tibet as a pro-British intermediary gained him imperial support, and in 1907, Urgyen Wangchuk was made Maharaja of Bhutan, founding adynasty that survives to this day. In 1905, imperial relations with Bhutan were made part of the re- sponsibilities of the Political Officer Sikkim, who subsequently madeoccasional visits there. But the kingdom remained otherwise closed toEuropeans, particularly missionaries. In 1910, Bhutan came under clo-ser imperial charge when its foreign relations were formally placed un- der British control in return for an increased subsidy. It remained an independent state, however, and after the British departed in 1947, In-dia inherited the British role, guaranteeing Bhutanese independence inreturn for influence over its foreign policy. The imperial relationship with Bhutan was thus rather different from Sikkim and Tibet. Sikkim was strategically important as the gate-way to Tibet and beyond, and with their regional Political Officer resi-dent in Gangtok the British inevitably became involved in the internal affairs of Sikkim, including the development of public health mea- sures. Tibet was a foreign power and biomedical initiatives were part ofthe political strategy of developing friendly relations with them. Butbeing of no strategic value, and as a stable and secure 'buffer state'whose foreign affairs were under British control, Bhutan was largelyleft to its own devices. No imperial officials or military forces were everstationed there, and as a result, Bhutan received very little support inmatters such as the modernisation of its medical world, with the estab- lishment of biomedicine largely a post-colonial process. In 1928, Brit- ish attitudes to Bhutan were unkindly, but fairly accurately summedup in the Sikkim Gazetteer : No one wishes to explore that tangle of jungle-clad and fever-stricken hills, infested with leeches and the pipsa fly, and offer- ing no advantages to the most enterprising pioneer. Adventurelooks beyond Bhutan; science passes it by as a region not suffi- ciently characteristic to merit special exploration. Our policy to- wards the Bhutanese, therefore, is determined solely by consid-erations of geographical position and diplomatic expediency. 6 European language accounts of indigenous medical practice in pre-modern Bhutan are almost non-existent. As in Tibet and Sikkim, theBritish doctors wrote little or nothing about it and the few referencesby European travellers are brief and superficial. Thus we are awaiting174 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINstudies of indigenous sources to shed more light on the pre-modern Bhutanese medical world. It appears, however, that the situation thereprior to the introduction of biomedicine was similar to that of Sikkimand Tibet. There was no public health system and while the elite medi- cal tradition of sowa rigpa was known and practised, the majority of the population relied on local and village level healers. Their treatments were primarily based on the wide variety of medicinal herbs tradition-ally found there, with Bhutan referred to in early Tibetan sources asLhojong Menjong - the 'Southern Valleys of Medicinal Herbs'. The transmission and promulgation of the elite traditions of the Gyu\u00a8 shiin Bhutan is attributed to Tenzing Drugyal, the personal physician of the Bhutanese founder, Ngawang Namgyal, and the tradition is thus accepted as deriving from Tibet. But, although individual Bhutanese medical practitioners did travel to Tibet to study medicine, the Bhuta-nese medical tradition developed independently from that of Tibet.There are variations of practice, belief, and culture and their elite sys-tem is not thought of as 'Tibetan medicine' by the Bhutanese, but assowa rigpa. One notable structural difference between the Tibetan andBhutanese medical systems was that medicine was not normally amonastic practice in Bhutan. Professional family lineages of doctors seem to have constituted the bulk of the elite practitioners, and while monks might on occasion make offerings to the Medicine Buddha,they did not normally practice medicine. Visits by IMS officers In 1905 the Sikkim Political Officer John Claude White visited Bhutan to present a knighthood to Urgyen Wangchuk in recognition of his contribution to the Younghusband mission, which he accompanied toLhasa. Probably for financial reasons, White was accompanied not by aEuropean medical officer, but by a hospital assistant. The only surviv-ing record of his activities seems to be in White's memoirs, where henotes having treated a murderer who had been punished by amputa-tion. White, however, was himself able to assist the Maharaja, whosesight was failing somewhat, by gifting him his own glasses, which were fortuitously suitable. 7 White visited eastern Bhutan the following year (1906), accompa- nied on that occasion by a vaccinator. He records that at one location: I started my vaccinator at work early, and before evening he had vaccinated over two hundred people, who all seemed verypleased, and flocked in for the operation. I had sent the [Mahar-aja] a consignment of lymph from Gangtok, as he wished to in-BHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 175troduce vaccination throughout Bhutan and his operator met us [here] to be instructed what to do.8 A total of over 800 people were vaccinated on this 1906 visit.9But it was apparent that there was a far greater demand for medical servicesthan could be provided by an unskilled assistant and the Sikkim stateengineer (who took on a medical role during the mission). White notesthat at Serpang: in this camp also people crowded to be vaccinated, and to betreated for various diseases. I did what I could, and Mr Dover[the engineer] was indefatigable in dispensing medicines, but it would have made a very great difference if I had had a doctor with me. 10 On his next mission to Bhutan in 1907, White was finally assigned amedical officer, Captain Henry Hyslop 11and in 1909-10, Charles Bell visited Bhutan accompanied by Dr. Kennedy, whose personal diary re-cords that at Chukha in January 1910: As soon as the people realised I was a doctor a great many peo-ple came along for medicine. In all 60 came before tiffin; 19 ofthese were venereal (apparently this county is even worse in thisrespect than Tibet) and most of the other cases were trivial. ...One gained the impression that they had great faith in our Eng-lish medicines. 12 Later he noted that: Smallpox sometimes appears in very severe epidemic forms (lastepidemic occurred nine years ago) when it kills people in scores.H.H. [His Highness, Urgyen Wangchuk] ascribes the large areasof deserted cultivations, partially at any rate to these two causes[the other being malaria] He himself has been vaccinated and isa firm believer in it; he is anxious to introduce it into his coun-try. Bell is wiring for some vaccine, and I have promised to teach some men how to vaccinate, if it arrives in time. 13 The vaccine arrived soon after and Kennedy instructed 'one of the Ma- haraja's men ' in vaccination.14But because Bhutan was of little impor- tance to the British, imperial medical initiatives there were limited tothese kinds of small-scale measures. Events in Tibet, with the collapseof the Chinese position and the subsequent Simla convention, meantthat Bhutanese affairs increasingly took a backseat in the Political Offi-176 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINcer's thinking, while World War One and its demands for medical offi- cers on the European front produced a great shortage of manpower inthe Government of India's British ranks. Thus, when a cholera out-break occurred in Bhutan in 1919, the same year Bell again visited Bhutan, a female medical practitioner, Dr. Ethel Cousins, accompanied by a Nurse Brodie, were sent to deal with it. 15 The next visit to Bhutan by an IMS officer was made in 1922, when Dr. Dyer accompanied the Sikkim Political Officer F.M. Bailey on hisvisit to Bhutan to invest Urgyen Wangchuk with another title. Theysubsequently crossed into Tibet and Dyer's report does not distinguishbetween cases treated in Bhutan and those treated in Tibet. But hedoes record that chronic ulcers, which formed around 30% of the 433 cases he dealt with, were especially common in Bhutan, and that while they were, 'said to be the result of the bites of certain insects, undoubt-edly a fair proportion of them were of syphilitic origin '. 16 Dyer states that 'the lack of facility [sic ] and the short halts at the camps', made it difficult to carry out any operations, 'although a num-ber of surgical cases necessitating operation came to seek relief andhad, unfortunately, to be denied'. 17In the absence of any suitable oper- ating theatre in Bhutan, this problem remained throughout the British period. Only the most basic surgery was possible and one of the main attractions of turning to the British dispensaries in Sikkim and Tibetwas thus not a significant factor in attracting Bhutanese to biomedi-cine. Bailey visited Bhutan again in 1924 but, presumably for financial reasons, without an accompanying IMS officer. In 1927, however, fol-lowing the death of Sir Urgyen Wangchuk the previous year, Bailey ledanother mission to Bhutan to attend the investiture of the new king, Jigme Wangchuk. He was accompanied by Major R.L. Vance IMS, whose report does not appear to have survived. The next British mission to Bhutan was undertaken by Bailey's suc- cessor Lt-Colonel J.L.R. Weir, travelled there 1931 to in-vest Jigme Wangchuk with a knighthood. The medical arrangementsfor this visit indicate Weir's awareness of their political value. He askedfor 1,000 rupees worth of medicines to distribute, and not only re-quested the services of M.R. Sinclair IMS, his companion on two pre- vious visits to Lhasa, but also those of a sub-assistant surgeon to assist Sinclair. Government financial stringencies were always a factor thatthe Political Officers had to take into account in their applications forfunding on such missions, but Weir was well-versed in such matters.He pointed out that: The political advantage of these medical officers being with meis too obvious for me to lay further stress on it. My proposalsBHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 177have been framed with a view to gaining a maximum of political advantage with a minimum expense and I would request thatthey may be granted. 18 Sinclair subsequently submitted a detailed account of the 'Medical As-pects of a Tour in Bhutan ' which painted a bleak picture of health con-ditions in the kingdom. 19It began by stating that: Bhutan ... is a country whose inhabitants are poor and the ma-jority of whom are ignorant. Owing to centuries of interbreedingand the prevalence of such diseases as venereal, they are of poorphysique and only the fittest can survive. Before many years, however, the survivors, having no knowledge of personal hy- giene, suffer from such and unsightly goitres.The his teeth or washes his mouth andhis food is, as often as not, rotten meat. The result is that he isslowly and chronically poisoned by a combination of enteritisand toxic absorption from oral sepsis. The percentage of the po-pulation suffering from Gonorrhoea and Pyorrhoea cannot be less than 80 per cent. Furthermore, owing to their complete lack of sanitation and to the consumption of badly cooked infectedmeat, especially pork, Ascaridiasis and Taeniasis are almost uni-versal. Such was the demand for Sinclair's services in Bhutan that the medi-cines carried proved totally insufficient, and additional supplies wereobtained from the Trade Agency at Yatung. 1,343 patients were treated and 370 vaccinated, but it was noted that this was probably an under- statement as the 'seething mob' of patients prevented efficient clericalrecording. No complete breakdown of conditions treated was given inthe report, but the demand for vaccination against smallpox did notprove as great as expected, which was attributed to the fact that thosepreviously inoculated considered themselves fully protected. The re-port 20stated: The complaints met with were chiefly Gonorrhoea, Goitres, Gas-tric troubles, Syphilis and joint pains. The goitres are of the Col-loid Cystic type, many becoming large and pendulous. Toxicsymptoms are rare and I only saw one case of Graves disease.Joint pains are due either to bad Pyorrhoea, to gonorrhoea or toboth, and as no cure can be expected in one evening's treatment,Epsom Salts becomes a ready and effective form of treatmentfor which kudos may be gained. Ringworm and other skin dis-178 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINeases, Chronic Bronchitis, various eye troubles and Intestinal Parasitis, e.g., Round and Tapeworms, make up the remainderof one's cases.Epilepsy, Congenital Heart disease, Cretinism and various con- genital deformities such as Harelip and cleft palate are not un- common ... cases of Nodular and mixed Leprosy were seen, butas these were far advanced with large ulcers all over the body, lit-tle could be done for them during a night's halt ... [except at]Bumthang [where] the same type of cases were seen, but, as wehalted there ten days, much was done in the way of healing ul-cers and curing the commoner maladies. One case of Pulmon-ary Tuberculosis was seen. During the trip, two operations were performed under chloro- form anaesthesia and several under local anaesthesia. Amongthe latter may be mentioned a Harelip, Papillomatta, Sebaceouscysts ganglions. Owing Bursae form over exter-nal malleoli. Suppuration frequently occurs and large callous ul-cers remain. Given that these reports were primarily intended for future medical of-ficers visiting the kingdom, the report concluded with further notesand suggestions for the guidance of such readers. It noted that on theirreturn journey patients were waiting in each village and along the road-side. Many of them were suffering from malaria contracted during thewinter months when Bhutanese journeyed south to trade, and Sin-clair's report warned that; 'They all begged for quinine and unless aconsiderable quantity be taken, one's stock runs out in a few days.' It concluded by warning future medical officers to be sure to take a plen- tiful supply of medicines, including supplies in case of cholera out-breaks, adding that supplies of empty bottles were unnecessary as thelocal people were accustomed to carrying their medicines in bambootubes. Sinclair's report thus helped to build up the medical picture ofBhutan that the British were developing. Later medical officers visitingBhutan would consult reports such as those of Dyer and Sinclair beforepreparing medical equipment and supplies for the journey. Weir's successor as Political Officer in Gangtok, Frederick William- son, visited Bhutan in the summer of 1933 (and went again briefly toHa in 1934 21) and among his entourage was Captain David Tennant IMS, who began a two-year term as medical officer in Gyantse laterthat year. As in the case of Weir's mission, a sub-assistant surgeon ac-companied Tennant, but the medical report on this mission was briefand superficial. Other than noting the most prevalent conditions en-countered - venereal diseases, alimentary complaints, goitre, rheumaticBHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 179disorders and dental conditions -Tennant gave no breakdown of condi- tions treated. He recorded that a total of 764 patients were treated dur-ing the two month journey, but this figure includes an estimated 200cases drawn from the mission 's own baggage coolies. That fewer Bhu- tanese resorted to Tennant's treatment than had availed themselves of Sinclair's services is inconsistent with biomedical progress in this re-gion throughout the British period and difficult to explain as anythingother than a reflection on Tennant's performance. Tennant, however,partly attributed the comparatively light workload 22to the warm sum- mer weather. It was, he claimed, the season in which the Bhutanesewere 'more concerned about their crops than their ailments'! 23 After Williamson 's untimely death in Lhasa in 1935, his successor Basil Gould led missions to Bhutan in 1935 and 1938. He was accom-panied on both occasions by Captain W.S. Morgan IMS, the Gyantsemedical officer who also accompanied Gould's 1936-37 mission to Lha-sa. While Morgan 's medical reports from Bhutan do not appear to havesurvived, Gould's report on the 1938 mission included lengthy com-ments on one medical-related matter. 24Gould, in the wider context of the growing Nepalese population, was concerned that the Bhutanesepopulation was declining, and that the people were, 'tending more and more to become sterile, or to produce children who die in early in- fancy'. There was, he noted: A time when it was ... held that ... certain remote races, whenconfronted with modern civilisation, were apt to die off for noapparent reason except a failure of vital energy. But in mostcases investigation has disclosed the fact that such dying off isdue to the introduction of some definite new factor such as gin, unsuitable clothing or food, or specific disease. In the present case, while in the entire absence of census or other statistics it isdifficult to adduce definite proof, there appears to be little doubtthat in fact a serious decline has actually set in, and that, whileenteric fever and other diseases, and possibly certain social andeconomic causes, play their part, the decline is in the main attri-butable to venereal disease, especially Syphilis. 25 Noting that venereal diseases were 'extremely prevalent in adjacentareas of Tibet and that ... intercourse between Bhutan and Tibet ... ismuch more frequent than was formerly the case'[ sic!], Gould suggested that, unlike the Tibetans, the Bhutanese had little resistance to the ef-fects of these diseases. He further noted that the expense and lengthynature of treatment for venereal diseases made their elimination diffi-cult, 'coupled with the fact that even a few injections are apt to produce180 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINsuch alleviation as to render an average ignorant person unwilling to subject himself to further treatment'.26 Gould considered, however, that there were grounds for optimism for the future, given a determination on the part of the Maharaja and of his right-hand man, Raja Dorji, and also of their wives ... to face the facts,and a social system affecting all of the Bhutanese under which apersonal lead given by such persons would be apt to be particu-larly effective. And I would emphasise the fact in the present in-stance it is not the case that a British officer is urging a Durbar,or a local authority, to direct attention to health, but that it is those in authority in Bhutan who have, constantly and with great earnestness, directed my attention to the matter, and havepressed me to bring it to the notice of the Government of India. Yet Gould admitted he could propose no immediate solution for theproblem, given that the Government of India had refused Williamson 'sprevious request for an increased subsidy for Bhutan to deal with sy-philis. He could only state that: Possibly the Government of India may be disposed to considerwhether, in place of money, they could see their way to contri-bute drugs, together with aid in the matter of medical staff. Pos-sibly there may exist some organisation, or some private indivi-dual, to whom the study and cure of syphilis in a circumscribedand hitherto completely undoctored area [would] be a matter ofsuch interest as to justify the expenditure involved. If on the other hand it should be considered that the seriousness of the case as represented me by the Bhutan Durbar and by CaptainMorgan may have been exaggerated and requires further study,I am assured that the Durbar, which is by no means disposed or-dinarily to welcome visitors, would afford to an investigatorevery facility which he might require. 27 This was not a new issue; Dr. Graham, the Kalimpong missionary, had written to the Maharaja in 1922 advising him that a population in- crease was the first priority for Bhutanese development.28However, the first census was not undertaken in Bhutan until 1969. So, the un-derstanding of a declining birth rate and population there was notbased on any reliable evidence or systematic research. The first Civil Surgeon for Bhutan and Tibet, Captain W.H.D. Staun- ton IMS, visited Bhutan in 1941 in a purely medical capacity, ratherthan as an accompanying medical officer of a visiting Political Officer.BHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 181Gould paid another official visit to Bhutan in February 1943, accompa- nied on this occasion not by the Civil Surgeon for Bhutan and Tibet,but by the Civil Surgeon in Sikkim, Captain St. John Hendricks (whohad previously accompanied Williamson on his visit to Ha in 1934). 29 Hendrick's report on the 1943 mission was purely statistical, but Gould's report states that one-half of the King's 80 attendants 'pre-sented themselves for treatment for gonorrhoea'. While the percentagewas lower in the general population, they suffered heavily from goitre,malaria, and worms, all of which, Gould thought contributed to de-creasing fecundity. Gould was also able to report, however, that the Ma-haraja had taken Captain Hendricks' advice, and wanted to have the en-tire population around his palace treated for venereal disease, as well as to obtain a large supply of various modern drugs. 30 However, as was the case in Tibet, the British understanding of ve- nereal diseases as endemic in this region was derived from a misinter- pretation of the statistics of resort; the belief that the venereal diseaserates among those who consulted the IMS physicians were representa-tive of the overall population. The surviving reports from Bhutan bythe medical officers Dyer, Tennant and Hendricks are not sufficientlydetailed to enable us to reach firm conclusions about medical issues there, and the position is complicated by Dyer's failure to separate cases from Bhutan and Tibet. But his 1922 report indicates that of 433persons treated by him, 158 suffered from ulcers, 72 from dyspepsia,49 from constipation, 35 from rheumatism, and 22 from conjunctivitis,and ear problems. Just 20 patients - less than 5% - had venereal dis-eases. In 1933, however, Tennant, while not providing a proper break-down of the 754 patients he treated, reported that venereal diseaseswere 'predominant', along with intestinal parasites, goitre, rheumatic disorders, and dental conditions (which were 'very prevalent'). A decade later, Hendricks reported that the 248 cases he treated consisted of thefollowing: Table 5.1 Medical Conditions: Bhutan 1943 Reported condition Patient numbers Gonorrhoea 71 Malaria 47 Worms and Constipation 55 Goitre 33 Syphilis 6 Minor Injuries 24 Coughs and colds and minor ailments 12182 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINThe figures suggest that the Bhutanese reception of biomedicine had much in common with the process as it occurred in Tibet, with theBhutanese rapidly concluding that biomedical treatment for venerealdiseases was more efficacious than the indigenous treatment. Thus, from consisting of less than 5% of the cases in 1922, it rose to approxi- mately 30% in 1943 (although, as noted, social disruptions due toWorld War Two may have increased these disease rates in the entire re-gion). The only comparable increase was in the goitre rates, which rosefrom under one per cent of Dyer's patients to around 13% of Hen-drick's two decades later. Goitre, however, was endemic to the pointwhere it was seen by the Bhutanese not as a disease but as part of theirhuman condition. The increase in consultation rates in this instance seems to reflect a growing understanding that it was a treatable medi- cal condition, although, in as late as 1964, a visiting British physiciannoted that; 'Nodular goitre is scarcely regarded as a disease.' 31 Once the belief that venereal disease was particularly prevalent in Bhutan had taken root, however, it persisted. A study undertaken in1968 noted that 'there is reputed to be a lot of venereal disease in Bhu-tan but this has so far not been confirmed by laboratory tests' 32and a subsequent survey found 'a seropositive syphilis rate of 8.8 per cent, a figure similar to findings elsewhere in the Himalayas.'33It does appear, therefore, that the accounts of high venereal diseases rates in this re- gion are a myth arising from strategies of resort. Basil Gould paid a further visit to Pharo in 1943 with the medical of- ficer Lt-Colonel E. Elliot IMS,34while the last Political Officer in Sik- kim, A.J. Hopkinson, visited Bhutan in 1947 accompanied by a Lt-Colo-nel L.K. Ledger IMS. 35While the IMS officer's reports do not appear to have survived, in his 1943 report, Gould claimed a growing interest in biomedicine was developing among the Bhutanese. There was, he sta- ted, no doubt that the creation in 1940 of the post of Civil Surgeon,Tibet and Bhutan, and the Civil Surgeons (first Captain Staun-ton and then Colonel Hislop) have done much to awaken inter-est in medicine in Bhutan. There has been no opposition on thepart of the monks or of any other class and, the more frequent the visits, the more the people seem to respond to them. 36 Gould had little contact with the bulk of the population in Bhutan and following usual administrative practices, was certainly intent on pre-senting the activities that he had personally promoted in the best possi-ble light. But while the impact of biomedicine in Bhutan in the colo-nial period was extremely limited, the admittedly narrow range ofsources gives little hint of any resistance to the British doctors practis-BHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 183ing there. If we accept that Tennant's report, which was rather less en- thusiastic about the Bhutanese reaction to biomedicine, was largely areflection of his own performance, then we may conclude that as inSikkim, the local population do not appear to have resisted the addition of biomedicine to their range of treatment options. In such a society, royal support for the new system must have been a powerful factor inthat acceptance, but there were also cultural factors, as will be seen. Maharajas and missionaries While biomedical practice in Bhutan was introduced by IMS physi- cians, Christian missionaries contributed to the awareness of biomedi- cine there through their dispensaries in Kalimpong and around theBhutanese frontier. But their greatest contribution, particularly in re-gard to the indigenisation of biomedicine in Bhutan, came in regard tothat biomedical stepping-stone, Western education. Bhutan, like Tibet,had been visited by 18 th-century Jesuit missionaries before closing its borders to outsiders. But following the establishment of a Christianbase in Kalimpong (which had been part of Bhutan when it was an- nexed by the British under the Treaty of Sinchula in 1865), Bhutan be- came a prime target for the missionaries planning the expansion ofChristianity into the Himalayas. In 1891 the indigenous Christian 'Kalimpong Foreign Mission to Bhutan ' was founded, which to avoid the restrictions on Europeans tra-velling there, sought to use local Christians to spread the Gospel acrossthe frontier. With deaths among the Kalimpong missionaries beinghigh, this endeavour was particularly costly. The first volunteer died of cholera on the morning he was supposed to leave Kalimpong and, although two other converts founded a mission at Rungamutti on thesouthern frontier of Bhutan, they also died of cholera in 1896. 37As the missionaries gradually developed a foothold on the frontiers of Bhutan,more deaths followed. Sigrid Gahmberg, a Finn from the ScandinavianAlliance Mission, who in the late 1890s became the first Europeanmissionary to enter Bhutan since the Jesuits, died of malaria in 1900,while Choten Bhutia, the leading local evangelist, died of hydrophobia in Bhutan in 1901. 38 Despite enjoying some success among the largely Nepali population on the frontiers, neither the European nor the 'Foreign ' missionaries had any real impact on Bhutan during this period. In Kalimpong andSikkim, the missionaries offered education and medical treatment;without those tools the Foreign Mission struggled and in retrospect itcan also be seen that missionary initiatives which attempted to subvertthe existing social hierarchies in the Himalayas made little progress.184 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINAny lasting successes achieved occurred through gaining the consent of the local elites. As we have seen in chapter one, a strong proponentof that approach was Dr. Graham in Kalimpong, who slowly developedties with the most powerful Bhutanese individual with whom he had contact. This was Raja Urgyen Dorje, who served as the Bhutanese re- presentative in Kalimpong until his death in 1916. A relative of the Ma-haraja Urgyen Wangchuk, and holder the important fiefdom of western Bhutan, Urgyen Dorje became the main intermediary be-tween the Bhutanese and imperial governments. Graham similarlyacted as a diplomatic agent. He was able to cultivate ties with Bhutanthrough Raja and later the Raja's son Sonam Tobgye Dorje, whohad attended Dr. Graham 's school as a day pupil and took over as the Bhutanese representative upon his father's death. 39 While Graham was a supporter of medical missions, he personally devoted greater attention to developing schools, an initiative Urgyen Dorje was similarly keen to develop. The Maharaja Urgyen Wangchukwas himself receptive to at least certain aspects of modernity, 40and his support for education provided the missionaries' initial entre \u00b4ei n t o Bhutan. In 1914, lacking the funds necessary for the internal develop-ment of such structures, the Maharaja turned to the missionaries, re- questing that they open a school in Ha for the sons of local aristocrats. Two indigenous Christian teachers were sent from Kalimpong, and byNovember of that year it was reported that there were 32 pupils at theHa school, which internal missionary reports proudly stated had'Christian instruction as the basis of its teaching'. 41In the hope of strengthening Bhutan 's links with India and boosting Christian influ-ence among the pupils, 42the missionaries arranged that during the winter season, the boys moved to Kalimpong to continue their educa- tions. In 1921, the first four of these Ha-Kalimpong students reached Indian university entrance standards and by 1924 eleven of the first 45students had graduated. It was from this group that the first Bhutanesebiomedical practitioners emerged, with two youths being sent to Indiaby the Bhutanese government for medical training, and two others sentfor veterinary training. 43 The identity of the first Bhutanese biomedical trainees is difficult to ascertain. Records pertaining to these early medical endeavours are ex- tremely limited; and within Bhutan there are apparently no biomedical records that survive from this period. There is a reference in Britishsources to one 'Phanchung', who qualified as a sub-assistant surgeonat Campbell Medical College in December 1931 and returned to Bhutanthe following year. He had spent at least four years completing thethree year course and thus must have begun his training no later than1927-28; 44suggesting either that there were two earlier trainees, or that the initial commencement of training was delayed. PhanchungBHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 185may be the practitioner referred to by Dr. Tennant in his report on his 1933 mission as the newly qualified (Bhutanese) doctor who was prac-tising at Bumthang and who was treating as many patients per day asTennant was. Tennant reported, however, that he had difficulties in his relations with the 'lamas' and, having unsuccessfully treated the young- er brother of the Bhutanese ruler for typhoid, that patient's death didlittle for his reputation or that of 'Western Medicine'. 45 Oral sources suggest that Dr. Tobgye of Ha was probably the first fully qualified Bhutanese biomedical doctor. Many of the early medicalpractitioners were from Ha because of the Ha-Kalimpong school pro-gram, and Dr. (later Lynpo Medical Faculty') degree and later obtained an MBBS in India. Although not a high-ranking aristo- crat by birth, he went on to become Head of Health Services, personalphysician to the King, Government Minister, and Ambassador to India.He was a contemporary of Dr. Karpo Tsering, the other early qualifiedbiomedical practitioner, who was also from Ha. In addition to the Ha-Kalimpong educational initiative, another school was opened at Bumthang in 1915, and a teacher was also sent tothe Maharaja's court at Punakha around that time to instruct the Royal children. In 1917, these schools were inspected by Mr Hornell, Bengal Director of Public Instruction. 46Dr. Graham himself visited Bhutan in 1921, and although the initial missionary emphasis in Bhutan was oneducation rather than medicine, Graham is credited with introducingthe use of iodine for the treatment of goitre there. 47As in Sikkim and Tibet, it was the development of a Western-educated class of Bhuta-nese, familiar with biomedicine and its associated worldview, that en-abled the emergence of the first indigenous biomedical practitioners. In the absence of state or imperial government funds, royal and aris- tocratic patronage was essential to this development process. Raja Ur-gyen Dorje covered most of the expenses schoolfrom his resources, 48and Maharaja Urgyen Wangchuk ensured that his own family received some Western education. After Urgyen Wang-chuk's death in 1926, his son and successor, Jigme Wangchuk, contin-ued his policies. In 1943, for example, it was noted that he was payingthe expenses of two former pupils at the Ha-Kalimpong school who were studying at Campbell Medical College in Calcutta. 49 While patronising Western learning, the Maharaja, like his fellow traditional rulers in Chamba and other Himalayan states, did not cease to sponsor traditional institutions.50Instead, these new systems were incorporated into traditional roles and structures; pluralistic medicinegenerated pluralistic patronage. As in kingdoms such as Chamba andSikkim, it appears that patronage was an intermediary step before thestate's assumption of support, and a correlation may also be noted be-186 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINtween the traditional Royal patron 's eventual loss of political power and the usurpation of his patron 's role by the state. In addition to those Bhutanese who were introduced to biomedicine through Western education, many received biomedical treatment at the mission hospitals in Kalimpong, while others visited the small Scottish mission dispensary established early in the 20thcentury just across the border at Todey.51Although the development of indigenous state bio- medical structures did not begin until at the earliest the 1940s, thearistocratic and trading classes were thus made aware of the new sys-tem. The first record of any structure is Tennant's report from 1933that there was 'a more or less permanent dispensary' in Ha where (bio-medical) 'treatment [was] readily sought after', and he attributed its success to the number of educated persons residing there. 52But there is no further mention of this dispensary or of the one in Bumthang and, furthermore, both appear to have been private initiatives. Whenthe British left South Asia, Bhutan still had no resident Europeans,and also lacked any significant biomedical structures. The colonial period: Some conclusions Imperial initiatives to introduce biomedicine to Bhutan reflected thewider political context of the period. The primary concern of the Britishwas to ensure the security of India's northern frontier by cultivatingties with Tibet, which was most easily approached through Sikkim.Having gained the control over Bhutan 's foreign affairs necessary totheir security interests, the British had little concern for its internal af-fairs. The Political Officers responsible for this frontier were pre-occu- pied with Tibet, and to a lesser extent Sikkim, at the expense of Bhu- tan. These priorities were symbolised by the fact that the British didnot establish a Residency in Bhutan, or even open Trade Agenciesthere on the Tibetan model. The lack of biomedical structures and cen-tres was one consequence of the absence of a permanent imperial re-presentative in Bhutan. Bhutan could not afford to develop its own biomedical structures as its cash income was largely restricted to the annual British subsidy. That subsidy was a mere 50,000 rupees until 1910, when it was doubled, and a similar sum was given annually to Bhutan from around1920 to compensate it for moving liquor shops ten miles back fromthe Indian border. Gould was finally able to get the subsidy doubledagain in 1942, but the cost of supporting the state administration andmonasteries left little finance available for development projects. Whilea number of possibilities were investigated, revenue-raising schemes ofBHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 187the type introduced in Sikkim were still in their infancy when the Brit- ish left.53 With the Bhutanese government unable to afford modernisation measures, and unable to obtain any extra funding from the Govern- ment of India, progress was limited to such privately funded initiatives as the Ha-Kalimpong school. The issue of voluntary medical workersbeing recruited to work in Bhutan does not appear to have been ser-iously considered. Had a program for the introduction of biomedicineinto Bhutan been intended that was entirely free of political considera-tions, private doctors might have been given permission to practicethere or volunteers sought. But the only medical practitioners consid-ered likely to volunteer their services for any extended period were medical missionaries and fears - shared by both the Political Officers and the Bhutanese government - of their impact on the local cultureruled out that option. But the visits by the IMS officers demonstrated that a demand for biomedical services existed in Bhutan, not least in regard to epidemicconditions. As in Sikkim and Tibet, the indigenisation of vaccinationfirst demonstrated that biomedicine was not an exclusively Europeanpreserve, but the establishment of a body of Western-educated indivi- duals was necessary for indigenous biomedical advancement. While the Political Officers supported the extension of modern education toBhutan no imperial funding was available for this and the developmentof schools in Bhutan was largely due to the initiatives and support ofDr. Graham and Raja Urgyen Dorje, who thus laid the groundwork forthe modern indigenous biomedical system in Bhutan. But what seems to have been the critical factor behind the eventual development of biomedicine there was that the Bhutanese rulers from Urgyen Wangchuk onwards were keen to introduce that system into their kingdom. Despite the extreme financial restrictions, they encour-aged its development there, firstly through allocating funds for generaleducation, and then through funding specialised medical educationand training in India. The British contribution was limited to advice,and to providing medicines for the use of visiting medical officers; theGovernment of India did not provide any regular funds specifically formedical purposes there. Although the British were successful in gaining the consent of the indigenous elites for the biomedical project, biomedicine had made lit-tle impact or structural advance there when the British departed. AWestern education was an essential precursor of biomedical training,and whereas the Sikkimese began that educational process in the late1880s, it arrived a generation later in Bhutan, which meant that, as aconsequence, it was a generation behind Sikkim in its production ofbiomedical professionals. The result was that many of the issues that188 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINhad been dealt with in Sikkim in the colonial period, emerged in Bhu- tan in the post-colonial era. That period will be examined in the follow-ing pages. It is not possible to provide a comprehensive account of thisdevelopment in the space available, and thus the narrative is selective, accentuating those elements of the expansion of biomedicine that have emerged as significant in earlier chapters. Post-colonial developments When the British withdrew from their South Asian empire in the late1940s, Bhutan was almost entirely lacking in the infrastructure that had been developed in Sikkim and the Himalayan districts of India. Even Tibet was better equipped in terms of roads and communications,as well as military, administrative, and even public health systems.While the Tibetan state was already employing foreign technical advi-sors, Bhutan remained closed to outsiders when the last British Politi-cal Officer in Sikkim, Arthur Hopkinson, handed over command tothe new Indian Political Officer, Harish Dayal ICS, on 1 September1948. But unlike Tibet, Bhutan had retained its independence. Under an agreement signed in August 1949, India acquired the British role, allowing Bhutanese internal autonomy and national independence, inreturn for which Bhutan agreed to follow Indian 'advice' in foreign re-lations. The sense that Bhutan was entering a new era was enhanced by the death of King Jigme Wangchuk in 1952, and the accession of his son,Jigme Dorje Wangchuk. In 1953, a National Assembly was formed andthe records of its sparse early proceedings suggest a very tentative ex- perimentation with democratic processes. However, public health is- sues were an area of consensus. One of the first proposals made by theAssembly in 1953 was to set up 'an indigenous medical school', 54 although it is unclear whether this refers to Traditional Medicine or toan indigenous biomedical school. While there were no immediate de-velopments in that regard, by the end of that decade there were sixteenbiomedical health clinics in Bhutan, of which five were being upgradedto hospital status. The cost of building these clinics was largely met by local labour and construction, with the government then provisioning the clinics and providing staff, many of whom were those trained inKalimpong. 55Such developments were accelerated with the introduc- tion of Five Year Plans in 1961. The 1950s and 1960s thus saw the pre-liminary development of a Bhutanese public health system, with anemphasis on the development of indigenous structures and the ex-tended training of Bhutanese medical practitioners to compounder le-vel in Kalimpong and to full qualification at Indian medical schools.BHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 189One significant decision was to adopt the British model of state provi- sion of free medical treatment for all classes of people and to reject pri-vate medicine (even today there are no private medical practitionerspermitted in Bhutan). But in the absence of sufficiently trained medi- cal professionals, the health system relied heavily on foreign practi- tioners, particularly from India, but also European specialists, includ-ing medical missionaries. Indian doctors, generally from northeastern India, were employed on a contract basis. Bhutan 's isolation meant that it was not an appeal-ing posting to many, and the quality and dedication of those who camenaturally varied, 56but there were those who found it very much to their taste and they managed to earn the respect of the Bhutanese. One example is Dr. I.K. Mohanta, who is currently the pathologist at the main hospital in Thimpu. Born and schooled in Upper Assam, hedid his MBBS at Assam Medical College, graduating in 1964. Not initi-ally drawn to medicine, he was encouraged to take it up by a distin-guished former doctor that he respected and was subsequently encour-aged by one of his College professors to take up pathology. He gainedan MD in Pathology and Macrobiology at Gauwhati Medical College in1969-71, where he met another Assamese doctor, J.N. Sharma, who had served in Bhutan. Dr. Mohanta agreed to a trial period in Bhutan and there he has remained, acting as Thimphu Hospital Superinten-dent in 1984-85, but preferring the practice of pathology. 57 Another doctor to make his mark in Bhutan was Tsewang Y. Pemba, who, as noted, was the first Tibetan to qualify as a biomedical physi-cian and surgeon. Dr. Pemba was invited to Bhutan by Jigme PaldenDorje, the grandson of Raja Urgyen Dorje and later Prime Minister ofBhutan. Dr. Pemba (whose wife is Bhutanese), spent three years at the new hospital in Paro, and later returned to Bhutan to serve as Superin- tendent of the Thimphu Hospital from 1985 to 1990. 58 Just as Raja Urgyen Dorje and his Maharaja had originally promoted Western education in Bhutan, so too did their direct descendants final-ly turn to European missionaries to provide medical services in Bhu-tan. This change of heart was doubtless due to their observations ofthe missionaries' activities in this region during the preceding century.While the medical missionaries in Kalimpong had established biomedi- cal services there that were clearly beneficial to the community, they had largely failed in their efforts to convert Buddhists to Christianity.They had had a similar record in Sikkim, where Mary Scott was highlyregarded and liked by the Sikkimese rulers but had made few converts.There were close links between the ruling families of the HimalayanBuddhist states and knowledge of her activities would have spread toBhutan, not least through the marriage of Raja Urgyen Dorje's son So-nam to one Dorje who invited Dr. Pemba and he also invited Dr. Craig, a le- prosy specialist from Edinburgh who served as Superintendent of theCharteris Hospital in Kalimpong, to come to Bhutan to advise on thesetting up of a new hospital in Thimphu. 60Dr. Craig's activities were well-known to the Bhutanese. Around half of the leprosy patients inKalimpong were from Bhutan, 61and not only had Bhutanese youths trained under Dr. Craig in Kalimpong but the Royal Family had beentreated at the Charteris Hospital (the present King Jigme Senge Wang-chuk was born there in 1955), and the Bhutanese Queen Mother hadeven done voluntary work there. 62Finally satisfied that the mission- aries were unlikely to convert Buddhists, the Bhutanese, although con-tinuing to forbid Christian evangelism, accepted Christian doctors and teachers from the 1950s onwards. In this latter category the Jesuits made a particular impression, with much of Bhutan 's present rulingclass having received a Jesuit education. 63 The Kalimpong influence remained strong, with most Bhutanese medical practitioners, including many nurses, training at the hospitalthere. Dr. Tashi Yongten, for example, was born in Bhutan, schooled inBumthang and Kalimpong, and then attended St Joseph 's College inDarjeeling. His parents were deeply religious and encouraged him to take up medicine as it was 'good action ' in the Buddhist sense. Dr. Yongten took his medical degree at C.B. Medical College in Orissa andafter returning to Bhutan in the mid-1960s served as Medical Officerto the Maharaja, and became Director of Health Services. 64 A similar career pattern was followed by Dr. Samdrup, perhaps Bhu- tan 's best-known biomedical pioneer. A grandson of Kazi Dawa Samdr-up 65(1868-1922), a Sikkimese aristocrat and translator of the History of Sikkim who became Professor of Tibetan at Calcutta University, Dr. Samdrup was born in Darjeeling and educated in Kalimpong. Moti-vated by the desire to 'do something' and to support his family, he tookup medicine and graduated from Assam Medical College in 1961. Hisgrandmother's suffering from cataracts inspired him to take up surgeryto help others with that condition and in 1963 he went to Bhutan, per-forming 33 cataract operations when he arrived. At first, having onlyever practised on a right eye, he only operated on that one, but he re-ceived further training from visiting doctors funded by the Lions Club, which sponsored a number of medical camps in Bhutan at this time. His later career was a symbol of the growing internationalisation ofBhutanese medical systems. Dr. Samdrup went on to work with UNI-CEF, and to travel to Switzerland with the Maharaja, who was treatedthere for a cardiac condition before his death in 2002. In the 1980sDr. Samdrup worked with the World Health Organisation in Switzer-land and Sri Lanka. He had previously attended the World Health Or-ganization conference in Alma Ata in 1978, which promoted medicalBHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 191pluralism,66and it was here that he was influenced by the Sri Lankan 's patronage of Traditional Medicine. Dr. Samdrup was later posted to the WHO Delhi regional office working on the leprosy programme there.In 1996, he returned to Bhutan, becoming Chairman of the Polio Commission from 1997, with further studies in Hawaii the following year, before his final retirement. 67 As in Sikkim, the construction of a modern public health system and the promotion of biomedical understandings in Bhutan has re-quired certain social negotiations. One example of this was the pro-blem of stray dogs, which were potential transmitters of diseases suchas rabies. Whereas in Sikkim a dog-licensing system had been intro-duced in the 1920s, the National Assembly, after a long-running de- bate, concluded in 1970 that 'Bhutan being a Buddhist country, the killing of dogs should be exclusively restricted to the mad ones', 68and to this day there are large numbers of stray dogs in the urban areas ofBhutan. 69Similar political negotiations may also be observed in regard to their acceptance of international aid from a very limited group of tra-ditionally non-aligned nations with no regional political interests, suchas Canada, the Netherlands, Denmark and New Zealand. The religious sentiments of Bhutan can create certain tensions in the medical sphere, malaria control, for example, can be seen as con-trary to Buddhist practice in that it involves killing living creatures. Butit may just as easily be justified on the grounds that these disease-caus-ing creatures are not compassionate beings. Abortion is a similarlycomplex issue. Today, efforts are being made to articulate these issuesin terms compatible with traditional models of understanding. For ex-ample, the encouraging of villagers to keep the local water source purecan be expressed in terms of avoiding polluting the realm of the local water-spirit, while understandings are translated into terms that equate germs to demons, pulse to blood pressure and so on. Similarly, withthe local practice of blood-letting, which in the context of HIV is pro-blematic, there is no local taboo against sterilising the instrumentsused and so local healers are encouraged to do that. 70 A very different example involves the smoking of tobacco, which the Bhutanese considered offensive to the Buddhist deities. Bhutan 's foun-der, Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, is credited with having 'enacted the first-ever ban on smoking in public when he outlawed the use of tobacco in government buildings' in the 1640s, 71and Bhutan today has the strictest laws against tobacco consumption of any nation on earth.192 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINStructures and diseases in Bhutanese public health By 1964, there were dispensaries staffed by compounders in each of Bhutan 's 23 districts and four biomedical hospitals, the biggest of which was a 50 bed hospital in the capital Thimphu. It included sepa- rate male and female wards, an operating theatre, dispensary, dentaldepartment and 'rudimentary' laboratory, with an x-ray machine 'to beinstalled'. 72It eventually was, and a TB ward was also added, but it was increasingly clear that a new hospital was needed to replace this basicwooden structure, which was located across the river from the royalcastle dominating Thimphu. Due to the Bhutanese Buddhist custom ofalways circumambulating the royal centre to the right, that hospital had to be approached by a detour around the castle, which was not medically appropriate in emergency cases. A new hospital, which came to be named the Jigme Dorji Wangchuk National Referral Hospital, was developed with considerable inputfrom practitioners such as Dr. Samdrup and Dr. Craig. 73Maximum use was made of available resources, with Dr. Samdrup ensuring that theoperating theatre was situated so that when the sun came up in themorning it would warm up the theatre. The hospital was officiallyopened in 1974, which was fortuitously the coronation year of the newKing, Jigme Senge Wangchuk. Patients, however, were first moved intothe hospital one rainy night in October 1973, when the old hospital was damaged by floods and had to be quickly evacuated. 74 Jigme Dorji Wangchuk National Referral Hospital in ThimphuBHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 193The new hospital provided a centre for the training of Bhutanese medical personnel and a Dr. J.S. Berkeley of the University of Aberd- een, who had previously worked in Bhutan on a leprosy survey in theperiod 1968-70, was invited to establish a medical training school in Thimphu, with WHO and UNICEF funding. 75The emphasis of that program was on training primary health care workers for rural areas, and a WHO-funded nurses training program was also institutedaround this time with Dr. Berkeley and his wife teaching there. Regis-tered nursing qualifications were obtained after a three-year course andvarious sub-disciplines such as dentistry and physiotherapy were alsointroduced; today all Bhutanese nurses are trained inside the coun-try. 76 Prior to this nurses training program, most nurses were trained in Kalimpong while others learned 'on the job' in Bhutanese hospitals,and there were no ranks or specialisations. Nurses, whose work patternwas fourteen days on, one day off, did not enjoy a particularly high sta-tus and had no prospects for advancement. While their motivationmight be similar to that of doctors - the long-serving Sister PasangOm recalls that having seen her uncle being taken care of by nurses inthe old hospital she liked the idea of medical service - they were not necessarily well-educated; Sister Pasang, for example, began nursing in 1966 at the age of 13. 77 Biomedical development had gender implications in providing state employment for women such as Pasang Om, the only breadwinner ina family with three children. As in other Himalayan Buddhist regions,Bhutanese women had traditionally enjoyed a higher status than in theneighbouring Sino-Indian and Central Asian societies, including eco-nomic freedoms, but biomedical developments provided new opportu- nities for female advancement, particularly in regard to women and children 's' health issues. While there are no records of child mortalityin the colonial period and there was no register of births and deathsuntil the 1970s, the child mortality rate was apparently very high. 78As in Tibet, indigenous medical practitioners did not deal with maternitycases for reasons of purity and women in labour kept this secret fromall but their immediate household. Childbirth thus took place in thehome with, at best, the attention of another woman with some experi- ence of midwifery. Traditional post-natal purification rituals and an iso- lation of the home of newborn babies offered some protection fromdisease but childbirth complications were frequently fatal. 79 While the Bhutanese aristocracy might travel to give birth at Kalim- pong, maternity care for the majority of Bhutanese developed slowly. Itinitially focused on primary health care workers locating expectantmothers and encouraging them to receive pre-natal care. But in 1969,Dr. Harku Norbu arrived FOOTPRINTS REMAINlist. Kalimpong, Norbu had studied medicine in Cal- cutta, where she met her husband Dr. Jigme Norbu, who was the Lha-sa-born son of Rai Bahadur Norbu Dondhup, a leading intermediarybetween the Tibetan government and the Political Officers in Sikkim in the 1920s and early 1930s. Dr. Jigme Norbu was educated in Kalim- pong and the Jesuit college in Darjeeling, graduating in science in1959. He had been a classmate of Dr. Yongten at Darjeeling, and choseto work in Bhutan rather than India, arriving there with his wife in1969. They received Bhutanese citizenship from the King in 1976, andboth subsequently served terms as Superintendent of the JDW hospitalin Thimpu, Dr. 1990-92, andDr. Norbu is remembered as the leading figure in the development of maternity and gynaecological structures in Bhutan. 80 Smallpox had almost disappeared from Bhutan by the 1960s. But Dr. Samdrup recalls that in 1965 a truck stopped outside the old Thim- pu hospital, dropped off one of a number of Nepali labourers who wereemployed in building work on the Royal castle, and sped away. The la-bourer was confirmed as having smallpox and most of the other la-bourers immediately fled, spreading smallpox throughout Bhutan. Thenew TB ward at the hospital had just been completed and was empty, so this was used as an isolation ward in the ensuing epidemic, where the death rate was around 50% of those infected. The victims wereburned rather than given the traditional burial. Despite problems withthe quality of the lymph provided, the epidemic was eventually con-trolled. Procedures were instituted to deal with future outbreaks via iso-lation, a development of the traditional practice and one effective underthe traditional rural population dispersal throughout remote valleys.But this was the last major outbreak of smallpox in Bhutan, although, due to difficulties of access and inadequate recording systems, it was not certified by the WHO as smallpox-free until the late 1970s, shortlybefore smallpox was globally certified as eliminated. 81 More problematic in this period were leprosy and goitre, both of which were widespread in Bhutan. A leprosy hospital was opened in1965 and developed under Dr. Berkeley; the disease gradually becameless common until today when it is rare. Endemic goitre was dealt withby banning the sale of non-iodised salt in the late 1960s. 82In 1985, the Bhutan government commissioned its own salt iodisation plant,83 and in 2004, the Prime Minister reported that goitre now affected un-der 5% of the population, in contrast to the 1983 figure of 64.5%. 84 Since June 2003, the Bhutanese Ministry of Health has been divided into two departments, Public Health, and the Health and EducationDepartment, which is concerned with primary health care and the de-velopment of curative systems. There are some 120 doctors, 70-80 ofwhom are Bhutanese nationals 85and fifteen students are annually sentBHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 195for medical training, so that the medical services are expected to be fully indigenised within a decade.86A new 350-bed addition is being made to the JDW National Referral Hospital with Indian governmentassistance and there is now at least one Grade One hospital per district - a total of 29 in the 20 districts - with Basic Health Units in all but one district of Bhutan. 87These Basic Health Units are staffed by a Community Health Worker, a medical assistant and a midwife. Theyfocus on clinics and preventative work, encouraging villagers to use la-trines and to keep water sources pure. Similar work is carried out invillage and community schools. 88 While India, China-Tibet, and Nepal allow private medical practice, Bhutan today remains the only Himalayan state where there is no pri- vate medical practice of any kind allowed. They believe there are a number of advantages to the state monopoly on medical practice. It al-lows more comprehensive health surveillance and reporting systemsand enables quicker responses to major problems. A state presenceand strong medical services in the rural areas is also considered helpfulin preventing urban drift (including that of older people) while the em-phasis on early 'on the spot treatment' (especially in rural areas) pre-vents many conditions from deteriorating, thus reserving the hospitals for serious problems. 89While there is a shortage of medical practi- tioners in Bhutan, private practice is not seen as a permanent solution to that problem. At present, patients of all social classes are said to be'in the same boat' in terms of their treatment options and a wide rangeof tests can be done that many could not afford with private practice. 90 Ultimately, however, it seems to be a question of quality, with privatepractice seen as leading to a lowering of standards. As one doctor putit; 'If a man buys a truck and makes money, everyone wants to buy one'; 91i.e., if medicine is seen to be profitable, profit will become the motive for the establishment of a practice. There are dissenting views in this regard, with some seeing private practice as a solution to the shortage of doctors. One factor contribut- ing to this lack is that citizens of neighbouring states are increasinglydrawn to Bhutan not only because the medical services are free there,but also because they are now better than those of their neighbours.While an Indian Medical Service type arrangement where doctors were permitted to charge fees for private consultations with the elites while providing free treatment for all at dispensaries might be considered asa future compromise, the principle of government control is a signifi-cant one. The principle of free medicine remains sacrosanct despitethe introduction of fees for non-essential treatment such as cosmeticdental work and drugs not among the list of those considered essential.Free treatment extends to those sent out of the country for advancedconditions such as hip replacements and kidney transplants. 92196 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINCertain problems are seen as arising from free medical services; pa- tients call doctors with minor complaints and may have unrealistically high expectations of treatment, demanding ultra-sounds, caesareans,etc. Doctors' workloads are thus high and they are effectively always on call. The allocation of resources remains problematic and Bhutan is also affected by global health 'fashions'. The institution of anti-HIVmeasures, for example, on which international agencies now placegreat emphasis, takes resources previously devoted to diseases such asmalaria, which could be more devastating in practice. While Bhutanhas the advantage of being a Buddhist country on good terms with itsneighbours, and thus spends very little on defence, medical costs arepotentially infinite, and the increasing costs of the system are an in- creasing problem. 93However, this is not a problem restricted only to Bhutan. The Prime Minister's admission that 'the services that are available can never compare favourably with the actual need of our peo-ple' 94could be applied to just about any country. Medical ethics: A shared belief? One theme that emerges strongly from medical research carried out inBhutan concerns the conceptual framing of the doctor's place in so-ciety, which appears to reflect Buddhist ideas of 'right livelihood' , andto also derive from established Himalayan social hierarchies and con-cepts of duty and responsibility. The concept does not appear to be af-fected by the type of medical system the doctor follows, but was a fac-tor encouraging the uptake of biomedicine as a career, with a numberof subjects noting that they were attracted to medicine by the desire to dedicate themselves to service. 95 In Bhutanese Buddhist culture the medical profession is looked up to and it is felt that doctors are fortunate to be in a positionwhere they can help people - and therefore they should helppeople. So there is a responsibility with the duty. Many feel doc-tors don 't need to pray because their performance of their dutiesis a prayer. 96 Similar sentiments were expressed by virtually all of those interviewedfor this project. Medical practice is considered 'good action ' or 'right li-velihood', which are basic Buddhist concepts of the proper path to en-lightenment. A doctor's status is equal to that of a monk. They are bothperceived as performing good work albeit in different fields, and thedoctors themselves also perceive their work in these terms, with severalreferring to their hospital as the 'temple' in which they practice reli-BHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 197gion.97Since doctors are perceived to be responsible to the community and have a duty to be concerned for their patients, it is acceptable to telephone a Bhutanese doctor at home, or to stop them in the marketfor medical advice, and the doctors, perhaps ruefully at times, do ap- pear to accept this role. Obviously, there is a degree of rhetoric involved in this situation and, as is the case anywhere, individual standards vary.But this issue is at the centre of the medical discourse in Bhutan andthere is a general articulated concern for patients as well as an aware-ness of the ideal doctor and the status bestowed on those who live upto that ideal. The status of medical practitioners does not appear to be related to the practice of a particular medical system. It is also valid for foreign doctors, particularly Europeans who status is enhanced because they are seen as professionals who have renounced a richer worldly lifestylein order to serve in Bhutan. Despite the current Bhutanisation process,this concept survives. 98 There is evidence that medical practice here reflects the ideal to a greater degree than elsewhere. Bhutanese doctors are highly respectedin neighbouring states and the corruption common to these regions isabsent among these doctors. Medical staff routinely work longer hours than in other branches of government and perform beyond their du- ties. Technicians, for example, helped to design a new laboratory inThimpu. 99Perhaps most significantly, young Bhutanese sent abroad for medical training invariably return to their own country. The vastdrain of medical professionals to the West that afflicts other Asian na-tions simply does not occur in Bhutan. The increasing pace of modernisation is bringing higher expecta- tions and demands in the medical field, as is the case among the gen- eral public. Indeed, the very necessity of having to articulate the doc- tor's ideology may indicate that it is becoming a threatened ideal. Butthe Bhutanese King's stated policy of prioritising 'Gross National Hap-piness' above 'Gross National Product' has led to a debate over the nat-ure of Bhutanese identity and the shape and priorities of its future de-velopment. One contribution to this debate has been by Dr. Gado Tser-ing, Officiating Secretary of the Health Department. By explicitlydrawing on Buddhist models, he has described an ideal of 'Bhutanese doctoring', which emphasises 'Kindness, Compassion, and Politeness' as the key features of a doctor's relationship with the patient, for whoma consultation should resemble 'a visit to a good friend'. Touching a pa-tient - to indicate that the doctor does not consider the patient of a low-er status - is an essential feature of this model, but he recognises thatthis requires prioritising time, which is Bhutan. 100198 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINPatient-based enquires are needed to ascertain the extent to which the Bhutanese public health system actually embodies these conceptual ideals. But the fact that these debates are significant issues in contem-porary Bhutanese society is an indication of the extent to which biome- dicine is shaped as a system by local cultural factors, not only in terms of concessions to indigenous practice, and the indigenisation of per-sonnel and structures, but also in terms of the wider conceptual locat-ing of biomedicine within society. While the ideals expressed in Bhu-tan are by no means foreign to Western medical practitioners, the ex-tent to which they are at the forefront of the construction of a nationalmedical system reflects the traditional culture of Bhutan. So too doesthe most outstanding characteristic of the Bhutanese public health sys- tem - the extent to which it has integrated Bhutanese Traditional Medi- cine into the state medical system. Bhutanese traditional medicine The imperial sources are silent on the extent of interaction betweenbiomedicine and the indigenous traditions of Bhutan in the colonial period. As in Sikkim and Tibet, biomedical practitioners in its initial development phase ignored the local medical practices under the impli-cit assumption that these would fade away. In the 1950s and 1960s,the Jesuit missionaries did experiment with treatment under both sys-tems, offering, for example, local medicine for diarrhoea but treatingbacterial infections with penicillin. 101But the two systems were kept se- parate at the state level, with government (and foreign aid) supportgoing to the development of biomedical structures. Patients, however, exercised their own choices. As one health official recalled; 'People would try allopathic medicine and if it didn 't work they would go backto traditional medicine, some just went first to traditional healers.' 102 It was recognised that factors such as ease of access, local language familiarity, and religious understandings all favoured continuing resortto local healers and that local medicine was liable to be preferred incases where people knew from previous experience that it worked. Norwas biomedicine necessarily immediately appealing, its dietary restric- tions on items such as salt were unpopular, the prospect of surgery frightening and the need for return visits not understood. 103As one Bhutanese doctor put it; 'Biomedicine takes time to learn about just aselectricity, when it was first introduced, brought many electrocutions,and cars brought many accidents. It took people time to learn to usethem.' 104 As in Sikkim and Tibet, this 'learning phase' took at least one gen- eration, but in contrast to the situation in India and amongst the Tibe-BHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 199tan exile community, medicine does not appear to have been located in a nationalist context during this period. Bhutan did not engage in ananti-colonial struggle for independence, or develop nationalism basedon the European model. Local, regional, and religious identities were generally more prominent than national identities and, in the absence of nationalistic issues, a pragmatic approach predominated. Biomedicaldoctors were aware that 'long-term patients would float around', obser-ving, for example, the marks of burns left by the local practice of cup-ping, which indicated that the patients were also receiving local treat-ment. They would attempt to persuade patients not to combine treat-ments, but otherwise accepted the practice. 105 Again as in Sikkim and Tibet, the development of biomedicine was characterised by selective acceptance. This was not just a question ofresort for particular medical conditions, but demand for particulartreatments such as injections and X-rays, which were especially popu-lar. So too were Penicillin and Tetracycline and their use spread widely,with lay people giving injections and keeping a stock of antibiotics intheir homes for a variety of illnesses. 106Thus, there was an under- standing that at least some efficacious biomedical treatments were 'freestanding'; their inherent efficacy existed outside of the power com- plexes and the authority of the elite or upper-class medical practi- tioners; it was available to one and all. However, this does not appearto have affected the status of medical practitioners, suggesting that adoctor's status was primarily based not on efficacy, but on intent -compassionate motive and action in the Buddhist sense. Faith in biomedical treatments developed particularly as a result of their efficacy in regard to chronic diseases such as leprosy, smallpox,TB, diabetes, and pneumonia; conditions that local medical treatments could not control. While it does appear in the early period that monks advised people against seeking biomedical treatment, once the monksthemselves - and even local doctors - turned to biomedicine there wasincreased confidence in the new system. 107But surgery was slower to find favour, perhaps because the Bhutanese had not had an early intro-duction to surgery as had the Tibetans wounded in battles against theimperial forces. However, with the increased understanding of biome-dicine that came from education and empirical experience, surgery too became increasingly common. 108 While biomedicine's prompt action was a factor in attracting pa- tients, Bhutanese medical personnel emphasised that the visual aspect of biomedical treatment was also of great importance. Laboratory re-ports, x-rays, ECGs, and ultrasounds could all be shown to the patient,as could kidney stones and other internal growths removed from thebody. This meant that even the illiterate could understand their condi-200 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINtion and its treatment, increasing the understanding of and confidence in, the new system.109 But the key factor that led people to take up biomedicine remained a Western knowledge-based education. Even today, there is a divide be- tween the educated, who favour biomedicine, and the uneducated, whose first resort is to the local system.110Given the educational devel- opments that have taken place in Bhutan in recent decades, the 'un-educated', in most cases, means the elderly and those in the more re-mote districts. This might suggest the decline of the indigenous sys-tem, but while this appeared to be a possibility in the 1960s, stateintervention has produced a very different result. The state medical system in Bhutan has, since the 1970s, integrated local practices into its biomedical institutions. While emergency treat-ment remains biomedical, hospitals throughout Bhutan (with the ex-ception of those in Thimpu), now provide patients with a choice oftreatments offered by biomedical or local practitioners. While there areas yet no formal referral structures other than in the case of notifiableinfectious diseases, doctors are free to refer patients to the alternativesystem and there is interaction and dialogue between practitioners.While local practitioners refer patients for tuberculosis, conditions re- quiring surgery and so on, biomedical practitioners accept the efficacy of local treatments primarily for non-specific chronic diseases, psychia-tric conditions, and ear, nose and throat problems. With both systemsproviding free treatment and medicines, economic factors do not ap-pear to affect resort and patients commonly adopt the strategy of chan-ging systems if their condition is not responsive to one treatment. Thebelief remains, however, that biomedicine is fast-acting, and patientsmay thus have less patience with biomedical treatments than with the traditional. 111 The systemisation of Traditional Medicine began in the 1960s with the establishment of an Indigenous Medicine Unit, a dispensary staffed by two Drungtsho s (Doctors), Pema Dorji and Sherub Jorden, both of whom had trained in Tibet.112The Unit was formally recog- nised by the Royal Government in 1967 and its development as a mod-ernised division within the Bhutanese public health system began. In1979, it was upgraded and became the Institute of Traditional Medicine Services and a new hospital and training centre were built in Thimpu. It is only in the capital that, due to the numbers of patients, the twosystems are separated; the hospital at the Institute of Traditional Medi-cine Services provides traditional treatment while the Jigme DorjiWangchuk Hospital provides only biomedical care. In certain respects, biomedicine remains hegemonic in Bhutan. Emergency treatment (wounds, fractures, etc.), is biomedical, and pa-tients are sent for specialist treatment abroad only under biomedicalBHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 201auspices. Because there was neither an indigenous surgical tradition nor did Bhutanese Traditional Medicine practitioners deal with mater-nity cases, both areas are almost exclusively biomedical domains today,as is the treatment of infectious diseases. But while the structural de- velopment of Traditional Medicine may have lagged behind biomedi- cine, and the leading figures in the public health system are primarilybiomedical graduates, there is continuing official support for the tradi-tional system, and considerable tolerance towards it among biomedicalpractitioners themselves. While the development of the Institute of Traditional Medicine Ser- vices does represent a modern systemisation and centralisation of thetraditional medical practices, it remains a living tradition, engaging with local practitioners and encouraging innovation and development rather than focussing on the selective reconstruction of elements of thepast. Traditional Medicine does function as a complementary systemand does so explicitly within the context of Bhutanese Buddhist cultur-al understandings and practices. These latter aspects also define theconstruction of the identity of 'the doctor' in both systems in Bhutantoday. In addition to the official integration of Traditional Medicine, biome- dical hospitals in Bhutan have also introduced another initiative thatadds an indigenous dimension to biomedical practice. We have seenthat accepting and facilitating the patient's right to consult monkswhen considering such issues as an auspicious day for elective surgeryhas contributed to the acceptance of biomedical treatment in Tibet. Inthe early 1990s, the Bhutanese government formalised this practicewhen they placed a monk on the staff of each of the regional hospi-tals. 113In addition to carrying out daily purification rituals in the wards, which is considered of psychological value to the patients, the monksassist in mediating such issues as family planning. They are consid-ered particularly valuable in cases of amputation where there is a Bhu-tanese belief that those losing a limb will also be reincarnated minusthe amputated limb in their next existence, a belief the monks are ableto negotiate. It is a Bhutanese custom that a monk should be presentwhen people are dying and the hospital monks spend much of theirtime in this role, performing the appropriate rituals. While a desire to be left alone may be common among the ill in the West, patients in Bhutan prefer company, and the presence of the monks is particularlycomforting to those without families or those from remote districtswhose families are not present. Biomedical staff view this initiativewith cautious optimism, considering that they work toward the sameobjectives as the monks, and that 'you must work with them not op-pose them '. 114202 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINOne factor behind these initiatives was that members of the Royal fa- mily have acted as patrons to both local and biomedical practices. They themselves have both a biomedical physician and a Traditional Medi-cine consultant and they have also been exposed to biomedicine in Ka- limpong, which has made them more aware of its benefits than people restricted to Bhutan. But they have continued to offer support to the lo-cal system. Given the nature of Bhutanese society, royal opinion re-mains important. But medical officials note that they - and the royalfamily - have also responded to people requesting the establishment ofmedical services in their area, and they have contributed labour andmaterials for the construction of various medical clinics. Doctors recog-nised that, in rural areas, 'what we thought was good was not always what they thought'. 115Preventive campaigns where the need was not obvious to the people brought only slow acceptance, whereas the peo- ple wanted, for example, measles vaccinations as they could see theirchildren dying of this condition. As one official remarked; 'The localsweren 't fools, they had different aims, and we had to listen to them.' 116 Perhaps the key reason why patients continue to resort to the tradi- tional system was the recognition that biomedicine could not cure allof the manifested medical conditions. Resort to Traditional Medicine was a logical strategy, particularly in those areas where biomedicine could not provide a guaranteed cure. But the simple fact of the avail-ability of a medical practice encourages resort and state support bothin material terms and in terms of social authority mean that Bhutanesestate support for Traditional Medicine must be considered as a factorexplaining patients choice of that system. In simple terms, the estab-lishment of dual-system public health clinics has meant that patientshave had access to a medical clinic, while the fact that the practitioners there provided state medical resources, meant the clinic embodied state authority in the field of medical knowledge. There is, however, a wider dimension to consider. Today Bhutan is a developing nation, but it also one that explicitly questions the modelsof development that have been applied elsewhere in Asia in recent dec-ades. 117Having observed the social, cultural, and environmental degra- dation as a result of the encounter with modernity in places such asLhasa, Kathmandu, and Dharamsala, Bhutan has sought an alternative model, one more in tune with the country's Buddhist principles. Con- temporary medical developments and articulations of health policy inBhutan are related to this wider enquiry. There have been great improvements in a short period of time in the health conditions of people in Bhutan, where health statistics are nowamong the best in Southeast Asia. A willingness to question receivedmodels from external sources and a desire to continue with indigenousmodels is implicit in this successful development. Whether the ele-BHUTAN :A LATER DEVELOPMENT 203ments of the system considered traditional can survive Bhutan 's conti- nuing encounter with modernity is another question, but the existingsystem does represent a continuation of ideas and understandings thatearlier medical practitioners - missionaries, IMS officers, and local practitioners alike - maintained and generally lived up to. Their foot- prints thus remain.204 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAIN6 The Choice of Systems Biomedicine in the Indo-Tibetan world today is part of a pluralist world of medicine comprising elements of various traditions and practices.Its structures and personnel have been largely indigenised and no Wes-tern doctors hold permanent appointments there. Biomedicine is re- cognised as being of foreign origin and has associations with local and global modernities rather than indigenous religio-cultural traditions.But it has become firmly rooted in the local medical world followingpractical concessions to local cultural understandings and the adoptionof many aspects of its practice and theory by indigenous medical practi-tioners. Reflecting wider social responses to modernity, the medico-cultural fractures induced by the introduction of biomedicine have resulted in a reformulated medical world. But medical cultures are intrinsically dy- namic and constantly evolving. 1While biomedicine is structurally dominant at the state (or exile-state) level, indigenous medicine also re-ceives state support in much of the region we have considered and itincreasingly profits from the growing global interest in TraditionalMedicine. With Western biomedicine indigenised and Tibetan Medicine sys- temised and internationalised, the boundaries between systems have blurred. Both actively promote their benefits and at least implicitly cri- tique other medical forms, but patients routinely switch between, orcombine, therapies. In recognition of that reality, there is increasingcommunication between the various competing practitioners in thismedical world, and even a growing sense of shared community indica-tive of a fully-formulated cultural system. Such pluralism seems historically characteristic of medical encoun- ters in this region, and is consistent with the conclusions of scholars such as Charles Leslie whose findings indicate that 'patients are, al- most without exception, pragmatic, and see nothing inconsistent aboutliberally combining different forms of therapy in their quest for re-stored health '. 2Craig Janes, for example, in a groundbreaking study of contemporary resort to biomedicine in the Tibetan Autonomous Re-gion of China, indicates that patients there pragmatically continue touse a variety of health care resources according to their understandingof what resources best address what symptom, and an understanding of how the nature of the illness, its onset and duration, dictates how itshould be handled. 3 While the boundaries between systems have blurred and dual resort is common if not characteristic, patients in the Tibetan world do routi-nely resort to biomedical treatment. Given that little more than a cen-tury ago the system was unknown to them, the question arises as towhy they choose biomedicine? In this chapter we shall discuss the fac-tors influencing that acceptance, focussing on the Tibetan exile com-munity, but taking the wider cultural region into account. An absence of hegemony There has been a significant transformation in resort since the intro-duction of Western medicine. The records of any particular medicalsystem do not reveal whether it is used by patients as their first resort,but the general trends are visible to practitioners. Thus, in 1911, theBritish medical officer in Gyantse lamented: 'In many cases, it is onlywhen these [Tibetan doctors] have experimented and failed that the pa- tients come to the dispensary. The result is that some of the cases are very serious.' 4His complaint was echoed in the 1950s by a Chinese biomedical doctor who complained to Tibetan aristocrats: ''When noth-ing [in Tibetan medicine] helps, then you come to us.'' 5But by the late 1980s, one of the leading practitioners of Tibetan medicine in the exilecommunity was voicing a similar complaint: 'Instead of coming to usonly as a last resort the patients should come much earlier.' 6 That biomedicine has attracted patients primarily due to its appar- ently greater efficacy might seem an obvious conclusion, but the issueis problematised in related literature. Craig Janes specifically avoidedthe subject, although providing a survey indicating that 34% [of nine-teen patients, i.e., 7?] found Tibetan Medicine more efficacious. 7Anil Kumar refers obliquely to efficacy as a factor in concluding that: 'Itmust be conceded and emphasized that 'colonial medicine', even if de-pendant, and public health policy, even if of a colonial character, weregreat improvements upon the pre-colonial medicine and health poli- cies.' 8Deepak Kumar is more explicit about the advantages of biomedi- cine. He found that, although 'reluctance and resistance were there, still many people, especially the propertied and educated classes, werequick to see the benefits', and he concludes that biomedicine 'wouldhave established itself even without government support'. 9A similar conclusion was reached in T.M. Madan 's study of a village near Delhi.He found no indication of any culture-based resistance to biomedicine,206 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINwhich was favoured by 80% of patients. They stated that the main rea- son for their choice was its greater efficacy.10 But more critical approaches to biomedical efficacy are common.11 As Margaret Lock and Mark Nichter have observed, anthropological ap- proaches to the subject have been dominated by theoretical under- standings deriving from the work of Michael Foucault. Thus, anthro-pologists have disputed, 'the entrenched habit of judging medical prac-tices everywhere in terms of measures of efficacy based on proscribedscientific (biomedical) standards', and have tended to understand bio-medicine as 'an instrument of governmentality'. 12Roger Jeffrey, for ex- ample, rejected efficacy as a factor in the uptake of biomedicine in In-dia despite recognising that Indian patients found Western medicine efficacious and that they used it 'in enlightened self-interest'. 13He con- cluded that: 'I do not believe that patients began to use Western medi- cal facilities because they were demonstrably better (though Westerndoctors always claim this). They were used because they were there,and they seemed to work sometimes.' 14 An insistence on the socio-cultural and political context of efficacy is characteristic of anthropological approaches to the issue, and the influ-ence of Foucault is implicit in the conclusion that, 'power complexes determine what is defined as efficacious and acceptable'. 15But, what- ever use may be made of them in the political sphere, power complexes within a profession may arise democratically and be a means of raisingand ensuring standards. As M. Miles points out, the fact that by 1900biomedical dispensaries in India were attracting more than 20 millionpatients a year was unlikely to be 'an incidental spin-off of deep-laidharmful aims', and Miles concludes that, 'it is not unreasonable tothink that many [IMS doctors] were keenly interested in controlling disease and promoting health '. 16 We also find other works that suggest a medical encounter in which issues of power seem less prominent. Helen Lambert's study of a for- mer Princely state territory in the post-colonial period found that 'atti-tudes to the selection of treatment are generally highly pragmatic', in-cluding 'knowledge of illness, previous experience, availability, econom-ic constraints, and, sometimes, social prestige' (with the elite classestending to favour biomedicine). 17Economic factors emerged as 'parti- cularly important', but the type of medical system they turned to wasnot that important to patients; 'new forms of therapy are generally ta-ken up with few reservations, and treatment is generally evaluated onthe basis of its perceived effectiveness.' 18As Lambert recognises, it is significant that her work relates to a Princely state, where, during theformative colonial period, local rulers enjoyed a negotiated autonomyin areas of social policy. A local ruler's attitude to biomedicine couldTHE CHOICE OF SYSTEMS 207make a considerable difference in the pace at which it was introduced, as we have seen in the case of Chamba state. Most of the existing studies regarding the introduction of biomedi- cine in South Asia concern regions directly ruled by the British Gov- ernment of India and they emphasise imperial government agency. But it is simplistic to imagine a monolithic colonial state and ignorethe realities of power diffusion that operated beyond the centre and itsrhetoric of control. Even in British India, imperial power was diffusedand multilayered. Central health officials issued directives to provincialofficials, who in turn instructed district officials, who instructed villageofficials who further instructed operatives. Policy implementation wasliable to mediation with a wide variety of social, political, and ideologi- cal interests, as well as practical considerations, at every level of this chain, and both British and indigenous officials were liable to interpretorders in line with their own interests and beliefs. Under the Princelystate system (which effectively included Sikkim and Bhutan), therewere far greater limitations on imperial power, and in Tibet, while theBritish representatives enjoyed more power and influence than usualfor diplomats, they did not have the power to institute social measureswithout local support. The British colonial state had a very limited role in biomedical devel- opments in the region under consideration here, with the exception ofSikkim. It did provide a regional model of development in terms ofboth structures and ideals. It did not, however, allocate regular fundingto biomedical developments in Sikkim, Bhutan, or other Himalayanstates under the Political Department and while it financed the biome-dical project in Tibet, no regular funding or systematic effort was allo-cated to indigenous development or training there. Imperial influence on medical development was also restricted by such factors as the brief two-year terms served by most IMS officers inTibet and the peripheral location of the imperial presence prior to theestablishment of a mission in Lhasa, both of which reduced biomedici-ne's impact. British initiatives did not lead to indigenous structures inBhutan or Tibet, or influence to any significant degree the future devel-opment of biomedicine in either state, which took place in the radicallyaltered circumstances after the period 1947-50. Even in Kalimpong the initial impetus to biomedical development came from the missionaries, not the Government of India. Nor did the Himalayan states themselves enjoy the power to enforce hegemonic understandings of medicine in the 1870-1950 period. Thediffused nature of power in Tibet, for example, was such that it hasbeen defined as a 'stateless society', 19and while individual rulers such as the 13thDalai Lama in the 1913-33 period did centralise power, there were always multiple sources of authority there, as was the case in the208 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINother Himalayan states. Even when a consensus developed, these states lacked the revenue necessary to support biomedical development. Ex-panding the system required finding new sources of income, some-thing that only occurred in the post-colonial period in the case of Bhu- tan and Tibet. The Tibetan state adopted smallpox vaccination in a limited form from the 1920s onwards and in the 1940s it paid for a small ward for its officials receiving treatment from the British hospital in Lhasa, butdid not otherwise institute any systematic biomedical education, train-ing, or public health structures. The process in Bhutan was similar,although it appears that the ruling elites there were more favourable tobiomedicine but lacked the means to institute it. Only in Sikkim, where the indigenous government carried on the initiatives of the im- perial government, was there effective development of public healthduring the colonial period. In Sikkim, however, missionaries, whosepresence was not encouraged by either the indigenous or the imperialpowers, also made a significant contribution to that process. Thus,while both the colonial and local states did intervene in and affect thedevelopment of biomedicine, there is little evidence from this region tosupport the claim that, 'power complexes determine what [was] defined as efficacious and acceptable'. 20 It is significant that neither the colonial nor local states instituted any systematic medical record keeping until at least the 1950s.21Medi- cine's exclusion from the knowledge-gathering project is further evi- dence that biomedicine in this time and place was not used as 'an in-strument of governmentality'. 22While post-colonial governments did draw on new sources of income to develop biomedicine, including glo-bal finance, it was already a common resort, and, as Deepak Kumar concluded in regard to India, it seems clear that biomedicine would have become established in this region without state support. What theBritish did impart was a model (of dispensaries and of public ratherthan private sector health provision, for example), that was adopted bythe post-colonial governments. State power thus dictated the structuraland institutional model rather than the system of medicine. It must be remembered in analysing developments in regard to Tibet that the colonial-era encounter with biomedicine was limited to the per- ipheries of the Tibetan cultural world where medical missionaries were based, and to the trade route from India to Lhasa via Gangtok andGyantse (with a very minor presence at Gartok in western Tibet). Thepost-1950 influence of Chinese biomedicine was far more significantin changing patterns of resort. 23In addition, we have drawn conclu- sions based on very limited sources,24and we lack evidence concerning strategies of resort by major social groups: such farmers, nomads, andtraders; any conclusions are thus qualified.THE CHOICE OF SYSTEMS 209On occasion, however, there are opportunities for illuminating com- parison between Western and Tibetan perspectives in secondary sources. Thus, Mrs Rosalie Guthrie, wife of Major James Guthrie IMS,writing from Lhasa notes that: 'Distant patients were treated and it was said cured (on occasions) by a Tibetan doctor if the patient's boot was sent in lieu of the person.' 25This seems to refer to a famous doctor in Lhasa about whom the Dalai Lama's mother stated; 'He could diagnosemy illness just by feeling my shoe or belt. I did not have to go in per-son. I would just send an article of my clothing. But he would never at-tend to people if they were past the age of fifty; he said it was a wasteof time, as they were about to die.' 26 More significantly, Dr. Morgan noted that no privacy was possible at the Lhasa dispensary, and that medical consultations became some-thing of a spectacle, attracting crowds eager for gossip and novelty. 27 But the aristocratic Jamyang Sakya was not keen to be the object ofpopular attention, noting that; 'there was always the problem of stand-ing in line to get to see the doctors.' 28She also observes the cultural difficulties for monastics in consulting biomedical physicians: celibate monks had never had their bodies examined .... having received certain high teachings and initiations, consider their bodies a mandalalike [sic ] temple that is not to be disturbed. They experienced not so much a fear of the needles hurtingthem physically, but mental anguish over this invasion of priv-acy. 29 Given that she is referring to the 1960s, and that notables such as thePanchen Lama and the Sakya Abbot had been vaccinated much earlier in the century, the depth of these feelings, or perhaps the lack of infor- mation exchange in Tibetan society, becomes clearer. Availability and cost as factors in medical resort Before returning to the issue of efficacy, we need to examine other fac-tors affecting medical resort. Two very obvious considerations govern this choice - availability and cost. These are virtually universal consid- erations, however we define concepts such as 'illness', 'treatment', 'hea-ler/doctor', etc. 30Only after these very practical considerations are ta- ken into account do other issues arise. The numerous instances of for-eign travellers who consulted local medical practitioners as they passedthrough remote areas confirms, in the absence of choice any availablepractitioner will probably be consulted, and we cannot assume thatchoices always existed in the Himalayas. While it is difficult without in-210 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINdigenous sowa rigpa prac- titioners in pre-communist Tibet, estimates range from under 100 to around 500.31Even the higher figure would equate to considerably less than one monk-physician per monastery in Tibet. While these esti- mates seem to exclude both amchi s and 'village level' practitioners, they do indicate a shortage of local medical specialists throughout the Hi- malayas. This was particularly the case in rural or peripheral areas,with patients consequently willing to attend any available practitionerand to travel considerable distances to do so. Biomedical development was stimulated by its practitioners actively seeking to make themselves available to patients. IMS officers did notonly practice in urban dispensaries. They would also seek out local peo- ple needing treatment in nearby villages and at temporary camps set up while they were travelling. Restrictions imposed by the local stateson areas that they could travel to were the only restrictions on these ef-forts. Missionary doctors in particular travelled widely in remote areas.As one churchman observed of missionary medicine in Sikkim; 'Youhad to go to the monks, but the mission doctors came to you.' 32 However, biomedical physicians were primarily based in urban cen- tres, as were local medical practitioners.33As a result, they were more often competing with the local physicians than operating in a medicalvacuum, and in cases where they did attract patients because they werethe only available doctor do not indicate a choice of resort to biomedi-cine, but only a pragmatic resort to any medical treatment on offer.Availability thus introduced people to biomedicine, but it did not neces-sarily influence their choice of resort. Cost seems a fundamental issue. The patient (or his kinship or social networks), must be able to affordappropriate medical treatment if it is available. Historical consideration of this factor is problematised by the Sino-Tibetan problem of compet- ing pre-1950 Tibet images. Medicine is an element in these discourses,thus pro-communist European observers claimed that Tibetan physi-cians ministered only to the higher ranks of the lamas, the nobilityand officers of the army. Poor monks and laity were entirely de-pendent on prayer and such simple home remedies as were known to them. 34 In contrast, exile sources often tend to imply that medical services in pre-1950 Tibet were freely provided as an act of Buddhist compassion.Thus, we read that at the Men-ze khang hospital in Lhasa 'All medi-cines were free of charge and there were no doctors' fees.' 35The Men- ze khang apparently drew on the model of state medicine in British In-THE CHOICE OF SYSTEMS 211dia and thus treatment there probably was free, but it is difficult to re- concile these highly politicised claims. There is evidence that medical professionals in Tibet, as elsewhere, normally charged for their services. Itinerants lived off the practice of medicine and monks provided professional medical services as they had since the beginnings of Buddhist monasticism in India.36The Je- suit Desideri's 18thcentury account of Lhasa doctors seems no more than realistic in stating that they were, 'well paid and generally stipu-late what their fee is to be before undertaking a cure'. 37A 1906 colo- nial report on Gartok, in western Tibet, states that: There is an ordinary hakim [i.e., local doctor] at a place three stages from Gartok; but his fee is very heavy, which the Zamin- dars [landlords] of this place cannot afford to pay. Many of themdie for want of treatment in consequence. 38 Given that the landlords were among the wealthier people in Tibet, thissuggests non-elite groups had little hope of professional treatment. Butthere is evidence that free medical aid could be available to the poor; aleading private practitioner of Tibetan medicine in the modern exile community states that their practice is not charitable work. But persons of any religious order, like saddhus, [and] lamas are treated free of charge. The poor arealso treated free of charge. From those who can afford to pay Icharge the cost of medicine. In all cases, consultation is free. 39 Given that this doctor was the 13thin her particular medical lineage, that concept does appear to represent at least one strand of the eco-nomic issue in Tibetan medical practice. Many amchis did offer free medical treatment, considering it as part of a religious duty, and in re-turn they gained enhanced social status. 40It may be safest to conclude that the issue is complex and that the situation probably varied with in-dividuals, but even the question of cost is complicated by cultural fac-tors. Both the imperial government and the missionaries provided freemedical treatment (including medicines), to all comers in the areas un- der consideration (as did the Chinese hospital in Lhasa in the 1940s), with some exceptions in regard to the wealthy elites. In the British un-derstanding, therefore, their health services were free, something as-sumed to be a major attraction to patients and a politically valuable ex-ample of imperial benevolence. It was also an implicit challenge to lo-cal medical practitioners and their income, and might have beendesigned to alienate them. 41212 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINGiven that free treatment was offered, we might presume that pa- tients unable to afford treatment from indigenous practitioners thus re- sorted to biomedicine for economic reasons. But, although many of thepatients at the IMS dispensaries came from the poorest classes, that conclusion is problematic. Desideri, describing Capuchin medical prac- tice in Lhasa, notes that their mission, 'have with great charity givenmedicine to sick people and have cured many without asking for anymoney, only accepting any present which is offered '. 42The IMS officers si- milarly 'cured many without asking for any money', and, like the Capu-chins, accepted 'presents'. This was usually in the form of foodstuffssuch as eggs, meat, or yak butter, and were of no real value to the Brit-ish. 43The gifts were accepted out of politeness and were certainly not regarded as payment by the imperial physicians. They were aware thatit was the custom throughout the Buddhist Himalayas to bring giftswhen visiting - not only officials (which would have implied corruptionin British understanding) - but also family and friends. 44The offerings were thus seen as a quaint cultural practice and accepted, albeit oftenpromptly disposed of. This still occurs in remote parts of the Hima-layas today, with indigenous biomedical doctors accepting items of littleuse to them because they consider refusing such gifts would be seen as insulting by the patients. As a Tibetan medical practitioner recalled; 'Often I didn 't want to accept pay for the medicine, but on many occa-sions the buyer would insist.' 45 The concept of reciprocality was inherent in Himalayan society, with payments expected in return for government and monastic posts, cer-tain exclusive religious teachings, and so on. But much of the indigen-ous population existed outside of a cash economy, and payment for anyservices was 'in kind'. Thus, in their understanding, 'gifts' to physi- cians equated to payment, and even if they were aware that that was not required, gifts might still be given in the very human belief thatthey would ensure a higher standard of treatment. There was also a Ti-betan belief that medicine could not be effective if there was no pay-ment for it. 46Thus, even if a growing understanding that free medical treatment was exactly that did encourage resort to biomedicine, eco-nomic factors were probably much less significant than the Britishhoped. Nonetheless, the British did establish a tradition of state re- sponsibility for free public health and with some restrictions, state bio- medical treatment remains free in this region to this very day. Nationalist factors in resort If the immediate practical considerations of availability and cost cannotexplain resort to biomedicine, other issues must be considered. WeTHE CHOICE OF SYSTEMS 213have seen that it is difficult to contextualise the medical transformation in this region in terms of imperial or indigenous state power. The gov-ernment did play a more powerful role in Sikkim, as it did in post-colo-nial Bhutan and Tibet, and in areas such as Kalimpong and Chamba where the twin forces of missionary and colonial state medicine com- bined to introduce biomedicine. However, the fractured process of bio-medical development and its introduction by various agencies is not in-dicative of any monolithic forces. Instead, it may suggest that state andimperial governments, were slow and limited in responding to theirpeoples' demand for biomedical services primarily for financial rea-sons. The most significant class involved in the process were the local lay and monastic officials who permitted and even sponsored biomedicalinitiatives in places like Gyantse. These individuals enjoyed consider-able autonomy within their own system and they were powerful en-ough to thwart many British initiatives they did not approve of, 47so their acceptance of biomedical initiatives cannot be seen as dictated byhigher powers. It appears that significant numbers of these individualscame to the conclusion that biomedicine was in their interests. Thoseinterests are rarely explicit in the sources, but given that the income of most lay and monastic officials was derived from local estates, econom- ic concern with the health of the wealth-generating classes may be pre-sumed, as well as humanitarian concerns with their peoples' welfare. These local officials and elites were not, however, a unified class even in the face of external threats. Socio-economic competition be-tween aristocratic families was endemic to the system, 48and there were a variety of both lay and monastic local, regional, and state offi-cials, as well as religious authorities, all existing in complex patterns of power and competition. The acceptance of biomedicine - not necessa- rily at the expense of local practices - was by individuals from theseclasses, not from a unified class. Biomedicine in Tibet in the colonialperiod was not, therefore, a powerful tool of government nor was itsdevelopment dictated by a unified power complex; it spread because in-dividuals saw its benefits. As one aristocratic woman, Jamyang Sakya,herself a Tibetan medical practitioner, recalled of her experience withChinese biomedicine in the 1950s: 'Never before had I surrendered myself or my child to Chinese medicine. But it was clear that our treat- ment wasn 't helping ...' 49 One factor shown to be historically relevant in the reception of bio- medicine in India is the role of nationalism, with the nationalist move-ment manifesting itself in various aspects of the medical processthere. 50But the multi-ethnic Indo-Tibetan frontier was largely outside of any nationalist discourse in the colonial period. The indigenous gov-ernments opposed Indian independence, advising the British to crack214 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINdown on the nationalists, although fantastically inflated rumours of Gandhi's activities suggests there was some popular support for hiscampaign. 51Sikkim and Bhutan existed in treaty relationship with the British Government of India, and as primarily Buddhist societies cultu- rally and historically orientated towards Tibet they had little interest in a Hindu India. Bhutan was free of resident colonial officials, and reso-lutely opposed to the idea of an Indian being appointed as Political Of-ficer there, 52while Sikkim included a number of different races, com- munities and language groups to whom Indian nationalist discourseswere largely irrelevant. Consequently, there is little indication of anyunited political consciousness directed at expelling the colonial powerfrom those states. Both Sikkim and Tibet lacked a sense of nationalism in the Eur- opean understanding of the term that is associated with a nation-state. 53While there was a distinct Tibetan identity deriving from such factors as shared language, diet, dress, mythology, etc., existing identi-ties there were primarily local rather than national. There is consider-able literature on this issue, 54which cannot be dealt with here, but further evidence for this is that the British were explicitly trying to de-velop a sense of nationalism in both Sikkim and Tibet as a means of unifying and thus strengthening their frontier 'buffer-states'. 55But this absence of national consciousness in the colonial period seems to have prevented the development of an association between medicine and na-tionalism as proposed for India, while as noted in the introduction,minority Christian communities may have held to a sense of a widerChristian community as their primary identity. In the post-colonial period, when nationalism did develop in the Hi- malayan states (largely in response to perceived and actual threats to their culture from Chinese and even Indian activities), its primary ef- fect in the medical field was to stimulate the systemisation, develop-ment, and promotion of indigenous systems rather than to explicitlychallenge biomedicine. Nationalism was certainly a key factor in theemergence of Tibetan medicine and its international promotion, and italso appears to have played some part in Bhutan 's medical develop-ments in recent decades as the Bhutanese seek a distinct national mod-el of progress. But the most convincing evidence against the concept of state or other power complexes as the primary force in promoting a medical system is that it cannot be reconciled with the general patternof resort, which was and is, selective. In both the colonial and post-co-lonial periods, patients have resorted to biomedicine for a limited rangeof conditions, often in conjunction with continuing to resort to localcures, a pattern recurring throughout the Tibetan cultural world. How-ever, selective or dual resort are not strategies promoted or imposed byany system, authority, state, or power complex and are more suggestiveTHE CHOICE OF SYSTEMS 215of understandings of efficacy than of ideological impulses. They indi- cate patients' pragmatic selection of what they perceive as the most effi-cacious curing strategy available to them. The steady increase in resort to biomedicine indicates the increasing number of conditions for which the biomedical was perceived to be themost efficacious cure. There are indications that cultural familiaritywith the general contours of particular curing strategies enhanced ac-ceptance of those practices. Cataract surgery, for example, was knownin Tibetan medical culture, the general concepts of splinting fracturesand of bandaging and covering a wound with some curing substancewere understood, and a system of variolation existed to pave the wayfor acceptance of smallpox vaccination. Such biomedical practices may, therefore, have been seen as superior rather than novel or 'foreign ' treatments. One characteristic of the growing belief in biomedical efficacy was an understanding that biomedicine cured rapidly, and patients were li-able to turn to other cures when that did not occur. That understandingseems to be a wider phenomena; Mark Nichter, for example, in a studyof Indian villagers' resort strategies, concluded that they would wait anaverage of four days for symptoms to diminish or disappear before seeking an alternative cure. 56Biomedicine's prompt action remains a significant factor in resort in the Himalayas today, where even those with a personal preference for indigenous medicine will resort to bio-medicine due to the demands placed on their time by the pace of mod-ern society. But the reluctance to undergo lengthy biomedical treat-ment, despite familiarity with the need for extended treatment in indi-genous practice, suggests that prompt efficacy was a more importantfactor in biomedical uptake than cultural familiarity with aspects of the system. The increasing resort to biomedical cures may also have been af- fected by the circumstances surrounding the initial encounter with them. Given that elements of the Tibetan army were drawn from awide geographical range, knowledge of the efficacy of biomedical treat-ment of wounds and fractures would have become widespread afterthe war of 1903-04. In the case of venereal disease, biomedical treat-ment was the favoured resort of the Chinese soldiers in Tibet, enabling them to act as cultural intermediaries encouraging similar resort by Ti- betans. 57 But while these elements may explain initial resort, that patients came to favour the biomedical over the indigenous form does suggestthat the new treatments were accepted because they were understoodas being in some way more efficacious than the indigenous therapies.In the case of smallpox vaccination, for example, the Tibetan govern-ment's acceptance of vaccination was contrary to their prevailing ten-216 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINdency to reject Western modernity after the early 1920s, and indicates that vaccination was primarily accepted because of its established effi-cacy. Monastic competition and the rise of a new elite class British officials attributed the gradual uptake of biomedicine in the Hi-malayas to the conservative nature of society there, in particular the so-cially influential monastic sector. The British tended to demonise thiscollective body they termed 'the monks' rather than to engage with thewider issues their views represented, for it was an article of faith among the British that the monastic elites opposed imperial endea- vours in order to protect their own privileges. But, although the monas-teries had a significant role as cultural guardians, they also representeda cross-selection of society. While the monastic elites were usually fromaristocratic families that acted as patrons of the monastery, the monkswere drawn from all social classes, and had some opportunity for ad-vancement based on merit. The monasteries were thus an integral partof the communities they served and their leaders were in close touch with community feelings. While doubtless seeking to protect their own narrow interests in many cases, they also needed to serve the interestsof that wider community. The decision to resort to monastic medical practitioners may have had a gender aspect as well, with women considered as the more deter-mined keepers of tradition. Dr. Pemba recalled that when he was sickduring his youth in Tibet, his father didn 't want to call in the monks,but, 'thought it would be better ... because if anything went wrong, mother would put the blame on him '. 58 Dr. Morgan also noted this tendency, recalling that, 'it was the wo- menfolk who were always to the fore in urging compliance with the time honoured and orthodox procedure of summoning the lamas'.When he questioned his Sikkimese Buddhist clerks regarding theirstrategies of resort, they replied that their first resort would be to thesub-assistant surgeon Bo Tsering, however, if symptoms persisted;'they would be compelled to call in the lamas, if only to allay the nag- ging of the womenfolk'. Perhaps more importantly however, they would also do so because to do otherwise would 'prejudice good rela-tions with the priesthood and [mean they would] encounter difficultieswhen they required their services for some purely religious purpose.' 59 It does appear that at least into the 1940s, as the British had com- plained, it was only when the monks 'had experimented and failed'60 that they recommended patients turn to the IMS dispensaries. How-ever, there is no record of any organised monastic resistance to Wes-THE CHOICE OF SYSTEMS 217tern medicine and individual monks are recorded as being among the first to resort to it. As we have seen, the only explicit active resistanceto the biomedical project recorded in British sources, was the resis-tance to smallpox vaccination around 1910, which emerged among vil- lagers, with no mention of it involving monastic powers. Despite cases of hostility toward the new system on the part of individual monksnoted in the British records, their opposition does not appear to havebeen systematic. One of the weaknesses of the British political and medical project in Tibet was that it primarily sought the consent and patronage of (whatthey considered to be) the more secular aristocratic elites. There wereincidental cases of friendships and alliances developing with religious leaders at various times, but, in general, the British understood the monastic powers as hostile (a belief that had developed in the lead upto the Younghusband mission). It was only after they gained a perma-nent presence in Lhasa after 1936 that a concerted effort was made tocultivate the friendship of the leading monastic authorities there andthose efforts did coincide with increasing biomedical resort. 61 The influence of the Dalai Lama was recognised as being of great significance in Tibetan Buddhist society. Having had smallpox (which generally confers future immunity), the 13thDalai Lama did not need to be vaccinated when he went to India and there is no indication that he ever resorted to biomedicine. But there is evidence that he was notopposed to it. While suffering a fever in 1921 he accepted - at least for'a day or two' - advice relayed from Dr. Kennedy that he should rest. 62 He is also reported to have stated as early as 1908 that he intended tosend Tibetan students to study science and medicine in India, 63he sent an approving letter to the American medical missionary Dr. Albert Shelton, and he cordially received the IMS physicians who visited Lha- sa in the 1920s and 1930s. The Dalai Lama also seems to have favoured the model of the public health system in British India, which he had observed while in exilethere in 1909-12. While an account of the founding of the Men-ze-khang in Lhasa around 1916 is an unfortunate lacuna in the field (andthere are only passing references to it in British sources), that institu-tion is generally assumed to have followed the Indian model. Even in the 1920s, when most aspects of modernity were rejected by the Tibe- tan state, vaccination was adopted at the state level, suggesting that theTibetan ruler recognised its benefits. What appears to have been hiscautious sanction of aspects of biomedicine and support for their indi-genisation can be seen to have been adhered to by his followers. Later,after his death in 1933, the Tibetan Regents and later the young 14 th Dalai Lama resorted to biomedical treatment at the British hospital in218 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINLhasa and in exile the present Dalai Lama has continued to support and resort to both biomedicine and sowa rigpa . The British imperial medical project was particularly focussed on the elite classes. While keen to offer biomedicine to all, the British re- garded the elites as the key to long-term biomedical acceptance. This was consistent with the wider tendencies of British imperial expansionin South Asia, a process that generally involved cultivating an allianceof interests with elite groups in local society. These elites were also thefocus of other aspects of modernisation; receiving scientific and tech-nological advances, modern weaponry, a Western education for theirchildren, and so on. This process led to the creation of a new (generallyurban), Westernised elite class with some knowledge of European worldviews, and identification with aspects of Western social and politi- cal activity. Disproportionately represented in colonial memoirs, thisgroup, which may have resorted to biomedicine for reasons of statusand as an indicator of association with Western modernity, was none-theless small, of limited influence, and remained both Buddhist andnationalist, rather than secular and internationalist. The construction of a class with a wider modernist worldview took time, and in Tibet and Bhutan the process was never fully realised in the colonial period largely due to their location outside the formal structures of empire. But the British records (which are heavilyweighted towards the Westernised elites for both geographical and stra-tegic reasons), do indicate that this class was increasingly representedamong those resorting to biomedicine. While this was a very smallgroup within Himalayan society, the hierarchical nature of that societywas such that their example stimulated other groups to resort to thenew system. But it would be very easy to overestimate the impact of modernity on ordinary Tibetans in the pre-1950 period. Their society and its technologies and understandings were largely untouched bymodernity outside of the Gangtok to Lhasa trade route via Gyantse. The importance of education What is clearly of particular, almost fundamental importance to the ac- ceptance of biomedicine is a Western education, as can be seen by a comparison of Tibet and Sikkim. Sikkimese began to receive Westerneducation from the 1870s onwards after Christian missionaries in Ka-limpong actively sought to attract Sikkimese to schools that they hadestablished there. By the 1880s, there were Western model schools inSikkim itself. When the first biomedical dispensaries in Sikkim wereopened by both state and missionary agents in the late 1890s and early20 thcentury, the medical practitioners at those dispensaries wereTHE CHOICE OF SYSTEMS 219mainly those Sikkimese educated in mission schools. While these pio- neers were only trained to the compounder level, the next generationof Sikkimese began qualifying as sub-assistant surgeons. That groupformed the basis for the indigenisation and expansion of biomedicine in Sikkim, although it was not until the late 1940s that any Sikkimese graduated as fully qualified doctors. In Tibet, however, as we have seen,very few individuals received a Western education and although a fewTibetans gained some medical knowledge from working with the Brit-ish, a significant body of Western-educated youths did not exist untilTibetans began sending their children to schools in Darjeeling and Ka-limpong in the late 1930s. Not until the post-colonial period did theseprivate initiatives produce biomedical trainees both in China and in In- dia and the West. An education imparting the Western worldview and scientific under- standing seems an essential precursor of biomedical training. Simi- larly, resort to biomedicine increases in relation to the growth in Wes-tern-educated patients. This continues to be a factor today, with resortto biomedicine in Sikkim being more prevalent among the better edu-cated sectors of the population. 64But it is also clear that the vast major- ity of patients resorting to biomedicine in Tibet had not been educated in the Western system, so while this is an important, and even crucial factor in establishing biomedicine in the long term, it does not explainresort in the short-term. There is evidence from the Himalayas to support David Arnold's conclusion that in India the indigenisation of medical personnel, 'prob-ably facilitated the eventual acceptance and assimilation of what hadonce been exclusively the white man 's medicine'. 65The indigenisation process was most successful in Sikkim, where Anglo-Indians held the highest position of Civil Surgeon Gangtok for most of the colonial peri- od and other medical positions were increasingly filled by Sikkimese.In Tibet, the British accepted that patients were more comfortable withthe (to a large extent culturally Tibetan) Sikkimese than with British of-ficers. As Dr. Morgan stated; 'I felt that Bo [Tsering] in his humble way- in fields social, medical and political - could inspire more trust, moreconfidence, and foster more friendship than perhaps any of us.' 66 We have seen that when the Republican Chinese established a bio- medical hospital in Lhasa they took patients away from the British hos-pital. In addition, as we have seen, there are records that show that Ne-palese vaccinators and Chinese private physicians earned a living in Ti-bet in this period, which again suggests that Tibetans preferredbiomedical practitioners from neighbouring states, despite historicallydifficult relations with both China and Nepal. Experience of treatment by Sikkimese, Chinese, Nepalese, and In- dian biomedical practitioners does seem to have helped transform bio-220 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINmedicine from a 'Western ' to an 'Asian ' practice in the Himalayan un- derstanding, enhancing resort. But perhaps more significantly, the bio-medical doctors increasingly adjusted aspects of their system to incor-porate local cultural understandings. Surgery on a day chosen as auspi- cious by the patient's religious advisors and greater access to the hospital for inpatient's families were colonial-era innovations that aretoday standard practice in the region. By the 1940s, the British doctorswere serving longer terms and had improved their command of thelanguage, establishing closer ties with the local society. Their conse-quently increased understanding of local culture lead to their makingconcessions to local understandings, concessions that undoubtedly con-tributed to increasing resort to biomedicine for a wider range of condi- tions, while simultaneously creating a greater degree of syncretism be- tween the two systems, paving the way for post-colonial developments.This supports the conclusion of Rosemary Fitzgerald, who in India no-ticed that: Medical missionaries found that they could only begin to gainthe trust and confidence of the people if the delivery of missionmedical care was adapted to harmonise with Indian sensibilities and habits of living ... by making concessions to local feelings on matters such as gender, caste, class and communal differ-ences, at least the trappings of missionary medicine took on aless forbidding appearance ... [but they ] ... depended ultimatelyon the ability to deliver effective forms of treatment. 67 World views, process, and biomedicine One factor that must be considered in regard to the acceptance of bio-medicine in Tibet is the possibility that for some Tibetans resort to thenew medical system was a reflection of a period of loss of faith in theirdominant socio-religious system; in other words, their resorting to bio-medicine may be read as resistance, not to modernity or British imper-ial power, but to the prevailing Tibetan system. When British machineguns massacred hundreds of poorly equipped Tibetan soldiers in one brief skirmish during the Younghusband mission, Tibetan troops slowly walked away in the face of such deadly force, instead of runningaway. A British war correspondent suggested that this was due to asudden and complete loss of faith in their traditional worldview afterthe obvious failure of their charms, mantras, and protective rituals. 68 The American missionary Shelton describes a very similar reaction thatthe Tibetans had when he shot holes in their supposedly bulletproofcharm boxes to demonstrate their worthlessness. 69THE CHOICE OF SYSTEMS 221Mental illness is not something we looked at for this study, because the records of the IMS dispensaries and the accounts of European tra- vellers in the Himalayas do not mention psychiatric illnesses. Indeed,as late as 1958, an article in the International Record of Medicine stated that mental illnesses 'are not found in Tibet'. 70But Tibetan categories of mental illness are very different from Western categories, and psy-chologists have found that applying European understandings of 'men-tal illness', 'trauma', etc., to Tibetan subjects is problematic. However,Dorje Yudon Yuthok refers to her aunt becoming 'insane' with griefafter the successive deaths of her child and husband in 1918, and notesthat her caretakers, 'tried never to upset her. They tried to please herby doing whatever she wanted. This was the Tibetan way to support people who are deeply disturbed or mentally ill.' 71Another account from Sikkim states that these conditions were considered shameful in local society, and that the victim was generally hidden away.72 But however one defines mental illness, the Younghusband mission and the ensuing years of turmoil must have had an immense psycholo-gical impact on Tibetans who witnessed it. When British troopsmarched forcefully into Lhasa, they not only shattered Tibet's carefullycultivated isolation from the outside world, but also explicitly chal- lenged the religious authority of the elite structures of the Tibetan Bud- dhist state. The elite's claim to divine authority and to the power to ma-nipulate worldly events was rudely demolished and it is difficult to be-lieve that the faith of at least some Tibetans in their rulers was notdiminished by their empirical observation of modern power, and thatthey did not imagine alternative political systems and even differentways of seeing the world. The existing literature in this field tends to presume acquiescence in existing indigenous cultural systems and to read resistance as exclu-sively directed against the imperial powers or their post-colonial succes-sor states. This seems simplistic. There were complex factors involvedin the reception of Western medicine, with opposition to vaccination incolonial India, for example, not just because it was 'European in char-acter'. 73While there are few records of non-elite resistance to the Tibe- tan system in the modern period, it would be na \u00a8ve to assume that Ti- betans did not, particularly in the largely leaderless years from 1904-13, question their own, apparently failed, system.74Thus we need to con- sider the possibility that, in some cases, initial experimentation with biomedicine was a manifestation of a loss of faith in or a resistance tothe Tibetan social system and/or its elite monastic medical practi-tioners. Paul Unschuld's work on the Chinese encounter with biomedi-cine seems to support this conclusion. He states that:222 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINA system of health care concepts and practices is plausible and acceptable when its ideas concerning the emergence, nature,and appropriate treatment of illness correspond to the sociopoli-tical ideas concerning the emergence, nature, and appropriate management of social crisis adhered to by a social group or by an entire society. ... From this it follows that a conceptual systemof medicine ceases to be vital and creative when its major legiti-mizing circumstances, its particular context of social ideologyand social structure, vanish, either in reality or in the aspirationsof a population. 75 The question of changing worldviews among changing political circumstances may be relevant to another aspect of this study. While the educated might understand a biomedical treatment as a logicalresponse within a scientific framework, in traditional understandingsthere was clearly uncertainty regarding the boundaries of biomedicalpractice. We read of 'lamas who wanted their voices improved', and aman wanting medicine to make his ears grow bigger. 76One Tibetan asked, perhaps ironically, if Europeans had not found a cure fordeath? 77 Biomedical powers wielded by foreigners might be regarded with particular trepidation. This was something biomedical physicians ap-pear to have recognised, with the British use of Sikkimese medical as-sistants in Tibet designed to demonstrate that the power of biomedi-cine was available to all. But many aspects of biomedicine, such asblood transfusions, were strange and forbidding. 78Another example of this was that although anaesthetics were known to their doctors,79Ti- betan patients, as we have seen, were generally reported to be reluctant to receive what they called 'dying medicine'80from British physicians. The conventional reading of this would be a fear of surrendering con- trol of 'the body'; yet it also suggests an area of religio-cultural under-standings in which the scientific world view and the traditional world-view were in negotiation. Tibetans reacted similarly to hospitalisation; the hospital was both a place where control was lost and an institution entirely unfamiliar toTibetans. It was also a place that was frightening because of the pollut- ing aspects (blood, etc.), that had not been ritually purified. Jamyang Sakya described her first visit to a (Chinese) biomedical hospital in the1950s in apocalyptic tones\": The hospital complex was like a vision of hell; doctors with nee-dles, strange noises, many wounded and ailing people. Childrenseemed to be crying all the time. The nurses and doctors all hadTHE CHOICE OF SYSTEMS 223their heads and faces covered and the nurses especially all looked alike to me.81 Tibetans were thus reluctant to become inpatients. Biomedical practi- tioners responded to these fears in a variety of ways such as Shelton 's glass-walled operating theatre, and they were keen to explain their sys-tem to any interested parties. Jamyang Sakya and her husband were gi-ven a hospital tour by Chinese doctors, with the result that 'I emergedfrom this visit willing to give the Chinese far more credit for suchknowledge than I had in the past.' 82. But the local peoples' traditional worldview certainly affected the reception of biomedicine and sustainedelements of the indigenous medical practices. While disease causation was ascribed to other-worldly factors in many cases, it was also recognised in the Tibetan cultural world thatan immediate cause might exist for illness and suffering. That immedi-ate cause and its results could be treated by worldly - including biome-dical - means. But cures for other-worldly issues remained within indi-genous cultural practices, with practitioners of religion-based healingconsulted on these issues. 83The understanding of medical conditions as having both worldly and other-worldly aspects meant not only con- tinued resort to the indigenous systems, but dual resort, which while notoriously difficult to measure even in a society with advanced recordkeeping, was and is clearly commonplace. 84 Dual resort could involve either the use of indigenous practices for the other-worldly aspect of a condition treated at the worldly level withbiomedicine, or the use of both indigenous and biomedical therapies atthe same time. Accounts by Tibetans as well as studies elsewhere, 85in- dicate that these strategies were followed in the Himalayas in the peri- od under consideration. As British sources indicate, in many cases, the patients' indigenous healers recommended biomedical resort, whichmeans that biomedicine may have drawn patients more from indigen-ous herbalists than ritualists. But it is also possible that the strategy ofdual resort indicates a widening of medical knowledge horizons andwas patient driven, anti-structural, or a claim to authority. Although the missionary doctors saw a resort to local practitioners in ideological terms, the IMS biomedicals and their local successors seem to have reluctantly accepted it. However, the Chinese communist bio- medical professionals, like the missionaries, may have seen it in ideolo-gical terms, for Jamyang Sakya states that when she took her child forbiomedical treatment in the 1950s, the Chinese doctor made themchoose which system they would follow. The Chinese subsequently, 're-minded us not to give Ani-la any more Tibetan medicine, saying it wasto blame for his continued ailment'. 86224 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINThat patients followed the recommendation of their indigenous medical practitioners suggests that the traditional practitioners did re- tain some authority for diagnosis, and indeed for knowledge of the bestavailable cure. A key factor in the authority of a Tibetan medical practi- tioner was his (it was almost invariably a 'his') teaching lineage. 87Ac- cording to the Gyu \u00a8-shi: a doctor who does not belong to a hereditary family of doctors, maintaining an unbroken blood-lineage of medical learning, ex-perience and skill, is like a fox who occupies the throne of a lionand pretends to be the king of the animals. Such a doctor willnot attain unanimous acclaim and recognition as no animals will take the fox as their king. 88 Biomedical doctors had a much weaker conception of their place in a teaching lineage. It was through the demonstration of efficacy that theysought to establish their authority. Patient choice It does appear that understandings of efficacy were the crucial factor inthe uptake of biomedicine. Whenever its treatments were found moreeffective than the indigenous cures they were adopted. Biomedical pro-gress was slow, but nonetheless, increasing numbers of people came tofavour at least aspects of it over indigenous treatments. They werenaturally uncertain regarding the limits of biomedical efficacy, with alearning phase that lasted for several decades. They understood biome- dicine as fast-acting, and tended to continue to use local practices where the biomedical cure was not a rapid one. The pattern of selectiveresort, however, ensured the survival of indigenous medicine, and ledto the creation of a medical world embracing a range of treatment op-tions under different systems. Individuals did make choices in regard to medical resort. While bio- medicine may have been a last resort and/or only adopted on the ad-vice of monastic or other social authorities, for us to ignore those choices means adopting the Orientalist construction of a monolithic Asian 'other', passively following the dictates of an unchanging tradi-tion or omnipotent ruler. We cannot assume that the local system wasunchallenged or that patients or their advisors did not make pragmaticchoices based on rational considerations of cost and efficacy. We canalso not ignore the fact that just as patients accepted aspects of theirown medical system as involving other-worldly cures, they also viewedaspects of biomedicine as involving other-worldly factors. With neitherTHE CHOICE OF SYSTEMS 225state power nor identification with a national identity as significant fac- tors in their resort, the perceived efficacy of a specific treatment or aparticular doctor's medicine was more significant than the perceived ef-ficacy of a specific system. Thus, Tibetan army commander Tsarong Shape \u00b4had an amchi as a family doctor, but also consulted the British doctor when he thought that biomedicine would be more efficacious, as in the case of his son 's dislocated arm. 89 The efficacy of biomedicine actually varied considerably. The small- pox vaccine was prone to decaying in the absence of an establishedholding agent and the efficacy of a single dosage declined over time.Venereal disease required continued treatment and secondary infec-tions undoubtedly resulted from the Tibetan 's reluctance to undergo re- peat treatment after the initial symptoms had disappeared. Nor could blindness always be reversed by surgery. However, biomedical treat-ments were increasingly recognised as more efficacious than the indi-genous practices for most conditions. But the Tibetans were not comparing the efficacy of two competing systems. They were already making choices within their own culture inregard to medical resort, and biomedicine was in many senses just an-other option. Biomedicine did not compete with 'Tibetan medicine', but with a range of medical practices and understandings within Hi- malayan society. It is here that the absence of detailed records of pa-tients' class and occupation is most keenly felt; we simply do not knowwhich groups consulted which practitioners of which system, althoughas noted, there are indications that the secular aristocracy were dispro-portionately favourable toward biomedicine. But that conclusion maymerely reflect the agenda of the British sources and it is also possiblethat the lowest social classes found the biomedical system more appeal- ing for reasons of economy and even for the reason that they were re- ceived and treated with more equality. In matters such as vaccination,the trading classes, who had little option but to be vaccinated when tra-velling to India, may have led the way in recognising its efficacy. The conclusion that resorting to biomedicine was primarily a matter of individual belief in its efficacy aligns this work closely with the stu-dies of scholars such as Rosemary Fitzgerald and Helen Lambert. AlanBeals' research into villagers in northern Mysore in the 1970s painted a similarly prosaic picture of patient resort strategies, with individuals 'prepared to accept all knowledge and to attempt all treatments'. 90He found that dual resort was common and that the patients' choice of re-sort was determined more by the advice of elders or by their economicsituations than by belief systems, with the cheapest system beingusually the first tried. 91 Martin Gaenszle has found a similar pragmatism operating in Nepal where; 'As long as the medicine is free, patients tend to be more open-226 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINminded and keener on experimenting'. His subjects see biomedicine as operating on the worldly plane and indigenous shamanic medicineon the other-worldly, and frequently take simultaneous treatment un-der both systems, a situation also recorded by Susan Heydon among the Sherpas. But patients freely accept that either or both treatments might succeed or fail. 92As Lambert noted: people's behaviour is rarely governed in a deterministic fashionby their system of beliefs ... contrary to the common claim in in-ternational health circles that in non-Western settings indigen-ous health beliefs constitute 'cultural barriers' to the use of mod-ern medicine, 'traditional culture' is very receptive to innova- tions that are readily available, observably efficacious and have prestige value. 93 Viewed as process, what Charles Leslie describes as the 'dynamic' as-pects of 'cultural premises' become more clear, revealing a slow andsteady syncretism. Aspects of biomedicine were absorbed into the indi-genous system while aspects of local understanding were accepted intobiomedical practice. As Leslie has pointed out, every medical system 'generates discontent with its limitations and a search for alternative therapies'; syncretism is 'a normative cultural practice' with a long his-tory. 94 We may conclude that each encounter produces different results and that different factors influence different individuals. The modern statemay seek a significant role, but its actual effect can end up being farless at the periphery than at the centre, and individuals may also makechoices based on a wide variety of factors in which the influence of the state or other power structures is almost entirely absent. What appears certain is that the ultimate result of any cultural or system encounteris some degree of syncretism, by no means necessarily on equal terms,but in some sense enhancing existing understandings.THE CHOICE OF SYSTEMS 227Conclusions According to missionary accounts, a wide range of Tibetan patients were attracted to the 18thcentury form of Western medicine offered by the Capuchins in Lhasa. Other European travellers in the pre-modernperiod record a similar demand for their medical services, but it is dif- ficult to assess the rationale for that demand in the absence of more ex- tensive and balanced sources. Greater overall efficacy seems doubtfulin an era before the biomedical revolution of the late 19 thcentury, but their availability and their offering of professional services withoutmonetary aims must have been factors, along with a certain novelty. The advances in biomedical science, however, transformed the equa- tion. Both missionary and government medical initiatives introducedon the Indo-Tibetan frontier in the wake of the British imperial ad- vance northwards towards Tibet found considerable appeal. While the adoption and subsequent indigenisation of biomedicine was a processwhich took several generations, and it was one which transformedrather than eliminated the local medical world, there does now seem tohave been a general transformation; what was once the last resort isnow first, and what was once first, is now last. As they advanced into the Himalayan states, the British-Indian gov- ernment used medicine primarily as a political/diplomatic weapon to win the support of the recently conquered indigenous peoples and the consent of their ruling elites. But while there were one-off grants forimmediate humanitarian relief and occasional supplies of free medi-cine surplus to requirements in India, imperial funds were not nor-mally given for indigenous medical development. The single greatestexpenditure involved in medical provision was the salary of the IMS of-ficer there and his primary responsibility was actually the health of thePolitical Officer and his staff. This lack of development assistance was, however, at least partly a re- sult of treaties under which the British agreed not to interfere in theinternal affairs of the local states. Medical intervention could be seen,at least technically, as a breach of such agreements, with the result thatmedical developments were not imposed on the Indo-Tibetan frontier,but generally arose to a large degree as the result of local demand byinfluential individuals or groups, particularly but not exclusively from the elite classes. In Sikkim, where the British had far greater authority and influence than they did in Bhutan and Tibet, the imperial government encour- aged the indigenisation of biomedicine as part of a strategy of ensuring the security of India's northern border by facilitating modernisationand development to strengthen the frontier states. But medical develop-ment and public health provision was charged to the indigenous statetreasury, as were most other aspects of modernisation. Under imperialinfluence Sikkim introduced income-generating schemes such as la-bour migration and forestry development (which had long-term humanand environmental consequences) to pay for modernisation, but funds for biomedical development were always limited. In parts of British India such as Kalimpong, Christian medical mis- sions reduced the need for imperial government expenditure and coun- tered the predominant urban focus of state medicine. But the Himala-yan Buddhist states firmly opposed missionaries, and the PoliticalDepartment were not prepared to risk the social and political conse-quences of allowing them to operate there. Yet the missionaries did en-joy considerable influence as a result of their endeavours in Kalimpong and opposition to the missionary-medical presence eventually de- creased to the point where individuals such as Dr. Craig were even in-vited into Bhutan in the post-colonial period. Missionaries shared the imperial desire to open Tibet and they were important agents in the initial advance of Western medicine into theHimalayas, using medicine as a tool with which to attract converts.They too sought to indigenise Western medicine as a means of uplift-ing and providing for the Christian community they sought to develop, but their success derived not only from their ability to appeal to indi- genous beliefs, sensibilities, and interests but also to their capacity forforging an alliance of interests with the imperial government and itsagents. As more attention is paid to missionary sources we need tolook at missionaries not as a category but as separate individuals andgroups, whose nationalities, theologies, class, and political acumen allaffected their complex and localised relationships with, and receptionby, both the indigenous people and the imperial authorities. We might also seek to situate them, their lifestyles and their conversion strategies within the context of local and wider Himalayan religious histories; itmay be that the processes surrounding a pioneer of Buddhism such asPadmasambhava in the 8 thcentury and a pioneer of Christianity such as the Rev Macfarlane in the 19thcentury had much in common. There was a humanitarian aspect to the encouragement of biomedi- cine by imperial officials, to whom its benefits were so obvious thatthere was rarely any need to articulate or debate them. The plight of230 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINthose without biomedical resort was not an academic concern to the 'men-on-the-spot', who reacted to the suffering they saw firsthand byencouraging biomedical resort. Whether from a Christian or more hu-manist perspective the desire to improve the lives of the indigenous people was a powerful motivating factor for many individuals serving the colonial state, as it was for the local intermediaries who saw thebenefits of modernity as implemented by that state. 1 This meant that just as a tension existed between the medical and missionary aspects of a medical missionary's work, conflicts arose be-tween the medical and political duties of the IMS officers. Dr. Morgan,in Lhasa in 1936-37, accepted that; 'I had a responsibility to our [politi-cal] mission. A failure would be a blow to our prestige (which in the orient means so much)....' 2But when he had to remain at an impor- tant reception when he had an urgent surgical case pending, Morgan, 'waited and waited, feeling all the while like one of the feebler disciplesof Hippocrates, driven to prostitute my calling in the interests of politi-cal expediency'. 3 The British used medicine in the Himalayas as a means of gaining political support; it was regularly and explicitly stated that a medical of-ficer's role was a political one. But the use of Western medicine seems to have been assessed on its curing merits and does not appear to have been commonly seen by the indigenous peoples as implying politicalor cultural subordination. Medicine probably did win the British somepolitical goodwill, but the local people were sophisticated enough to beable to separate medicine from colonialism just as they separated itfrom Christianity in the case of medical missions. The Himalayanmedical world was a marketplace, and cultural familiarity and traditiondid not prevent individuals from selecting what they saw as the best available curing strategy. Increasingly that selection involved biomedi- cine as at least one element of that strategy. Pragmatism and pluralismare most characteristic of medical resort in this region and by the post-colonial period the main brakes on biomedical progress were structuraland financial rather than cultural. We need to recall, however, that im-perialism took something of a different form in the Himalayas whencompared to British Indian centres, and that may have been a factor inthe reception of biomedicine there. Process, policy, and resort Following the establishment of biomedical dispensaries throughout theHimalayas there was a steady increase in indigenous resort. In theearly years of the Gyantse dispensary, for example, 400 to 500 Tibetanswere treated annually, but by 1947 the number had increased tenfoldCONCLUSIONS 231(see appendix), and these increases continued in the postcolonial peri- od. This was partly due to population growth, and to such factors asbiomedicine's wider remit, with birthing and postnatal care medica-lised and endemic conditions such as goitre identified as curable medi- cal conditions, but the general pattern was increasing resort. Traditional Medicines' failure to deal with epidemics has been widely noted as a factor encouraging resort to biomedicine and in this region that was clearly apparent in regard to smallpox, which regularly deva-stated Himalayan communities. 4Biomedicine eventually vanquished smallpox entirely, and enabled the effective control of other epidemicsdiseases such as the plague, typhoid, and measles. Systematic vaccina-tion was simply a more efficacious preventative measure than sporadic variolation and that efficacy was fundamental to its uptake, with indi- genous groups coming to actively demand vaccination. That indigen-ous demand highlights a relatively unstudied aspect of the spread ofWestern medicine in Asia. While the primary agents of biomedicinewere the IMS officers and medical missionaries, commercial agentsand private interests were not far behind, for there was considerableconsumer demand for effective medical services. The introduction of biomedicine was a process not an event. It might be compared to the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet in thefirst millennium (AD). While introduced by foreign agents such as theIndian maha \u00afsiddha Padmasambhava, it developed rapidly after local elite figures saw its benefits and patronised the development of indi-genous structures at the expense of pre-existing beliefs. The IMS offi-cers who served in Tibet were all trained after the discovery of bacterio-logical disease causation, but even for them it was a remarkable newsystem continuously enhanced by fresh developments and significant discoveries. As a system, biomedicine was almost entirely distinct from indigenous medical traditions and its conceptual basis, ritual theatre,and practical applications required time to understand. A learningphase that lasted a generation or more was thus characteristic. Witheach succeeding generation indigenous trainees in the new system ad-vanced from compounder level to intermediate qualification as sub-as-sistant surgeons and finally to biomedical degree status. At the sametime, local patients increasingly experimented with the effectiveness of biomedicine in regard to specific conditions and slowly established the boundaries of its application. Dual resort with the selective acceptance of the most obviously effica- cious elements of the biomedical system was also a characteristic as-pect of the process. Where the indigenous treatment was consideredjust as effective or more so, patients tended to continue resorting to lo-cal healers. But advances in biomedical knowledge and the steady in-crease in those receiving a secular scientific education favoured the232 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINcontinuing growth of resort to biomedicine at the expense of indigen- ous practices. Medical pluralism was, however, present from the firstand continues on into the present day. While biomedicine did renderand even displace certain categories of indigenous healers (such as var- iolaters) obsolete, in many senses it simply added another dimension to the existing medical world. 5 These findings parallel Mark Harrison 's statement in regard to the introduction of biomedicine into India: No clear pattern emerges in Indian responses to western hy-giene and public health measures ... However, one or two gener-alisations can be made. Firstly, suspicion of, or resistance to, western sanitary measures tended to diminish over time; sec- ondly these measures whose effects were most readily apparent,like smallpox vaccination, tended to be the most popular. 6 Harrison 's conclusion that there was 'little consensus among colonialofficials concerning the objectives of medical policy in India' 7might also be applied in this region with the qualification that there was actu-ally very little discussion about those objectives. There was an estab- lished model of princely state development, but there was very little co- herent medical planning specifically for this region. Concessions to lo-cal culture and practice, while an important factor in the increasingresort to biomedicine, were at the behest of individual practitionersrather than the result of systematic thought. There were occasional re-commendations by concerned officials, 8but as in the case of Gould's soliloquies concerning venereal diseases and population decline thesewere liable to be ignored by higher authorities at the imperial centre, not least because they would have required imperial funds, which were not forthcoming. Future studies of biomedical progress in South Asia might benefit from greater consideration of the process in China, which revealsmany commonalities. There are, for example, also close parallels be-tween missionary medical experiences in India and in China, wheremedical missionaries played the dominant role in biomedical introduc-tion and establishment down to 1949. 9In the field of political medi- cine, Florence Bretelle-Establet's study of the French Foreign Ministrydispensaries in Yunnan in the 1898-1930 period contains the closestparallels to the work of the IMS physicians on the Indo-Tibetan fron-tier. Both groups used military doctors rather than what were consid-ered less reliable civil physicians, and both attracted increasing num-bers of patients as they blurred the boundaries between medical sys-tems, with the French, for example, offering smallpox vaccinationduring the traditional variolation season. 10In a clear parallel with theCONCLUSIONS 233history of the IMS doctors in Tibet and Bhutan, the author concludes that while the Yunnnan consular doctors were colonial officials, the factthat Yunnan was never a French colony meant that biomedicine wasnever 'coercive'. But it also meant that the consular doctors took no re- sponsibility for indigenous public health, nor did they establish any structural framework for biomedical training and development. 11 An aspect of the Political Department's medical activities that is diffi- cult to account for is their rudimentary record keeping. Intelligencegathering was a primary role of the Department and its officers in Ti-bet and elsewhere collected and collated a vast amount of informationon local states. As numerous studies have indicated, 12this was a key part of the colonial process, with the knowledge gained used to further the colonial project. French medical officers in Yunnan gathered con- siderable information,13as did IMS officers elsewhere,14yet those ser- ving with the Political Department on the Indo-Tibetan frontier seemedto have gathered very little intelligence. The usual colonial categories ofrace, religion, and even social class were rarely mentioned and appar-ently never subject to any on-going systematic analysis. While PoliticalOfficers, in recognition of professional medical ethics, were not per-mitted to ask about specific patients, the medical officers probably did inform them unofficially on politically relevant matters (such as the health of a local official), 15otherwise it seems entirely contrary to gen- eral imperial tendencies that the medical officers had little active rolein the information-gathering process. 16 'Enclavism' and 'resistance' Radhika Ramasubban described a model of colonial health care in In-dia which, to the neglect of the general population, was deliberatelyconcentrated on the enclaves where the British and essential local em-ployees (particularly the military) resided. 17The evidence from our re- gions supports that model in that the primary role of IMS doctors at-tached to the Political Department was to care for the Political Officerand his staff. But as we have seen in the case of Kalimpong, the imper-ial government endorsed medical missionary expansion into peripheral areas of British India, and these missions did counter the enclavist ten- dency. The missionaries paved the way for the social acceptance ofWestern medicine and they also established structures such as theCharteris hospital that eventually passed to state control. In that sense,missionary medicine can be seen as a transitional phase of develop-ment in the periphery, 18just as indigenous elite patronage was a tran- sitional phase in the urban centres.234 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINThere are other problems with applying the enclavism model to the Himalayan states in the colonial period. Both the missionaries and the imperial government wanted to establish biomedicine beyond the Eur-opean centres of the frontier regions, but aside from the financial and enormous logistical difficulties, the indigenous rulers objected to Eur- opeans (particularly missionaries), travelling freely or settling in theirterritory. Medical missionaries were thus prevented from filling thetransitional role in Bhutan and Tibet, and their impact was restrictedin Sikkim. In the case of Tibet, the British had agreed that their offi-cials remain within certain specified territories on and around the es-tablished routes from India to the Trade Agencies in central and wes-tern Tibet. Enclavism was thus imposed on the imperial power by the local states; a situation for which there were such numerous parallels in the history of European expansion in Asia that it may be seen as acharacteristic indigenous response to foreign encounters. 19 It is also difficult to see enclavism as specific to colonial medicine. In Republican China, for example, even after the emergence of indi-genous practitioners, both state and private, they were concentrated inenclaves which were urban rather than specifically colonial. Even inthe mid-1930s, more than 99% of China's biomedical physicians were concentrated in less than half of the countries' provinces, with the countryside largely the preserve of indigenous medical services. 20 Biomedicine as a predominantly urban phenomena is certainly char- acteristic of both colonial and postcolonial Asia, not least because ofthe reluctance of indigenous medical personnel to serve in remoteareas. In their absence, traditional practitioners may fill the vacuum.In Chamba district today, for example, there is a state biomedical hos-pital in Chamba town, and further east on the road towards the fron- tier there are biomedical dispensaries at smaller centres such as Bhar- mour. A day's walk beyond the roadhead at Kugti however,there is only an A \u00afyurvedic clinic. 21Therefore, Enclavism does not ap- pear to be a uniquely colonial model, but a complex phenomena that ispart of a wider problem involving such issues as urban drift, limited re-sources, and practitioners' motivations. David Arnold has argued for 'resistance' arising from different cul- tural understandings of disease and its causes 'as an essential element in the evolution of a particular system of medical thought and ac- tion.' 22But the evidence from this region suggests that it is not neces- sarily an active23or significant element and that resistance must be analysed not only in the context of reactions to foreign systems, butalso in regard to local hegemonies. There is certainly plenty of evidencefrom our region that medical interventions which were foreign to localunderstanding were to some degree feared, but as we have seen in thecase of the Panchen Lama and Jamyang Sakya, such fears were over-CONCLUSIONS 235come when the practice was better understood. The reception of bio- medicine was a complex phenomena, but when its efficacy in regard toa specific condition was clearly apparent, as with smallpox vaccination,that aspect was soon adopted. Only by breaking down the reception of different categories of practice can wider conclusions be reached, while biomedicine must also be located in the wider context of the moderni-sation process. In that context, Dr. Tsewang Pemba, a biomedical prac-titioner who grew up in pre-communist Tibet has concluded: 'Perhapsit is true to say that of all the things in the modern world that perme-ated into Tibet, medicine was the one that encountered the least oppo-sition and resistance.' 24 Intermediaries and patrons Biomedicine could not have been introduced into areas beyond directBritish authority without the support and example of indigenous inter-mediaries in the process. These included interpreters such as KarmaPaul and other local employees of the British who explained the systemand vouched for its validity; local authority figures such as Tsarong Shape \u00b4who allowed or encouraged biomedical initiatives in areas under their influence; and indigenous compounders and sub-assistant sur- geons such as Bo and Tonyot Tsering who demonstrated that biomedi-cine was a universal rather than a Western practice. Furthermore, wecan assume the existence of an informal network in which biomedicinewas discussed and its benefits debated around campfires and in housesand monasteries. Many individuals must have contributed to this de-bate, while agents such as pilgrims and cross-border traders linked this to a wider Asian enquiry into biomedicine. The key role played by the intermediaries in the colonial process has been much neglected by scholarship. But there can be no doubt that a major part of the credit for the introduction of biomedicine into Tibetwas due to Rai Bahadurs Bo Tsering and Tonyot Tsering and theirSMD colleagues. Both Bo and Tonyot served there for some thirtyyears, far longer than any individual British medical officer, and theyprovided the continuity that the IMS positions lacked. As Western-edu- cated and cosmopolitan Sikkimese Tibetan Buddhists they were ideally placed to act as cultural transmitters, and were clearly at home in bothBritish and Tibetan society. Liked and trusted by both parties, theywere crucial to the transmission process. Similarly the compounders,who as we have seen might practice both biomedicine and indigenousmedicine, played an important role not only in spreading a knowledgeof biomedicine, but also in paving the way for the closer integration ofthe systems.236 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINBut a Western education was a pre-requisite for biomedical practice and almost essential for informed resort. Thus the establishment and indigenisation of biomedicine followed after the foundation and devel-opment of an educational system on the Western model and in Tibetwhere the colonial education project failed, biomedicine did not be-come indigenised until the post-colonial period. This pre-requisite hadan important long-term effect in regard to social ranks in the region.In places such as Kalimpong and Sikkim the earliest people to receivea Western education were mainly non-elite Christian converts, and that group were disproportionately represented in the initial ranks of com- pounders, nurses, and other medical assistants, as well as patients.Many families were able to advance their social and economic status asa result of their role in the development of biomedicine. Within a gen-eration, however, as it became apparent that Western education did notrequire conversion to Christianity and that the new medical system re-presented a social sphere of power that could be claimed by the indi-genous peoples, that education, and thus biomedical employment, be- gan to attract the traditional Himalayan elites. Tonyot Tsering and familyCONCLUSIONS 237As a part of that process, and with the encouragement of the colonial power, the elite classes (both traditional and new) began to embed bio- medicine in local patronage structures, extending their traditional sup-port for indigenous medical practitioners to the new system. Their con- tribution and example were recognised when state hospitals were named after rulers such as Sir Thutob Namgyal and Maharaja ShamSingh. 25While the latter even supported Christian establishments, lo- cal rulers generally favoured secular institutions and mission hospitalswere thus named after foreign patrons or inspirations, as in the case ofthe Charteris Hospital and Shelton 's Susan M. Diltz hospital. Just as individual initiatives such as those by Dr. Hutchinson in Chamba and Mrs Graham in Kalimpong were soon systemised and eventually absorbed into state structures, so too the local rulers' role as biomedical patrons was to largely disappear in the postcolonial period,as nation-states took both political power and responsibility for publichealth from traditional aristocratic rulers. As in the Tibetan exile com-munity, however, those rulers might continue their patronage of localmedical systems excluded from or peripheral to state public health andcontinue to manifest traditional authority in that sphere. More studiesof these social and patronage patterns are required; we need to ascer- tain how traditional patronage patterns operated in the medical sphere in this region, particularly in regard to enabling the provision of freemedical services to non-elite groups, and how Western modernity im-pacted on patronage structures in both the colonial and post-colonialperiods. If patronage was a symbol of indigenisation at the elite level, at the non-elite level, indigenisation was a complex process and one that wasdifficult to measure, but it was eventually signalled by villagers' de- mands for biomedical services and, as in Bhutan, indicated by their willingness to provide the structural facilities for a practitioner. The in-digenous elites were an important factor in the social acceptance of bio-medicine, yet in the absence of local elites, as in Kalimpong which waseffectively a town the missionaries built, foreign missionaries mighttake on the traditional elite role in society. Unwittingly perhaps, theyfulfilled indigenous understandings of the proper role of a religiousfigure in society by the provision of medical services and the articula- tion of it within an ethical context. The demand for biomedical services does appear to have transcended class divisions, and there is no clearindication in Western sources that any one social group dominated thatdemand.238 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINNationalism Medical histories of modern China have frequently demonstrated an entirely uncritical approach to communist Chinese rhetoric and re- cords.26But scholars like Paul Unschuld have adopted a more rigorous approach to the analysis of indigenous traditions than has been com- mon in South Asian studies,27and as the work of R.C. Crozier has de- monstrated, the very category of 'Chinese medicine' dates only to thelate 19 thcentury.28In a with late 20thcentury construc- tions of 'Tibetan medicine', nationalists then seeking to preserve dis-tinct Chinese cultural forms began to define indigenous medical prac-tices as 'Chinese' rather than as 'useful techniques'. 29 We have indicated that nationalism was not an important factor in medical resort on the Indo-Tibetan frontier in the colonial period. Butin the post-colonial period it became a major factor in the emergenceof a modern systemised Tibetan medicine. Against the wider politicalcontext of the Sino-Tibetan problem, the identification of medicine bythe exile government as an essential part of Tibetan culture led to stra-tegies of preservation and promotion that are closely linked to the na-tionalist project as, for example, in the internationalisation of Tibetan Buddhism and the promotion of the term 'Tibetan medicine' for what is essentially sowa rigpa . 30As Fernand Meyer observed, this process has involved 'secularisation, standardization in terms of curriculum andpractice, professionalization and reinterpretation of certain conceptsunder the influence of biomedicine'. 31 While Meyer's work demonstrates that systemisation and standardi- sation processes have always been characteristic of Tibetan medicine,32 they have been greatly accelerated in the modern period and have oc- curred throughout the Tibetan cultural world; Vincanne Adams and Craig Janes, for example, have demonstrated the concessions made byTibetan medicine in China to scientific models and standards, a pro-cess with parallels in the Tibetan exile community in India. 33The mod- ernisation processes may be complex and even contradictory, as can beseen in the case of secularisation, which is concurrent with the activeassociation of Tibetan Medicine in an explicitly Buddhist context toboth Tibetans and Western Buddhist sympathisers. 34We may hope for future studies which examine the role of patronage in these processes,for in recent decades, groups such as the Tibetan exile communityhave been able to attract considerable amounts of Western patronage toboth Traditional and biomedical institutions. This is in stark contrast tomany other Himalayan communities and in line with Christian Klei-ger's thesis that the Tibetan system requires an external patron, whichhas in the case of the exile community, become the West. 35CONCLUSIONS 239Modern Tibetan Medicine also follows the general pattern of con- temporary Traditional Medicine systems in that what is increasingly re- cognised is not traditional practice but text-based knowledge.36The 'Charter of Association of Tibet Medical Physicians in the Exile Tibetan Community' (2003), states that the purpose of the charter is to 'meet the standard as set in the traditional texts ' [emphasis added]. But a con- siderable body of medical knowledge existed outside of the textualworld in pre-colonial Himalayan society, and the result of this textualemphasis may be to marginalise peripheral, non-elite, and local tradi-tions, and to hegemonise centralised, patriarchal, and elite structuresand understandings, obscuring the pragmatic nature of actual Tibetanmedical practice and resort. These are issues that require a separate study of Tibetan medicine in the modern world, with one leading scho- lar even questioning whether Tibetan medicine (both in the TibetanAutonomous Region and the exile community) can retain sufficientauthenticity to justify its distinct status and respond appropriately tonew demands. 37 In Bhutan, by contrast, while the development of official structures has led to an increasing systemisation of the Bhutanese form of sowa rigpa in recent decades, they do not face cultural survival issues to the same extent and perhaps in consequence, have not located their medi-cal knowledge in a nationalist context to the same extent. The term'Bhutanese medicine' is not used, nor does the resorting to traditionalmedicine appear to reflect patients' concepts of political identity as ex-pressed in terms of a (real or imagined) nation-state. That wider sys-tem of Himalayan knowledge termed sowa rigpa sustained and guided elite local practices throughout the region, and was not the preserve ofany one nationalist culture. The assumption and casual usage of the term 'Tibetan medicine', particularly as adopted in the West, is there- fore extremely problematic. 38 But there are other aspects of modern developments that are not pri- marily nationalist. As Paul Unschud observed in regard to medicine inChina, while 'the legitimising context of traditional medicine' - thepre-colonial social system - might be lost with modernity and changeinduced by external impetus rather than internal creativity, 'the ... lossof [the] creative vitality of a conceptual system of medicine does not ne- cessarily entail its immediate disappearance. Satisfied clients, and in- terest groups profitably employing it, may continue to support and useit for a long time.' 39Those clients and interests do appear likely to sus- tain and advance Tibetan medicine in a globalised world. The structural and financial limitations of state biomedicine, and its failure to cure many chronic conditions (such as asthma and arthritis),have left a space for alternative practices, and Tibetan medicine has ta-ken its place in a pluralistic world of Traditional Medicine resort. 40Just240 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINas biomedicine took on local cultural characteristics as it spread, so too have aspects of the practice, ritual theatre, and structures of biomedi-cine been adopted by Tibetan medicine during that process. 41Once in- terpreted as quackery, this is now recognised as a dynamic and innova- tive aspect of Traditional Medicine, with the incorporation of new tech- nologies and understandings characteristic of unbounded systems.42 While much of the wider Himalayan medical understandings and prac-tices have disappeared as a result of the systemisation of sowa rigpa and the construction of Tibetan medicine, it may be that external im-petus and new settings and centres of Traditional Medicine can lead tonew vitality and satisfied clients in a global medical world in whichdual resort is acknowledged as a logical strategy of pursuing the most efficacious treatment. As Geoffrey Samuel notes, there is a possibility that Western influence; 'will in time produce a new branch of Tibetanmedical practice that genuinely instantiates ... holistic and spiritual per-spectives.' 43 Ethics and standards One aspect of the transmission of biomedicine to this region that is dif-ficult to quantify is the issue of professional standards. Many negativeaspects of colonialism are well-remembered in the Himalayas today,yet the biomedical pioneers, particularly the missionaries, 44are fondly remembered there for having maintained high standards of probity,professional care, and selfless service. This favourable reputation doesnot appear to particularly derive from nostalgia or even reflect colonialrhetoric, although it may reflect the paternal attitudes of the colonial period. But it is certainly in contrast to studies of postcolonial India, which indicate that while non-elite groups admire the technologies ofbiomedicine, they found the physicians, rudely condescending, 'avari-cious' and 'dishonest'. 45 As is the case anywhere, individual standards vary, but there are indi- cations that in the Himalayas 'something remains' of colonial-era stan-dards. 46In contrast to physicians from other parts of the sub-conti- nent, at the time of writing there are just eleven Sikkimese doctors working abroad,47and Bhutanese medical trainees have invariably re- turned home after receiving their degrees in other lands. As we have seen, the religio-social role of the doctor is a current issue, particularlyin Bhutan, but also in Sikkim and the Tibetan exile community, andthere is a distinct and articulated ideal of social service associated withthe profession of medicine that has largely vanished in the West. Thismay partly reflect the fact that private practitioners are less common inthese regions (and forbidden in Bhutan), or indicate, as suggested inCONCLUSIONS 241regard to Sikkim, that in small and/or autonomous states, isolated from the extremes of Indian society, such standards and ideals haveproved easier to maintain in the postcolonial period than they did inIndia itself. But rather than indicating that these ideals were intro- duced and transmitted by biomedical pioneers, 48it may reflect a com- mon ground on which indigenous and imperial ideals met. Christopher Beckwith, in discussing Greek influence on Tibetan medicine has pointed out the similarities between the Hippocratic Oath and a very similar - perhaps derivative - Tibetan medical oathfrom the 8 thcentury that emerges in similar form in later texts includ- ing the Gyu\u00a8-shi. It calls for physicians to be thus honoured: seat them in the place of honor; set out excellent cushions (forthem) ... feed them the best food and drink as presents; providehorses for them ... pay their fees in gold; be grateful for theirwork ... wish him joy and be respectful. 49 In return the doctor is similarly exhorted: do not expound (medicine, to them) for the sake of (their) poor offerings; (as you are) pursuing learned piety, do not do evil to householders; (as you are) upholding the noble method, do notgive out evil drugs ... do not be indecent and hypocritical to pa-tients. 50 This ethical framework remains an important consideration among Ti-betan medical practitioners even in the TAR today, 51and suggests that the ideal of the doctor was common to both indigenous and colonial societies on the Indo-Tibetan frontier. It has been suggested in chapter one that the acceptance of the missionaries may have been enhancedby their acting within the indigenous models of a religious renouncer,and IMS doctors, and particularly the medical missionaries, may alsohave been seen as acting in a manner associated with the ideal doctorin Himalayan Buddhist culture. Anil Kumar has astutely reflected that;'Ultimately [medical] hegemony did pass to the non-West but to such anon-West which was a reconstruction of the West itself,' 52but in the widest historical perspective the construct of the ideal doctor seems tooscillate between West and East until the barriers dissolve. Yet it would be unrealistic to conclude on such a harmonious note. Charles Leslie observed that: When the social history of cosmopolitan [i.e., bio-]medicine inIndia comes to be written, it will show that from the nineteenthcentury to the present time, the demand for medical services242 THEIR FOOTPRINTS REMAINhas far exceeded the capacity of cosmopolitan medical institu- tions [which have thus] depended upon the professionalizationof indigenous medicine to meet a substantial portion of the ex-panding need for professional care. 53 As Leslie implies, postcolonial governments have encouraged the moreeconomical alternative of Traditional Medicine not because of its effi-cacy, but because they are faced by the spiralling and potentially infi-nite costs of providing biomedical services. The result is often to con-demn rural and peripheral groups to less effective medical treatmentand in much of India, for example, the question of non-elite resort tobiomedicine is almost irrelevant. The Indian public health system to- day lacks resources, its personnel assets are continually stripped by the West, and there is corruption that further restricts the availability ofproper treatment for the poor. For the majority of the population, themost commonly resorted to medical system is probably not biomedi-cine or a form of Traditional Medicine, but quackery. In the absence ofdecent, affordable biomedical treatment patients must rely on unquali-fied practitioners whose equipment is liable to be unhygienic andwhose medicines are frequently adulterated, out of date, or irrelevant to the patient's condition. 54While parts of the Buddhist Himalayas have maintained higher standards, we may question whether they can continue to do so in the face of increasing populations and costs.CONCLUSIONS 243Appendix: Attendance at Gyantse and Yatung IMS dispensaries All figures are taken from the annual reports of the Gyantse and Ya- tung IMS civil dispensaries.

But it has the great advantage of being the term that was the most commonlyused during the colonial period, while also implying the oppositional nature of its concepts vis-a `-vis those of Himalayan traditions. I owe to Theresa the clarifica- tion that the term nub chogi sman (i.e., the literal translation of 'Western medicine' in Tibetan) is hardly ever used in central Tibet today. The favoured term is either 'Chi-nese medicine', or in more remote areas tang sman , which literally means 'commu- nist medicine'. Only when using Chinese is there a specific term for 'Western medi- cine'. 2 McDonald 1950: 114, quoting General Sir Neville Chamberlain to Dr. David Boyes Smith, Indian Medical Gazette , November 1887. 3 Arnold 2000: 178; regarding dispensaries, see also Harrison 1994: 88-90; see Daniel Sheets Dye, 'The Challenge of the Far Western Border', The Chinese Recorder , 71.7, 1940: 441, regarding the possibility of providing itinerant medical services in the Sino-Tibetan borderlands: I am indebted to Mona Schrempf for this reference. 4 For an analysis of this progression from approaches through Nepal and the western Himalayas to the route via Sikkim, see Lamb 1986. 5 Even Darjeeling and Kalimpong, which were districts of Bengal Province, were out- side of the regular administrative patterns. Both were classified as 'non-regulation districts', meaning there were certain local variants of laws and customs permittedthere. 6 The Department underwent various name changes; until 1914 it was known as the Political and Secret Department, after 1937 it was divided into the External AffairsDepartment and the Political Department. It was popularly known as the PoliticalDepartment; 'political' in colonial India equating to 'diplomatic'. 7 The earliest European medical presence in Nepal appears to have been a Capuchin monk practicing there in 1766-67. Dr. Oldfield became the first British surgeon atthe Residency in Kathmandhu ca. 1850, when vaccination was introduced there un-der King Jung Bahadur. The first indigenous biomedical hospital was the Bir hospi- tal, opened in Kathmandhu in 1890.

Despite obvious biases and frequent open hostility to the Tibetan system, the descriptions of the local medical environment presented by these accounts are cred-ible, and consistent with accounts from other pre-modern states. 15 Mainprise 1904: 537.

Gonorrhoea is not mentioned in the 1940 figures, but was far less common than syphilis, although the figures for gonor- rhoea doubled from 98 to 203 in 1945 to 1947, possibly as a result of post-war social disturbances on the trade route from Lhasa to Sikkim and northern India, wheremany troops were stationed.

Dr. Guthrie's private papers include a diary which very briefly notes the age, sex and condition of patients he treated while on tour, but while similar notes from Gyantse survive in one or two instances, it appears that most of the IMS doctors didnot make systematic case notes. For a photograph of a typical page of Guthrie's diary;see McKay 2005 (b): 130. 22 See note 15.23 Critical studies of Chinese biomedicine in Tibet during the period from 1950 until the opening of the TAR to foreign travellers in the mid-1980s face almost insur-mountable difficulties in analysing highly politicised claims of 'progress' with statis- tics provided by the Communist party. Several Western 'fellow travellers' visited Tibet during the closed period and described biomedical developments; see, in particularEpstein 1983: 386-400. 24 Imperial and Republican Chinese sources might shed further light on the matter.25 Mrs R.

Neither source is necessarily reliable, but it is interesting that the Gelders, Communist 'fellow travellers', actually give the higherfigure.

More valuable gifts were, however, given by the elites; Suchpresents to IMS officers in Tibet had to be given to the imperial government, butcould be bought back at a greatly reduced value. 44 See for example, White 1984: 27.45 Sakya and Emery 1990: 236.46 Ibid . 47 See, for example, the education initiatives referred to in chapter Three, notes 73-75. Non-elite groups could also resist British initiatives; for example, a motorised mailvan service in the 1920s, was discontinued due to objections from mule drivers. 48 See Goldstein 1973: 445-55. 49 Sakya and Emery 1990: 186. 50 See, for example, Quaiser 2001: 317-55.51 It was reported after talks with the Bhutanese ruler that, 'The execution of Mr Gand- hi was his solution to the difficulty'; OIOC, L/P&S/2222-3112, J.L.R.

Those who did not directly witness the events may not have been affected however; see Bray 1985: 61, who notes that Ladakhi Buddhist readers of theTibetan language newspaper published by the Moravians at the time of the Young-husband mission 'refused to believe that a Tibetan army wearing religious talismanshad ... proved vulnerable to ordinary bullets'. 70 Montague 1958: 637. This reflects an earlier belief that mental illnesses were un- known among 'savage tribes'; see Ernst 1997: 157 REMAIN74 That the 'traditional' was not unchallenged in Tibet is demonstrated by various recog- nised discourses in Tibetan society, including folk tales and popular satirical songs. Despite the dominant record of consent, large numbers of peripheral groups, bothelites and non-elites, had historically broken from the Tibetan state, e.g., Sherpas, Sikkimese, Everyday Tibet', Guthrie papers ...,' 120. 77 Personal diary of Dr. Ernst Schaefer, 1938-39, reference courtesy of Dr. Isrun Engel- hardt; cf; the Tibetan proverb 'There is no answer to an order, there is no medicine for death '; O'Malley 1999: 41. 78 Sakya and Emery 1990: 238. 79 Gelder 1964: 90 of a Tatura [ sic: Datura?] tree' were used.

Notes to Conclusion 1 See, for example, the memoirs in Richardus 1998. Aside from medical issues, pro- motion on merit was perhaps the aspect of British government that was most widelyadmired by the non-elite literate classes. 2 Morgan 2007: 131.3 Ibid: 150.4 See for example, Leslie and Young 1992:11, who quote an example from Tunisia.5 On which see, Lambert 1997; those displaced appear to be those such as variolaters whose speciality was in regard to conditions where biomedical treatment was consid-ered more efficacious by patients. Such practitioners, might however, adapt and findemployment within biomedicine - e.g., as vaccinators. 6 Harrison 1994: 232.NOTES 2817 Ibid.: 230 8 E.g., National Archives of India, Foreign Department, 1914 Index, indicates that file reference NAI, FD, 1914 External, June 163, Part B, contains Dr. Kennedy's 'Sugges- tions for Improving Medical Officers in Tibet'; the file itself remains closed. 9 Yuet-wah 1988: 1. 10 Bretelle-Establet: 171-203; attendance at Kunming Consular hospital showed as steady growth from 4,143 outpatients in 1908 to 55,450 in 1921 (the population doubled), although it did later decline; ibid: 190-91. 11 Ibid.: 187-88. 12 See, in 1996. 13 Bretelle-Establet 1999: esp., 171, 175, 178.14 See, for example, Meserve 1998: 70. 15 Oriental and India Office Collection, R/1/1/303, Government of India Foreign Depart- ment Proceedings, August 1904, parts 1-2. 16 I have previously noted that while information-gathering was a major part of the Poli- tical Officers' role in Tibet the information and perspectives of the technical and ad-ministrative staff who served there do not appear to have been included in this pro- cess; McKay 1997: 201-05. 17 On 115. 19 Similar attempts to confine Europeans to specific areas were made in China, Japan, Nepal, etc. 20 Lucas 1982: 70; see also, Crozier 1968: 164-65. 21 Paradoxically, biomedical services of a high standard become available in the most re- mote districts of India's northern frontier, where medical officers of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, while predominantly concerned with military health, also serve the lo- cal people; in many senses their services are superior to state civil medical provision. The situation has some obvious parallels with the Political Department dispensariesin areas beyond the reaches of British-Indian public health measures. 22 Arnold 1993: 7. 23Cf.Sakya and Emery 1990: 183; 'The Chinese also gave vaccinations for smallpox as well as other kinds of injections.
