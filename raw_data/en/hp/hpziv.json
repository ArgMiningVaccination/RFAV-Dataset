The average JCPyV and BKPyV seroprevalence rates in adults are 70% and 90%, respectively. After asymptomatic infection both v iruses persist in the renourinary tract. In fact, asymptomatic viruria is detectable in one -third of general population. However, in immunocompromised patients, JCPyV and BKPyV replication may progress to significant Hence, JCPyV can cause progre ssive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in or autoimmune diseases under immunosuppressive treatment. BKPyV can be a cause of polyomavirus -associated nephropathy (PyVAN) in kidney transplant recipients or hemorrhagic cystitis (PyVHC) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Due to more frequent application of immunosuppression, the risk of developing these diseases has increased in the last few decades. The risk of PML development is estimated to be 10 0- fold higher for JCPyV -seropositive patients in comparison to JCPyV -seronegatives. Most cases of PyV AN and PyVHC have been tested positive for BKPyV at the moment of disease diagnosis. Unfortunately, there is no specific anti viral therapy against any of t hese HPyV diseases. Thus, current strategies to avert PyVAN or PyVHC aim at identifying patients with BKPyV viremia and reducing immunosuppression. Similar strategies for PML have not been effective, since JCPyV viremia is usually not detected prior to or at the diagnosis of disease. The fate of BKPyV and JCPyV virus -like particles (VLPs ) was examined in an animal model corresponding to primary viremia in non -immune host. Radioactively labeled VLPs were used to assess blood decay, organ, and hepatocellular distribution of ligand, and non -labeled VLPs to examine cellular uptake by immunohisto - and cytochemistry. Rapid distribution of both BKPyV and JCPyV VLPs to the liver was observed, with lesser uptake in kidney and spleen. Liver uptake was predominantly ob served in LSECs. Blood half -life and tissue distribution of both wild -type JCPyV VLPs two mutant JCPyV VLPs (L55F and S269F), lacking sialic acid binding affinity, were similar, indicating involvement of non -sialic acid receptors in cellular uptake. We concluded that LSECs very effectively cleared a large fraction of blood -borne BKPyV and JCPyV VLPs, indicating a central role of these cells in early removal of polyomavirus from the circulation. Moreover, we observed that a subpopulation of endothelial c ells in kidney, the main organ of polyomavirus persistence, showed selective and rapid uptake of VLPs, suggesting a role in viremic organ tropism (Simon -Santamaria et al., p. 54 ). 5 Giving the increasing clinical need to reliably determine JCPyV and BKPyV IgG levels in patients at risk, we first reviewed and optimized serological tools for JCPyV and BKPyV IgG detection including virus -like particle (VLP) -based ELISA. We demonstrated that althou gh no statistically significant differences in intraassay and interassay variability were revealed for JCPyV serology of 400 -fold diluted sera from healthy donors, qualitative differences were seen in the identification of the individual JCPyV serostatus. The cause of discordance for approximately 10% of sera resulted from a low IgG activity close to the cutoff of the assay. Therefore we standardized the ELISA using reference serum for normalization. Moreover, we developed a preadsorption assay with cutoff of 35% reduction of the JCPyV IgG activity after preincubation with JCPyV VLPs. Importantly, we BKPyV antibody cross in preadsorption assay BKPyV VLPs. In conclusion, we show ed that VLP -based ELI SA with normalization can serve as a reliable tool for JCPyV IgG serology. Additionally, the preadsorption assay can help with unequivocal determination of JCPyV serostatus for samples with low I gG levels. (Kardas et al., p. 72 ). We also normalized this VL P-based ELISA for BKPyV IgG detection and showed that for seroepidemiology studies, BKPyV IgG ELISA at 1:200 serum dilution provides optimal sensitivity and specificity with the lowest false -positive and false -negative rate. However, f or individual risk assessment, 100 -, 200 -, and 400 -fold dilutions combined with preadsorption for low -reactive sera might be the most a ppropriate (Kardas et al., p. 82 ). This improved ELISA was used to investigate JCPyV and BKPyV specific antibody levels in several clinical studies: (1) one case of PML patient where positive JCPyV IgG status was compatible with other PML -indicating symptoms (Kurmann et al., p. 90 ); (2) one case of PyVAN caused by JCPyV rather than BKPyV, as confirmed by and BKPyV IgG/IgM negative results (Lautensc hlager et al., 99 ); (3) one case of PyVHC patient after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation where increasing BKPyV IgG activities were in line with progression of BKPyV viremia (Koskenvuo e t al., p. 106 ). Further, by serological testing of 122 immunocompetent and 63 immunocompromised patients we demonstrated that the BKPyV IgG level is age -dependent, with the highest values between 20 and 30 years (Schmidt et al., p. 119 ). In another study we compared serological outcomes of ELISA utilizing two different antigens in terms of prognostic value in prostate cancer development . To accomplish this we utilized improved ELISA for BKPyV IgG activity to both BKPyV VLPs and BKPyV LTag. Testing of 226 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for primary prostate cancer revealed that BKPyV 6 VP1 serostatus, in contrast to BKPyV LTag, has no prognostic value in prosta te cancer progression (Keller et al., p. 125 ). In conclusion, we provided a new input into kno wledge about tropism and clearance of polyomaviruses from blood. Moreover, we established a reliable and sensitive VLP -based assay for specific detection of JCPyV and BKPyV IgG and IgM . Serostatus based on ELISA results was compatible with other symptoms o f BKPyV - and JCPyV -related diseases. 7 3 Introduction 3.1 Human Polyomaviruses (HPyVs) The family Poly omaviridae comprises of three genera: two mammalian genera designated Orthopolyomavirus and Wukipolyomavirus , and the avian genus Avipolyomavirus (Fig. 1 ) (1, 2). JC and BK polyomaviruses (JCPyV and BKPyV), closely related to most intensely studied animal virus simian virus 40 (SV40), were the first PyVs to be discovered in humans (3-5). More recently, increased interest in innovative screening methods have led to discovery of ten previ ously unknown human polyomavirus (MCPyV) . This virus can be found in tumor cells of Merkel cell carcinoma, a skin cancer affecting mostly immunocompromised individuals (6). Another HPyV Trichodysplasia spinulosa polyomav irus (TsPyV) was identified in a rare skin disease with a typical striking development of keratin spicules originating from unusual hair follicles in immunocompromised patients (7). Further, human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) and 7 (HPyV7) were first detected on the skin of healthy individuals. Human polyomavirus 9 (HPyV9) was found in a serum sample from kidney transplant recipient and human polyomavirus 10 (HPyV10) was identified polyomavirus (STLPyV), closely related to HPyV10, was identified in stool samples from both healthy and diarrhea -inflicted children, wh ereas human polyomavirus 12 (HPyV12) was detected in liver tissue (11). New Jersey polyomavirus (NJPyV) is a novel polyomavirus that may have been discovered recently in a pancreatic transplant recipient with retinal blin showing tropism for vascular cells (12). According to the International Committee on Viruses JCPyV, another two HPyV, Karolinska Institute polyomavirus (KIPyV) and Washington University polyomavirus (WUPyV) identified in airway samples from patients with respiratory disease, are part of Wukipolyomavirus genus (Fig. 1 ) (2, 13) . 8 Figure 1. Phylogenetic tree of Polyomaviridae family [from (2)] HPyVs infect a large part of the general pop ulation with different age -dependent pattern s (14-16). MCPyV seroprevalence increases drastically in childhood and remains constant through life (17). For JCPyV, seroprevalence in creases slowly during childhood and continues increasing during life (15). On the other hand the sero prevalence of BKPyV increases during childhood but starts declining at the age of 40 (15). Those seroprevalence differences indicate that HPyVs are transmitted independently of one another and carry various risks of exposure and reexposure throughout the entire life (18). 9 3.1.1 JC and BK Polyomavirus es 3.1.1.1 Viral Background 3.1.1.1.1 Virion and Genome Organization The outer surface of every polyomavirus is a naked protein capsid composed entirely of a single virus -encoded protein called major capsid protein 1 (VP1). The virion contains a total of 72 pentameric VP1 capsomers arranged in T=7 icosahedral structure of approximately 40 - 45 nm in diameter . Inside the capsid, one molecule of either minor capsid protein 2 (VP2) or minor capsid protein 3 (VP3) is attached to each VP1 pentamer (Fig. 2 ). The N -terminus of VP1 is responsible for the interaction with other VP1 proteins in the same pentamer, wh ile the C -terminus reaches out into the neighboring pentamer to interact with VP1, thereby stabilizing the capsid. VP2 and VP3 interact with the VP1 molecule through hydrophobic interactions (19). It is believed th at both VP2 and VP3 are importan t for BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) genome s into virions as well as for uncoating and delivery of viral genome to the host cell nucleus (20, 21) . Figure 2. JCPyV and BKPyV structure 10 The HPyV virion encapsidates a circular double -stranded DNA of about 5100 -5300 base pairs (bp), organized around histones in a core -like structure. The BKPyV genome shares 75% of overall homology with JCPyV (22). Similar to other PyVs, the genome of both viruses can be divided into three parts: the non-coding control region (NCCR), the early viral gene region (EVGR) and the late viral gene region (LVGR) (Fig. 3 400 bp and corresponds to the nucleosome -free area between early and late region (19). It contains origin of viral replication ori, TATA - and TA TA-like sequences for both early an d late viral gene transcription, many DNA - and transcription factor - binding sites, promoter and enhancer elements as well as binding sites for large T -antigen (LTag) . The EVGR is about 2400 bp in size close to the left side of the origin of replication ori and encodes small T -antigen (sTag), LTag, and the . TruncTags have a common N -terminal part but differ in C -terminal part, due to alternative splicing of one pre - mRNA . Polyomaviruses do n ot enco de viral DNA polymerases , therefore the genome replication relies on host -cell enzymes. However, LTag contains DNA unwinding/ helicase activity and therefore regulates DNA replication as well as LVGR expression. All the transcription processes of the virus are completely dependent on host -cell transcription factors (23). Thus, cell activation by growth factors and other signals may initiate and facilitate these events. 11 The LVGR cover s about 2300 bp more distant to the origin of replication ori and contains the open reading frames (ORFs) of the structural proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3. Additionally, the JCPyV LVGR encodes a small protein called A gno, found only in BKPyV and simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40) . Although, there are many speculations about its properties, the function of Agno remains unknown (24, at least seven major genotypes and numerous subtypes (26). All genotypes were detected in different geographic areas of the world (Fig. 4). Type s 1 and 4 are the most common genotypes in Europeans, Types 2 and 7 are more frequent among Asians, and Types 3 and 6 in Africans. For each of the genotype one to five subtypes have been identified. 12 Figure 4. Phylogenetic reconstruction of JCPyV genome development and Subtypes on of all known genome -full-length isolates, BKPyV can be categorized into four major genotypes, namely I, II, III, and IV (29). Neutralization experiments show that all BKPyV genotypes are fully distinct serotypes (30, 31) . Due to expansion of BKPyV diversity and a rising difficulties in assigning viral strains to existing subtypes, additional subgroups within the four major subtypes have been appoint ed (32-34). Thus, subtype I is the most frequent and has a worldwide distribution, subtype IV is the second most frequent and might be more frequently detected in Eastern Asia . Although subtypes II and III are found worldwide, their frequencies are low (35, 36) . Additionally, according to the phy logenic investigations subtype I can be divided into 4 subgroups including subgroups Ia, Ib1, Ib2 and Ic, with broad geographical distribution . Subtype IV is divided into six subgroups in phylogenic including IVa1, IVa2, IVb1, IVb2, (6, 7) 5 ). It might be that different BKPyV genotypes have different cellular tropisms and pathogenic potentials in vivo (30). Figure 5. Phylogenetic reconstruction of BKPyV genomes from (34)] 3.1.1.1.3 attaches the 2,6-linked sialic acid -bearing structures (mostly glycoproteins and glycolipids) on the host cell surface (Fig. 6). Additional or alternative receptor might a lso be involved, such as the 5 -hydroxy -tryptamine -2A serotonin receptor (5HT which could bind virions have been identified on oligodendrocytes a nd astrocytes, on B -lymphocytes in tonsils and spleen, and in kidney and lung tissue, which stays in line with results from studies on the tissue distribution of JCPyV DNA (38-41). It is suggested that after attachme nt of JCPyV to 5HT 2AR and terminal 2,6-linked acid, internalization of the virus mediated via clathrin -coated pits takes place. Further steps include caveolin -1 and pH -dependent transport along the cellular 14 cytoskeleton to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (42-44). The caveolae are then transported to the caveosome, a vacuolar structure with a neutral pH, functioning as a sorting compartment. BKPyV infection is mediated by binding of major capsid protein VP1 to the 2,3 -linked sialic acid including GD1b and GT1b gangliosides, responsible for mediating cellular recognition and cell -to-cell interaction (19, 42, 45, 46) . Both GD 1b and GT1b are present on kidney and urinary tract cells making them th e main sites of the viral infection and replication (47). After binding to the receptor on the cell surface, the virus is internalized via caveolae -mediated endocytosis (48, 49) (Fig. 6 ). Caveolin lipid mbrane invagination and vesicle generation (50-52). The following steps of life cycle are similar for both JCPyV and BKPyV (49, 53) . After transport to the ER, partial uncoating of the virion takes place . Disulfide isomerases available in ER induce conformational changes in the VP1 structure of both viruses , facilitating capsid disassembly prior to its entry into the nucleus. For BKPyV, it has been shown that Derlin -1, a member of the ER -associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, works as a retro -translocation channel to transport the virus to th e cytosol through the interaction with VP1, prior to entry into nucleus (49, 54) . It has been proposed, that BKPyV might use the proteasome to enable a more efficient disassembly of the capsid in the cytosol (49, 55, 56) . Figure 6 . JCPyV and BKPyV life cycle 15 The detailed steps of the viral entry into the nucleus are not well defined . Nevertheless , due to size of the virion (40-45 nm), its transport might be limited , as the nuclear pore complex allows to pass only particles up to 39 nm (57). Moreover, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) located at the N-terminus of VP2 and VP3 has to be exposed to enable efficient transport into t he nucleus. There fore, the virion has to be partially disassembled in the ER for the NLS recognition and the pass age through the nuclear pore . After the entry of a viral DNA into the nucleus, decision on replication or latency must occur . This decis ion is well defined and the latency depends on host cell fitness , its differentiation potential and the immune status of the host. In case of the EVGR , expression begins from the left TATA box promoter and progresses in one direction half around the circular genome. Although mRNA of LTag and sTag are translated in the cytosol (58), LTag is immediately transported to the nucleus, whereas sTag stays in the cytoplasm. sTag interacts with retinoblastoma proteins (pRb) enabling the release of members of the E2F family of transcription factors from their Rb partners to promote cell cycle progression (59). sTag also inhibits phosphatase 2A (PP2A) . However, a direct role of sTag in promoting viral r eplication has not been defined . LTag on the other hand is necessary for replication of the viral genome as a result of its DNA binding and helicase activities (60). LTag is thought to promote viral replication directly by binding to viral DNA and viral proteins , as well as indirectly by interaction with key regul atory proteins of the host cell . Taking SV40, s ix copies of LTag asse mble into two hexameric structures at the NCCR initiate bidirectional melting of viral genome (61). Hexameric LTag also recruit s host cell polymerase and DNA -binding proteins to the replication fork in order to facilitate viral DNA replication. LTag also conveys a negative expression feedback of its own transcription by interactio n with binding sites in NCCR, thereby initiating expression of LVGR proteins (2). Similarly to sTag, LTag ensures activity of the cell through binding to the pRb and inhibition of its function . In an active state, pRbs cause a cell cycle arrest through formation of a complex with histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the transcription factor E2F (19, 62) . After binding of pRb by LTag, E2F is released, thereby inducing the trans cription of E2F-dependent gen es encoding cyclins, checkpoint regulators . The expression of proteins promoting DNA repair and replication leads to a ce ll cycle progression accompanied by viral replication (19, 62) . LTag also prevents the host cell from p53 -mediated apoptosis which would be caused by accumulating ampli fied DNA fragments and metabolic exhaustion (60, 63). 16 The LVGR expression is initiated by interaction of LTag with cellular transcription factors , including DNA polymerase , topoisomerases and replication protein A (RPA), and their binding to the NCCR (64, 65) . After transcription of LCGR, its common mRNA is alternatively spliced and translated into proteins . Thereafter, capsid proteins undergo posttranslational modifications including myristoylation of the N -terminus of VP2 and VP3 as well as formation o f disulfide bridges between VP1 proteins, which prevents the single pentamers from dissociation (19). After translation of capsid proteins, they are transpor ted from cytosol into the nucleus , whose mechanism is still not revealed. T he assembly of the virions with viral encapsidated viral DNA then takes place, leading to nuclear inclusion s and enlargement and eventual lysis of the cell (19, 66) . 3.1.2 Clinical Implications 3.1.2.1 Epidemiology of JCPyV Infection Numerous reports on JCPyV seroprevalence indicate presence of anti -JCPyV antibodies in 30 to 70% of healthy individuals (2, 14 -16). Diverse rates among different age groups indicate that JCPyV exposur e occur s at least in two life periods: in child hood with seroprevalence reaching around 25% in early adolescence , followed by the second phase in adult hood with up to 70% JCPyV seroprevalence among old people (14-16, 67) . There is also a regional variation of JCPyV seropositivity ranging from 47% in Norway to 68% in Turkey (68). JCPyV persists in the renourinary tract and viral replication is detected as asymptomatic viruria in approximately 30% of immunocompetent JCPyV seropositive individuals (15). Since seroprevalence of around 80% has been reported for BKPyV , it can be assumed that both viruses are transmitted independently and probably through various routes. Exposure and re-exposure to JCPyV is associ ated with a seroconversion of 1 to 2% per year, which has been not observed for BKPyV (15, 69) . 3.1.2.2 JCPyV -Associated Diseases In immunocompetent individuals JCPyV infection is not definite and may be subclinical or unspecific. T he major JCPyV -associated diseases occur in the context of immunological impairment of an efficient control of viral replication in the central nervous system (CNS) 17 and kidney and possibly in other sites, e.g. colon (2). The interest in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has increased due to a widespread us e of different immunosuppressive drugs. More over, cases of JCPyV -associated nephropathy in kidney transplant recipients have appeared as well as other pathologies including some forms of cancer (Table 1 ) (70). Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) JCPyV is the causative agent of PM L, a rare and frequently fatal brain disease preferentially affecting the white brain matter and is caused by cyt opat hic replication of the virus in myelin -producing oligodendrocytes (2, 71 -74). The pathology of the affected brain tissues demonstrates oligodendroglia -like cells with viral inclusions in their enlarged nuclei, one of the diagnostic hallmarks of this disease (68, 71, 73, 74) . The l ack of an animal model and the need to investigate PML only in humans made the understanding of the disease very difficult. However, it has changed in the last 50 years. Due to an increased rate of PML in HIV -AIDS patients and more common use of new biologic therapies of multiple sclerosis (MS) and autoimmune conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), there are more opportunities to study this disease (75). Moreover, highly sensitive molecular techniques allow nowadays detecting even very low level of virus. Additionally, estimation of PML risk for patients undergoing newer therapies for cancer, solid -organ and hematologic transplant ation, multiple sclerosis , and other autoimmune diseases has increased the general knowledge in this field (76-81). 3.1.2.2.1.1 Risk of Developing PML Among People with Different Cause of Immunodeficiency PML affects a small fraction of immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV -AIDS and transplant recipients on immunosuppressive drug therapies. Nowadays, HIV infection i s still the most frequent setting for PML, 80% of the cases, followed by hematologic malignancies ( approximately 8%), solid cancers ( around 3%), organ transplantation, and autoimmune diseases treated with immunomodulators (82). Due to various immunosuppressants being used, the risk of PML development varies between different group s of patients. The incid ence of PML in the general population was e stimated as 0.3 per 100 000 persons years compared to 1.0 for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (83, 84) . The 18 incidence in HIV -AIDS individuals is estimated as 2.4 cases per 1 000 patients years (r eported for Switzerland and Den mark) (85, 86) . Among patients after solid organ transplantation (heart or lung) th e PML incidence have been obser ved for 1.24 patients out of 1 000 (76). In patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with rituximab, a depleting monoclonal antibody targeting CD20+ B cells, the prevalence of PML was estimated as 1 in 25 000 patients (87). For multiple sclerosis patients approximate risk of PML development depends on several factors including JCPyV serostatus, prior therapy of multiple sclerosis with immunosuppressive drugs and duration of natalizumab treatment ( Fig. 7). Figure 7 . Approximate incidence of PML among multiple sclerosis patients stratified acco rding to different risk factors For patients receiving natalizumab for at least 2 months , 2.13 PML cases per 1 000 patients were reported (2, 88) . Taking the risk of PML stratified according to three risk factors, the incidence of PML is the lowest among the patients who are negative for anti -JCPyV antibodies, with the estimation of less than 0.09 cases per 1 000 patients. Patients wh o are positive for anti -JCPyV antibodies, had taken immunosuppressants before the initiation of natalizumab therapy, and have received 25 to 48 months of natalizumab treatment have th e highest estimated risk of 11.1 cases per 1 000 patients (68). 19 3.1.2.2.1.2 Various Hypotheses Concerning PML Pathogenesis The detailed steps o f PML development remain unknown due to the lack of definitive human data (73). The time between onset of JCPyV replication in the brain and accumulation of cytopathic damages leading to clinical and radiological abnormalities is still unclear . Moreover, the releva nt sites of JCPyV latency, including compartments where the virus acquires the most pathogenomic NCCR rearrangements (rr -NCCR) and VP1 capsid protein mutations, are not defined (2). However, it is postulated that JCPyV reaches CNS during primary viremia where its reactivation is locally censored by specific T -cell effectors. The decrease of T -cells function in the CNS permits local replication of JCPyV and cytopathic damage progressing to PML. Another theory presents lymphocytes, hematopoietic progenitor cells and other cells of the body as a site of JCPyV persistence, where in case of decreased activity of JCPyV -specific T -cells the virus can reactivate and occult secondary viremia resulting in colonization of susceptible cells in CNS and their eventual cytopathic damage. It has been hypothesized that the virus could persist in other cells of besides the kidney (lymphocytes or bone marr ow progenitor cells) and reach CNS via infected lymphocytes migrating to the CNS. The entry of the virus into nervous system would result in colonization, local replication and eventual cytopat hic damage of CNS cells. The virus reactivation hypothesis is supported by the fact that practically all PML patients are JCPyV seropositive at the time of PML diagnosis, although the serology testing was performed exclusively on HIV -AIDS or MS patients (69, 71, 88 -90). 3.1.2.2.1.3 Unique archetype JCPyV NCCR has been arbitrary divided into 6 blocks, designated from A to F (Fig. 8 ). Block A covers 36, B - 23, C - 55, D - 66, E - 18 and F - 69 base pairs. The highly variable rearrangements in JCPyV NCCR (rr -NCCR) can affect any of the blocks and can comprise of duplications (partial, multiple or tandem repeats) or deletions of archet ype NCCR (at -NCCR) sequence or combination of both (91-93). Some of the NCCR rearrangements are unique for PML cases, suggesting their role in the disease pathogenesis. PCR amplification and direct sequencing of rr -NCCR sequences allowed the identification of some typical rearrangemen t patterns. The rearrangements i n rr-NCCR sequences found in PML cases were observed in an ori-distal part of the NCCR close to LVGR and D -block of 20 NCCR, affecting a part or the entire D -block, whereas duplications occurred in ori-proximal part of the NCCR close to EVGR T ATA-box as well as in C -block alone or in combination with mutations in blocks A and B . Less frequent partial deletions have been observed in blocks E and F (92, 94, 95) . Sequence analysis of NCCRs from single -sampling site from the same PML patient indicates the presence of many different rr -NCCR sequences wit h a common signature but with one dominant rr -NCCR sequence (96). The major JCPyV quasispecies can change within 2 days in CSF, retaining nevertheless a rearrangement signature. The NCCR rearrangements might appear due to uncontrolled dynamic replication of JCPyV in the brain. Errors occurring during viral D NA replication result in generation of quasispecies of JCPyV with rr -NCCR with varied replication fitness (92). Figure 8 . JCPyV archetype NCCR architecture However, it can not be excluded that independent replication generates in parallel new NCCR rearrangements. Despite the high variety of NCCR rearrangements, the majority of JCPyV quasispecies with rr -NCCR invariably show increased EVGR expression in comparison to JCPyV with at -NCCR (92). 3.1.2.2.1.4 Major Capsid Protein (VP1) Characteristic for PML Patients Analysis of JCPyV VP1 sequences reveal s that a small number of mutations can be found exclusively in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain of PML patients . In fact, between 80 and 90% of viral isolates from PML patients exhibit mutat ions in one or more of the VP1 and these mutations have never been found in JCPyV isolates from individuals without PML (97). These substitutions affect amino acids located at or close to binding s ites for sialic acid structures, which enables viral interactions with cellular receptors and hence viral infectivity (98). The most frequent changes occur in amino acids 269 and 55 (L55F and S269F) (Fig. 9) (99, 100) . 21 Figure 9. Frequency of JCPyV VP1 mutations among 37 PML patients [from (99)] While wild -type JCPyV causes agglutination of red blood cells (RBC) (due to JCPyV binding activity to sialic acid structures pr esent on RBC), the virus with 55F, 267F, 269F or 269Y mutation is no longer able to achieve this (99). For some of the mutants, e.g. 60E, 265D and 271H, hemagglutination is still possible but at much lower level. Those changes in hemagglutination ability suggest that these mutations may influence the cell tropism of JCPyV in human by abrogating the ability to bind to sialylated molecules on a variety of peripheral cell types, but retain the ability to bind CNS glial cells (99). It is not well defined where the mutagenesis of JCPyV VP1 takes place. Nevertheless , approximately 10% of PML patients carrying the virus without VP1 mutations is still consistent with the hypothesis that the mutations occur prior to viral entry into the CNS (99). 3.1.2.2.1.5 Diagnosis and Clinical Presentation of PML The diagnosis of PML can be viewed as a loss of myelin -producing ol igodendrocytes which leads to a symmetric and focal lesions in the initial stages of the disease, followed by a dramatic subcortical expansion, confluence and even contralateral spread along the corpus callosum (73). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the key non-invasive diagnostic method for PML diagnosis (accompanied by clinical symptoms). Typically the lesions are located in the subcortical white matter with a sharp border toward s the gray matter and diffuse border towards the white matter (Fig. 10 ). 22 Figure 10 . Cerebral PML lesions (a, c) of an HIV -negative patient without IRIS and (b, d) an HIV -positive patient with IRIS [from (73)] The diagnos is of histologically confirmed PML requires demyelination in the white matter of the brain, compatible cytopathic alterations and specific JCPyV inv olvement, proven with immunohistochemistry for virus proteins (LTag or VP1) or DNA detection by in situ hybridization. Detection of JCPyV DNA in CSF is usually accepted as probable PML, called as well virologically - or laboratory -confirmed PML (2, 101, 102) . Based on observations of case series from different PML (pre-AIDS era, AIDS -associated the clinical presentation of PML is variable and reflect s severity an d location of the lesions. The general symptoms might i nclude cogn itive and behavioral abnormalities, visual deficits, motor weakness, gait abnormalities, incoordination, sensory loss and headache s (68). Epilepsy, althoug h rare in the initial clinical presentat ion of PML in HIV -AIDS, can be frequently observed among patients with PML lesions in more cortical location (103) as well as in patients with radiological signs of inflammation due to local immune responses (2). 23 3.1.2.2.1.6 PML Treatment Strategies There is currently no specific antiviral therapy to PML and the treatment aims at regaining control of i mmune system over JCPyV replication. In tran splant recipients , this approach requires reduction of immunosuppression , which is limited by increased risk of organ dysfunction or even graft rejection. For kidney transplant recipients , a return of hemodialysis or discontinuation of immunosuppressive treatment may be indicated for a successful outcome (104) . For other SOT patients, the reduction of immunosuppression might be not feasible to allow for timely recovery of immune control over JCPyV replication. Reduction or discontinuation of immunosuppre ssion in HSCT case could lead to a worsening of the graft -versus -host disease. For HIV -AIDS patients with PML, the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) might improve the overall outcome. Unfortunately, still approximate ly half of the HIV -patients develo p the disease or suffer from significant neurological impairment. In case of MS patients undergoing natalizumab treatment, immune reconstitution can be successful but sometimes can also lead to significant side effects, e.g. immune reconstitution inflammat ory syndrome (IRIS). In high -risk patients with PML -IRIS, the use of intravenous immunoglobulins may be beneficial due to their immunomodulatory activity dempening IRIS (105) . Also, adoptive transfer of JCPyV -specific T-cells has been reported for a child after allogeneic HSCT (106) . This immunologic treat ment was well tolerated and no recurrence of PML was noted. More attention has been also paid to the antivirals cytarabine and cidofovir and uptake blockers mirtazapine, chlorpromazine, and mefloquine alone or in combination, with varying success, typicall y in uncontrolled case studies (107 -113) . 3.1.2.2.2 Other JCPyV -Associated Diseases diseases including JCPyV -mediated granule cell neuronopathy caused by replication of the virus in granule cell neurons of the cerebellum (114, 115) . The disease is associated w ith VP1 C -terminal JCPyV mutations , approximately 10 bp deletions resulting in frame shift and a total change of the C -terminal amino acid sequence of the protein (116, 117) . Clinical symptoms include a cerebellar syndrome with ataxia and progressive cerebellar atrophy without involvement of the white matter (114) . The JCPyV can be detected in CSF. The lesions frequently coexist with PML in the white matter of the 24 cerebellum and cerebrum. The proposed treatment is based on regaining immune control over JCPyV replication. JCPyV-associated encephalopathy is another disease caused by cytopathic JCPyV replicat ion in the gray matter, this time targeting the cortical pyramidal neurons (118) . It is characterized by lesions expanding from the gray matter to subcortical areas and by presence of the virus in the CSF of the patient . JCPyV -associated mening itis and encephalitis have been discovered in patients with typical symptoms of meningeal inflammation, including neck stiffness, headache, fever and JCPyV present in CSF (119, 120) . However, no clinical sign of neurologic deficits characteristic for PML has been found. The diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms of meningitis and presence of JCPyV in the Acute Radiological findings (MRI) Asymmetric , well demarcated, non - enhancing subcortical white matter lesions, hyperintense in T2 and FLAIR, hyperintense in T1 Contrast enhancement and mass effect Cerebellar atrophy Cortical lesions No defined lesions, ventricular dilatation Neurological symptoms Based on location Based on location and inflammation Cerebellar syndrome Encephalopathy Headache, stiff neck, fever Diagnosis JCPyV detection in the CSF, brain biopsy, radiographical findings and symptoms JCPyV in the CSF, brain biopsy, radiographical findings and symptoms Cerebellar biopsy, JCPyV in radiographical findings and symptoms Brain biopsy, JCPyV PCR in the CSF, radiographical findings and symptoms JCPyV in the CSF and exclusion of other viruses Histology Demyelinating lesions often at grey/white junction, JCPyV detected in enlarged oligodendrocytes, bizarre astrocytes Demyelination similar to classic PML, with addition of inflammatory infiltrates Lytic infection of granule cell neurons in the cerebellum Lytic cortical pyramidal astrocytes by JCPyV Treatment cART for HIV-positive patients, discontinue or decrease immunosuppression for HIV-negative patients, plasma exchange for natalizumab -treated patients Similar to PML, consider steroids in cases with notable neurological worsening or signs of impending brain hern iation Similar to classic PML Similar to classic PML Similar to classic PML Table 1. Clinical presentations of JCPyV -related neurological diseases [from (121) ] 25 Nephropathy due to JCPyV (JCPyVAN) is a rare complication affecting approximately 1% of kidney transplant recipients causing severe graft dysfunction and its eventual loss (122, 123) . This complication leads to the decline of the renal allograft function, very high JCPyV load and decoy cells shedding in urine. Morphologically, JCPyVAN and BKPyVAN are indistinguishable. Blood or plasma test could be unreliable due to frequently very low or even undetectable amount of JCPyV DNA (124) . JCPyVAN is usually confirmed with immunohistochemical detection of LTag in renal tubular epithelial cells by cross -reactive SV40 antibodies . The pathology of JCPyVAN occur s without NCCR rearrangements (125) . JCPy VAN can be treated by reducing immunosuppression leading to stabilization of allograft function during follow -up and to clearance of the virus (122) . The transforming potential of JCPyV makes it interesting in terms of human malignancies. Numerous human malignancies have been associated with Infection Epidemiological studies revealed that BKPyV infection occurs during early childhood at a median age of 4 -5 years through the respiratory or oral route (14, 130) . After primary infection BKPyV persists in the renourinary tract as the principal site (131) . It is unknown if this is a truly latent infection, with no replication and limited or no viral gene expression, or if it is a persistent infection, with low -level vir al replication. However, it has been shown that spontaneous r eactivation of BKPyV and its asymptomatic urinary shedding occurs in up to 62% of healthy BKPyV -seropositive individua ls (130, 132, 133) . The overall seroprevalence for BKPyV among human population reaches up to 90% (14-16). The number of seropositive individuals increases until the age of 40 years and then slightly decreases (14, 16) . Interestingly, this is in contrast to JCPyV which seroprevalence -Associated Diseases Primary BKPyV infection is not associated with any well -defined clinical symptoms in immunocompetent individuals. Reactivation of latent virus could however occur in old age, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, congenital immunodeficie ncy, HIV -AIDS and most importantly, 26 kidney transplantation. The first sign of reactivation is BKPyV viruria, which has been reported in 15 -60% of kidney transplant patients (134, 135) . This is followed by BKPyV viremia and BKPyV -associated nephropathy (BK PyVAN) seen respectively in 5 -30% and 1 - 10% of kidney transplant patients (134 -138) . In bone marrow transplant recipients, hemorrhagic cystitis is an important clinical syndrome attributed to BKPyV infection, particularly after radiation and chemotherapy (139 -142) . Other diseases caus ed by BKPyV infection include ureteric stenosis and bladder cancer. Disease s affecting regions outside of the urogenital tract associated with BKPyV have only rarely been seen in the form of myopathy in kidn ey transplant recipient or disseminated infection i n AIDS patients as well as single cases of encephalitis and meningoencephalitis (143, 144 ). 3.1.2.4.1 Polyomavirus -Associated Nephropathy (PyVAN) It has been reported, that PyVAN affects between 1 and 10% of kidney transplant patients during the first two years post -transplantation (135, 145 -147) . PyVAN rarely affect s patients other than kidney transplant recipients and so far only few cases of the disease in native kidneys of other immunocompromised patients have been reported (148) . 3.1.2.4.1.1 PyVAN Pathogenesis The impairment of immune response allows BKPyV to be reactivated, leading to its replication and host cell death . The nephropathy is manifested as damage of tubular epithelial cells due to extensive viral replication causing their eventual lysis (136, 149) . The damage to the tubules can be observed along the whole nephr on. Howe ver, the proximal tubul es, the collective duct and the distal tubules are usually the most affected by extensive viral replication (150, 151) . As a consequence, virus leaks into the bloodstream and inflammatory cells infiltrate the interstitium leading to tubular atr ophy and interstitial fibrosis (152, 153) . This impairs the graft function and increases the risk of graft rejection. Importantly, the urothelial cells may also play a role in PyVAN. Modeling of BKPyV replication in kidney transplant patients with PyVAN suggests that although viral replication starts in the renal tubular epithelial cells, BKPyV is later carried to the urothelial cell compartment where more than 90% of urine BKPyV loads are gen erated (154). Histopathological data revealing extensively infected urothelial cells in the bladder of 27 patients with PyVAN confirm the suggested model (150) . 3.1.2.4.1.2 Diagnosis and Clinical Presentation of PyVAN The clinical presentation of PyVAN is insidious and allograft function decreases with persistent disease indicating progressive involvement of BKPyV replication . Typical signs of viral replication can be observed in tubular epithelial cells including enlargement of nuclei with smudgy chromatin changes, intranuclear inclusions, rounding, and eventual detachment of the cell from tubular walls (146, 151, 155, 156) . In f urther phase of PyVAN development, extensive renal involvement is observed with multifocal cytopathic alterations, necrosis, accompanied by inflammatory response, and first signs of fibrosis. The inflammatory i nfiltrate contai ns polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, and plasmacytoid cells in varying distributions (146, 150, 157) . Further on, interstitial fibrosis, scarring, and even calcifications could occur . The become flattened and atrophic and sometimes few polyomavirus -infected cells are detectable. It is stron gly recommended to screen kidney transplant patients regularly for early diagnosis (158) . Screening for PyVAN can be achieved by detection of BKPyV replication in the urine to identify patients at risk. Various techniques and urine cytology have been used to identify decoy cells or quantitative PCR of urine and/or plasma for detection of high -level BKPyV viruria (159) . Importantly, p lasma PCR has a higher positive predictive value in comparison to urine PCR as episodic viruria is quite frequent in this patient group, while viremia is less common and usually precedes PyVAN (135) . Alternatively, cytological examination of urine in search of decoy cells o r electron microscopy can be performed (160) . Most of the time the complete diagnosis of PyVAN requires a histologica l demonstration of BKPyV replication. However, a negative biopsy result cannot exclude PyVAN, due to its focal nature (149, 161) . 3.1.2.4.1.3 PyVAN Treatment Strategies The management of PyVAN is difficult due to the lack of standard protocol and effective antivir al drugs. BKPyV infection remains latent with its predisposition to reactivation and regaining of patient immune function is needed to eventually control BKPyV replication. Th e most widely used interventions include reduction, change or discontinua tion of immunosuppression. These approaches are nevertheless connected with a risk of acute graft rejection. After decrease of immunosuppression, the serum creatinine value has to be 28 monitore d in 1 -2 week intervals and the BKPyV viremia in 2 -4 week intervals (158) . When the disease is detected at an early stage, a reduction in the immunosuppressi on is often sufficient to clear BKPyV viremia and stop the progression of disease (162 -164) . Clearance of BKPyV occur s in >85% of BKPyVAN cases, although more advanced stage of PyVAN may require more comprehensive intervention (138, 163, 165) . In comparison to strategy based on reduction in immunosuppression alone, there is no evidence to support the use of any other drugs combined with reduction in immunosuppression (166) . Nevertheless, cidofovir (orally administered dru g which indir ectly leads to decrease of T - and B - lymphocytes proliferation), fluroquinolones (synthetic broad spectrum antimicrobial agents suggested to interfere with the helicase activity of BKPyV LTag) and intravenous immunoglobulins haematopoietic stem -cell transplantation (171 -173) . Causative factors include urotoxic conditioning procedures and total body irradiation as well as viral in fections including BKPyV and adenovirus. In terms of further therapy, it is important to distinguish BKPyV -associated affects allogeneic HSCT patients, sin gle cases have been reported in other immunocompromised patients (130) . 3.1.2.4.2.1 PyVHC Pathogenesis Although the pathogenesis of PyVHC is not wel l understood, sequence of events has been suggested as cause of the disease (150, 175) . Those include subclinical damage of bladder mucosa by acroleine - a toxic metabolite of cyclophosphamide (used as conditioning protocol prior HSCT), im munologically uncontrolled high -level replication of BKPyV resulting in uncovering of the damaged bladder mucosa, and inflammation occurring during engraftment of the stem cell graft. 29 3.1.2.4.2.2 Diagnosis and Clinical Presentation of PyVHC In contrast to PyVAN cases, BKPyV viremia is not consistently seen in patients with haemorrhagic cystitis (176) . To discriminate PyVHC from haemorrhagic cystitis occurring prior to the engraftment due to urotoxic conditioning or total body irradiation, the triad of cystitis, hematuria (grade II or more) and high -level BKPyV replication need to be reported. Additionally, plasma BKPy V load should be also measured (135, 177, 178) . As viral determinants of haemorrhagic cystitis, altered nuclear factor 1 (SP1) transcription sites in the BKPyV NCCR have been reported (179) . Organ determinants may reside in tissue injury elicited by conditioning, which may provide an increased number of regenerating cells for BKPyV replication. Conditioning for HSCT impairs the BKPyV -specific cellular immu ne surveillance and provides the grounds for extensive BKPyV replication. On engraftment, recovering immune cells including polymorphonuclear and NK cells engage with BKPyV targets and elicit a pronounced inflammatory response typical for late onset of HC. 3.1.2.4.2.3 PyVHC Treatment Strategies Therapy for PyVHC is challenging and purely supportive, consisting mainly of pain relief, bladder irrigation to prevent clot fo rmation, hyperhydration to increa se diuresis and urosurgical intervention (153) . Additionally, lost platelets and red blood cells are substituted. There have been reports of effective interventions with vidarabine or cidofovir (180, 181) . However, renal drug toxicity is a critical issue in stem -cell transplant patients, which calls for a cautious use of cidofovir. Inte restingly, hyperbaric oxygen is frequently used for radiation induced haemorrhagic cystitis and has also been reported to be beneficial for patients with PyVHC (182) causing stimulation of mucosal repair in adder. 3.1.2.4.3 Other BKPyV -Related Diseases cause other diseases, such as ureteric stenosis found in kidney transplant recipients and in allogeneic HSCT patients (4, 183 -185) . Few reports descri be some cases of BKPyV influence on CNS diseases among immu nocompromised patients (186, 187) . There are also reports on detection of BKPyV proteins and/or DNA in some tumors (188) . However, a definitive causal role for BKPyV in human malignancy is stil l missing (189, 190) . 30 3.2 Immune Response to Viral Infection All living org anisms have developed several kinds of mechanisms to protect themselves from invasion by microorganisms, including viruses (191) . The main function of immune system is the recognition and distinction of self and non -self antigens (192 -194) . The mammalian immune system can be generally divided into two parts : (1) the innate or non -specific immunity , which is a first line of defense causing immediate not antigen -specific response against invading organisms , and does not demonstrate immunological memory; (2) the adaptive or specific immunity, which is a second line of defense causing delayed antigen - specific response against invading organisms , and demonstrates immunological memory (195) . 3.2.1 Innate Immune Response to Viruses Body surfaces like skin, mucosa or surfaces within the body, including endothelial cells and basement membranes, are typical anatomic barriers, which are partly effective in preventing virus entry and its spread within the host organism (196) . Under normal conditions, these barriers have a low permeabil ity for viruses provided that the body surfaces stay intact . However , virus es can sometimes penetrate endothelial border by replicating in the capillary endothelial cells or in circulating leukocytes (197 -202) . Additionally , most of body fluids and tissues contain soluble viral inhibitors, including chemically diverse lipids, polysaccharides , proteins, lipoproteins and glycoproteins, which prevent viral attachment, inactivate virus or inhibit virus replication (203, 204) . In the gastrointestinal tract, some viruses can be also inactivated by acid, bile salts and enzymes (204 , 205) . The complement system is one of the major effector mechanisms of the innate immune response. It is complex network of more than 30 plasma and membrane -associated serum proteins, constituting more than 15% of the globular fraction of plasma which can elicit cytolitic immune responses against the virus (206, 207) . All complement proteins are organized into a hierarchy of proteolytic cascades that start when pathogenic surfaces are identified . The recognition of an antigen leads to generation of potent proinflammatory mediators (anaphylatoxins), opsonization of the pathogenic surface through various comp lement opsonins (e.g., C3b), targeted lysis of the pathogenic surfac e through the 31 assembly of membrane -penetrating pores known as the membrane attack complex (MAC) , as well as production of classical proinflammatory response molecules , e.g. interferons (206) . Type I interferons (IFNs) are the principal cytokines involved in the antiviral response and can be produced by all nucleated cells (208) . Some members of type II and III IFNs have also been shown to play a role in blocking viral DNA synthesis (209 -211) . Despite different receptors for each of these IFNs, they share downstream signaling molecules and initiate a signaling cascade through the Janus kinase (JNK) signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK -STAT) pathway. The activation of this pathway leads to the transcription al regulation of hundreds of IFN -regulated genes (IRGs) including the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and IFN regulatory factor (IRF) families of transcription factors, which are involved in the regulation of both ISG and IFN gene e xpression (212, 21 3). This leads to a remarkable antiviral state, effective against positive -, negative -, and double - stranded RNA viruses, DNA viruses, and intracellular bacteria and parasites. Therefore, IFNs have multiple functions: (1) they increase expression of proteins responsible for the apoptosis of virus -infected cells, (PML) and regulators of IFN induced death (RIDs) (214, 215) ; (2) they activate NK cells and DCs and trigger the adaptive immune response (216) . The cells involved in the innate immune response include natural killers (NKs), dendritic cells express a set of germline encoded pattern recognit ion receptors (PRRs) that are able to recognize conserved molecular patterns asso ciated with viruses (191, 196, 217 -219) . These receptors trigger a rap id inflammatory response by production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, thereby inducing the killing of infected/ transformed cel ls or stimulating phagocytosis or apoptosis. They can also upregulate expressi on of co -stimulatory molecules responsible for activation of the adaptive arm of the immune responses . Another essential function of PRRs is discrimination between self and non -self nucleic acids. According to recent reports on innate immunity this discrimination relies mostly on Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid -inducible (NLRs). TLRs are single, membrane -spanning receptors on sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from pathogens . TLR 32 mediate the antiviral immune responses by recognizing virus infection, activating signaling pathways and inducing the production of antiviral cytokines and chemokines . TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are located pr imarily in the plasma membrane and therefore interact with components of microbial pathogens that come into contact with the cell. In contrast, TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 are situated in the membr anes of endosomes and lysoso mes . The extracellular ligand -binding site is exposed inside these organelles. Genomic material derived from endocytosed pathogens can be bound by TLRs and trigger immune response. After binding their respective ligands, TLRs 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 send the signal through their homodimers. However, TLR2 may heterodimerize with TLR1 or TLR6 depending on the ligand. TLR4 requires in addition MD2 for signal transduction (Fig. 11). Figure 11 . Cellular distribution of TLRs and their recognized molecules . Although TLR2 has been best studied in the context of antibacterial and anti -fungal responses, it has been also shown in a limited number of cases to be involved in the recognition of DNA viruses, e.g. by recognition of envelope glycoproteins B and H of human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV) gH/gL and virus (HSV) (220 - 224) . Therefore it is believed that it might be also involved in recognition of other DNA viruses . However, the most important member of the TLR family able to detect viral DNA is TLR9. This receptor is primarily expressed in B cells and plas macytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). The main function of TLR9 is to reco gnize viruses containing genomes rich in CpG DNA 33 motifs , which is commonly found in prokaryotes and viruses but not in vertebrates. Studies have shown that TLR9 is involved in recognition of hepatitis B virus (HBV), murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and Epste After recognition of cytoplasmic viral DNA, TLR9 recruits its adaptor protein MyD88 to initiate two signaling pathways in IRF7 is translocated into the nucleus in order to induce the transcription of type I IFN genes (227, 228) . MyD88 is also associated with TRAF6 which interacts with IKK kinase complex resulting in IKK activation by phosphorylation (229) . The activated IKK initiates dim ers from the cytoplasmic NF -B-IB complex allowing them t o translocate to the nucleus, binding to B enhancer elements and inducing transcription of proinflammatory genes (230 -232) . Upon stimulation by viral nu cleic acids, TLR9 is transported to the early endosomes to activate the NF -B. Once activated, it is able to induce cytokine genes in dendritic cells (DCs) and subsequently traffics (230, 233) . Also RLRs can trigger signal that induces type I IFNs and other inflammatory cytokines through the IPS -1 adaptor molecule (234, 235) . Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen -presenting cells , whose main function is to process an antigen and present it on the cell surface to the T cells of the immune system. They act as messengers between the innate and the adaptive immune system. Macrophages are another type of innate immune cells, which can act as messenger for the adaptive immune system. Along with dendritic cells, they are foremost among the cells that present antigens, play ing a crucial role in initiation of an immune response. As secretory cells, monocytes and macrophages are vital to the re gulation of immune responses and the development of inflammation. They produce a wide array of chemical substances including enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such a s interleukin -1 (IL -1). Natural Killer (NK) cells are a nother key component of innate immunity. They display an antigen -independent lytic activity (236) . NK effector functions are controlled by a balance of activ ating and inhibit ory signals provided by killer -cell immunoglobulin -like receptors (KIRs) through the interaction with specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) -class I ligands. In HSCT recipients, the of NK cells in mediating graft -versus -leukemia effec t and in controlling infections has been well described, but little is still known about NK cells in solid organ transplantation (237) . It has been observed that NK cells are able to suppress graft -versus - host disease (GV HD). It has been also shown that donor T cells exhibited less proliferation 34 and decreased IFN - production in the presence of NK cells (238, 239) . In vivo studies revealed perforin - and Fas ligand (FasL) -mediated reduction of donor T cell proliferation and increased T cell apoptosis in the presence of NK cells (238) . In vitro , activated NK cells mediate direct lysis of reisolated GVHD T cells (238) . The correlation between KIRs genotype and viral infection following kidney transplantation has been described for CMV (240) . HLA-C/KIR interactions were associated with the control of primary CMV infection as measured by the time to CMV viremia in CMV D +/R- solid organ transplant recipients. The presence of the activating receptor (KIR2DS2) in combination with a weaker inhibitory receptor (KIR2DL3 on at least one allele) was associated with protection against CMV viremia. However, this protective effect was only present if neither the donor nor the recipient expressed any HLA -C2 molecules (240) . Another study showed significantly reduced rate of CMV viremia in kidney transplant recipients carrying KIR B haplotypes in the subpopulation of kidney transplant recipients (241) . In contrast, a lack of such association has been observed for BKPyV reactivation (237) . A recent study reported a genetic predisposition to BKPyV infection and PyVAN development by demonstrating a protective effect of the activating receptor KIR3DS1 as it has been shown for other v iruses such as human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and CMV (242) . Although it is well known that the spleen plays a key role in detection and clearance of pathogens from blood, these processes are redundant with immune surveillance by other tissues. With the exception of clearance of encapsulated bacteria by the spleen, the host's ability to detect and clear pathogens is not affected by sple nectomy (243) . Such functional redundancy is not seen for immune surveillance mediated by th e liver, suggesting this organ is a primary surveillance mechanism for intravascular infections (244) . By receiving both portal vein blood and arterial blood, the liver is an important and critical component in the defense against blood -borne infec tion due to innate and adaptive immune cells spec ialized in detection and capture of pathogens from the blood. Additionally, these immune cells participate in coordinated immune responses leading to pathogen clearance, leukocyte recruitment and antigen presentation to lymphocytes within the vasculature. The role of liver in host defens e has to be tightly regulated to ensure that inappropriate immune responses are not raised against non -pathogenic exogenous blood -borne molecules, e.g. food. Therefore, this characteristic for the liver balance between activation and tolerance makes the li ver a frontline immunological organ (244) . The liver contains the largest popu lation of macrophages (resident liver macrophages, namely Kuffler cells (KCs)) and NK 35 cells. The role of the liver in detection and response to infectious organisms is a function of not only the population of cells residing in this organ, but also specific anatomy. Liver sinusoid al endothelial cells (LSECs) play a major role in pathogen detection, capture and most probably antigen presentation. LSECs comprise approximately 50% of the non - parenchymal cells in the liver, meaning more than twice more abundant than either macrophages or lymphocytes in the live r (245) . LSECs separate the underlying hepatocytes from the blood in the sinusoidal lumen. Due to lack of organized basement mem brane there is a gap between the endothelial lining and hepatocytes , called the space of Disse . This physical separation serves to limit direct contact between the liver parenchyma and the sinusoidal lumen (246) . The LSECs can selectively regulate the passage of molecules from the sinusoid lumen to the space of Disse and the under lying hepatocytes, and facilitate direct contact between hepatocytes and intraluminal lymphocytes (246) . LSECs are also important immune APCs due to expression of wide variety of PRRs, including Toll -like receptors TLR3, molecules CD86) and adhesion molecules ( such as ICAM) needed for interaction with lymphocytes (248) . Surface scavenger receptors, mannose receptors and receptors for immunoglobulins and immune complexes, enable LSECs to directly internalize antigens, cellular debris and immune complexes of the size u p to 1 m in diameter (248, 249) . Innate immune responses in the liver are summarized in Figure 12 . Figure 12 . Innate immune responses in the liver [from (244) ] 36 3.2.1.1 Specific Viral DNA sensors So far, several candidate s of viral DNA sensors together with their signaling pathways have been reported (250, 251) . The f irst protein suggested being a cytoplasmic DNA sensor is DNA -dependent activator of interferon -regulatory factors (DAI). Overexpression of DAI enhan ces the induction of type I IFN by cytosolic DNA from different sources including bacterial and mammalian DNA. Moreover, DAI knockdown experiments point out that HSV infection also induces ty pe I IFN. Recently, it has been also reported that DAI is an important partner of receptor -interacting protein kinase ( RIP) 3 and is essential for murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) -induced cell death (252) . DAI partners with RIP3 and induces RIP3 binding to RIP hom otypic interaction motif (RHIM) and RHIM -dependent necrosis. Expression of DAI sensitizes cells to virus - induced necrosis and DAI knockdown or knockout cells are resistant to this death pathway (252) . Although RIG -I is well known as an RNA -binding protein, some study reported that RLRs, including RIG -I and MDA5, might also act as DNA -binding proteins. Two groups identified RNA polymerase III as a cytosolic DNA sensor, which subsequently activates the induction of type I IFNs through the RIG -I pathway (253) . Both studies demonstrated that AT -rich dsDNA serves as a template, which is consequently converted into dsRNA by RNA polymerase III. The transcript acts as a preferred ligand of RIG -I and as a result induces IFN - through t he RIG-I pathway (253) . Moreover, it has been shown that HSV -1 and EBV all trigger the RNA polymerase III -mediated induction of type I IFNs (253) . Recognition of dsRNA intermediates produced by RNA polymerase III -med iated transcription of dsDNA by RIG -I could be therefore the possible mechanisms of innate immune detection of DNA viruses. It has been shown that PyVAN innate immune mechanisms through TLR3 and RIG -I are responsible for both anti -BKPyV responses and inflammatory events . These mechanisms might therefore contr ibute to PyVAN development due to enhanced expression of cytokines and chemokines (254) . MITA (Mediator of IRF3 Activation, or STING [Stimulator of Interferon Genes]) was identified as an important adapter protein for virus -triggered type I IFN induction. MITA occurs on the outer membranes of mitochondria and ER. In certain cell types, MITA is recruited to VISA and RIG -I upon RNA virus infection. MITA can also recruit serine/threonine -protein kinase TBK1 TBK1 phosphorylates IRF3 (255) . It has been shown that IFN - production in res ponse to the infection of HSV-1 or transfection of purified DNA from Escherichia coli is abolished in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with MITA 37 deficiency, suggesting that MITA is crucial in mediating DNA -induced innate immune responses (256) . Mice with MITA knockout failed to produce type I IFNs upon infection with Listeria monocytogenes , or treatment with c -di-GMP in vivo . Another protein called IFI16, containing a C -terminal HIN -200 domain for DNA binding and an N -terminal pyrin domain (PYD) for protein -protein interaction, binds to both ss and ds DNAs. The subcellular localization of IFI16 differ in different cell types and can be detected i n nucleus, cytoplasm or both (257) . The cytoplasmic of HCMV replication. Furthermore, knockdown of IFI16 inhibits DNA - and HSV-1-mediated activation of IRF3 and NF -B (258, 259) . When localized in the nucleu s, IFI16 functions as a nuclear sensor to recruit ASC (apoptosis -associated speck -like protein containing a CARD) via their respective PYD domain and therefore induce the formation of inflammasomes. However, further studies are required in order to underst and the significance of the nuclear IFI16 -inflammasomes (250, 251) . DDX41, a member of DEXDc family of helicases, has also been suggested as a c ytosolic sensor for DNA virus (260) . It has been shown that DDX41 is responsible for cytosolic DNA sensing in human mDCs (myeloid dendritic cells), BMDCs (bone marrow derived dendritic cells) and monocytes. DDX41 can also bind to poly -AT or HSV -1 DNA, resulting in its interaction with MITA and activation of TBK1 (260) . LTTFIP1 can possibly also take part in non -self DNA re cognition. It is able to detect the infection of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV ) in -induced of IFN - (261) . After recognition of dsRNA, B -DNA or Z -DNA in the cytoplasm, LRRFIP1 promotes the activation of -catenin, which binds to the C - terminal domain of IRF3 and recruits the acetyltransferase p300 to induce the expression of IFN- (261) . However, more studies are needed to establish a specific role of LRRFIP1 in innate immune recognition of DNA viruses in vivo . Recently, high -mobility group box (HMGB) proteins have been also reported to sense non - self nucleic acids. The family includes highly conserved HMGB1, 2 and 3. Eac h protein contains two DNA binding domains. Whereas HMGB1 is ubiquitously and abundantly expressed, the expression of HMGB2 and HMGB3 are limited to lymphoid organs and hematopoietic stem cells. While HMGB1 and HMGB3 have been suggested to recognize both and RNAs, HMGB2 recognizes only cytosolic DNAs. HMGB1 deficiency results in reduction of type I IFNs as response to both DNA and RNA, whereas HMGB2 deficiency only affects DNA -triggered induction of type I IFNs in MEFs. 38 LSm14A, has been also demonstrated as a sensor of viral nucleic acids in the early phase of viral infection (262) . LSm14A is translocated to peroxisomes upon infection by both RNA and DNA viruses. In t he peroxisomes, LSm14A binds MITA to induce IFN - as a response to DNA viruses, leading to the recruitment of RIG-I and VISA thereby inducing IFN- in response to RNA viruses (262) . The constitutively expressed LSm14A may act as the earliest sensor of viral nucleic acids. Therefore, it has been assumed that P -bodies are important cellular structures involved in viral life cycles (263) . Interestingly, a recent study shows that nonstructural protein (NS1) of influenza A virus inhi bits cellular antiviral response by targeting the P -body -localized LSm14A/RAP55 (264) . These findings indicate an important role of LSm14A as well as the P -bodies in cellular antiviral response. Besides the activation of TBK1 and IRF3, which results in the induction of type I IFNs, innate recognition of viral DNA also activates pathways leading to the assembly of inflammasomes, which, via caspase -1, result in the cleavage and maturation of certain proinflammatory cytokines such as IL -1 and IL -18 (265) . So far, four types of inflammasomes have been identified, including the NLRP1, NLRP3, IPAF, and AIM2. Whereas NLRP1 - and IPAF - inflammasomes mainly function against bacterial infection, AIM2 was reported to be a regulator of DNA -mediated inflammatory responses (266) . AIM2 contains a conserved DNA binding domain and a PYD domain. It has been reported that AIM2 directly senses dsDNA from both bacteria and virus in the cytoplasm and recruits the adaptor protein ASC that interacts with pro -caspase -1. Procaspase -1 is activated in this complex, leading to the processing and maturation of inflammatory cytokines, like IL -1 and IL -18 . Caspase -1 is called AIM2 Since the expression of AIM2 is induced by IFNs, it is likely that after DNA virus infection the host cells utilize both the TBK1 -IRF3 and AIM2 -inflammasome pathways to ensure a fulfilled innate response against viral infection. Defensins are small cationic peptides that intrinsically possess antimicrobial properties and are key mediators of the innate immune system (267) . It had been proposed that defensins primarily target enveloped viruses by disrupting the envelope membrane in a manner similar to their antibacterial activities. However, the recent studies demonstrates that defensins exhibit complex func tions by positively or negatively modulating infection of both enveloped and non -enveloped viruses (267) . Human defensins are classified into two subfamilies, and , which differ in their three disulfide bond paring. Neutrophil -defensins (HNPs 1 -4) ar e synthesized in promyelocytes and the mature peptide is stored in primary granules of neutrophils (267) . However, HNPs 1 -3 can also be found in other immune cells, including natural killer cells, B cells, T cells, monocytes, macrophages and immature dendritic cells. 39 Two additional human -defensins, human defensins 5 and 6 (HD5 and HD6), are constitutively expressed in intestinal Paneth cells but also found in the genital mucosa. HNP release can be induced by chemokines, FC receptor cross linking, phorbol myristate acetate and bacterial components that activate Toll -like receptors (TLR) 2 and 5. Human - defensins (HBDs) 1 -3 are expressed by epithelial cells, monocytes, macrophages and monocyte -derived dendritic cells. HBDs expression can induced by ria, microbial products, Toll -like receptor (TLR) ligands, EGF pro -inflammatory cytokines. It has been shown that defensins are frequently induced in response to viral infection (268 - 270). Recent studies revealed that HD5 neutralizes JCPyV infection at early post entry step in the viral cycle by stabilizing the viral capsid and disturbance of JCPyV trafficking (271) . The same effect of HD5 has been observed for BKPyV. However, due to different receptors in comparison to JCPyV, disturbance of virus trafficking occurs at the entry level thereby preventing virus entry to the host cell (272) . In conclusion, only few studies have been performed to investigate innate immune responses to JCPyV and BKPyV (237, 242, 254, 271, 272) . Since both viruses, similarly to other polyomaviruses, have dsDNA as a genome, all above described DNA sensoring mechanism should be taken under consideration whilst speculation about the innate immunity to HPyV. The innate immune response makes a crucial contribution to the activation of adaptive immunity. The i nflammatory response increases the flow of lymph containing antigen and APCs into lymphoid tissues, while complement fragments on virus surface together with cells which have taken up the virus provide signals to activate lymphocytes, which receptors bind to presented antigens. 3.2.2 Adap tive Immune Response to Viral Infection The induction of the adaptive immune response is activated once the virus is ingested by immature dendritic cells (DCs) . These specialized phagocytic cells are localized in most tissues. The immature DCs carry receptors on its surface that recognize common features of many pathogens which enable DCs to engulf pathogen and degrade it intracellulary. When a DC takes up a pathogen in infected tissue, it becomes activated, and travels to a nearby lymph node. Viruses do not carry invariant molecules similar to those of bacteria and are rarely directly recognized by macrophages. However, viruses can still be taken up by 40 dendritic cells through nonreceptor -depending process. Antigens can then be presented to the lymphoc ytes (Fig. 13 ). Each naive lymphocyte entering the bloodstream bears antigen receptor of a single specificity. This specificity is determined by unique genetic mechanism that operates during lymphocyte development in the bone marrow and thymus to generate numerous different variants of the gen es encoding the receptor molecules. Lymphocytes undergo a process akin to natural selection and only those lymphocytes that encounter an antigen to which their receptor binds will be activated to proliferate and differentiate into effector cells. Clonal se lection of lymphocytes is the most important principle of adaptive immunity. The lymphocyte population comprises of th e thymus -derived lymphocytes (T lymphocytes), bone -marrow -derived the natural killer cells (NK cells). T-lymphocytes mediate the cellular immunity and require thymus to mature before being deployed to the peripheral lymphoid organs for further antigen -mediated differentiation. A small subset of the CD4+ cells, including natural regulatory cells and NK cells are already distinct differentiated cells on release from the thymus. CD4+ T cells , along with CD8+ T cells , comprise the majority of T -lymphocytes. CD4 T cells recognize approximately 17 amino acid peptides presented by APCs on MHC class II . After being activated and differentiated into distinct effector subtypes CD4+ T cells play a major role in mediating immune response through the secretion of specific cytokines. The CD4+ T cells carry out multiple functions, ranging from activation of the cells of the innate immune system, B -lymphocytes, cytotoxic T cells, as well as nonimmune cells, and also play critical role in the suppression of immune reaction. The subset of CD4+ helper T cells remaining in the lymphoid organ helps B lymphocytes to respond to the microbial antigens. CD8+ T cells are stimulated by 10 amino acid peptides on MHC class I molecule of APCs. As a result of clonal expansion, activated CD8+ T cells rapidly increase from virtually undetectable in the naive host to levels that are readily detectable. CD8+ T cells are typically cytotoxic and express enzymes such as perforin , granzym e and granulysin . After clearance of the virus CD8+ T cells dec line in number to a memory level. Memory CD8+ T cells may be present lifelong and are able to mount rapid, heightened responses to reinfection with the certain virus. 41 Figure 13 . Adaptive immune responses to viral infection. The critical event in antigen recognition by T cells is the manner the antigenic peptides are presented and thus recognized by the T cell receptor (TCR). The main molecules presenting antigen peptide are major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, di vided into two classes: MHC class I and II. They deliver peptides from two diverse intracellular compartments reflecting the origin of the antigen which is processed: either intracellular or taken up from the outside of the cell. MHC molecules are glycopro teins localized on the cell surface. These two classes of MHC molecules differ both in function, structure and cell distribution. While MHC class I is present on all nucleated cells, MHC class II are present mostly on specialized antigen -presenting cells. The MHC class I molecules bind peptides derived from virus -encoded proteins in a size of up to 10 amino acids in size . Such peptides are mainly formed thr ough degradation of cytosolic proteins by the proteasome and translocated to the ER by proteins called transporters associated with antigen processing -1 and -2 (TAP1 and TAP2) where they associate with MHC class I complex (273) . At this stage, the fully folded MHC class I -peptide complex is released from the TAP complex in the ER and is transported to the plasma membrane, where the peptides are presented to appropriate CD8+ T cells ( Fig. 14a ). The MHC class II molecules bind extracellular antigen s comprised of up to 17 amino acids. This occurs usually in specialized APC. Extracellular proteins are endocytosed and d ue to low 42 pH, endosomal and lysosomal proteases are activated and degrade the proteins into peptides, followed by their binding by MHC class II molecules. During their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, MHC class II molecules are covalently bound to a polypeptide called the invariant chain (274) . The invariant chain protects MHC class II molecule from binding unwanted peptide and targets the MHC class II -invariant chain complex to the endosomal compartment, where the invariant chain is replaced with the antigen peptide. The peptides are presented to CD4+ cells on the membrane surface of APC (Fig. 14b ). Thus, MHC class I -peptide complexes a ctivate CD8+ T cells committed to kill, while MHC class II-peptide complexes activate CD4+ T cells aimed at activating macrophages (Th1 cells) or B cells (Th2 cells). Figure 14. Different antigen -processing pathways for the MHC class I and class II molecules [from (275) ] However, dendritic cells can endocytose antigens from other cells and cross -present them to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Cross -presentation is of particular importance, because it permits the presentation of exogenous antigens, which are normally presented by MHC class II on the surface of infected dendritic cells to be also presented by MHC class I without infecting the den dritic cell. Cross -presentation allows the dendritic cell to avoid using the endogenous proteasomal processing pathway, which otherwise would divert cellular resources away from MHC class II presentation processes that present endogenous antigens after inf ection. Such a diversion could functionally impair the dendritic cell (Fig. 14c). 43 Another important lymphocytes are B cells , or bone marrow -derived lymphocytes . They comprise up to 20% of all circulating peripheral lymphocytes, but can be also found in bone marrow or other lymphoid tissues, including spl een, lymph nodes, and tonsils. Produ ced in the bone marrow B cells can migrate to the spleen and lymph nodes in order to mature and differentiate into immunocompetent B cells. B cell s are responsible for generating antibodies to specific antigens, which they bind via B cell receptors (BCR). Activation of B cells occurs through antigen recognition by BCRs and a required co -stimulatory, secondary activation signal from either helper T c ells or the antigen itself. This results in in B cell proliferation and formation of germinal centers where B cells differentiate into plasma cells or memory B cells. Importantly, all B cells derived from a specific progenitor B cell are clones that recogn ize the same antigen epitope. Plasma cells are found in the spleen and lymph nodes and are responsible for secreting different classes of clonally unique antibodies. Following the primary response, a small number of B cells develop into memory B cells, which express high -affinity surface immunoglobulins (mainly IgG), survive for a longer period of time, and enable a rapid secondary response. B cells are the only cells producing antibodies in order to mediate humoral response. Upon stimulation with viral antigen, B cells differentiate into plasma cells and secr ete large amounts of antibodies. The antibodies circulate in the bloodstream and permeate the other body fluids, where they specifically bind to the antigen of a pathogen and mark it for elimination by ph agocyt osis. After the response, some of the B cells differentiate into memory B cells, which are ready to rapid response in case of re -exposure to the viral antigen. The antibody response is most of the time directed to the structural proteins of the virus (276) . However, usually not all of the elicited antib odies have neutralizing activity, which inhibit the viral infection (277, 278) . Neutralization is often considered as the most efficient mode of antibody -mediated defense against viral infections. During neutralization antibodies interfere with virion in many different ways including blocking viral receptors, inhibiting uptake into cells, preventing uncoating of the genomes in endosomes, or causing aggregation of virus particles. All of these mechanisms lead to virus neutralization (Fig. 15 a). However, effector functions mediated by virus -specific non-neutralizing antibodies can also have a substantial impact on virus clearance (279, 280) . Non -neutralizing antibodies can still bind to the virus/infected cell and are able to lyse the virus/infected cell through activation of complement (complement -depende nt lysis) . Polymerization of specific activated complement components on a foreign cell or enveloped virus leads to the formation of pores. The lipid bilayer of the cell or (enveloped) virus is disrupted (281) (Fig. 15 b). 44 Antibodies can also cause opsonization, by which the marked virus is ingested and destr oyed by a phagocyte (282) (Fig. 15 c). Antibody -coated virus can be killed by a cytotoxic effector cell through a non -phagocytic process, characterized by the release of the content of cytotoxic granules or by the expression of cell death -inducing molecules (Fig. 15 d). Effector cells that mediate ADCC include natural kill er (NK) monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (283) . Figure 15 . Different antibody strategies to combat a virus [ modified from (276) ] 3.2.2.1 Adaptive Immune Response to HPyVs Polyomaviruses belong to the group of infectious non -self agen ts delivering PAMPs that are recognized by cell surface pattern recognition receptors PRRs on APC (192 -194, 196, 284) . T cell immunity to p olyomaviruses has been studied mostly for LTag and capsid protein VP1 (285 -297) . LTag is very suit able to examine due to its immunogenicity and capability to stimulate both T and B cell responses (298) . T cell responses to LT ag have been studied in selected healthy humans by stimulating isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC s) with purified SV40 LTag. Eventually all re sponded by T cell proliferation and T cell lines could have been established by LTag and nucleosome -LTag complexes (298, 299) . 45 Because LT ag from BK PyV, JC PyV and SV40 demonstrate approximately 75 % amino acid homology , it might be that the data obtained for SV40 LTag do not reflect a high incidence of SV40 infected individuals, but more likely that most indi viduals have cross -reactive LTag - specific memory T cells (298 -301) . The T cell responses were caused by CD4+ T cells, as demonstrated by a substantial decrease in proliferation upon adding human anti -CD4 antibodies to the cultures prior to antigenic stimulation and weak prolife ration reduction after anti -CD8 treatment (300) . Similar results have been observed in mice after immunization with SV40 LT ag (298) . The established CD4+ T cell lines had the potential to induce low level anti-LTag antibody production in vitro when cocultured with highly purified autologous B cells (302) . It has been reported that all of healthy BKPyV seropositive individuals had T cells proliferating in vitro as a response to antigens prepared from BK PyV- infected fibroblasts , whereas this was not the case for seronegative individuals (303) . It has been also reported that BKPyV replication in healthy individuals and in immunosuppressed patients is controlled by CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes (285, 297, 304) . A recent study investigated circulating BKPyV -specific T cells in healthy donors (HDs) by using VP1 antigen to BKPyV VP1 -specific T cells circulate in the peripheral blood at low levels. Moreover, they display a resting memory phenotype and are polyfunctional upon stimulation in terms of cytokines production (296) . These results consorts with lack o f the virus in the blood but virus presence in distal sites, urinary tract and kidneys, implying that circulating T cells are lacking BKPyV specific - stimulation for large periods of time. Additional in vitro studies showed that pulsing of monocyte -derived dendritic cells with inactivated BKPyV or peptide pools covering either structural or regulatory BKP yV proteins results in generati on of cells (305, 306) . Those BKPyV -specific cells displayed both production of cytokines and cytotoxic activit y. It has been reported that both VP1 and LTag responses are significantly hi gher in KTRs in comparison to healthy individuals (285, 307) . Overall CD8+ T cell responses were identified as LTag -specific rather than VP1-specific (285) . In the same study, JCPyV VP1 and immune re sponses were investigated in JCPyV -seropositive KTRs and showed that in vitro stimulation with BKPyV VP1 peptides induce limited JCPyV VP1 responses. However, similar responses to BKPyV LTag and JCPyV LTag were observed after in vitro stimulation with BKPyV LTag peptides, suggesting that BKPyV - and JCPyV - specific immune responses mediated by LTag are more conserved among HPyVs than those mediated by VP1 (285) . Furthermore, LTag -specific immune responses have been shown to be correlated with the recovery from viremia in KTRs (291) . This comes along with results from more recent study 46 where BKPyV -specific immunity to structural and non -structural BKPyV proteins at different phases of BKPyV reactivation was studied in KTRs (308) . T cells specific for non-structural proteins such as LTag were detected earlie r than T cells specific for structural proteins, and appearance of T cells specific for non -structural proteins correlates with recovery from BKPyV reactivation. T herefore, immunity to non -structural proteins, and not to structural proteins, are thought to be a reliable marker of recovery from BKPyV viremia (308) . The presence lymphocytes among healthy and immunocompetent to protect from PML development (309 -312) . It has been also shown that CD8+ T cell response was significantly lower in PML progressors in comparison to survivors (313) . Additionally , an early detection of JCPyV -specific CD8+ T cells in PML patients seems to be associated with a better outcome and eventual higher survival (314, 315) . Among multiple sclerosis patients, it has been shown that natalizu mab treatment preventing T cell homing to the brain does not impair peripheral JCPyV -specific T cells responses and even increase JCPyV -specific memory or effector responses in some patients after 12 months of therapy (316) . The presence of CD4+ T cells seems to be necessary for an efficient immune control of PML (313) . Individuals with low CD4+ T cell numbers, including HIV-AIDS patients or individuals with idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia , have a higher risk of developing PML and a lower survival rate (310, 315, 317) . Estimated 1 -year survival was 48% in HIV+ patients with PML with CD4 count less than 200/\u00b5l at PML diagnosis compared to 67% in those with CD4 more than 200/\u00b5l (315) . Nevertheless , PML does not affect all HIV patients with very low CD4+ T cells counts (90). Surprisingly, individuals with a low CD4+ T cell activity show ed very strong humoral response against JCPyV. This phenomenon might be explained either by a T cell -independent virus -specific antibody production or by the establishment of B cell memory directly after primary infection (310, 318) . Cellular immune responses directed against the VP2 and VP3 capsid proteins and regulatory (sTag, Agno) proteins have also been investigated (296, 307, 308, 319 -321) . It has been demonstrated that VP2 , VP3 and sTag proteins are targets of JCPyV and BKPyV -specific immune responses in healthy donors, KTRs and PyVAN patients . Moreover, memory T cells directed against VP1, VP2, VP3, LTag and sTag have been detected in BKPyV -seropositive KTRs (307) . In the same study, memory T cells specific for VP3 were found to be more prevalent than memory T cells specific for the other BKPyV proteins in patients with a PyVAN history (307) . Despite the high expression of Agno, it seems to be ignored by the immune system, since o nly 15% of HDs and 7.5% of KTRs are Agno seropositive . 47 3.3 Antibody Assays for Studying Adaptive Humoral Immunity to JC and BK Polyomaviruses 3.3.1 Technical Aspects of JCPyV and BKPyV Antibody Assays The detection of JCPyV - or BKPyV -specific antibodies can be accomplished by different techniques . Hemagglutination assay (HA) utilizes ability of JCPyV and BKPyV to bind to sialic acid structures; virus binds to sialic acid residues on RBCs and forms a lattice (hemagglutination) and can be used for rapid determinatio n of level of virus in a sample. RBCs which are not bound by virus precipitate to the bottom of the well. However, the RBCs bound by the virus form a lattice. The titer of the virus is calculated as the highest dilution at which virus causes hemagglutination. The HA can be modified in order t o investigate level of antibodies to JCPyV or BKPyV in a serum sample. The basis of hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) is that antibodies against the virus will prevent attachment of the virus to RBCs resulting in hemagglutination inhibition. The high est preventing hemagglutination is called hemagglutination inhibition titer. However, HAI fails to detect JCPyV with mutations characteristic for PML. Virus 269F and 269Y mutations cannot agglutinate RBCs of the mutants, e.g. 60E, 265D and 271H, hemagglutination is still possible but at much lower level . Moreover, another disadvantage is a need of removal of unspecific inhibitors from sera prior testing . For neutralization test a serum sample is mixed with a viral suspension and incubated to allow the anti bodies to react with the virus, followed by plating the mixture on virus - susceptible cells. Depending on the virus, the results of the neutralizing test can be examin ed in different ways, including direct microscopic examination for evidenc e of viral cytopathic effect, immunofluorescent staining or reduction of plaque numbers. A modified virus neutralization assay, called the log serum neutralization index (LNI), can also be used to evaluate the potential of a serum specimen to neutralize virus infectivity. In this test concentration of serum stays constant while the challenge dose of the virus is increased. The advantage of this method is that it measures the capacity of a serum to protect from virus infection because serum is usually being tested undiluted. However, because the used serum is undiluted, routinely securing volume s of serum sufficient to perform this test is difficult and mitigates against general implementation of this assay . Moreover there is a 48 need to remove non -specific inhibitors which naturally occurring in sera, to standardize antigen each time a test is per formed, and the need for specialized expertise in proper reading the test results (322) . The current enzyme -linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA s) for JCPyV and BKPyV are usually based on either LTag or VP1 (31, 285, 302, 323 -326) . VP1 can be used as antigen in in a form of monomer s, pentamer s, or virus -like particle s (VLP s) (2, 99, 327 -329) . Alike for BK PyV, there are curren tly no data comparing JCPyV HAI, anti -VP1, anti -VLP, and anti -LTag responses, except from experimental tumor exposure models (320, 325, 328, 330) . However , it can be presumed that the high -level JCPyV antibody responses are directed against the viral capsid protein s due to their abundance and repetitive structure (325, 331) . Moreover, based on the reports for BKPyV, some responses to sTag can be expected (90, 325) . In healthy individuals , these anti -N-terminal Tag responses are hidden in the background signals, but m ight become detectable after high -level PyV replication or from PyV -associated tumor formation (325, 330, 332, 333) . Some studies have co mpared HAI and VLP -based ELISA for structural protein antibodies , but it becomes clear that the assays are not equivalent with respect to their immunological and clinical implications (334) . A low percentage of tested samples showed low H AI antibody titers and high ELISA antibody titers to JCPyV or BKPyV (335) . The reasons for these discordant results are unknown. However, it could be that antibody responses to epitopes other than those involved with H AI or to strain differences between the virus initiating an infection and that used in antibody assays. The major points of each antibody testing include: (1) choice, prep aration, and the purity of antigens; (2) background reactivity; (3) definition of analytically significant and clinically relevant results ; (4) detection and interpretation of different antibody classes and subclasses ; (5) selection of most appropriate testing method ; (6) appropriate cutoff to define positive and negative test results; and (7) sensitivity and specificity influenced by conformation of the epitopes (2, 71) . The c hoice of antigen and background reactivity has an impact on assay specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, the source of PyV virions or the recombinant viral antigens may impact the serological background activity as a result of preparative impurities from a n expression system of choice. Discrimination of seropositive and serone gative samples is highly depende nt on sensitivity and specificity of the assay and the appropriate cutoff. Sensitivity is the probability that the test result will be positive wh en the disease is present (true -positive rate). Whereas specificity is the probability that the test result will be negative when t he disease is not 49 present (true -negative rate). A false -positive result occurs when the assay indicates the disease , although the disease is not present. Whereas a false -negative result occurs when the assay indicates the absence of disease, although the disease is present. ELISA with low sensitivity or too low cutoff may result in false -positive readouts, whereas low specificity and too high cutoff - in false -negative readouts. This might be detrimental by underestimating disease risk (in c ase of false -negative serology result) or unnecessary withhold of the immunosuppressive therapy (in false -positive serology result) . The antigen conformation is another important aspect of proper antibody testing. In recent years serology based on virus -like particles in enzyme immunoassays (ELISA) has become widely used in many viral systems, including polyomavirus infections (2, 14, 337) . 3.3.2 Virus -Like Particles as the Antigen in Antibody Assays Virus -like particles (VLPs) are multisubunit self -assembling protein structures with identical or highly related overall structure to their corresponding native viruses (338) . After the first demonstration of the polyomavirus VP1 self -assembling into VLPs in the absence of viral genetic material, VLPs have been produced from a broad spectrum of enveloped and non - enveloped viruses. Until now more than 110 VLPs have been constructed from viruses belonging to 35 different families (339) . The interest in VLPs has significantly increased due to the successful development and introduction of HBV surface antigen and HPV capsid protein L1 as commercial vaccines against HBV and HPV -induced cervical cancer, respectively (340, 341) . The recent reports describe high immunogenicity of VLPs via B cell activation and production of antibodies against the viral motifs presented on VLP surface (342, 343) . In addition, due to a small size VLPs can be taken up by antigen -presenting cells and degraded, which ultima tely leads to T cell activation (344) . Moreover, due to their s ymmetric and highly repetitive structure , VLPs are capable of inducing strong humoral and cellular immune responses even in the absen ce of frequ ently used adjuvants (344) . Furthermore, particular attention has recently been given to the development of new nanomaterial s. This new area, called bionanotechnology, employs ideas and methodologies from biology, chem istry, physics, and engineering (345). VLPs can be produced by several expression systems (339) . More than half of these systems employ bacterial or insect cells, other systems use yeasts (20%), mammalian (15%) or plant cells (9%) (339) . Bacterial systems are mostly based on Escherichia coli strains. E. coli systems , based on 50 vector transformation, are generally accepted and widely used technology for VLP productio n (346) . However, such a system has s everal disadvantages including inability to perform post -translational modifications of recombinant protein , their inability to generate the proper disulfide bonds, protein solubility problems, and the presence of endotoxins in the preparations of recombinant proteins (339, 341) . In contrast to bacteria, yeasts are able to introduce post -translational modifications of proteins, including glycosylation, phosphorylation , acetylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation (347, 348) . Different yeast systems have been used for the construction of numerous VLPs. Unfortunately , they are more complex than E. coli systems because yeast shuttle -vectors have to be prepared first in bacteria and only then introduced to the yeast cells as plasmid vectors. Moreover, yeast -based systems provide only 30% of the properly folded protein yield obtained in E. coli (347, 348) . Plant systems could be a cost -effective and scalable alternative for the production of different VLPs in comparison to above mentioned bact eria- and yeast -based systems. One of the most effective plant expression systems is based on the Agrobacterium (339) . It has been shown that tobacco and potato plants can be successfully used in p roduction of HPV VLPs (349) . Also transgenic tobacco has been successfully utilized for HBs antigen and HBc antigen VLPs (350, 351) . More than half of all of the recombinant proteins in the pharmaceutical industry are produced in different mammalian cell lines (339) . Alternatively, much simpl er in setup i nsect cell-based system has become common for VLPs expression on laboratory or industrial scale. The latter is characterized by the capacity for large -scale VLP production , fast growth rates in serum -free media, and possible post -translational modifications similar to mammalian cells. Baculovirus e xpression system s enable generation of recombinant baculoviruses in order to express the protein of interest in insect cell culture ( Fig. 1 6). The method is based on site - specific transposition of an expression cassette into a baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid) propagated in E. coli. The system comprises of: (1) pFastBac donor plasmid allowing generation of expression construct containing the gene of inte rest under control of a baculovirus -specific promoter; (2) E. coli host strain containing baculoviru s shuttle vector (bacmid) and helper plasmid, and allow ing generation of recombinant bacmid by transposition the pFastBac expression construct; (3) Sf9 Spodoptera frugiperda cells in a liquid culture. After successful transposition , the high molecular weight recombinant bacmid DNA is isola ted and used for transfection into insect cells. After generation of a recombinant baculovirus stock, it can be used to infect insect Sf9 cells for large -scale 51 expression of the recombinant protein of interest. Figure 16 . Generation of recombinant baculovirus and expression of gene of interest using baculovirus expression system and Sf9 insect cells by electron microscopy and functionally by mediating hemagglutination and host cell binding (71, 335) . These specific properties cannot, or can only partly, be mimicked by VP1 monomers and pentamers, respectively. Study on antibody responses in kidney transpla nt patients revealed significantly higher IgG ELISA levels for BKPyV VLPs in comparison to BKPyV VP1 monomers (352) . In the same study t he importance of the three - dimensional antigen structure was experimentally confirmed by denaturation, which caused a drop in anti -BKPyV VLP E LISA levels , whereas anti-BKPyV VP1 levels were hardly affected (352) . This indicates that the respective antibody binding activitie s are distinguishable in humans and suggests a lower sensitivity and specificity for VP1 compared with VLPs (352). There is a greater potential for VP1 monomers and pentamers to detect cross -reacting antibodies. It has been shown indirectly by western blot on GST and GST -VP1 fusion proteins of BKPyV and JCPyV by using hyperimmune rabbit serum against BKPyV . Rabbit 52 showed strong cross -reactivity with GST -JCPyV VP1 fusion protein, and vice versa , anti -JCPyV VLP rabbit serum reacted also with GST - BKPyV VP1 chimeric protein (353) . In conclusion, although seroprevalence determined with VLP -based E LISA suggest the absence of cross - between or assays applying monoclonal antibodies (353) . VP1 cross -reactivity may therefore complicate a routine interpretation of serological re sults and demand additional confirm atory experiments (354) . 53 4 Aims of the Thesis The aims of the thesis are: 1. Use of virus -like particles as a tool to study the fate of primary JCPyV and BKPyV viremia . 2. Optimization detection . 3. Development of preadsorption to precisely define JCPyV and BKPyV IgG serostatus for samples with ambiguous ELISA results . 4. Application of optimized JCPyV/BKPyV VLP -based ELISA in clinical case studies . 5. Investigation of prognostic value of ELISA utilizing as antigen either BKPyV VP1 VLPs or BKPyV LTag . 54 5 Results 5.1 Efficient Uptake of Blood -Borne BK and JC Polyomavirus -Like Particles in Endothelial Cells of Liver Sinusoids and Renal Vasa Recta The renourinary tract is a well -known major persistence site for JCPyV and BKPyV. However, the initial routes of primary infection with both viruses are not well defined . Also , the fate of JCPyV and BKPyV primary viremia are unclear . JCPyV and BKPyV replication is highly specific to the human host which precludes studies of those viruses in anima l model. However, 2,6 - linked and 2,3 -linked sialic acid structures serving as receptors for JCPyV and BKPyV, respectively, are commonly found in vertebrates, including mice. Therefore we decided to use a mous e model to investigate the fate of BKPyV and JCPyV in peripheral blood and their cellular site of uptake. Under these circumstances the mouse model simulates a non- immune host. We utilized JCPyV and BKPyV virus -like par ticles (VLPs) as a model system for native JCPyV and BKPyV, respectively. VLPs are multisubunit protein structures with identical overall structure to their corresponding native viruses. It is known that overexpression of major capsid protein 1 (VP1) of either JCPyV or BKPyV leads to self -assembly into VLPs, which recapitulate the three -dimensional morphology of native virus. Four different VLPs were used in the study : (1) JCPyV last two carry mutations in VP1 which have been found exclusively in patients with PML. These amino acid substitutions close to binding sites for sialic acid struct ures enable viral interactions with cellular receptors and hence viral infectivity . Moreover, both mutants lack the ability to trigger hemagglutination which suggests that L55F and S269F mutations may influence the cell tropism of JCPyV in human by abrogat ing the ability to bind to sialylated molecules on a variety of peripheral cell types. Therefore we investigated if the distribution and clearance of JCPyV L55F -VP1 VLPs and to JCPyV wild - type -VP1 VLPs. 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 In conducted study, w e observed distribution of b oth JCPyV VLPs and BKPyV VLPs mostly in the liver, but also at lower level in kidney and spleen. Moreover, liver uptake was predominantly observed in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in tissue distribution between wild -type JCPyV VLPs and JCPyV the blood half -time was similar for all of them. With a view to the lack of sialic acid bindi ng activity in mutant VLPs, this indicates involvement of other non-sialic acid receptors in cellular uptake. While all types of JCPyV VLPs were almost completely removed from the circulation within 10 minutes, it took significa ntly longer time for BKPyV VLPs. This suggests either higher stability of BKPyV VLPs in compari son to 3 variants of JCPyV or a rapid saturation of BKPyV binding receptors . Another reason for a delay of BKPyV VLPs clearance from the blood could be unspecific interaction s of BKPy V VLPs with blood factors . To maintain signature scavenging activity LSECs rely on clathrin - mediated endocytosis . It is also known that i n natural host cells BKPyV is internalized via caveolin clathrin -mediated endocytosis . Thi s could also explain the higher blood half -time for BKPyV VLPs in comparison to JCPyV VLPs. Further studies would be require d to establish whether JCPyV or BKPyV uptake in LSECs would lead to destruction of all internalized virus particles. Additionally, a better understanding of LSEC -mediated polyomavirus clearance could lead to better understanding of development mechanism of polyomavirus -associated diseases. This may also allow to develop the strategies to arrest this process for immunocompromised subje cts at risk of high -level polyomavirus replication. Another important subject would be to investigate organ distribution, LSEC uptake and clearance of VLPs preincubated with either murine or human antibodies and to compare them with non -preincubated VLPs. Due to morphological identity with authentic virus, virus -like particles are widely used as an antigen to detect virus -specific antibodies. Numerous studies showed that use of VLPs, rather than VP1 monomers or pentamers, for detection of specific antibodies makes the testing more sensitive and specific. Therefore majority of serological tests, including enzyme -linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) utilize VLPs as the antigen. 72 5.2 Inter - and Intralaboratory Comparison of JC Polyomavirus Antibody Testing Using Two Different Virus -Like Particle -Based Assays Because of more frequent application of immunosuppression, the risk of developing JCPyV - and BKPyV -associated (PML for BKPyV) has increased drasti cally in the last decades. The risk of PML development is estimated to be 100-fold higher for JCPyV -seropositive patients in comparison to JCPyV -seronegatives. Most cases of PyVAN and PyVHC have been tested as positive for BKPyV at the moment of disease diagnosis. Moreover, positive JCPyV or BKPyV serostatus indicates not only past exposure, but also viral persistence which is associated with a risk of high -level viral replication in case of immunosuppression. Therefore, investigation of JCPyV and BKPyV infection has been receiving significantly more attention. However, correct identification of IgG positive and negative results could be problematic due to lack of universal standar dized ELISA procedure . In conducted study we reviewed and optimized virus -like particle (VLP) -based ELISA for JCPyV IgG detection . Moreover we developed the preadsorption inhibition assay in order to precisely define JCPyV serostatus for samples with ambiguous ELISA results. 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 Validation and optimization of VLP -based ELISA was performed by investigation of JCPyV - specific IgG response in 400 healthy blood donors. The same set of samples was in parallel tested in independent ELISA in Helsinki. Comparison of both data sets revealed discordance for 10% samples, which showed low IgG activity close to respective cutoffs of the assays. By introduction of normalization of result s the overall assay performance has improved, resulting in decrease of discordance rate. To precisely define JCPyV serostatus for samples with discordant ELISA results, we developed a preadsorption inhibition assay. Decrease in IgG activity has been measured after preincubation with JCPyV VLPs in solution. The 35% decrease in the signal has been determined as the cutoff for the preadsorption ihibition assay. Moreover, we also after preadsorption with BKPyV VLPs and therefore excluded impact of cross -reactive antibodies in tot al JCPyV IgG signal. In conclusion, we confirmed that VLP -based ELISA with normalization step can serve as a reliable tool for JCPyV IgG serology. Additionally, the preadsorption assay can help with unequivocal determination of JCPyV serostatus for sample s with low IgG levels close to cutoff . For testing of sera with unknown JCPyV IgG serostatus the following points should be taken under consideration: (1) sample should be tested at least in duplicate; (2) normalization using reference serum should be alwa ys performed - additional quality control, when the expected sign al for reference serum is known; (3) sample with low IgG activity close to cutoff should be additionally tested in preadsorption inhibition assay; (4) training of a person performing the test ing would be beneficial. 82 5.3 Optimizing JC and BK Polyomavirus IgG Testing for Seroepidemiology and Patient Counseling In the previous study 10% of VLP -based ELISA results were discordant in the interlaboratory comparison with results from independent ELISA testing. All of them showed low IgG activity against JCPyV VLPs. To avoid misinterpretation of serostatus for samples with low antibody responses, we reinvestigated the performance of our optimized VLP -based ELISA by investigation of serum sample at 100 -, 200- and 400 -fold serial dilutions, in contrast to only one 400 -fold dilution used in the previous study. Moreover, we adapted our ELISA for BKPyV IgG detection, by utilizing BKPyV VLPs as a coating antigen. 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 With this study we presented that also BKPyV VLPs can be utilized in our normalized ELISA for BKPyV IgG detection. By testing 400 healthy donor samples at 100 -, 200 and 400 -fold dilutions we showed, that 100 -fold dilution provides the highest sensitivity f or both JCPyV and BKPyV testings and no false -negative results. Taking this dilution and supporting it with preadsorption inhibition assay might be the most suitable for testing individual patients. Although at 200 -fold serum dilution sensitivity went down to 98.3% and stayed at 100% for BKPyV IgG, the best trade -off between sensitivity and specificity was achieved. Thus, 200 -fold dilution in normalized VLP-based ELISA might be the most appropriate for seroepidemiological studies of large samp le size. 400 -fold serum dilution might give first approximation of high and low JCPyV and BKPyV IgG levels. Of note, specificity was equal to 100%, whereas sensitivity decreased to 87% - 89%. Depending on the results, preadsorption reduction assays could b e applied to low -level antibody sear in order to rule out false - positives. Although we showed that normalized ELISA is a specific and sensitive assay for detection of antibodies ag ainst either JCPyV or BKPyV, officially approved reference serum is needed in order to enhance reproducibility and permit clarification of PyV serology potential in clinical practice. In immunocompetent individuals JCPyV or BKPyV infection is not definite and may be subclinical or un specific. Both viruses can cause serious diseases only when immune functions are impaired. This applies to immunocompromised patients, i ncluding those with HIV-AIDS and patients with hematologic malignancies , solid cancers , transplantation, and autoi mmune diseases treated with immunomodulators . Among these patients the risk of high -level JCPyV or BKPyV replication, followed by development of PyV -associated disease, is higher because their immune control fails to control viral replication. The most com mon disease caused by JCPyV is PML, whereas two most common BKPyV -associated diseases are PyVAN and PyVHC. Unfortunately there is currently no specific antiviral therapy for any of those and treatment is usually focused on regaining immune functions controlling virus replication. Therefore, sensitive and specific testing for antibodies against JCPyV and BKPyV in immunocompromised individuals is needed. The following 4 case report studies cover examples of immunocompromised individuals undergoing the treatment with different immunosuppressive drugs. Normalized ELISA was utilized to investigate their JCPyV and BKPyV serostatus in order to support the diagnosis of PyV -associated diseases. 90 5.4 Progressive Multif ocal Leukoencephalopathy in Common Variable Immunodeficiency: Mitigated Course Under Mirtazapine and Mefloquine 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 5.5 A Case of Primary JC Polyomavirus Infection -Associated Nephropathy 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 5.6 BK Polyomavirus -Specific Cellular Immune Responses Are Age -Dependent and Strongly Correlate With Phases of Virus Replication 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 5.7 Diffuse Gastrointestinal Bleeding and BK Polyomavirus Replication in a Pediatric Allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Patient 120 121 122 123 Our normalized VLP -based ELISA was applied to investigate anti-JCPyV and anti-BKPyV antibodies in clinical case studies : (1) Patient with definitive diagnosis for PML showed positive JCPyV IgG serostatus , which was in line with other PML symptoms including high level of JCPyV DNA detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) , NCCR mutations characteristic for PML and brain lesions shown by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . However in this case positive JCPyV IgG serosta tus might be unreliable since the patient has regularly received intravenous immunoglobulins (IvIgG). Two years after PML on set, the patient is still alive. (2) Asymptomatic JCPyV viral shedding occurs in up to 30% of human population. However, only few re ports describe JCPyV as a cause of PyVAN. This is the first case report study of JCPyV -VAN. Normalized JCPyV VLP -based ELISA was used for detection of anti -JCPyV IgG and IgM. Testing has been performed at several time points after kidney transplantation. Y oung boy was clearly seronegative and demonstrated a seroconversion first for IgM and followed by IgG, which indicates primary infection. The poor outcome of this case highlights the potential importance of JCPyV serostatus in pediatric and adolescent KT r ecipients. Our case underlines the li mitations of current guidelines and proves that blood JCPyV DNA findings are not reliable. Further studies and better understanding are needed to optimize the management of JCPyV -associated nephropathy and the potential role of JCPyV and BK PyV serology for donor and recipient. (3) T esting of 122 immunocompetent and 63 immunocompromised patients demonstrated age dependency of BKPyV IgG level, with the highest values between 20 and 30 years . Also maximum levels of specifi c CD4 T cells has been observed for the same age rang , and thereafter progressively decreased to below detection limit in most of the older age groups. This correlation suggests an increased vulnerability of older kidney transplant recipients to BKPyV -replication. Whereas BKPyV -specific CD4 T cells of immunocompetent individuals exhibited a multifunctional phenotype expressing several cytokines in response to stimulation, kidney transplant patients with BKPyV -associated complications showed a significant lo ss of multifunctional CD4 T cells. These results indicate the particular need for intact T cell functionality to control BKPyV replication. Despite quantitative similarities, young adults and patients with complications differ ed in functional characteristi cs of BKPyV - specific immunity. Th erefore , cytokine profiling may be important as a tool for discrimination of immunologically controlled BKPyV -infection from uncontrolled virus replication and therefore could serve as risk predictor of PyVAN development . 124 (4) Pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient was tested as positive for BKPyV IgG antibodies, which was in accordance with a significant BKPyV viruria and viremia and start of PyVHC. Gastrointestinal complications with bleeding are a significant problem after allogeneic HSCT with viral infections including BKPyV. Massive BK PyV viremia has been associated with PyVHC which can result in other replicat ion foci including the GI tract. This has to be taken under consideration in future stu dies. 125 5.8 Antibody Response to BK Polyomavirus as a Prognostic Biomarker and Potential Therapeutic Target in Prostate Cance r VLPs composed of VP1 and LTag are currently the most common antigens to detect specific anti-JCPyV and anti -BKPyV antibodies. Both proteins are good ELISA antigen candidates due to their immunogenicity and capability to stimulate B cell responses . Therefore we decided to use both proteins as antigens in ELISA for screening of BKPyV IgG response among 226 patients und ergoing radical prostatectomy from primary prostate cancer. With this, we investigated whether the preoperative antibody responses to BKPyV LTag or VP1 were associated with the risk of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 Testing of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy from primary prostate cancer for antibodies against BKPyV LTag and VP1 revealed no association between BKPyV VP1 antibody level and the ris k of prostate cancer recurrence. That was in contrast to anti-LTag response correlating with the clinical course of prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy. Due to oncogenic activity of LTag the increased antibody activity against LTag would be expected in cases with high risk of biochemical recurre nce. This study underlines how important is the choice of appropriate antigen in order to give a correct answer to assigned study question. 138 6 Discussion Although JCPyV and BKPyV infections are usually asymptomatic, both viruses can lead to serious diseases in patients with immune response impairment. JCPyV can cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients with HIV -AIDS, malignancies or autoimmune diseases under immunosuppressive treatment. Whereas increased BKPyV replication can induce polyomavirus -associated nephropathy (PyVAN) in recipients or hemorrhagic cystitis (PyVHC) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Due to more frequent application of immunosuppression, the risk of developing these diseas es has increased drastically in the last few decades. Therefore, investigation of JCPyV and BKPyV infection has been receiving significantly more attention. This thesis addresses the following aspects: 1. Use of virus like particles as a tool to study the fate and innate immune response to primary JCPyV and BKPyV viremia. 2. Optimization of VLP -based ELISA for JCPyV BKPyV IgG detection. 3. Development of preadsorption inhibition precisely define JCPyV and BKPyV IgG serostatus for sampl es with ambiguous ELISA result. 4. Application of optimized JCPyV/BKPyV VLP -based ELISA in clinical case studies. 5. Investigation of prognostic value of ELISA utilizing either BKPyV VP1 VLPs or BKPyV LTag JCPyV and BKPyV inf ection are currently lacking. Their initial infection route and organ distribution are also not understood. Following respiratory or gastrointestinal transmission, JCPyV and BKPyV colonize the renourinary tract - the major site of persistence. To reach the renourinary tract, a viremic phase has been postulated, but the fate of JCPyV and BKPyV primary viremia is currently unknown. Like most of HPyV s, JCPyV and BKPyV replication is highly specific to the human host, which preclude s studies of virus replication in animal models. However, the 2,6 -linked and 2,3 -linked sialic acid receptors used and BKPyV , respectively, are widespread in vertebrates, including mice. Therefore we decided to study the fate of BKPyV and JCPyV VLPs in blood and t heir cellular site of uptake in a mouse model (Simon -Santamaria et al., p. 54 ). Four different VLPs in major capsid protein 1 (VP1) which have been found exclusively in patients with PML (97). These 139 substitutions affect amino acids located at or close to bindin g sites for sialic acid structures, which enables viral interactions with cellular receptors and hence viral infectivity (98). Moreover, both mutants, in contrast to wild -type VLPs, lack the ability to trigger hemagglutination. This might suggest that L55F and S269F mutations may influence the cell tropism of JCPyV in human by abrogating the ability to bind to sialylated molecule s on a variety of peripheral cell types, but retain the ability to bind CNS glial cells (99). By using above -mentioned VLPs, which are a good model system for virions, we observed that the effective clearance of both JCPyV and BKPyV takes place in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) (2, 355) . JCPyV VLPs and BKPyV VLPs cleara nce patterns were observed. While JCPyV VLPs were almost completely removed from the circulation within 10 minutes, it took significantly longer time for BKPyV VLPs, suggesting either higher stability of BKPyV VLPs in comparison to 3 variants of JCPyV VLPs , a rapid saturation of BKPyV binding receptors or interaction of BKPyV VLPs with blood factors, delaying the blood clearance. Moreover, in natural host cells BKPyV is reported to be internalized via . This could also be an explanation of our results, because LSECs rely on clathrin -mediated endocytosis to maintain their signature scavenging activity. Despite this efficient clearance mechanism, VLPs still reached the kidney and were efficiently taken up in some microvessels of renal medulla and the spleen marginal zone reticuloendothelium, suggesting a role in viremic organ tropism. It suggests that LSECs may play a key role in the mostly asymptomatic course of primary JCPyV and BKPyV infection, leaving only little virus to escape and reach the renal medulla and possibly the spleen, an important site of viruses persistence. For two PML mutants, L55F and S269F, blood half -life and tissue distribution of VLPs were similar to the wild -type VLPs , which indicate the involvement of non -sialic acid receptors in cellular uptake. Further studies would be require to establish whether JCPyV or B KPyV uptake in LSECs would lead to destruction of all internalized virus particles, or allow for endosomal escape and intracellular replication of a fraction of the internalized virions. Additionally, a better understanding of LSEC -mediated polyomavirus cl earance may shed light into the role of these cells in the development of polyomavirus -associated diseases. This may also allow developing the strategies to harness this process for immunocompromised subjects at risk of high -level polyomavirus replication. In the next part of the thesis we focused on validation and optimization of virus -like particle (VLPs) -based testing for JCPyV - and BKPyV -specific IgG (Kardas et. al., p. 72 ). 140 The diagnosis of JCPyV or BKPyV infection can employ detection of either viral DNA or specific antiviral antibodies. However, it has been shown previously that in some cases DNA detection is not enough sensitive indicator of viral infection, including examples of PML patients with no detectable JCPyV DNA in urine and blood samples o r individuals with undetectable urinary JCPyV shedding, albeit with JCPyV -specific 358) . Therefore JCPyV and BKPyV serology has become the critical first choice analysis to classify patients exposed to both viruses. It is also receiving increasing attention as potential predictors of the risk of polyomavirus -associated diseases. Despite the obvious advantages of neutralization, ELISA has become the most common serological testing for detection of JCPyV - and BKPyV -specific antibodies. It usually uses viral capsid protein 1 (VP1) as the antigen for detection of specific anti -JCPyV and anti -BKPy V antibodies. VP1 can be used in the form of monomers, pentamers or VLPs (2). However, it has been confirmed tha t utilizing VLPs in ELISA makes the assay more sensitive and specific in comparison to ELISA using VP1 either in monomer or pentamer form (2, 325, 359) . The positive JCPyV or BKPyV serostatus indicates not only past exposure, but also viral persistence and the associated risk of high -level replication in case of immune function impairment, resulting eventually in PyV disease (71, 90, 317, 360) . Unfortunately correct identification of IgG positive and negative results could be problematic due to lack of universal standardized ELISA procedure, differences in antigen preparation and serum dilutions, empirically derived cutoffs, and lack of WHO -approved international reference serum. During validation and optimization of virus -like particle (VLPs) -based testing for JCPyV - and BKPyV -specific IgG we demonstrated that although no statistically significant differences in intraassay and interassay variability were revealed for JCPyV serology of 400 -fold diluted sera from 400 healthy donors, qualitative differences were seen in the identifica tion of the individual JCPyV serostatus (Kardas et. al., p. 72 ). By interlaboratory comparison of our ELISA result with results obtained in independent VLP -based assay in Helsinki, discordant JCPyV IgG results have been observed for 10% samples. The discor dance resulted from sera with a low IgG activity close to the cutoffs of both assays. Performance of normalization to a reference serum was shown to improve the overall assay performance by reducing the rate of discordance. Since the discordances in this l ow OD range could still be caused by false - positive (e.g. cross -reactive) or false -negative ( e.g. low IgG) results, we developed preadsorption assay to better verify the serostatus of discordant samples. By reduction in JCPyV IgG activity after preincubati on with JCPyV VLPs and cutoff of 35%, we were able to 141 solve the serostatus for previously discordant samples. Importantly, we also excluded BKPyV antibody cross -reactivity by testing JCPyV IgG IgG inhibition at low 8% level. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that serological assays for JCPyV IgG need to take under consideration whether epidemiological questions or individual risk assessm ents are to be addressed. We confirmed that VLP -based ELISA with normalization step can serve as a reliable tool for JCPyV IgG serology. Additionally, the preadsorption assay can help with unequivocal determination of JCPyV serostatus for samples with low IgG levels . Further, we reinvestigated the performance of our normalized VLP -based assay and adapted it to BKPyV IgG detection (Kardas et al., p. 82 ). To find the best testing conditions, each serum from 400 healthy blood donors was tested at 100 -, 200 - and 400 -fold dilutions. We observed that 1:200 dilution provided the best trade -off between sensitivity and specificity with respective values being 98.3% and 97.5% for JCPyV IgG, Thus, the 1:200 dilution in the normalized ELI SA format might be the most appropriate for seroepidemiological studies when large sample size is considered. The 1:100 dilution provided the highest sensitivity for JCPyV and BKPyV IgG detection and no false -negative results. If combined with preadsorptio n reduction for confirmation, this approach might be the most suitable for individual patient counseling. The 1:400 dilution can provide first approximation of higher and lower JCPyV - and BKPyV -specific IgG levels. As relative antibody levels and their cha nge over time should be explored in clinical settings, this dilution seems to be appropriate for specific clinical setting including intrathecal antibodies or pretransplant serology (105, 361, 362) . With this study w e showed that for seroepidemiology studies, normalized JCPyV and BKPyV IgG ELISA at 1:200 serum dilution provides optimal sensitivity and specificity with the lowest false -positive and false -negative rate. However, for individual risk assessment, 100 -, 200 -, and 400 -fold dilutions combined with preadsorption for low - reactive sera might be the most appropriate. Next, our normalized VLP-based ELISA was applied to investigate JCPyV and BKPyV seroprevalence in clinical case studies : (1) positive JCPyV IgG serostatus for PML patient was in line with other PML symptoms including high level of JCPyV DNA detected i n cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), NCCR mutations characteristic for PML and brain lesions shown by magnetic resonance imag ing (MRI) (Kurmann et al., p. 90 ); (2) positive JCPyV IgG and IgM and negative BKPyV IgG and IgM serostatus for a boy a fter kidney transplantation confirmed the diagnosis of JCPyV -associated nephropat hy (L autenschlager et al., p. 99 ); (3) testing of 122 immunocompetent and 63 immunocompromised patients demonstrated age 142 dependency of BKPyV IgG level, with the highest values between 20 and 30 years (Schmidt et al., p. 106 ); (4) positive BKPyV IgG serostatus for serum samples from pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient was in accordance with a significant BKPyV viruria and viremia and start of PyVHC (K oskenvuo et al., p. 119 ). As a conclusion of this part of the thesis, our findings demonstrate that serological assays for JCPyV and BKPyV need to take into account whether epidemiological questions or individual risk assessments need to be addressed. Test ing of serum sample in 100 -, 200 -, and 400 -fold dilution series in a normalized VLP ELISA provides a convenient determination of JCPyV and BKPyV -specific antibody status and levels. Additionally, preadsorption assay could be applied to low -level antibody s era in order to rule out false -positives, and therefore avoid unnecessary withholding of an effective treatment option, and false -negatives, for better estimation of the risk of PyV -associated diseases. For future investigation of unknown sera samples the following conditions are suggested to be fulfilled: (1) sample should be tested in at least duplicates to avoid technical errors; (2) every ELISA should include reference serum for results normalization; (3) samples with low IgG activities should be addit ionally tested in preadsorption assay. Quality assessment programs with appropriate training for laboratory technicians would be recommended in order to globally standardize the ELISA performance and antigen preparation. Moreover, reference sera approved b y WHO might significantly enhance testing reproducibility and permit clarification of potential role of PyV serology in clinical practice. T cell immunity to polyomavirus es has been studied mostly for large T antigen (LTag) and capsid protein VP1 (285 -297) . Both proteins are good ELISA antigen candidates due to their immunogenicity and capability to stimulate B cell responses (298) . Therefore we decided to use both proteins as antigens in ELISA for screening of BKPyV IgG response among 22 6 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy from primary prosta te cancer (Keller et al., p. 125). We evaluated whether the preoperative antibody responses to BKPyV LTag and VP1 were associated with the risk of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. No evidence for an association between BKPyV VP1 serostatus and the risk of prostate cancer recurrence was observed. However, an antibody response to LTag was associated with the clinical course of prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy. Due to the fact that LTag may lead to the oncogenic transformation of BKPyV infected glandular prostate cells, an increased antibody activity against this oncogenic protein would be expected in cases with high risk of biochemical recurrence. In this study we reve aled that the preoperative LTag serology may be a valuable biomarker for a prediction of favorable prostate cancer 143 prognosis after radical prostatectomy. Finally, this study underlines how important is to choose an antigen which will be adequate to assigne d study question. 144 7 References 1.
