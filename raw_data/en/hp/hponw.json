If the judge determines, either with or without a 22 hearing, that the juvenile should be returned, the judge shall 23 present to the appropriate court or to the executive authority 24 of the state where the juvenile is alleged to be located a 25 written requisition for the return of such juvenile.

If the judge of such court shall 22 find that the requisition is in order, the judge shall deliver 23 such juvenile over to the officer whom the court demanding the 24 juvenile shall have appointed to receive the juvenile.

If a record check performed in accordance with paragraph 13 \"b\" or \"c\" identifies that an individual is a person subject 14 to an evaluation, the department record check evaluation 15 system shall perform the evaluation in accordance with this 16 subsection , even if the application which made the person 17 subject to the record check is withdrawn or the circumstances 18 which made the person subject to the record check are no longer 19 applicable.

A person subject to a record check who is or was employed 24 by a child care facility or child care home provider and 25 is hired by another child care facility or child care home 26 provider shall be subject to a record check in accordance 27 with this subsection . However, if the person was subject 28 to an evaluation because of a transgression in the person's 29 record and the evaluation determined that the transgression 30 did not warrant prohibition of the person's involvement 31 with child care and the latest record checks do not indicate 32 there is a transgression that was committed subsequent to 33 that evaluation, the person may commence employment with the 34 other child care facility or provider in accordance with the 35 -501- SF 514 (2) 90 ec/jh/mb 501/ 1512 S.F. 514 department's evaluation and an exemption from any requirements 1 for reevaluation of the latest record checks is authorized. 2 Authorization of an exemption under this paragraph \"g\" from 3 requirements for reevaluation of the latest record checks by 4 the department record check evaluation system is subject to all 5 of the following provisions: 6 (1) The position with the subsequent employer is 7 substantially the same or has the same job responsibilities as 8 the position for which the previous evaluation was performed. 9 (2) Any restrictions placed on the person's employment 10 in the previous evaluation by the department record check 11 evaluation system shall remain applicable in the person's 12 subsequent employment. 13 (3) The person subject to the record checks has maintained a 14 copy of the previous evaluation and provides the evaluation to 15 the subsequent employer or the previous employer provides the 16 previous evaluation from the person's personnel file pursuant 17 to the person's authorization. If a physical copy of the 18 previous evaluation is not provided to the subsequent employer, 19 the record checks shall be reevaluated. 20 (4) Although an exemption under this paragraph \"g\" may 21 be authorized, the subsequent employer may instead request a 22 reevaluation of the record checks and may employ the person 23 while the reevaluation is being performed. 24 h.

If the department record check evaluation system 14 determines, through an evaluation of a person's transgression, 15 that the person's prohibition of involvement with child care is 16 warranted, the person shall be prohibited from involvement with 17 child care. The department record check evaluation system may 18 identify a period of time after which the person may request 19 that another record check and evaluation be performed. A 20 person who continues involvement with child care in violation 21 of this subsection is subject to penalty under section 237A.19 22 or injunction under section 237A.20 . 23 k.
