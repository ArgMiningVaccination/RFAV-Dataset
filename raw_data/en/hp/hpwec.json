We determine prior authorizations for add-on services and process reimbursement for these services. See Service Coordination section for additional information. Nursing facility role and responsibilities Nursing facilities provide overall care for all members including, but not limited to the following: room and board, interdisciplinary healthcare needs, and access to hospice services.

Members should contact their PCP, also known as the medical home, to coordinate their care and help them access their benefits in a manner that takes into consideration member special access requirements. PCPs are required to assess the medical and behavioral health needs of members and when appropriate refer to other health care professionals, including specialists who are in network. Referrals must be documented in member chart. PCPs coordinate member care and follow-up with the member and/or representatives, the nursing facility, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan service coordinators, and any other health care professionals involved in the member's care. Referrals do not require an authorization so long as the health care professional is in network with UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. If the member accesses care through a non-contracted health care professional without prior authorization, note that the services may not be reimbursed unless the service is an emergency, urgently needed, post-stabilization or out-of- area renal dialysis. To submit a justification of an out-of-network referral, visit UHCprovider.com > Referrals. The PCPs have screening and evaluation procedures for the detection and treatment of, or referral for, any known or suspected behavioral health problems and disorders. A PCP can offer behavioral health services when clinically appropriate and are within the scope of the PCP's practice. These claims would be submitted to health plan. Members in a nursing facility have the right to designate a specialist as their PCP, as long as the specialist agrees to provide PCP services to the Member. The specialist physician must agree to perform all PCP duties required in the contract, and PCP duties must be within the scope of the specialist's license. Any interested person may initiate the request through the MCO for a specialist to serve as a PCP for a member with disabilities, special health care needs, or chronic or complex conditions.Panel roster PCPs may print a monthly PCP panel roster by visiting UHCprovider.com . Sign in to UHCprovider.com . Select the UnitedHealthcare Online application on the Provider Portal. Select Reports from the Tools & Resources. From the Report Search page, select the Report Type (PCP panel roster) from the pull-down menu. Complete additional fields as required. Click on the available report you want to view. The PCP panel roster provides a list of UnitedHealthcare Community Plan members currently assigned to the health care professional. Females have direct access (without a referral or authorization) to any OB/GYNs, midwives, physician assistants, or nurse practitioners for women's health care services and any non-women's health care issues discovered and treated in the course of receiving women's health care services. This includes access to ancillary services ordered by women's health care professionals (lab, radiology, etc.) in the same way these services would be ordered by a PCP. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan works with members and health care professionals to help ensure that all participants understand, support, and benefit from the primary care case management system. The coverage shall include availability of 24 hours, 7 days per week. During non-office hours, access by telephone to a live voice (i.e., an answering service, physician on-call, hospital switchboard, PCP's nurse triage) which will immediately page an on-call medical professional so referrals can be made for non-emergency services or information can be given about accessing services or managing medical problems. Recorded messages are not acceptable. Assignment to PCP panel roster Once a member has been assigned to a PCP, panel rosters can be viewed electronically on the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Provider Portal at UHCprovider.com . The portal requires a unique user name and password combination to gain access.Chapter 2: Roles and Responsibilities 10 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Texas STAR+PLUS and UnitedHealthcare Connected Nursing Facility Care Provider Manual \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareRole and responsibilities of specialty health care professional Specialist consultations do not require authorization as long as the specialist is an in network health care professional. Medical specialists are responsible for providing covered health services within the scope of their UnitedHealthcare Community Plan agreement and within the scope of their specialty license. Verify member eligibility and ensure an authorization or services is in place at UHCprovider.com/priorauth . Health care professionals agree to render covered health services to members in the same time availability as offered to their other patients, in compliance with state regulations and as described within this manual. It is the responsibility of the specialist to report the specialist's findings, recommendations and treatments. The report should be after the initial assessment and quarterly thereafter. Any necessary authorizations may be requested after the member's visit to the specialist office for consultation or if the specialist was consulted during a member's hospitalization. Role of the pharmacy Pharmacy responsibilities include a range of care for members, from dispensing medications to monitoring member health and progress to maximize their response to the medication. Pharmacists also educate members on the use of prescriptions and over-the-counter medications and advise physicians, nurses, and other health professionals on drug decisions. Pharmacists also provide expertise about the composition of drugs, including their chemical, biological, and physical properties. They ensure drug purity and strength and that the drugs do not interact in a harmful way. Pharmacists are drug experts ultimately concerned about their patients' health and wellness. Pharmacies may also contract for durable medical equipment (DME) with UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Network limitations UnitedHealthcare Community Plan has no network limitation on referrals to any in-network health care professional. If a health care professional is contracted with UnitedHealthcare Community Plan through an Independent Practice Association (IPA) or Medical Group, the health care professional is not limited to referring within that IPA for specialist services. Member's right to designate an OB/GYN UnitedHealthcare Community Plan DOES NOT LIMIT to network.

HHS is responsible for determination of Medicaid eligibility. Medicaid eligibility is determined through the Texas Integrated Eligibility Redesign System (TIERS) after the initial 30-day stay that establishes residency. The HHS Medicaid eligibility worker (MEW) is responsible for the financial eligibility for Medicaid. This process should be completed within 45 days, except in unusual situations. Please note that members may choose to switch plans within a six-month time frame. If an applicant is determined eligible, an applied income amount may be determined that the individual must pay toward to the cost of the nursing facility care. Denial of Medicaid eligibility may be appealed. Medicaid payment does not begin until HHS establishes a record of eligibility in its central computer. The Form 1230, Notification of Eligibility - Regular Medicaid Benefits, indicates the date benefits begin and the amount of applied income the individual must pay to the facility each month. Applied income information is also provided in the Medicaid Eligibility Service Authorization Verification (MESAV) system. See the Billing section of this manual for additional information regarding applied income. A member may request to dis-enroll from managed care. This would require a medical documentation form from the member's PCP, or documentation that indicates sufficiently compelling circumstances that merit disenrollment. HHS will make the final decision regarding disenrollment. Health care professionals may not take retaliatory action against a member for any reason including disenrollment.Member disenrollment We have the limited right to request a member be disenrolled from our health plan without the member's consent. HHS must approve any such request for disenrollment of a member for cause. We must take reasonable documented measures to correct member behavior prior to requesting disenrollment. Reasonable measures may include providing education and counseling regarding the offensive acts or behaviors. HHS may permit disenrollment of a member under the following circumstances: 1. Member misuses or loans member's MCO membership card to another person to obtain services. 2. Member's behavior is disruptive or uncooperative to the extent that member's continued enrollment in our plan seriously impairs our plan's or the health care professional's ability to provide services to either the member or other members, and the member's behavior is not related to a developmental, intellectual, or physical disability or behavioral health condition. 3. Member steadfastly refuses to comply with managed care restrictions (e.g., repeatedly using emergency room in combination with refusing to allow us to treat the underlying medical condition). 4. HHS must notify the member of HHS' decision to dis-enroll the member if all reasonable measures have failed to remedy the problem. 5. If the member disagrees with the decision to dis- enroll them from UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, HHS must notify the member of the availability of the complaint procedure and, for Medicaid members, HHS' State Fair Hearing process. 6. We cannot request a disenrollment based on adverse change in the member's health status or utilization of services that are medically necessary for treatment of a member's condition.Chapter 3: Eligibility 13 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Texas STAR+PLUS and UnitedHealthcare Connected Nursing Facility Care Provider Manual \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareSpan of coverage The following table shows payment responsibility for Medicaid enrollment changes that occur during a nursing facility stay, beginning on the member's effective date of coverage with the new MCO.

The MCO SC is responsible for a member's service plan. A NF plan of care is the Medicaid-covered services provided in a nursing facility. The nursing facility is responsible for its plan of care but the nursing facility plan of care may include add-on services authorized by the MCO. The nursing facility plan of care is included in the MCO's service plan.Our service coordinator participates in person- and family-centered service planning with the nursing facility, PCP, vendors, and other state and community agencies to coordinate managed and non-managed services, including non-Medicaid community resources to develop a plan of care. Our service coordinators also participate with the member and family or representative, nursing facility and other members of the interdisciplinary team to provide input for the development of the nursing facility plan of care. They also attend meetings surrounding member care and serve as a resource, or advocate for the member. Service coordinators conduct a face-to-face visit with the member at a minimum of quarterly, and more frequently as determined by the member's condition, situation, and level of care. Service coordinators for STAR+PLUS Level 1 members in a nursing facility may determine it is appropriate to use an audio-visual service visit in place of an in-person visit. Members will have at least one annual face-to-face service coordination visit. The UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Service Coordinator role includes: Coordinating services when a member transitions into a nursing facility for long term care Partnering with the member, family, nursing facility staff and others in the development of a service plan, including services provided through the Nursing Facility, add-on services, acute medical services, behavioral health services, and primary or specialty care.

This includes acute and sub-acute medical, long term acute care, acute rehabilitation, skilled nursing facilities, home health care and ambulatory facilities. Promoting independence We participate in the promoting independence initiative. The philosophy is that aged and disabled individuals remain in the most integrated setting to receive LTSS. Promoting Independence is Texas' response to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Olmstead v. L.C., which requires states to provide community-based services for persons with disabilities who would otherwise be entitled to institutional services, when: It is determined that such placement is appropriate; The member does not oppose LTSS; andChapter 5: Service Coordination 20 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Texas STAR+PLUS and UnitedHealthcare Connected Nursing Facility Care Provider Manual \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareChapter 5: Service Coordination LTSS can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available and in consideration of the needs of others who are receiving state supported disability services. Our service coordinators complete an assessment of the member within 30 days of admission. At that time, a plan of care is developed, if appropriate, to transition the member back into the community. If at this initial review, return to the community is possible, the service coordinator works with the member and family to return the member to the community using Home and Community-based STAR+PLUS Waiver services. If the initial review does not support a return to the community, the service coordinator will conduct a second assessment 90 days after the initial assessment to determine any changes in the member's condition or circumstances that would allow a return to the community. The service coordinator will develop and implement the transition plan. Discharge and transition planning When a member is ready to return to community living, our service coordinator will develop and implement a member- centered transition plan which will include the following: Coordination with Member and member's family (or other social supports) The nursing facility social worker The HHSC relocation specialist The Long Term Care ombudsman Member's PCP and other healthcare professionals Community resources The plan will include utilization of appropriate and available resources such as the following: Money Follows the Person Demonstration which includes resources for activities of daily living, housing and behavioral health Transitional assistance service - a maximum of $2,500 is available on a one-time basis to help defray the costs associated with setting up a household.

These agencies must be licensed by HHSC and Medicare-certified as hospice agencies. Coverage of services follows the amount, duration, and scope of services specified in the Medicare Hospice Program. Hospice pays for services related to the treatment of the client's terminal illness and for certain physician services (not the treatments). Medicaid hospice provides palliative care to all Medicaid- eligible clients (no age restriction) who sign statements electing hospice services and are certified by physicians to have six months or less to live if their terminal illnesses run their normal courses. Hospice care includes medical and support services designed to keep clients comfortable and without pain during the last weeks and months before death. Texas Medicaid clients who are 21 years of age and older and who elect hospice coverage waive their rights to all other Medicaid services related to their terminal illness. They do not waive their rights to Medicaid services that are unrelated to their terminal illness.23 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Texas STAR+PLUS and UnitedHealthcare Connected Nursing Facility Care Provider Manual \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcare Chapter 6: Health Care Delivery and Availability PCPs, specialists and other health care professionals providing care to members in nursing facilities will be required to contract with UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, to be considered in-network health care professionals. The PCP must have a national provider identification number and a Texas provider identification number, which qualifies them to serve Texas Medicaid members. We foster the Medical Home model in which health care services are accessible, family-centered, and sensitive to cultural differences, comprehensive, coordinated, and compassionate. Care for every member integrates health education, wellness, and prevention. The CP coordinates the medical home, which includes participation in the plan of care with the service coordinator, member, member family, and specialists as appropriate. PCPs, specialists and other health care professionals providing care should ensure continuity of care for members related to: hospitalization pregnant women facility transfer when a member moves out of the service area surrounding pre-existing conditions not imposed Members in a nursing facility have the right to designate a specialist as their PCP as long as the specialist agrees to that designation. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan network will establish the PCP designation in the provider agreement contract. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will ensure a member's right to select and have access to, without a PCP referral, a network ophthalmologist or therapeutic optometrist to provide health care services other than surgery and ensure a member's right to obtain medication from any network pharmacy. Female members have the right to access an OB/ GYN in network health care professional in addition to their PCP. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan recognizes that members can access a second opinion regarding the use of any health care service. The second opinion must be provided by a network health care professional. Members with Special Health Care Needs need to have access to a specialist as appropriate for the member's condition and identified needs, such a standing referral to a specialty physician. Access to care standards A PCP has the responsibility to ensure that necessary health care services are available to members 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. This includes the responsibility to return member after-hour phone calls within 30 minutes of the phone call. When unable to provide this level of care for the member, you must arrange with another in network PCP to cover this availability. Note: A hospital emergency room is not an acceptable substitute for a covering health care professional. All health care professionals need to adhere to the access standards in emergencies and when scheduling appointments (see chart). Access and availability ConditionTime frame (Requirements for Scheduling Appointments) Routine: Primary CareWithin 14 days Specialty Care Referrals (Including Therapy)Within 21 days Preventive Health ServicesWithin 90 days Behavioral Health Post HospitalizationWithin 7 days from the date of discharge Urgent Care Within 24 hours Emergency Upon member presentation Cultural sensitivity Our health care professionals adhere to the American with Disabilities Act standards governing the ready access and usability of facilities by individuals with disabilities; and are expected to provide reasonable accommodations to those with hearing, vision, cognitive, Chapter 6: Health Care Delivery and Availability 24 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Texas STAR+PLUS and UnitedHealthcare Connected Nursing Facility Care Provider Manual \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareand psychiatric disabilities when requested, promoting the social model of disability. You are expected to comply with the Title I of the American with Disabilities of 1990 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This person-centered approach to care requires physical access to buildings, services, and equipment and flexibility in scheduling and processes. Communication with members needs to be in a manner that accommodates their individual needs, including providing interpreters (for those who are deaf, hard of hearing or do not speak English) and accommodations for members with cognitive limitations. It's important that staff receive competent training on accessibility and accommodation, independent living and recovery models, cultural competency, and wellness philosophies. We expect our members to receive culturally competent care delivered in the same manner as other patients which is free of discrimination of the member's race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. Cultural sensitivity and literacy Cultural competency is the ability of individuals and systems to provide services effectively to people of various cultures, races, ethnic backgrounds and religions in a manner that recognizes values, affirms and respects the worth of the individual and protects and preserves dignity. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan promotes cultural competency. Racial and ethnic minorities face many barriers in receiving adequate care. These barriers include difficulties with language and communication, feelings of isolation, encounters with service health care professionals lacking knowledge of the member's culture and challenges related to socioeconomic. You have a responsibility to provide a voice for members who cannot speak for, or represent, themselves. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan believes that everyone should be able to understand health care materials we provide. This idea is key to informed treatment decisions and compliance. To support this belief, all health related member materials are written at a 4th to 6th grade reading level and provided in English and Spanish. Materials will be published in additional languages, should enrollment reach at least 10% for another non-English speaking group. Language translation services Members with a limited English proficiency or reading skills require an interpreter. Customer Service can assist with accessing these services for them over the phone. Telephone interpreting service is also available for members who are deaf, hard-of hearing, deaf-blind or speech impaired. We have interpreter services to help ensure effective communication for our members regarding treatment, medical history or health condition. This is at no cost to you or our members when the member is receiving services from a health care professional in an office, other location or accessing emergency services. It includes written, spoken, and sign language interpretation. Over-the-phone (OPI) interpretation, including three-way calls facilitated between UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, you as the health care professional and a phone interpreter, does not require advance notification by the you or the member. Requests, for in-person interpreters for scheduled appointments can be arranged as quickly as possible, including for care in urgent conditions. For routine care, in-person requests are scheduled based on the requested date and time, or upon the next availability of the interpreter for the requested language, including American Sign Language (ASL). If an in-person interpreter is not available for the requested date and time, we'll notify and coordinate with you and the member to offer alternative interpretation options, such as OPI, Video Remote Interpretation, or the earliest availability of the an in-person interpreter.

Statement must be signed prior to service, dated and filed in member's medical record. Sample wording of this may include: I [enter member name] understand that [enter service] is not a covered service and will not be paid by MCO or State.

I agree to pay [enter specified cost] for this service which will terminate [enter timeframe or number of service provision incidents]. Emergency transportationChapter 8: Services and BenefitsChapter 8: Services and Benefits 34 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Texas STAR+PLUS and UnitedHealthcare Connected Nursing Facility Care Provider Manual \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareEmergency transportation is a method to access emergency treatment as defined in the emergency treatment section of this manual, for example an ambulance. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan does not require prior authorization for or notification of the emergency transport. Non-emergency transportation The nursing facility is responsible for providing routine non-emergency transportation services. The cost of such transportation is included in the nursing facility unit rate. Transports of nursing facility members for rehabilitative treatment (e.g., physical therapy), to outpatient departments, or to physicians' offices for recertification examinations for nursing facility care are not reimbursable services by UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is responsible for authorizing non-emergency ambulance transportation for a member whose medical condition is such that the use of an ambulance is the only appropriate means of transportation (i.e., alternate means of transportation are medically contra-indicated). Nursing facilities are responsible for providing or arranging transportation for their residents. Arranging transportation for Medicaid clients includes obtaining prior authorizations for non-emergency ambulance transports. Ambulance health care professionals may assist nursing facilities in obtaining prior authorizations (e.g., faxing the required documentation to TMHP). Ambulance health care professionals, however, may not call TMHP's Ambulance Prior Authorization Unit to request prior authorization. Transports from a nursing facility to a hospital are covered if the client's condition meets emergency criteria. A return trip to a nursing facility following an emergency transport is not considered routine; therefore, transport back to the facility must be requested by the discharging hospital. Nonemergency transport for the purpose of required diagnostic or treatment procedures that are not available in the nursing facility (such as dialysis treatments at a freestanding facility) are also allowable only for clients whose medical condition is such that the use of an ambulance is the only appropriate means of transport (e.g., alternate means of transport are medically contraindicated). The cost of routine non-emergency transportation is included in the nursing facility vendor rate. This non- emergency transport requires the nursing facility to request and obtain a PAN from the TMHP Ambulance Unit before contacting the ambulance company for the transport. Transports of nursing facility residents for rehabilitative treatment (e.g., physical therapy) to outpatient departments or physicians' offices for recertification examinations for nursing facility care are not reimbursable ambulance services. Claims for services to nursing facility residents must indicate the medical diagnosis or problem requiring treatment, the medical necessity for use of an ambulance for the transport, and the type of treatment rendered at the destination (e.g., admission or X-ray). If a client is returned by ambulance to a nursing facility following inpatient hospitalization, the acute condition requiring hospitalization must be noted on the ambulance claim form. This transport is considered for payment only if the client's medical condition is appropriate for transport by ambulance. This non-emergency transport requires the nursing facility to request and obtain a PAN from the TMHP Ambulance Unit before contacting the ambulance company for the transport. Ambulance providers may bill a nursing facility or client for a non-emergency ambulance transport only under the following circumstances: Health care professionals may bill the nursing facility when the nursing facility requests the non-emergency ambulance transport without a PAN. Health care professionals may bill the client only when the client requests transport that is not an emergency and the client does not have a medical condition such that the use of an ambulance is the only appropriate means of transport (i.e., alternate means of transport are medically contraindicated). The health care professional must advise the client of acceptance as a private pay patient at the time the service is provided, and the client is responsible for payment of all services. Health care professionals are encouraged to have the client sign the Private Pay Agreement.Chapter 8: Services and Benefits 35 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Texas STAR+PLUS and UnitedHealthcare Connected Nursing Facility Care Provider Manual \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareYou may refer questions about a nursing facility's responsibility for payment of a transport to the TMHP Contact Center at 800-925-9126 or TMHP provider relations representative. Please see Appendix A for a list of Covered Benefits for UnitedHealthcare Connected members. 36 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Texas STAR+PLUS and UnitedHealthcare Connected Nursing Facility Care Provider Manual \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcare Chapter 9: Fraud, Waste and Abuse Fraud is the intentional deception or misrepresentation that an individual knows to be false or does not believe to be true, when that individual knows that the deception could result in some unauthorized benefit to him/her or some other person. Abuse is defined as practices that are inconsistent with sound fiscal, business or medical practices and result in an unnecessary cost to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan or that fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care. Waste is defined as billing or other information submitted for items or services where there was no intent to deceive or misrepresent, but the outcome resulted in an overpayment of funds. It is your obligation to report knowledge or suspicion of fraud, waste or abuse. Federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly submitting false or fraudulent claims or claims- related information to the federal government. The Act permits any person who knows of fraud against the United States government to file a lawsuit on behalf of the government against the person or business that committed the fraud. Texas False Claims Act states that a person may also be liable if he presents a claim for payment under the Medicaid program for a product or service that was rendered by an unlicensed health care professional or that has not been approved by a healthcare practitioner. The civil penalty under the Act is greater than the Federal False Claims Act for unlawful acts that result in injury to an elderly person, a disabled person, or someone under the age of eighteen. The Act includes provisions to prevent employers from retaliating against employees who report their employer's false claims. Whistleblower Act provides protection to an employee who is retaliated against by an employer because of the employee's participation. The protection is available to any employee who is fired, demoted, threatened, harassed or otherwise discriminated against by his or her employer because the employee investigates, files, or participates in a qui tam action. The protections includes reinstatement and damages of double the amount of lost wages if the employee is fired, and any other damages sustained if the employee is otherwise discriminated against.

Coordination of benefits State specific guidelines will be followed when Coordination of Benefits (COB) procedures are not parallel with UnitedHealthcare Community Plan procedures. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan public or private sources of payment for services rendered to members in the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Together with our network health care professionals, including nursing facilities, we agree that the Medicaid program will be the payer of last resort when third party resources are available to cover the costs of medical services provided to Medicaid members. When we become aware of these resources before paying for a medical service, payment of a health care professional's claim will be rejected and the health care professional will be directed to bill the appropriate insurance carrier. If we become aware of additional resources sometime after payment for the service, we will pursue recovery of the expenditure. Nursing facilities must not seek recovery in excess of the Medicaid payable amount. We avoid payment of claims where third party resources are payable. We assist HHS in the identification, pursuit and collection of third party resources and will notify HHS within 30 days upon identification of health or casualty insurance coverage available to a member, or any change in a member's health insurance coverage. Claims for covered services subject to coordination of benefits will be paid based on the member's benefit plan and applicable law. For questions or inquiries regarding a paid, denied or pended claim, please call Customer Service at 888-887-9003 . UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is the primary payer, except in case of: Medicare TRICARE UMVSChapter 10: Billing 40 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Texas STAR+PLUS and UnitedHealthcare Connected Nursing Facility Care Provider Manual \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcare Veterans Other insurance carriers Workers' compensation insurance Black lung benefits Automobile medical insurance No fault insurance Any liability insurance It is the nursing facility's responsibility to file claims for Medicare coinsurance. The 110-day rule When a service is billed to a third party and no response has been received, you must allow 110 days to elapse before submitting a claim to TMHP or UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. If the third party has not responded, delays payment or denies a health care professional's claim for more than 110 days after the date the claim was billed, the claim will be considered for reimbursement. However, the 365-day federal filing deadline requirement must still be met. The following information is required when re-submitting the claims: Name and address of the TPR Date the TPR was billed Statement signed and dated by the health care professional that no disposition has been received from the TPR within 110 days of the date the claim was billed When TMHP denies a claim because of the client's other coverage, information that identifies the other insurance appears on the health care professional's Remittance & Status Report. The claim is not to be refiled until disposition from the third party has been received or until 110 days have lapsed since the billing of the claim with no disposition from the third party. A statement from the client or family member which indicates that they no longer have this resource is not sufficient documentation to reprocess the claim. When a health care professional is advised by a third party that benefits have been paid to the client, the information must be included on the claim with the date and amount of payment made to the client if available. If a denial was sent to the client, refer to the verbal denial guidelines above for required information. This enables TMHP or UnitedHealthcare Community Plan to consider the claim for reimbursement.Claims submitted for the Medicare nursing facility rate will continue to be processed through the administrative services contractor. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will not reassess or authorize services resulting from the MDS and covered under the Nursing Facility Unit Rate. The nursing facility must submit an electronic version of the Medicare Remittances and Advice form. Unit rate claims deadlines Unit rate claims must be received by UnitedHealthcare Community Plan within 365 days of the date of service on the claim to be considered for payment. In-network nursing facility unit rate clean claims are processed within 10 days of receipt. Non-network nursing facility unit rate clean claims are processed within 30 days of receipt and are subject to 95% reimbursement. Claims meet HHSC criteria for clean claims submission as described in the Uniform Managed Care Manual, Chapter 2.3, nursing facility Claims Manual. Original claims submissions and adjustments processed for in- network nursing facilities after the tenth day will include interest payments according to HHS guidelines. If a claim is not received within 365 days, we must deny the claim unless excepted from the claims filing deadline. If you file with the wrong health plan or the wrong HHSC portal within the 365 day submission requirement and produce documentation to that effect, we will honor the initial filing date and process the claim without denying the resubmission for the sole reason of passing the filing timeframe. The claim must be filed with us by the later of 365 days after the date of service, or 95 days after the date on the R&S Report or explanation of payment from the other carrier or contractor. We will submit a request to you for additional information necessary to allow adjudication of a deficient claim within 10 days from the date of original claim. We will adjudicate deficient-pended or deficient-denied claims for which additional information is requested within 10 days from the date of receipt of the requested information. We determine claims to be adjudicated-denied when any deficient-pended or deficient-denied claims for which requested additional information is not received within 10 days from the date the information was requested from you.Chapter 10: Billing 41 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Texas STAR+PLUS and UnitedHealthcare Connected Nursing Facility Care Provider Manual \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareOnce an initial claim has been adjudicated to a paid status, we automatically adjust claims to reflect changes to such things as: Nursing Facility Unit Rates Provider Contracts, Service Authorizations Applied Income, Level of Service (RUG) Claims in progress should complete adjudication. We can only adjust an adjudicated-paid claim. We will not require nursing facilities to submit updated claims once a claim is an adjudicated-paid claim. We will not directly or indirectly charge or hold a member or a network or non-network health care professional responsible for a fee for the adjudication of a claim. We will make adjustments to previously adjudicated claims within 30 days from the date of receipt of an adjustment from HHSC to reflect changes to such things as: Nursing Facility Unit Rates, Provider Contracts, Service Authorizations, Applied Income and Level of Service (RUG). We make every effort to avoid making more than one request to you for additional information in connection with a specific claim. Our claim procedures include processes intended to prevent a health care professional claim from being repeatedly deficient-denied for reasons that were present on the original claim submission. Whenever possible, we identify each applicable reason code and specific information requirements to inform you of the precise data fields and issues related to each claim. We withhold all or part of payment for a claim for the following reasons: The claim for a health care professional- administered drug is missing the National Drug Code (NDC) information, or the NDC is not valid for the corresponding HCPCS code Exclusion or suspension from the Medicare or Medicaid programs for fraud, waste or abuse A full or partial payment hold under the authority of HHSC or its authorized agent(s) is in effect with debts, settlements, or pending payments due to HHSC, or the state or federal government The claim for nursing facility Unit Rates does not comply with HHSC criteria for processing clean claimsPayment for nursing facility unit rate The unit rate is the contract rate in effect on each day of service.
