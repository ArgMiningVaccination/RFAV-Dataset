Throughout history they've been used for protection from negative energy or evil spirits, and nowadays people wear them and chart their energy without even knowing! Each stone carries its own power and purpose. To find out which one to use, you need to connect to your mind and heart. Your intuition will lead you to what your soul is missing and needs. Starting with identifying an area you'd like to work on, and then you can choose the perfect crystal. For example, one of the most popular gemstones for meditation is amethyst. Amethyst is a gemstone which will enhance your immune system, reduce headaches, and improve your skin and anxiety symptoms. Amethyst can be really helpful to improve your sleeping schedule. How to prepare for meditation In order to connect properly with your crystals, it is best to cleanse them before starting the rituals. To prepare for the ritual, you will need to sage smoke your crystals. Sage helps to cleanse the crystals and your personal space. Relax your body and clear your mind when you begin to connect to your stones. Crystals can also be programmed to be more personalised so you have a stronger connection with them. Simply hold them in your hands and focus on devoting all your energy and thoughts to the gemstone. Clear your mind from all of the negativity, take the stone and place your hand on your heart. How to meditate with crystals Now that you have cleansed and personalized your crystal, it is time to meditate! Daily meditations have proven to be helpful to fight anxiety and having a more balanced lifestyle. 1. Find a safe space and sit down in a comfortable position. 2. Close your eyes and clear your mind. Try to transfer your mind into a happy place. 3. Start with deep breathing and relaxing. 4. Focus on the stone and the energy you are hoping to get from it. Try to come back to the stone if your mind starts thinking of something else. 5. Sink into the stone's vibrations. You may want to hold it in your hands or place it on one of your chakras for a stronger connection. 6. Allow yourself as much time as you need to connect and do not rush the process or results quickly. If you find that the connection to the gemstone is right, you might find it beneficial for you to carry it around as a talisman. Being consistent with your crystal is a key to making them work. Keep your gemstones close and don't forget to take some time during the day to practice gratitude.
