For submission to the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting Washington DC, USA April 20 2022 3 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT BACKGROUND The first meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors under the Indonesian Presidency was held on 17 and 18 February 2022. The communique requested the WHO and WB, and implementing partners work further with countries to report on obstacles to, and accelerate, vaccine deployment strategies to get more COVID-19 shots into arms. This report, produced to answer that request, has been prepared with the support of six international bodies involved in work to support higher levels of COVID-19 vaccination coverage and the leadership of the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership (CoVDP) and Act-Accelerator (ACT-A) Hub. The WHO and WB worked in collaboration with the IMF and WTO as members of the Multilateral Leaders Task Force on COVID-19 as well as Gavi and UNICEF as members of the CoVDP to co-produce this report. 3 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT4 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTEXECUTIVE S UMMAR Y The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. The risk of a new Vari ant of Concern (VoC) emerging continues to be high due to inte nse transmission of the virus and low vaccination levels in many parts of the world. This carr ies with it the threat of further wa ves of serious disease, mortalit y, and societal and economic disrupti on. The world has a comprehensive COV ID-19 toolkit of vaccines, t ests, tr eatments, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to mit igate this risk.1 COVID-19 vaccines act as a fir st line of defense and remain highly effective at reducin g serious illness and death s, even as the virus has continued to mutate. In 2021, WHO laid out a global ta rget to vaccinate 70% of the popu lation in all countries, t oward ending and recovering from the pandemic. That target has been met by only 52 countries, while the interim milestone of 40% cove rage is yet to be achieved by 69 coun tries, 21 of which have n ot yet achieved even 10% coverage. The significant inequities in COVID-19 vaccine coverage threaten to derail sustainable economic recovery, particularly in countrie s with low coverage levels. Over 11.3 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine s have been administered worldwide resulting in 58% o f the world's population having pri mary va ccination. Yet only 11% of the population in low income countries are vaccinated, c ompared with 73% of those in high inco me countries. For the first time since the pandemic began, the global supply of vacci nes is not currently a binding constraint. With coordination between global, regional, and bilateral vaccine suppliers and manufacturers, low and lower-m iddle countries can now better ma tch the supply of vaccines arriving in country with their own count ry specific demand for doses. And whi le trade bottlenecks are being tackled and export restrictions are being rolled back, expo rts of some vaccination-relate d products remain restricted, indic ating persistent global shorta ges.2 This means the overarching challe nge is now vaccine delivery - gettin g shots into arms. A con tinued , concerted and country-led push to deliver against nationall y defined vaccination strategies can act in support of global targets. The greatest benefits within that approach will come from pri oritizing full vaccination and boosters for high risk populations - older a dults, healthcare workers, persons with co-morbidities including im muno compromised persons. Strong leadership engagement and commitm ent to detailed and cos ted vaccination plans will be essential. National healthcare system capacity will need to be s treng thened. Incr easingly COVID-19 vaccination services will nee d to be integrated with other i mmunization services and alo ngside other health and social interventions for maximum impact and to buil d long-term capacit y. As people's risk perception of the virus wanes, c areful risk communicatio n and community engagement plan s need to be adapted to enhance demand for vaccination, and dom estic and international funding needs to be coordinated, a vailable and swift to deliver agai nst clear country plans. The COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnersh ip, a collective international effort with 'One Country Team', 'One Plan', and O, UNI CEF, and Gavi with international partners including the World Bank to intensify country readiness an d intensify delivery support. It focuses on 34 low coverage coun tries, with the government at the cente r, to accelerate COVID-19 vaccination. Despite incremental success si nce its launch three months ago, low and lower-middle income countries are facing difficulties to get a step change in vaccinat ion rates. This represents a seri ous threat to the fragile economic recovery, including due to risk of new variants creating large waves of serious disease and death in pop ulations with low vaccination cove rage. It also means accelerati ng the delivery of other COVID-19 tools and t reatments is a crucial p riority to help the world build up multiple layers of protection against the virus. Concerted and urgent action from coun tries, int ernational partners and age ncies, along with G20 Finance Ministers is required to i ncrease vaccination levels.5 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT1. Fully fund the remaining US$ 1.1 billion requested by ACT-A's CoVDP partners for vaccine delivery while noting the support available from MDBs and other partners -and commit to close the gap on the remaining US$ 14 billion ACT-A budget asks including forCOVID-19 tests and treatments. 2. Advocate with political leaders and Finance Minister counterparts to ensure allcountries urgently accelerate vaccination to reach coverage targets, especially byvaccinating all high risk populations. 3. Mobilize financing for crucial national health system capacities includingimmunization programs. 4. Advocate and act to keep borders open and reduce tariffs and other trade and regulatory barriers applied to vaccines, inputs, and ancillary products, so that supplychains can run smoothly, and to facilitate access to COVID-19 tools. 5. Review progress against the COVID-19 vaccine delivery challenges outlined in thisreport at G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors' meetings in July, October, and November.FIVE PRIORITY ACTIONS FOR G20 FINANCE MINISTERS AND CENTRAL BANK GOVERNORS 5 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTPRIORITY ACTIONS FOR COUNTRIES WITH LOW COVID-19 VACCINATION COVERAGE 1. Ensure strong leadership engagement and commitment to detailed and costedvaccination plans and national targets, including for emergency funding requests. 2. Prioritise fully vaccinating high risk populations, as laid out in WHO guidance. 3. Promote demand for COVID-19 vaccination including through targeted RiskCommunication and Community Engagement to address vaccine hesitancy. 4. Integrate COVID-19 vaccination programs alongside the strengthening and restorationof health systems, including routine immunization programs. 5. In humanitarian settings, integrate COVID-19 vaccination with humanitarianactivities and promote safe and unhindered access for the delivery of COVID-19vaccinations to populations in need. 6. Provide additional layers of protection, ensuring sufficient focus is also placed onaccelerating the delivery of other COVID-19 tools such as tests and treatments. PRIORITY ACTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS AND AGENCIES 1. Align coordination at the global level, through COVAX/ACT-Accelerator with supportfrom the Multilateral Leaders Task Force, and at the country level, grounded in theOne Country Team approach of the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership behind thechallenges set out in this report. 2. Agree and deliver on rapid timeframes to respond to emergency funding andtechnical assistance requests from countries (CoVDP partners aim to disburse funds forclearly expressed needs within 15 days). 3. Support countries to build sustainable COVID-19 vaccination programs adaptableto evolving priorities over time. 4. Coordinate together and with vaccine manufacturers to provide countries withpredictable forward timelines for the supply of vaccines matched against demand-coordinate dose donations through global and regional mechanisms, including COVAX and AVAT, to avoid fragmentation.RECOMMENDATIONS TO ACCELERATE COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT Country-by-country specific recommendations to accelerate vaccine delivery in the 34 countries being provided with concerted support by the CoVDP and other partners are set out in Annex 1 to this report. Annex 2 contains an overview of the effects of trade-related measures on COVID-19 vaccine deployment.Tackling the obstacles to obtaining higher levels of COVID-19 vaccine delivery highlighted in this report will also require concerted action from countries with low vaccination coverage and international partners and agencies.7 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT CONTENTS Chapter 1: Introduction Chapter 2: COVID-19 vaccine delivery - what has happened, where do the greatest obstacles remain?

It is now over two years since the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. More than six million deaths from COVID-19 have been officially reported, with recent estimates putting the true number three times higher.3 The virus has c aused unprecedented disruption and harm to billions of lives and livelihoods around the world. 2. Global economic losses are expected to be close to US$ 13.8 trillion through 2024 relative to pre-pandemic forecasts.4 The number of people living in extreme poverty is estimated to have been around 70 millionhigher than pre-pandemic trends in 2021, setting back the progress in povertyreduction by several years. The long-term impacts on human capital will actas a drag on global growth for decades. The share of children living in learningpoverty in low and middle income countries, already 53% before the pandemic, could potentially reach to 70% given school closures and challenges withremote learning. Over seven million children have lost a parent or caregiver dueto COVID-19. 5 The pandemic has acted as a 'fragility multiplier', exacerbating the factors that drive displacement, including hunger, poverty, and sexual andgender-based violence, while trapping migrants and displaced people in evermore vulnerable situations due to closed borders and restrictions. For example, women - who represent 39% of global employment - have accounted for 54%of overall job losses during the pandemic. 6 3. Fortunately, a wide range of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines have been developed in record time to help mitigate the worst impacts of this pandemic, and more are under active development. WHO authorised vaccines have remained highly effective at reducing seriousillness and deaths, even as the virus has continued to mutate. A new variant ofconcern has appeared on average every four to five months since the pandemic began. Many of these vaccines have been developed and manufacturedthrough partnerships across sectors and countries. Multilateral rules underpinthese collaborations that enabled unparalleled speed in the development andmanufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines. Even as the greater transmissibility andpartial immune evasion of Omicron has changed the impact and perceptionsof the pandemic, vaccination continues to protect against hospitalisation andsevere disease, slowing transmission, and reducing the risk of future variants. Large immunity gaps, especially among those at high risk, leave populationseverywhere vulnerable to COVID-19 mutations and rapid waves of infection. 4. A continued push to support countries to achieve their own national vaccination targets in support of the global target of 70% coverage is key to minimising risks - both locally, but also as global health security priority. The greatest benefits within that approach willcome from prioritising full vaccination and boosters for high risk populations- older adults, healthcare workers, persons with co-morbidities includingimmunocompromised persons and pregnant persons, among others.PANDEMIC IMPACT KEY FIGURES >6MILLION DEATHS TRILLIONfrom COVID-19 officially reported.

Vaccine policy is now also economic policy. As set out in figure 1, countries that have been able to achieve higher rates of vaccine coverage have also been able to recover faster from the economic disruption caused by COVID-19, with low vaccination rates contributing to a drag onrecovery elsewhere. Prior to the war in Ukraine, while advanced economies had been projected toreturn to their pre-pandemic growth trends this year, several emerging markets and developingeconomies were projected to have sizeable output losses into the medium-term. 7 Increasing vaccination levels will help drive a sustainable global economic recovery. Reducing the impact ofCOVID-19 on health systems will also allow countries to return to other crucial health and economicpriorities at a time of great global insecurity. And if the world or parts of the world find themselves ina severe downside scenario then there will be significantly higher health and economic returns froma higher vaccine coverage. 8 FIGURE 1: VACCINATION HAS PROVED AN EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC POLICY 9 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT1.

Keeping borders open and reducin g trade-related bottlenecks and economic barriers to ensure that manufacturing inputs, finished vaccines, and ancillaries can reach their destinations plays an important role in effective vaccine deployment.9 Annex 2 to this report contains information about the effects of trade-related meas ures on COVID-19 vaccine deployment. 7.For much of 2020, and 2021, securing access to scare supplies of COVID-19 vaccines was an overriding priority for most countries and fuelled global inequalities in vaccine access. With the supply situation easing , the overarching global challenge now is getting shots into arms. This report was requested by G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, recognising the tremendous risk to global economic recovery and growth linked with ending the acute phase of the pandemic. This entails a rapid equitable acceleration of vaccine coverage across the world. Despite the coordinated support by CoVDP and partners to increase vaccination rates in lagging countries, success has been modest at best. Now more than ever, there is a need for urge nt investment and advocacy by Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to support this work. Delays in accelerating vaccine coverage risk delaying the end of the acute phase of the pandemic. 8.This report provides an update on t he global progress on COVID-19 vaccine delivery to date and then highlights a set o f common challenges that will ne ed to be overcome to raise coverage levels and prioritise high-risk groups. It ends with a set of recommendations for countries with low coverage rates, international partners and agencies, and G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to take to help drive progress in 2022.10 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT0100 255075Coverage (%) Years from First Available Data50 10 The pace and breadth of the global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines to date is unprecedented. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, manufacturers produced an estimated total of five billion vaccines doses peryear - across all diseases. 65% of the world's population has now receivedat least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and over 11 billion doses have beenadministered globally. The COVID-19 vaccine rollout has been achieved atglobal level faster than any other vaccine in history (see figure 2), savingmillions of lives. Less than 12 months after the first vaccine was authorisedevery country in the world, except two, 10 had introduced new COVID-19 vaccine programs - an unprecedented achievement. The growth in vaccinetrade was also accompanied by increasing trade in related or intermediateinputs underpinning their global manufacturing and distribution.CHAPTER 2: COVID-19 VACCINE DELIVERY - WHAT HAS HAPPENED, WHERE DO THE GREATEST OBSTACLES REMAIN? FIGURE 2: HISTORICAL SPEED OF VACCINE ROLLOUT AGAINST TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASES. 11PROGRESS & OUTLOOK 65% of world population has received at least one dose 11.2% fully vaccinated coverage in LICs 34 COUNTRIES at or below 10% coverage in January 2022 and off track to achieve the WHO's 70% target are receiving concerted support1.2 bn doses delivered by COVAX Greatest benefits will come from prioritizing full vaccination & boosters for high risk populations Source: COVID-19 Vaccine Development and Rollout in Historical Perspective, Center for Global Development (February 2022) - Amanda Glassman, Charles Kenny, and George YangPROGRESS HAS BEEN UNPRECEDENTED, BUT UNEQUAL 11 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT10. High and upper-middle income countries have been able to reach high vaccine coverage across their populations, surpassing global targets. Across high income countries, 877 million people (73.6% of the population) have now been fully vaccinated.12 In upper-middle income countries that number rises to 1.6 billion (73.9%). Most of these countries also have activebooster programs for their vulnerable populations reflecting the latest WHO guidance, and inmany cases for all adults. In general, these countries were able to strike individual bilateral dealswith COVID-19 vaccine manufactures to secure relatively early deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines. When combined with strong and well-funded health systems this allowed higher income countriesto plan in advance and introduce successful mass vaccination strategies that were rolled outover the course of 2021. Upper-middle income countries were not able to move as fast as higher-income countries but have gradually caught up. 70% of the population of G20 countries have nowbeen fully vaccinated. 11. Unfortunately, while progress has been made, the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines against global targets remains unequal and falls short of the expectations set out byG20 leaders last year for all countries to reach 40% vaccination coverage by end 2021 and 70%by mid-2022. 13 - as set out in figure 3.

Disruptions to global supply chains, export restrictions applied to vaccine-related inputs and finished products, manufacturing chall enges, intense competition for vaccines and delays to regulatory approvals meant that many low and lower-middle income countries were left behind as deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines increased in higher income countries. This made it almost impossible for them to plan, test and implement their delivery systems for COVID-19 vaccines at scal e. Levels of vaccination coverage in low and lower-middle income countries trailed consistently behind wealthier countries and despite recent progress, remain so today. Across lower-middle income countries, 1.6 billion people (47.9% of the population) have now been fully vaccinated. In low-income countries that number falls to 73 million (11.2%) of the population. One third of the world's population remains unvaccinat ed. The differential pace of vaccination across country categories is set out in figure 4 below.12.

For the first time since the pandemic was declared two years ago, there is currently sufficient supply in the global vaccine market - which means countries can secure the vaccines they need, on a timescale that works for them, and better plan their vaccinationstrategies. Over the past two years a significant amount of work has been done across lower incomecountries to prepare for large-scale vaccination deployment, in many cases supported by the countryreadiness and delivery work of international partners, and for many it is only in recent months thatthose plans could be operationalised at scale. 14. As supply constraints have eased, it has become clear that a group of countries could benefit from concerted support to accelerate COVID-19 vaccination. Recognising theurgency of turning vaccine doses into vaccinated, protected, people and communities, Gavi, UNICEFand WHO, launched the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership (CoVDP) in January 2021, an inter-agency initiative building on existing resources and partnerships at country, regional, and global levelto accelerate vaccination coverage in countries that face the biggest challenges to reaching theirvaccination targets. The work of the CoVDP has been supported by and coordinated with membersof the Multilateral Leaders Task Force, as well as donor partners and the ACT-A Health Systems andResponse Connector.FOUNDATIONS HAVE BEEN LAID TO REDUCE INEQUALITY IN 2022 13 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT15. Despite inequality across country income levels, important progress has been made that can act as a foundation to drive higher coverage levels for low- and lower- middle income countries during 2022. International partners are now able to provide support at scale. COVAX has now delivered more than 1.2 billion donor-funded doses to the 92 lower-income members which it is supporting through the Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) mechanism.15 The World Bank has committed US$ 8 billion in vaccine financing across 71 countries, supporting the purchase of over half a bill ion doses, of which, 269 million doses have been delivered and 2 00 million administered. Other sour ces include regional development ban ks as well as the deals secured by the African Union's African Vaccine Acquisition Trust (AV AT) and Pan American Health Organization ( PAHO) revolving fund, that are providing complementa ry supply. Many G20 countries have and are planning to provide large numbers of donated COVID-19 vaccine doses. These provide significant value when delivered th rough predictable timetables, with long shelf-lives as requested by countries and coordinated through global mechanisms like COVAX, or regional mechanisms like AV AT. 16. The CoVDP and partners are providing concerted support to 34 countr ies that were at or below 10% coverage in January 2022 and off track to achieve the WHO's 70% global coverage target by June 2022. It is providing the 10 countries facing the greatest challenges with immediate suppor t on a rotating basis16 to help them address bottlenecks (see figure 5). The CoVDP works with countries and partners based on a 'One Countr y Team', 'One Plan', and 'One Budget'17 approach to understand bottlenecks to vaccination. Countries are supported to access urgent operational funding , technical assistance, political engagement and demand and supply planning required to plan, implement and scale their vaccinat ion response and monitor progress towards targets. The Wo rld Bank has approved vaccine operations in 27 of the 34 countries and in line with country requests is closely aligning its financing and support to overcoming the bottlenecks identified through the One Country Team approach. FIGURE 5: 34 COUNTRIES ARE BEING PROVIDED WITH CONCERTED SUPPORT BY THE COVDP Countries agreed upon for immediate support Afghanistan Burkina Faso Burundi Cameroon CAR Chad C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Djibouti DR Congo Ethiopia Gabon Gambia Ghana Guinea Guinea-Bissau Haiti Kenya Madagascar Malawi Senegal Nigeria Papua New Guinea Mali Niger Syria T anzania South Sudan Sudan Sierra Leone Solomon Islands Zambia Uganda Yemen Somalia14 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT17. That supply will need to be sustained and provided to countries in a predictable way to allow them to successfully plan their vaccination strategies and campaigns. Transparency is key and global, regional and bilateral suppliers of vaccines, including vaccine manufactures need to coordinate together to give countries a clear forwardpipeline of their future vaccine supply, to allow them to plan effectively for delivery. At variouspoints in this pandemic, for example through disruption to manufacturing, or the arrival of newvariants leading to increased competition, the supply of COVID-19 vaccines to lower incomecountries has been disrupted. Now that vaccine deployment strategies are underway across AMCcountries it is crucial tools are in place to stop that happening again. At the moment, the supplypicture is positive. AMC countries are now able to order the vaccines they want from COVAX ona rolling six-month forward basis. MDBs and regional organisations like AVAT also have clearvisibility on the delivery of their contracted doses. International partners can play an importantrole here by working together to match the supply of COVID-19 vaccines to the specified demandof AMC countries which will help to ensure vaccination strategies can be well designed andminimise dose wastage - with bilateral donors ensuring donated doses are channelled throughCOVAX or other regional bodies. 18. The importance of securing diversified regional vaccine manufacturing capacity has also emerged as a priority with new initiatives underway - both to securelocally-made doses of COVID-19 and other vaccines and as part of longer-term pandemicpreparedness agenda. There are a broad range of opportunities in this space being drivenforward by governments and supported by international partners and financial institutions, including the WHO mRNA hub and spokes. Many are focused on Africa, such as the Partnershipfor African Vaccine Manufacturing, and aim to provide the continent with greater resilience andcapacity to secure doses early in a pandemic. Securing sustainability in the medium and longterm will be crucial here. The pandemic has also proven the importance of the pooled vaccineprocurement mechanisms that combine demand across countries for negotiation power andefficiencies. The COVAX facility, PAHO Revolving Fund, and AVAT have each provided importantmeans by which vaccine doses are secured and market shaping advanced. WHILE PROGRESS IS BEING MADE ACROSS THE AMC92 AND 34 COUNTRIES BEING PROVIDED WITH CONCERTED SUPPORT, SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES REMAIN 19. Over 43% of the population of AMC 92 countries are now fully vaccinated. Since January 2022, vaccination rates have increased by a third across the 34 countries froman average of 2.7% of the population per month during the fourth quarter of 2021 to 3.6%per month in the first quarter of 2022. Only 19 of the 34 countries now have less than 10%coverage, 14 of those countries are on the African continent. 20. Countries have set ambitious plans and vaccination targets, in the context of their national priorities and international goals. On average, the 34 countries are seekingto fully vaccinate 50% of their population by the end of 2022. 15 of them have set targets at orabove the WHO's goal of 70%. For countries to hit their nationally defined targets will requirethem to consolidate the progress they have made since January - and then to increase thatrate 3.5 times between now and the end of the year - as set out in figure 5. Internationalpartners are working to support countries to achieve those milestones, with a particular focuson reaching everyone in the high risk groups - older adults, healthcare workers, persons with co-morbidities including immunocompromised persons - which is likely to have the greatest healthimpact and return on investment with limited resources. How those targets are met - and whichpeople are protected first - is worth just as much attention as achieving the targets themselves.15 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTFIGURE 6: DOSES ADMINISTERED PER 100 PEOPLE IN 34 COUNTRIES FOR CONCERTED SUPPORT Trajectory needed to 2021 rates 1.

Going forward, helping countries to prioritise vaccinating those high risk groups within their national plans will have the most impact on reducing morbidity, mortality, and protecting health systems. These populations should also receive prioritised access tobooster doses where recommended - an even more important layer of protection against theOmicron variant. This should be a focus of vaccine delivery campaigns both across the AMC92and the 34 countries targeted for concerted support- where surveys suggest vaccination ratesamong vulnerable categories are lower than in high-income countries, especially among those60+, as shown in figure 7.16 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTFIGURE 8: SUMMARY OF THE RECENT PROGRESS MADE ACROSS THE 34 CONCERTED SUPPORT COUNTRIES, SPLIT ACROSS FOUR CATEGORIES. 1.

The most recent performance of the 34 concerted support countries can be shown across four different categories - as set out in figure 8. The categories demonstratewhich countries have been able to capitalise on vaccines now being available and the supportand attention provided through national systems and by international partners. They serve toillustrate where bottlenecks can be overcome with concerted support and highlight where furtherinternational support is needed. Countries agreed upon for immediate supportBetween January 25th - March 25th, 2022 Before vaccination rates417 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT23. The first group of seven countries have coverage levels over 10% with vaccination rates increasing. In general, these countries have benefitted from strong leadership engagement and have taken advantage of greater certainty over supply at the end of 2021 to implement new approaches to vaccination. For Uganda this meant taking the decision to move from fixed site delivery to mass vaccination campaigns to boost coverage. Driven by ambitious targets set from the President and with the support of the Ministry of Health and key partners, the campaign has been introduced in phases and led to three-fold increase in country coverage rates within two months. The campaign was backed by the introduction of appropriate digital tools which allowed for real time planning, monitoring, and adjustment of strategies. Ethiopia ramped up vaccination rates by pursuing bottom-up microplanning, ensuring timely disbursement of funds to local levels, and carrying out a similar series of phased mass vaccination campaigns. Ghana's recent success comes from combining a series of mass vaccination campaigns with a focus on increasing the number of sites available and using flexible, mobile, and door-to-door strategies in areas of low uptake. The involvement of community leaders and public vaccination of key figures increased social mobilisation. Sierra Leone has adopted a surge approach to accelerate COVID-19 vaccination with six surges completed (reaching 300,000-400,000 per surge) and now planning for a seventh surge. Both Ghana and Sierra Leone are success stories of countries effectively communicating urgent funding needs so that international partners can help coordinate rapid disbursement. 24. The second group of eight countries have coverage levels over 10% but with vaccination rates decreasing or stagnating. In the Central African Republic, with coverage levels approaching 17% after successful early campaigns, the focus now is on the need to develop bespoke micro-plans at the district level to create ownership and reach those who are willing to get vaccinated if the vaccines can be brought closer to them. In Afghanistan, 11% of the population has been fully vaccinated but recent performance has not maintained earlier pace due to adverse weather conditions, security challenges, shifting priorities to measles and other outbreaks and food shortages which are exacerbated by the economic situation and humanitarian challenges. The COVAX Humanitarian Buffer18 has also been deployed to provide 1.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Afghan refugees outside of Afghanistan. 25. The third group of five countries have coverage levels below 10% but with vaccination rates increasing. Countries in this group typically have very unique funding asks and specific challenges to improve vaccination coverage. In Nigeria, establishing a strategy that works at national but also at a state and local level is imperative. In February 2022, the CoVDP conducted a high-level mission in Nigeria to meet with political leaders at Federal and State levels to understand key bottlenecks and identify targeted areas of support to accelerate delivery of COVID-19 vaccines. Nigeria has now launched a refreshed national strategy based on state and micro level plans to tackle the identified blockages. These included setting state level targets to drive and monitor progress, tripling number of vaccination teams and engagement with religious and community leaders on community mobilisation and dialogue. Nine micro- plans have been submitted so far of the 36 expected. Out of 26 provinces, the Democratic Republic of Congo now has four provinces conducting mass vaccination campaigns and 16 providing vaccination through routine vaccination services which has driven the recent increase coverage despite low overall coverage (less than 1%).18 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT26. The fourth group of fourteen countries have coverage levels below 10% and have persistently low vaccination rates. Somalia's coverage has remained low despite strong performance in a few States due to a combination of issues including around vaccine tariffs, lack of operational plans, and competing priorities such as forthcoming elections, drought, and measles. Vaccination coverage in Burkina Faso has made limited progress overall with the country now just getting the first campaigns off the ground. Niger has had strong engagement from political leadership on COVID-19 vaccination, but continues to struggle with limited decentralised vaccine storage and insufficient mobile logistics for outreach (for example, motorbikes). Other factors underlying the limited performance are insufficient coordination across regions, insufficient personnel, especially to reach remote populations and inadequate storage and waste management facilities. 27. Moving forward, countries will need to be provided with financial and technical support to tailor their vaccine strategies to their national priorities. Governments are facing rising pressure to tackle other non-COVID-19 related health and economic priorities as people's risk perceptions of the pandemic wane. For example, outbreaks of measles and polio in Senegal have led to stagnating demand in 2022. This will likely require more integration of COVID-19 vaccine programs into national health services as part of long- term planning as the virus becomes endemic - a process which will take time. This will require establishment of regular adult vaccination programs in countries, rather than campaign approaches which are effective to rapidly increase coverage in the short-term. It will require a mix of modalities - for example continued campaigns where coverage levels remain very low, or where high-risk groups require additional support - and national programs depending on country circumstances and targeted at getting the best public health outcomes and return on investment. A clear focus here will help to ensure essential health services, like routine immunization, are maintained and protected during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. 28. Annex 1 provides a country-by country list which has more detail on the state of vaccine delivery across all 34 countries being provided with concerted support by the CoVDP and partners. It highlights the individual challenges that need to be addressed in more detail. The next section of this report provides a thematic overview of those challenges and summarises key success stories from countries within the AMC92 and 34 concerted support countries which have successfully accelerated vaccination rates. 19 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT29. The previous chapter demonstrated that a concerted effort will be required to increase coverage levels in the 34 countries being provided with support by international partners. To have any chance of success, and in light of the WHO's global 70% target, international partners will need to coordinate their efforts and work in line with countries' own vaccination strategies and implementation plans. Additionally, there are middle income countries which have not achieved their targets and prioritized actions are needed for them to rapidly accelerate. 30. There is no one size fits all solution. In normal times, national immunization programs and campaigns are intensively planned months and years in advance. Most but not all deliver childhood vaccines. Each country's health system operates differently. Many health systems in low and middle income countries are chronically underfunded. Vaccination strategies take into account local and regional differences and are adjusted to take account of cultural and historical factors and take years to develop. 31. Crucially, international partners must work together under the leadership of national governments to design and implement bespoke plans for each country that tackle the specific obstacles and challenges to achieving higher rates of COVID-19 vaccination. Many partners have a role to play here, including Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) whose local knowledge and expertise on the ground form an important part of both the development and delivery of national and subnational vaccination plans, including in humanitarian settings. 32. Despite inherent differences specific to each country, it is possible to draw out common obstacles that have been overcome by countries that have managed to deliver successful COVID-19 vaccination programs. Five core challenges will need to be tackled by the 34 countries to deliver sustainable increases in COVID-19 vaccination coverage.CHAPTER 3: OVERCOMING FIVE KEY CHALLENGES CAN HELP TO DRIVE VACCINE DELIVERY IN COUNTRIES WITH LOW VACCINE COVERAGE5 KEY CHALLENGES FOR VACCINE DELIVERY 1Ensuring strong leadership engagement & detailed vaccine planning 2Increasing the amount, speed, and coordination of funding 4Augmenting mission-critical healthcare system capacity 5Ensuring prioritisation of COVID-19 vaccination in addition to other health priorities3Reducing vaccine hesitancy and increasing demand for COVID-19 vaccination20 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTIn Rwanda, coordination between the Government, both at central and local levels, and development partners has been key to a successful COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Success is grounded in the proactive steps the Government has taken to ensure the availability and distribution of vaccines across the nation, working in a whole of government approach and with communities, coordinating with partners. The central government has met daily with local governments to identify challenges arising at district level. Those daily meetings cover the supply of vaccines, data improvements, the state of health and care workers, and rely on local skills and competencies to use digital tools. The country has reached 62% coverage rate and aims to vaccinate 86% of the population by the end of 2022.Country example RWANDA CHALLENGE 1: ENSURING STRONG LEADERSHIP ENGAGEMENT AND COMMITMENT TO DETAILED VACCINE PLANNING IN COUNTRIES WITH LOW VACCINATION COVERAGE 33. Experience has demonstrated that strong political leadership with clear governance and coordinating mechanisms are essential underlying factors for effective COVID-19 vaccine delivery. International guidance and frameworks are available to help countries introduce National Deployment and Vaccination Plans (NVDPs) - which helped provide the framework for over 100 countries to develop plans early in the pandemic. Underneath that, developing detailed operational microplans helps ensure the proper prioritization and distribution of human, financial, and medical resources for effective COVID-19 vaccine delivery. Countries with senior political and technical leaders committed to mobilizing the resources needed to scale up vaccination have shown success in raising demand and getting vaccines into arms. 34. Strong leadership and coordination across the national, subnational, and community levels is also key. At the national level, successful COVID-19 vaccine delivery focuses on creating an efficient coordination mechanism, enabling policy environment, functional procurement system, and healthy mechanisms for adequate and rapid resource allocation. At sub-national levels, including districts and sub- district levels, strong local governance, coordination, and monitoring mechanisms against set goals are key. Capacity is required to manage a complex array of actors including private sector, development partners, and communities including traditional and religious leaders. 35. Many of the 34 countries with less than 10% coverage in January 2022 have struggled with consistent coordination and engagement at the senior levels of government. In some countries, conflict and insecurity have posed an additional challenge to scale-up COVID-19 vaccination responses including reaching displaced populations. But where high government engagement and political commitment are exercised, results have been encouraging. Many countries have launched strategies with the public vaccination of Heads of State which is cited as key to trust and success in uptake of the vaccines. Rwanda, Seychelles, and Mauritius have achieved vaccination coverage of 60% through strong engagement. Among the 34 countries receiving concerted support, Ghana and Ethiopia have made good recent progress in aligning leadership behind clear plans. National structures such as a National Task Force or Technical Working Group (TWG) also enable effective oversight and coordination. After a concerted advocacy effort, Burundi approved its first NVDP in March 2022, and will now expand vaccination sites outside of the capital.21 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT36. International partners can play a role in helping countries tackle this challenge by engaging political leadership and supporting countries to develop and implement their national strategies and subnational operational plans. This can include providing additional surge capacity to work alongside the country coordination mechanisms - and by making sure that supportive efforts are docked into and well aligned with countries' own national mechanisms. Strong coordination and communication of all partners is essential to maximize the impact, avoid confusion, and build public trust in the vaccines and the immunization efforts. Morocco reached 40% vaccination coverage by end of 2021, is on track to achieve 70% coverage by end of June 2022, and is currently at 62%. The national vaccination program has had the highest level of political ownership from the beginning - King Mohamed VI was the first person to get vaccinated to build trust among the citizens. Success has been driven by a whole of government approach with strong governance. The Minister of Health chairs the National Steering Committee with cross-government representation. A clear vision of what to achieve and a deployment plan was ready in early 2021. Roles and responsibilities of different government offices/ ministries were spelled out clearly and strong oversight was in place for implementation.Country example MOROCCO 21 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT22 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTCHALLENGE 2: INCREASING THE AMOUNT, SPEED AND COORDINATION OF FUNDING IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURE THE FULL IMPACT OF HEIGHTENED POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT 37. External funding for COVID-19 vaccine delivery is an important complement to domestic budgetary resources for low- income countries and some lower middle-income countries - issues related to the efficiency, speed, and coordination of external funding are particularly relevant for these countries. Accurate budgeting is an important step towards efficient coordination of funding and can help countries leverage their domestic financing. Countries rely on multiple budgeting methods to estimate the cost of the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out and to reflect costs in their national budgets accordingly, including covering basic health costs such as the payment of health and care workers. These different methods include available global costing models, based on assumptions,19 budgeted National Deployment and Vaccination Plans (NDVPs), budgeted micro plans, and other budgets in funding proposals (that may be country level, regional or global). All these budgets need to be reconciled to provide a clear picture of funding needed and to build consensus on next steps with budgeting at country level. That is not always the case. 38. Increasing cove rage levels wil l require sign ificant funding over the course o f 2022, and beyond. Funding will need to come from domestic sources, MDBs, internatio nal and regional agencies, as wel l as donor partners. Interna tional estimate s on the size of funding required for delivery vary. Detailed bo ttom-up costs f rom the countri es required concer ted report are being compil ed by the CoVDP. A recent study s uggested national in- country deliver y investment nee ds of US$ 3.7 bi llion across 133 low- and middle-income cou ntries20. ACT-A partne rs have identified a need of US$ 1. 7 billion of addi tional grant fund ing for deliver y to help cou ntries fill these gaps. Gavi was able t o raise its US$ 600 million reque st in full at t he Break COVID Now summit on 8 April. That leaves a remaining gap of US$ 1.1 bi llion split between UNICEF (US$ 575 milli on) and WHO (US$ 525 million) on t op of the country-specific delivery support that is being delineated as p art of the CoVDP process in each country - where contributions by MDBs and other bil ateral donors, funders ( e.g. private sec tor) and regional partners will be needed. For example, the World Bank h as made significant funding ava ilable for delivery across its approved vaccine pro jects in over 70 countries, more th an half of which are in Afri ca. US$ 700 milli on of funding fo r delivery was originally earmarked for de livery in World Bank vaccine p rojects approved in the 34 countries rece iving concerted s upport - although in total aro und U S$ 1.3 billion in appr oved but unalloc ated funding rema ins available a t countries' request to be used for vaccine- related activitie s. The Government of Chad and development partners have jointly planned a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Under the leadership of the recently appointed Minister of Health and following the recommendations of the revised National Vaccine Deployment Plan, a vaccination campaign to accelerate COVID-19 vaccination was planned by the Ministry of Public Health and National Solidarity and partners. The COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership worked with the World Bank task team to coordinate their support and align investments. The campaign, which covers 10 out of 23 provinces, was launched by the Minister of Health on March 24th. The overall cost was estimated at US$ 5.7 million and financed by Gavi (US$ 1.2 million), the World Bank (US$ 2.3 million) and UNICEF (US$ 2.2 million). A second phase of the campaign is planned in May to cover the remaining 13 provinces.Country example CHAD 23 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT39. All international partners must work with countries to support budget preparation and ensure that budgets include COVID-19 vaccine delivery financing needs. The CoVDP , in collaboration with countries, is developing a roadmap to better coordinate across the multiple delivery funding streams that already exist. Having a single agreed budget in support of the plan to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine delivery ensures clarity and accuracy on countries' funding needs, provides clarity across bilateral and multilateral donors, and ensures there is a structure to align funders with needs at a country level. 40. A variety of factors need to align to ensure that external funding can flow smoothly, and at the right pace and scale to meet country needs. For Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) financing, which flows through government budgets, government leadership and the speed of budgetary approval processes and other country processes are critical determinants of the speed and efficiency with which resources are utilized. Beyond MDB financing, flexibility on the part of donors and external partners is another important factor. Some donors have priorities and restrictions on the way in which their funds can be used. These are not always aligned with government priorities and plans. For example, although there is increased discussion of incorporating COVID-19 vaccines in routine immunization programs, some partners remain strongly oriented towards solely funding COVID-19 vaccination without wanting to strengthen the routine immunization platform through which these vaccines are delivered. Gavi, UNICEF, and WHO have been providing grant money for delivery to help catalyse action at the country level, which has been particularly useful and in high demand in countries where the speed of national budgetary processes have not unlocked other sources of finance in time to help build systems as vaccines have arrived in country, or where finance ministries have not wanted to allocate approved MDB financing towards COVID-19 delivery. 41. More broadly, government capacity to coordinate across multiple donors and partners is crucial. Countries themselves need regular information on the timing, flexibility, application requirements and roles and responsibilities of funding sources. This information needs to be clear to avoid undermining the ability of countries to make best use of external funding. But this situation on the ground is complex. There are now many more different sources of funding available than ever before in immunization. Many individual funders have bespoke application processes, requirements, strategies, and disbursement timelines. At a global level, the Multilateral Leaders Task Force can play a role here to use its convening power and financial leverage to step up international actions for fast and equitable vaccine delivery and align bilateral and multilateral partners around the 'One Country Team', 'One Plan', 'One Budget' approach of the CoVDP .For much of 2021, Ethiopia struggled to devise a comprehensive national vaccination strategy faced with unpredictable dose allocations which made it difficult to plan effectively. As the supply of vaccines became more predictable in 2022 the country was able to review its delivery strategies and had enough confidence in the situation to organize immunization campaigns. These campaigns were supported with funding from the WB, GAVI, UNICEF, WHO and other partners that to date have jointly provided US$ 196 million of funding to Ethiopia to support delivery efforts. In mid-March the country finished its second campaign, has administered 29 million vaccines, and 20% of the population is now fully vaccinated - including 3.7 million over the age of 65.Country example ETHIOPIA24 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTCHALLENGE 3: REDUCING VACCINE HESITANCY AND INCREASING DEMAND FOR COVID-19 VACCINATION INCLUDING THROUGH RISK COMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT (RCCE) 42. Converting vaccines to vaccinations is becoming the key to winning the race between vaccines and variants to end the pandemic - and doing that requires strong and sustained country- led vaccination strategies. Even at the best of times, introducing a new vaccine and promoting demand for vaccination, especially among a new population is complex and challenging. Vaccine decision making is influenced by psychological, sociological, and environmental drivers. Promoting pro-vaccination behaviors and social norms requires an in-depth understanding of those drivers, so that detailed social and behaviour change interventions can be designed to address them. After two years of multiple waves, with cases declining, rates of hospitalization and death decreasing, several COVID-19 related public health measures being removed, and other priorities rising - making that case is becoming increasingly difficult and the messaging needs to evolve accordingly. 43. Over the coming months, promoting demand for vaccination among their populations will become a crucial determinant of success for each country . But there is a good baseline upon which to build. Recent surveys (as set out in figure 9) suggest many people in countries with low vaccination rates would be willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine if they were informed of and able to get access to one. Despite evidence of vaccine hesitancy among the population - just as for higher income countries - this suggests demand should not be considered the primary barrier to raising coverage. Focus should be placed in understanding the drivers and barriers of vaccination of local communities and helping those who want to get vaccinated to get a vaccine, so that the positive social norm is well-established, making it easier for those hesitant to follow the norm and get vaccinated.The Philippines offers some important lessons on how to address deeply entrenched and widespread vaccine hesitancy (due to the adverse effects of a dengue vaccine administered to school children in 2015-2016). With support from a range of development partners and the World Bank's vaccine financing operations, the Government adopted a multi-pronged approach to addressing hesitancy, with visible results. Efforts have included i) engaging celebrities and religious leaders to serve as vaccine advocates; ii) training of health and care and community-based peer educators; and iii) rolling out incentives and nudges to drive uptake, including raffles, free transportation to vaccination sites, and SMS reminders. The Philippines now has 59% of its population fully vaccinated.

Efforts were made to ensure the final sample was representative of the wider population but varied depending on the methodology used. 44. Pro-equity, gender sensitive, tailored strategies based on evidence is key to encouraging vaccine uptake and maintaining public trust in vaccines. While there may be high willingness to get vaccinated, the general roll-back of restrictions and lower risk perception of death or serious illness also mean people are less inclined to make an extra effort to get vaccinated in many lower income countries. Additionally, there is residual hesitancy and concerns over vaccine efficacy and safety among certain groups, including women, younger people, marginalized groups, and some health and care workers - which can have a broader impact if not considered as part of an overall strategy. Women have specific concerns related to vaccine safety such as whether the vaccine is safe for pregnant and lactating mothers, which need to be addressed to build their trust in vaccines. In some countries, low trust in institutions, which includes governments and pharmaceutical companies, can amplify this further. Engaging communities in co-designing and co-creating local solutions not only for vaccine uptake but also associated preventive behaviors such as testing, mask use, and hand washing has proved to be effective. 45. Countries that have achieved higher levels of vaccination coverage have used a variety of approaches to make it easier for people to find places to get vaccinated. This has included offering immunization services on a continual basis, by appointment or walk-in, or mass campaigns that mobilize large numbers of health workers and community members in a specific time interval. The latter has historically proved to a very successful way to immunize large numbers of individuals in a short period of time in lower income settings. 26 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT46. National vaccination plans need to be flexible, with tailored communication at regional and subregional levels. The fast-evolving situation of COVID-19 has made this a particular challenge. But countrieswho have been successful have generated social data and insights fromtheir communities to develop and implement risk communication andcommunity engagement (RCCE) plans. The best of those plans takeinnovative ways of collecting social data from the population in real-timeand use it to both calibrate demand, and decide where, how, and with whomto target vaccination campaigns. They support and equip health workersto perform outreach tasks, explain possible side-effects, and monitor theimpact of any adverse events. They are developed at the community level, with local people and workers and are designed to bridge gaps in inequality. Developing specific interventions to increase the rate of women beingvaccinated has been key in increasing the uptake of COVID-19 vaccinein many countries. At the same time, there is a need for coordinatedefforts to build confidence in vaccination and combat misinformation -particularly directed through social media. Partnerships with private sector, CSOs, media, academia, and faith-based organizations are important toincrease community engagement. Understanding community perceptionsand working with trusted sources to allay concerns is integral to buildingtrust in vaccination. In South Sudan, where female vaccination wassignificantly lower, focus group discussions with women to identify barriersto vaccination informed targeted RCCE efforts and evidence-based advocacythrough female influencers that saw an increase in vaccination from 25% to43% in females. 47. International partners can play a role by providing coordinated support to drive increased demand across countrieswhile putting emphasis on vulnerable, marginalized communities. Working in line with countries' own plans, they can help to develop andfund targeted campaigns to increase coverage. That involves knowledge andevidence-based research on sub-population specific effective approaches. Ensuring that appropriate funding for RCCE plans and strategies areincluded in national plans and supported in a coordinated way bypartners is key - where possible building this into long-term plans beyondcampaigns. It is also important to demonstrate how the available fundshave been spent to strengthen transparency and accountability and improveeffectiveness of the spending.Country example I NDIA Despite having one of the highest rates of vaccination acceptance in the world, India has worked with international partners to develop bespoke campaigns to reduce vaccine hesitanc y. Responding to insights in an international survey , partners developed eight campaigns - four in English and four in Hindi -- all of which targeted both men and women with the goal of increasing the public's confi dence in the COVID-19 vaccine. The campaigns linked directly to the Government of India's COVID-19 website24 which provided more information on vac cines, r egistration for app ointments, and how to get vaccination certificates. The eight campaigns reached a combined total of over 98 million p eople. Ov erall, the campaigns improved attitudes among the Indian public towards COVID-19 vac cines, including their effectiveness and whether people would recommend them to friends or famil y. Campaigns emphasizing social norms such as national momentum and content depicting testimonials with diverse messengers including health and care workers and parents achieved the greatest lift in attitudes, showcasing the importance of leveraging credible voices in the quest to address vaccine hesitanc y.27 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTCHALLENGE 4: URGENTLY AUGMENTING MISSION-CRITICAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM CAPACITIES TO INCREASE VACCINATION RATES 48. COVID-19 has placed unprecedented strain on healthcare systems around the world and exacerbated pre-existing health issues. Countries which entered the pandemicwith strong existing healthcare systems and resilient and well-functioning immunizationprograms have generally had far greater successes with their COVID-19 vaccination rollouts. Urgently augmenting critical healthcare capacities to increase vaccination rates is an essentialpriority. A functioning health system needs core essential functions to deliver vaccines atscale - a trained, remunerated, and effective health workforce, a robust supply chain, capacityto engage with and mobilize communities and address questions about vaccination throughdialogue, and a mix of appropriate vaccine delivery sites and data and monitoring systems. Asfigure 10 shows, those countries which entered the pandemic with stronger health systems haveon average achieved greater levels of vaccine coverage. FIGURE 10: VACCINATION COVERAGE SHOWN AGAINST THE STRENGTH OF HEALTH SYSTEMS PRE-PANDEMIC Haiti DRCongoBurundiSyriaLaos Palau Lebanon Libya Algeria 0040 50 75 100CAR ChadMicronesia KiribatiNauruBhutanCambodia IndiaMongolia Guyana UAE 34 countries for concerted support Other countriesUHC index Note: Line represents the linear best fit calculated across all countries. Sources: UHC Index: 2022)28 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT49. Insufficient trained and remunerated health and care workers has been highlighted by countries21 as the most common cause of service disruptions and bottleneck in the delivery of essential COVID-19 tools. The pandemic has had a profound adverse impact on health and care workers. Approximately 115,000 are estimated to have died in the first 18 months of the pandemic22. Many countries had insufficient human resources for health to meet essential services needs prior to COVID-19, leaving little to no spare capacity to meet additional requirements related to the pandemic. Health and care workers - most of whom are women - entered the pandemic in a precarious position, facing challenges such as low pay, high gender pay gaps, and high levels of harassment and violence in the workplace. Health and care workers are often not provided with an adequate remuneration; incentives to carry out additional tasks may not suffice if the underlying working conditions and remuneration levels are inadequate. 50. Correcting this requires an integrated set of policy actions to protect and support health care workers - improving working conditions, occupational health and safety, prioritizing vaccination and adequate IPC practices, and manageable workloads. Across many countries, a scale-up of the health workforce may be required to respond to temporary or sustained spikes in the demand for vaccines, depending on the scenario and local epidemiologic patterns. This can be achieved through a mix of new hires, redeployment, and optimization of scopes of practice and roles. Factoring in these needs in short- and medium-term workforce projections and budget allocation decisions is essential for a sustainable response to the pandemic, while avoiding an over-reliance on re-deployment and minimizing disruptions to the provision of essential health services. 51. The unusual characteristics of COVID-19 vaccines have posed significant logistical and supply chain challenges for countries with lower capacity in their health systems. Many countries are equipped to deal with routine vaccines that require storage in a traditional range of 2 to 8 \u00b0C. Storing and distributing COVID-19 vaccines has required enormous effort to expand their cold chain capacity and for many, introduce ultra-cold chain storage systems for the first time so vaccines can be kept at -70 \u00b0C. Many countries have successfully modernized their cold storage infrastructure with support from international partners. In addition, thetarget populations for COVID-19 vaccinations are vastly different from thetraditional national immunization programs which are focused on children, adolescents, and pregnant women. Defining supply chain strategies tosupport vaccination activities at a population wide scale is an enormouschallenge. Another challenge is safely disposing of the large amount ofwaste generated from vaccination activities.Sri Lanka has met all WHO targets for population coverage ahead of target and with 65% fully vaccinated, is on-track to achieve 70% coverage by mid-2022. These gains have been achieved despite significant fiscal and debt challenges. At the centre of this success is a strong, publicly funded and delivered primary health care-led health system. The overarching principle of equity - embodied in free and quality careaccessible to all - has been sustainedthroughout the pandemic withsignificant Government investment invaccination services. The COVID-19 response quickly built on a well-functioning routine immunization network, including trained health workers and effective supply-chain, to rapidly roll-out COVID-19 vaccination. This foundation allowed many innovations to be successfully implemented during COVID-19. An innovative Vaccine Tracker that updates on availability of vaccines, status of vaccines administered and issuing of vaccination cards has proved popular and is now being considered for the basis to introduce a permanent health-card for all services.Country example SRI LANKA29 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTIn Tajikistan, the World Bank's US$ 46.2 million program has helped with the procurement of vaccines via COVAX cost-sharing, and delivery, key consumables, expansion of the electronic vaccine and COVID-19 testing registration system, and vaccine certificates. The World Bank and international partners have supported the government in combating hesitancy, through high-level messaging, targeted messaging to communities, training of health professionals and the use of community volunteers. Nearly 50% of the population is now vaccinated, compared to under 30% just three months ago.Country example TAJIKISTAN52. A country-specific mixture of mass vaccination sites in dense urban areas and flexible local capacity and mobile clinics are required to reach higher levels of coverage and to reach underserved and underrepresented populations. In many difficult environments, people cannot spend half a day in search of a vaccine, so vaccines need to be brought to them. Mass vaccination sites and national immunization campaigns, adapted for local and community contexts, can bring vaccinations closer to the communities they serve. Countries require support to design the most appropriate combination of providing immunization from existing fixed vaccination or medical sites, temporary pop-up facilities, public gathering zones, special campaigns, mobile outreach clinics, or even bus-stops that bring immunization closer to clients. In some countries, private facilities have not yet been involved in service delivery, which can be a missed opportunity to scale up vaccination more rapidly given the sizeable coverage of populations that they have. Special strategies are required to reach women, older populations, the disabled, vulnerable populations such as refugees, internally displaced persons, those living in prisons, military camps, and those marginalized in their community - such as individuals living with HIV. 53. Delivering national vaccination campaigns for entire adult populations which can respond to the evolving epidemiological situation requires improvements in data and monitoring systems in most countries. The demand for complete, real-time, granular, and precise data was not compatible with the pre-pandemic data monitoring systems in many countries. As a starting point, COVID-19 vaccine modules were often added to existing data monitoring systems. Progress has been made as COVID-19 vaccination programs have been established and there has been a leap in innovation and digitalization across many government systems. The need for accurate information on vaccine logistic systems, vaccine administration, and safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines from subnational to national level drove this development as it was needed to monitor the roll out and drive actions. Challenges remain, and investment in electronic health and logistic systems is a priority to improve standards and to embed upgraded systems that leave a legacy for the future. Of particular importance is the need to improve data and monitoring systems for high risk groups to ensure that COVID-19 vaccine programs can be adopted and adjusted against evolving science and needs. 54. International partners can play a key role in helping countries to strengthen their national health systems as part of the COVID-19 vaccination response - in many cases building on the core work already undertaken by organization like GAVI, UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank. Providing countries with support to maintain and expand their core immunization programs alongside the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines has a double benefit - providing greater protection for the population now while also acting as a longer-term investment into health systems strengthening and part of pandemic preparedness and response ahead of the next crisis. In the short- term, reaching ambitious coverage targets requires a surge workforce to support vaccination, which can be achieved by task-shifting across various groups and considering the provision of financial incentives for increased workloads. Building health worker knowledge and confidence through education on vaccine development, effectiveness, and safety is key. They also need training on how to address common questions and concerns in a respectful and open dialogue so they can maintain public trust in vaccines. Partners can also support country governments to invest in data systems to improve traceability and monitoring of vaccine stocks and utilization as well as vaccination implementation and investments in climate-friendly infrastructure.30 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTCHALLENGE 5: ENSURING LOW COVERAGE COUNTRIES CAN PRIORITISE COVID-19 VACCINATION IN ADDITION TO OTHER PRESSING HEALTH PRIORITIES 55. Across many of the 34 countries s elected for concerted support, the levels of severe illness and death from COVID-19 are trending downwards - refocusing attention on other health priorities tha t have been neglected during the pandem ic. Data suggests disruptions to essential health s ervices that have begun since the beginni ng of the pandemic pers ist across all regions and income l evels. A recent WHO survey23 suggested that 92% of 127 countries were experiencing some extent of disruptions in at least one e ssential health service. I n som e health services, such as emer gency care, disruptions have i ncreas ed, showing that the en tire health system in many countries is strug gling to recover and reduce back logs. Routine and essential health programs have suffered in the last 24 months including childhoo d and adolescent immunization, surveillance of measles and other infec tious diseases, malaria, and cervical cancer eliminat ion programs. The recent polio case i n Ma lawi, and surge in measles ca ses in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, and Pa kistan are warning signals o f the possibility of a resurgenc e of other communicable diseases unless routine services can be put back on t rack. For many governments, faced with proportionally less hospi taliza tions and mortality rates from COVID-19 than earlier in the pandemic, this is becoming the pr iority. 56. In acknowledgement of these ch allenges, integrating the del ivery of COVID-19 vaccines alongside other essential h ealth services is emerging as a key measure to increase coverage levels. Maximizing the use of COVID-19 resources and COVID-19 vaccine roll- out experiences to strengthen i mmunizati on programs and primary health care systems should be the first practical step towards achie ving this integration. With countries facing other com peting health priorities, COVID-19 vacci nation programs must be bundle d up together and provided alongside other health interventi ons. They can be designed to t ake advantage of places where people already have other touc h point s with health and care work ers - most obviously when the y arrive for routine immunization s for other diseases, but this can also be bundled up with other health interventions. For example, integrating access to COVID-19 v accines with broader routine adult health services such as ph arma cies, clinics, and outposts. 57. Large-scale vaccination campaigns can al so play an important role as a strategy to accelerate coverage, but these must be carried out in a manner that does not detract from routine immunization and other hea lth priorities. As set out in the previou s chapter, recent mass vaccination campaigns in E thiopia, Ghana, and Uganda are go od examples where countries have focused specific and targeted dr ives to increase coverage - suppo rted by international partners - and well aligned with their national health systems. Moving forward will require a careful phasingof mass vaccination campaigns with the gradual increase in the delivery of COVID-19 vaccinesalongside other routine interventions - in an acceptance that COVID-19 will most likely be here tostay and so will need to be become part of countries' longer-term immunization strategies. Properintegration can also leave a positive long-term legacy. COVID-19 vaccination roll-out targetingadults has raised awareness, acceptance, and motivation for vaccination across the life-course. Thedevelopment of these delivery platforms and strategies for vaccination of health workers, elderly, pregnant women, and people with comorbidities provide opportunities to integrate other vaccinesand additional interventions more easily for these population groups.31 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT58. Some countries have already taken steps to maintain their essential health services by leveraging and integrating them as much as possible with COVID-19 vaccine delivery, although the range of integration varies significantly. In general, countries have been relatively successful in linking together the supply and delivery of different vaccine types and common usage of cold chain facilities, but less successful in integrating together overall planning and funding of combined health programs and health and care workers. There are good examples where countries have leveraged an outreach session planned for COVID-19 vaccine delivery as an opportunity to also provide routine immunization services to the same community. In Sudan, with health services facing many competing priorities, plans are underway to integrate COVID-19 vaccination with routine immunization in all health facilities - a recognition that a longer-term approach that builds capacity more slowly is likely to be the most sustainable approach to increase coverage levels. To take this to the next level, countries should consider examining the optimal COVID-19 vaccination targets within the content of their own national health systems and socio- economic goals. 59. Further efforts are required to increase coverage in fragile, conflict, and vulnerable (FCV) settings. Particularly, refugees, migrants, asylum seekers, stateless people internally displaced, and other populations of concern residing on or near front lines (i.e. inaccessible) are at higher risk of being overlooked in the global COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. Data from UN OCHA shows only 3.4% of doses administered globally were administered in countries with ongoing humanitarian crises. The UN's Inter-Agency Standing Committee put the number of people at 155 million globally in 2022, including many in the 34 countries being provided with concerted support. 19 of the 34 countries identified for concerted support by the CoVDP are included in the Global Humanitarian Overview for 2022. A recent study by the International Office of Migration (IOM) underscored the gap in vaccine access for refugees in particular, as only 46% had access to COVID-19 vaccines in practice, compared to 83% of migrants in regular situations. In such settings, countries have faced a wider range of urgent health and non-health priorities with regular health service disruptions and limited resources. It is even more crucial that COVID-19 vaccine delivery support and funding is integrated into the delivery of existing primary care services and humanitarian assistance where possible. This is being carried out in places like Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria, Ethiopia, and Sudan. Humanitarian partners, working closely with international and national health partners, CSOs, and with active community engagement, need to place a particular focus on developing quality micro- plans, tailored to the community level, to support access to a bundle of health services, including routine vaccination and access to humanitarian assistance at sub-national level. Each FCV setting provides a unique opportunity and challenge for COVID-19 rollout given the impact on vulnerability as a result of the global pandemic. 60. International partners can assist countries here by demonstrating how introduction and scale-up of COVID-19 vaccination can be used to strengthen immunization programs and primary health care systems and prepare for the longer- term. The political and societal attention on immunization and COVID-19 investments can be used to channel support for long-term health system strengthening components. This can include boosts to vaccine management capacity and cold chain equipment, social listening and communication, community engagement, real-time monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination coverage, and use of new digital technologies to enhance immunization program management and primary health care delivery. International partners can help countries ensure high levels of COVID-19 vaccine coverage are not achieved at the expense of other immunization program given the risk of resurgence of other preventable diseases by continuing to focus countries' attention on the implementation of long-term strategies (such as the WHO's Immunization Agenda 2030, Gavi's 5.0 strategic plan, and the delivery of the World Bank's IDA20 targets for health system strengthening). 31 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT32 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT61. The pace and breadth of the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in high income and upper-middle income countries is unprecedented. Although reported cases and deaths are declining globally, and several countries have lifted restrictions, the pandemic is far from over - and it will not be over anywhere until it's over everywhere. More cases can be expected wherever public health and social measures are being lifted, and deaths wherever populations are under vaccinated, especially among the most vulnerable. 62. However, low and lower-middle income countries have achieved far lower coverage due to severe delays in accessing doses during 2021, falling short of global targets. High income countries have administered nine times more doses per inhabitant compared to low-income countries. But over the past few months, those gaps have been narrowing. The supply of COVID-19 vaccines is no longer a binding constraint. And while many countries are managing to organize vaccination campaigns quickly as supply ramps up, in some countries increasing supply is highlighting critical bottlenecks to getting vaccines from airports to arms, including the distribution, delivery, and demand generation challenges highlighted in this report - particularly among the 34 focus countries supported by the CoVDP and international partners. 63. Tackling these bottlenecks will have global as well as local benefits to health, security, and the economy. Until vaccination rates are high everywhere, there will be an increased risk of new variants. Until high risk groups are fully vaccinated, the risk of serious outbreaks remains elevated. COVID-19, as it has consistently done over the past two years, will still have the potential to mutate again and cause serious harm by knocking-down the global defences provided by the current COVID-19 toolkit of vaccines, tests, treatments, and PPE. This makes the case for increasing levels of vaccine deployment as a global risk mitigation approach, alongside the further support and development for other COVID-19 tools. It is also likely that it will be impossible to eliminate COVID-19 entirely from the world and it will continue to circulate indefinitely, resulting in periodic outbreaks and endemicity. In an endemic scenario where the length of immunity conferred through infection or vaccination is not long-lasting, there may be a need for regular boosting. This is a further case for strengthening immunization capacity, building out adult vaccination programs which can deliver COVID-19, influenza, and other necessary vaccines, and securing a strong platform for pandemic risks of the future. 64. Infectious diseases with pandemic potential are a threat to global economic stability and security. Health security should be viewed as an investment rather than just a cost. Investment in vaccine delivery will also support improvements in people processes, systems, and infrastructure to strengthen overall national health systems. This has the dual benefit of making the world better prepared to fight the next pandemic. Even if these investments reduce the large economic cost of future pandemics even modestly, the return on investment, in absolute terms, would be substantial - making the allocation of additional funding for fighting pandemics and health system strengthening both domestically and overseas a priority for all. 65. This report has set out serious and urgent obstacles that need to be tackled to drive increased vaccine delivery, protect those in high risk groups, and ensure sustained economic recovery and growth. The following are a list of recommendations that can be taken forward by countries, international partners and agencies, and G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to achieve those goals.CHAPTER 4: CONCLUSION33 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTPRIORITY ACTIONS FOR G20 FINANCE MINISTERS AND CENTRAL BANK GOVERNORS 1. Fully fund the remaining US$ 1.1 billion requested by ACT-A's CoVDP partners for vaccine delivery while noting the support available from MDBs and other partners - and commit to close the gap on the remaining US$ 14 billion ACT-A budget asks including for COVID-19 tests and treatments. 2. Advocate with political leaders and Finance Minister counterparts to ensure all countries urgently accelerate vaccination to reach coverage targets, especially by vaccinating all high risk populations. 3. Mobilize financing for crucial national health system capacities including immunization programs. 4. Advocate and act to keep borders open and reduce tariffs and other trade and regulatory barriers applied to vaccines, inputs, and ancillary products, so that supply chains can run smoothly, and to facilitate access to COVID-19 tools. 5. Review progress against the COVID-19 vaccine delivery challenges outlined in this report at G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors' meetings in July, October, and November. PRIORITY ACTIONS FOR COUNTRIES WITH LOW COVID-19 VACCINATION COVERAGE 1. Ensure strong leadership engagement and commitment to detailed and costed vaccination plans and national targets, including for emergency funding requests. 2. Prioritise fully vaccinating high risk populations, as laid out in WHO guidance. 3. Promote demand for COVID-19 vaccination including through targeted Risk Communication and Community Engagement to address vaccine hesitancy. 4. Integrate COVID-19 vaccination programs alongside the strengthening and restoration of health systems, including routine immunization programs. 5. In humanitarian settings, integrate COVID-19 vaccination with humanitarian activities and promote safe and unhindered access for the delivery of COVID-19 vaccinations to populations in need. 6. Provide additional layers of protection, ensuring sufficient focus is also placed on accelerating the delivery of other COVID-19 tools such as tests and treatments. PRIORITY ACTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS AND AGENCIES 1. Align coordination at the global level, through COVAX/ACT-Accelerator with support from the Multilateral Leaders Task Force, and at the country level, grounded in the One Country Team approach of the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership behind the challenges set out in this report. 2. Agree and deliver on rapid timeframes to respond to emergency funding and technical assistance requests from countries (CoVDP partners aim to disburse funds for clearly expressed needs within 15 days). 3. Support countries to build sustainable COVID-19 vaccination programs adaptable to evolving priorities over time. 4. Coordinate together and with vaccine manufacturers to provide countries with predictable forward timelines for the supply of vaccines matched against demand - coordinate dose donations through global and regional mechanisms, including COVAX and AVAT, to avoid fragmentation.34 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTANNEX 1 Country Profile | Afghanistan 39 73rd10% 11% Country metrics dashboard Health care system strength out of 1001Rank out of AMC92Ultra- cold chain capacity (doses (k)) Pipeline capacityExisting capacity 000 Total future capacityHealth system strengthDelivery funding from development partners (US$ m)Between February 4th, 2022 and April 4th, 2022 Before 2022 050%100% UNICEF Gavi0.4 7.513.0 WHO World Bank20.9 2.0 3.8 6 7.0 Disbursed ApprovedP ending approval Estimated financing availableProgress against key challenges Total coverage Recent progress largely driven by urban campaigns - how ever, the country's vaccination campaigns are currently paused by Ministry of Health.

Every country has faced challenges to ensure that their populations are vaccinated, protected, and tested. Trade has played a critical role in the fight of the pandemic; and the multilateral trading system underpins the exchange of inputs and products that result in smooth supply chains that enable global access to the required vaccines and ancillary products, transport, and logistics services to successfully roll out vaccination campaigns. ii. The roll-out of many COVID-19 vaccines was the result of collaborative efforts (partnerships) among private companies, government agencies and/or academic institutions. Multilateral rules, as implemented into the domestic legal framework, that enable sharing intellectual property, transfer technology and know-how underpin these collaborations that enabled unparalleled speed in the development and manufacturing of vaccines. Notably, partnerships were built up rapidly in just a few weeks or months.1 iii. During the first six months of 2021, global trade in vaccines was 26% higher than for the full 12 months of 2020.2 Charts 1 and 2, below, show, respectively, the total supply of COVID-19 vaccines, covering both exported and domestically delivered doses, by producing economy;3 as well as the imports by income group.4ANNEX 2: EFFECTS OF TRADE-RELATED MEASURES ON COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENT CHART 1: SUPPLY AND EXPORTS, BY PRODUCING ECONOMY Source: WTO-IMF Vaccine Trade Tracker (31 January 2022)54 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTCHART 2: IMPORTS BY INCOME GROUP (MILLIONS OF DOSES) Source: WTO-IMF Vaccine Trade Tracker (31 January Low incomeLower middle incomeUpper middle incomeHigh income Population (million) Doses per 100 people Number of doses (millions) iv. The growth in vaccine trade was also accompanied by increasing trade in related products, which also have wide manufacturing and distribution chains. Imports and exports of medical goods were valued at USD 2,343 billion in 2020, a 16% growth compared to the previous year. In contrast, the total value of world merchandise trade contracted by 7.6% in 2020. Global trade in products essential to fight the pandemic and, particularly, roll out vaccination campaigns, such as face masks, syringes, and gloves, grew by 31% in 2020.5 v. Of the 34 countries provided with concerted support by the CoVDP , only 29 are WTO Members.6 This Annex provides a background on the trade measures that were implemented during the pandemic. Where possible, it focuses on measures adopted by these 29 Members. Data on certain of these Members is scarce or remains unavailable, as most are least developed countries and, hence, benefit from transition periods for the domestic implementation of WTO disciplines. CUSTOMS PROCEDURES AND TRADE FACILITATING MEASURES vi. Many WTO Members adopted measures to facilitate access to critical health products, by simplifying import, export, and transit procedures, for example by establishing priority clearance channels (i.e., green lanes), streamlining documentary requirements, enabling electronic processing, and strengthening cooperation among border agencies from different countries.755 ACCELERATING Countries AVGSenegal Solomon Islands Malawi Mali The Gambia Madagascar Papua New Guinea Nigeria Niger Cote d'Ivoire Burundi Chad Afghanistan Zambia Central African Republic Ghana Burkina Faso Tanzania Cameroon Gabon Guinea Uganda Kenya Sierra Leone Djibouti Guinea-Bissau Haiti Yemen Ethiopia Somalia South Sudan Sudan FACILITATION AGREEMENT - PROGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION COMMITMENTS OF THE 34 FOCUS COUNTRIES (MARCH 2022)vii. Existing information suggests that, in the 29 Members, customs procedures might be affecting imports of key products to fight the pandemic, as they are underperformingconsiderably in the notified implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA). 8 Sev eral of the 29 Members have a high share of committed TFA implementation, particularly, the Democratic Republic of Congo (100%), Senegal (77.7%) and the Solomon Islands (77.3%). However, this contrasts with the low degree of TFA implementation commitments by several other countries, three of which (Guinea Bissau, Haiti, and Yemen) have not yet notified their commitments, as shownin Chart 3. This strongly suggests that vaccines and ancillary products might be facing significantchallenges upon importation and transit through many of the 34 Focus Countries because ofinefficient customs procedures. Reportedly, land-locked countries including Afghanistan, havereported issues related to the lack of border coordination, burdensome documentary requirements, insufficient human and financial resources or infrastructure deficiencies. 956 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTIMPORT TARIFFS ix. In low-income countries, vaccine imports are mainly the result of government procurement and/or donations; and therefore, enter most of these territories duty free. However, tariffs applied to products related to the storage, distribution, and the administrationof vaccines (e.g., facemasks, gloves, syringes, and needles) might have an impact on access, affordability and the actual roll-out of vaccination campaigns, as such tariffs tend to be high forrevenue purposes. x. Chart 5 shows the latest available applied tariffs for 18 of the 34 countries provided with concerted support. Their tariffs are generally higher than the 8.75% world average for thesame set of products. Only six of these Members, Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Mali, Nigeria, and Zambia, have introduced temporary elimination of tariffs for essential goods to fight theCOVID 19 pandemic.41 16 12 9 10 13 12 0 9 5 426 25 21 20 14 14 12 6 3Face and eye protection Protective garments Sanitizers/Disinfectants Gloves Pharmaceuticals Other medical supplies (syringes etc.) Foodstus Medical devices and equipment COVID-19 Test kits Vaccines In force rst 6 months 2020 In force March 2022CHART 4: EXPORT PROHIBITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19, COVERED PRODUCTSTRADE-RESTRICTING MEASURES viii. The number of export restricting measures, implemented by WTO Members, peaked in April 2020. Almost half of those measures have been rolled back. However, someproducts, such as pharmaceuticals, medical devices and equipment, other medical supplies, COVID-19 test kits and vaccines appear to be as restricted as they were during the first six monthsof 2020. This seems to suggest that global shortages in these products persist. Products related tothe rollout of vaccination campaigns were covered by these measures, as shown in Table 4. 1057 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTxi. Notably, Kenya applies the highest tariffs, reaching 13.8% for products related to vaccine storage and distribution. ECOWAS Members have a common external tariff of 10% for storage, distribution, and administration products, as well as 5% for syringes, needles, andrubber gloves. Papua New Guinea does not apply tariffs on products related to vaccine storage, distribution, and administration, including gloves; but applies a 12.5% tariff for facemasks. Cameroon levies the highest import tariff on masks (30%) and rubber gloves (17.5%); as well asfor products related to vaccine storage, distribution, and administration (15.6%). REGULATORY ISSUES xii. Over the last 18 months, many WTO have Members facilitated trade through streamlined regulatory procedures, such as temporary and emergency authorization tospeed up the import and access to critical medical goods to fight the pandemic. SeveralMembers also introduced new technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessmentprocedures to ensure safety and quality of medical goods that were not previously regulated, suchas COVID-19 diagnostics, or face masks for public use. 11 xiii. Cooperation between regulators from different countries, including reliance on the work and decisions of other regulatory authorities helps speed up processes, avoidsduplication of efforts, and leads to more efficient use of resources, for both regulators andmanufacturers. 12 xiv. Of the 34 countries, Ghana stands out in terms of its use regulatory agility and reliance early in the pandemic. The Ghana Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) was able torapidly approve COVID-19 vaccines using its own emergency use authorization (EUA) guideline, based on reliance on stringent regulatory authorities and the WHO Emergency Use Listing. 13 This c ontributed to Ghana being the first African country to receive COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility in February 2021.14 Further, only Kenya of has notified COVID-19 related regulatory measures to the WTO. Kenya notified, among others, requirements and testing methods forflocked swabs, and requirements for face masks for general use.CHART 5: LATEST AVAILABLE APPLIED TARIFFS FOR SELECTED PRODUCTS RELATED TO VACCINATION 05101520253035Per Cent Storage/distn & admin Textile Facemasks Syringes average for storage/ distn & administration products Source: WTO Staff calculations based onWorld Tariff Profiles 202158 ACCELERATING COVID-19 VACCINE DEPLOYMENTMAIN REPORT 1.While rol is impor this report f ocuses on vaccines.
