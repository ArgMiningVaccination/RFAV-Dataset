It is not a chiropractic issue, nor has it ever been. It is a freedom of choice issue. You as the parent have the ultimate responsibility for your child's health and well- being, and you, not your doctor, state, or federal health officials, will live with and be responsible for the consequences of your decision. Vaccines are portrayed as being indispensable and somehow better at disease protection than our innate biolog ical defenses and nutritional resources have accomplished for thousands of years. The Anthon reports that medical experts with financial ties to the vaccine manufacturers heavily influence the government's decisions endangering the health of innocent child ren to enhance profit. In the U.S. alone, they estimated that over $1 billion is generated each year from profits. \"Although I administered them myself during my early years of practice, I have become a steadfast opponent of mass inoculations because of th e myriad hazards they present.\" Robert Mendelson, M.D. \"Isn't it ironic that we require or recommend immunizations in order to start school only to, in some cases, compromise some of the children by the very method we are using to supposedly protect them.\" Mark Thoman, M.D. \"Immunizations promote certain types of chronic diseases. And far from providing a genuine immunity, the vaccines are actually a form of immunosuppression... I could no longer bring myself to give the injections to children even when the parents wished me to.\" Richard Moskowitz, M.D. Not only are vaccinations not able to completely prevent us from contracting a certain disease, but they also have many ingredients that have known reactions in the body. These ingredients include: Ethel Glyc ol (antifreeze), formaldehyde (preserving -bodies), acetone (finger nail polish remover), aluminum phosphate (carcinogens), mercury (cancer causing agent), phenol (carbon acid - disinfectant), and Thimerosal (carcinogen). On average before the age of six, your child will have been vaccinated 34 times. Many childhood diseases have declined steadily due to the increases in technology, such as improved sanitation, nutrition and health care, but not because of vaccines. In a whooping cough outbreak in Cincinn ati in 1993, 80% of those under the age of five who got whooping cough had been fully vaccinated. Every year 8 cases of Polio occur as a result of the vaccine. There has not been a naturally occurring case of Polio since 1979. Vaccination promises protec tion against a select number of chronic diseases that, for some mysterious reason, our own immune system and natural health resources cannot deal with effectively on their own. The common side effects that have been documented after vaccinations include c hronic immunological and neurological disorders such as autism, hyperactivity, attention deficit disorders, dyslexia, allergies, cancer and other conditions. These diseases barely existed 30 years ago before mass vaccination programs. Reactions to vaccina tions can consist of persistent screaming, a high -pitched unusual cry, and a state of unresponsiveness; fever with or without seizures or convulsions, excessive drowsiness, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, nausea or apparent dizziness. If any of these sympt oms occur any time, you should contact your physician, but this is especially important after a recent vaccination. It is estimated that physicians report less than 10% of vaccine damage and 97.5% vaccine related deaths go unreported. The U.S. pays more than $11 million each year in settlements and paid a total of $750 million in damages presently. CHIROPRACTIC IS THE #1 SOURCE FOR A PROPERLY FUNCTIONING NERVOUS AND IMMUNE SYSTEM Chiropractic is a natural, simpler and holistic way of improving your chil d's immune system. Chiropractors look directly for a SUBLUXATION; this is a misalignment of a bone that is putting pressure on a nerve creating an interference or dysfunction in a body. There are three ways that a child or an adult gets a subluxation: Tr auma - birth process (Dr. Towbin states that 80% of all children are subluxated at Birth), slips, or falls, stress - emotional, family dynamics, chemicals or drugs - antibiotics, vaccination, sugar, NutraSweet, 2nd hand smoke, and pollution. Chiropractors are the only health care professionals who can detect and correct your child's subluxation. Chiropractors look for the cause of your son/daughter's weakened immune and nervous system. In a recent study, children under chiropractic care can get sick less often and less severely, and they will rarely miss days from school. Recent studies show that they have fewer emotional and learning disabilities and other neurological problems connected with childhood. Chiropractic Kids also have less need for antibiot ics, less occurrence of ear infections, tonsillitis and the immune system strength is doubled. It is clear that American health care consumers are not going to win the right to make informed, independent health care decisions, including vaccination decisio ns, for themselves and their children unless they actively push for a change in state mandatory vaccination laws and support large scale reform of the mass vaccination system. MOMS SPEAK OUT \"I feel the body's own immune system is far better than injecti ng an unnatural substance. Most common childhood diseases are not life threatening. Once the child has the disease he/she is immune for life.\" S.G. For more information contact Wendy at Smith UC Chiropractic Health Care "}
