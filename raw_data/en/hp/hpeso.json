Of the 330 naturopath websites analysed, 40 included vaccine hesitancy discourse and 26 offered vaccine or flu shot alternatives. Using these data, the authors explored the potential impact such statements could have on the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. Next the researchers considered these misrepresentations in the context of Canadian law and policy, and outlined various legal methods of addressing them. They concluded that tightening advertising law, reducing CAM practitioners' ability to self-regulate, and improving enforcement of existing common and criminal law standards would help limit naturopaths' ability to spread inaccurate and science-free anti-vaccination and vaccine-hesitant perspectives. The paper listed some poignant examples of vaccine hesitancy discourse: 1) '...children are now being given increasing numbers of vaccinations containing potentially harmful derivatives and substances such as mercury, thimerisol [sic], aluminum and formaldehydes. These harmful derivatives can become trapped in our tissues, clogging our filters and diminishing one's ability of further toxins out.' \u2014 [www.evolvenaturopathic.com](http://www.evolvenaturopathic.com/) 2) 'Vaccines given to children and adults contain mercury and aluminum. Babies are especially susceptible to small amounts of mercury injected directly into their tiny bodies. It is now suspected that the increase in autism and Asperger Syndrome is related to the mercury in childhood vaccinations.' \u2014 [www.vancouvernaturopathicclinic.com](http://www.vancouvernaturopathicclinic.com/) 3) 'The conventional Flu Shot is a mixture of 3 strains of flu viruses mixed with a number of chemical preservatives and these strains are based on a prediction of what flu viruses some medical experts think will be the most problematic this season. This is really an impossible prediction to make when we have thousands of different strains of viruses that are continuously mutating.' \u2014 [www.advancednaturopathic.com](http://www.advancednaturopathic.com/) 4) 'A [sic] epidemiologist researcher from British Columbia, Dr. Danuta Skowronski, published a study earlier this year showing that people who were vaccinated consecutively in 2012, 2013 and 2014 appeared to have a higher risk of being infected with new strains of the flu.' \u2014 [www.drtas.ca](http://www.drtas.ca/) 5) 'Increasing evidence suggests that injecting a child with nearly three dozen doses of 10 different viral and bacterial vaccines before the age of five, while the immune system is still developing, can cause chronic immune dysfunction. The most that vaccines can do is lead to an increase in antibodies to a specific disease.' \u2014 [www.evolvevitality.com](http://www.evolvevitality.com/) 6) 'The bugs in question (on the Canadian Vaccine List) can enter our systems and depending on our bodies, our histories, and mostly the bugs' propensity, they can cause serious harm. There are certainly questionable ingredients in vaccines that have the potential to do the same.' \u2014 [www.tharavayali.ca](http://www.tharavayali.ca/) The authors also considered that, in Canada, a naturopath who recommends homeopathic vaccines or who counsels against conventional vaccination could potentially be criminally negligent. Section 219 of the Criminal Code of Canada [Code] states that '[e]very one is criminally negligent who, in doing anything, or in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons'. Subsection (2) goes on to state that, for the purposes of criminal negligence, 'duty' means a duty imposed by law; a legal duty in this context is one arising from statute or from the common law. The Code creates a legal duty for anyone 'who undertakes to administer surgical or medical treatment to another person or to do any other lawful act that may endanger the life of another person' to 'have and to use reasonable knowledge, skill and care in so doing'. This duty is a uniform standard, meaning the requirement of reasonable knowledge, care, and skill is based on the treatment or lawful act in question, not on the level of experience of the person administering it. As such, naturopaths offering services similar to medical doctors will be held to the same standards under the Code. Criminal negligence occurs due to the 'failure to direct the mind to a risk of harm which [a] reasonable person would have appreciated'. Fault is premised on the wrongful act involved, rather than the guilty mind of the perpetrator. Naturopaths counseling patients against vaccination are arguably undertaking a lawful act that endangers the life of another person (especially in the case of a young child, elderly individual, or immunocompromised person), breaching s.216 of the Code. In addition, since relevant legal duties include those arising through the common law, naturopaths could alternatively be criminally negligent for failing to satisfy the aforementioned duty of reasonable disclosure inherent to standard of care in tort. In the context of a community with diminished vaccination rates, either failure could be considered wanton or reckless, as it may greatly and needlessly endanger the patient. However, under the standard for criminal negligence, the trier of fact must 'assess whether the accused's conduct, in view of his or her perception of the facts, constituted a marked and substantial departure from what would be reasonable in the circumstances'. This is similar to the standard of gross negligence, so ultimately a finding of criminal negligence would require meeting a rather onerous threshold. ______________________________________________________________________________ This, of course, is according to Canadian law; but I imagine that the law in other countries must be similar. Therefore, this is a legal opinion which might be worth considering also outside Canada. If there is a legal expert amongst my readers, please do post a comment. "}
