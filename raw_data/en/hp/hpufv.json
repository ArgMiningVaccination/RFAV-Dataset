BREAD/PASTA: Choosing whole grains means higher amounts of fiber which is important for digestion, fullness, and blood sugar regulation. In order to know if a product is truly whole grain, check to make sure that the first ingredient on the list is \"whole grains\" Lentil/bean pastas are a great source of fiber AND protein! For additional info, check out: https://wholegrainscouncil.org/ Nutrition and Food Packaging Choose nutritious foods that align with your health goals. Let's go through some things to keep in mind when choosing certain products: MARCH 2023 | ISSUE NO. 2 CEREAL: Choosing a nutritious cereal can be very overwhelming! Look for the word \"whole\" grain, wheat, or oat for a great nutrition and fiber push! Often times, cereals are loaded with sugar! If sugar is in the top 3 ingredient list, best to find an alternative option. MILK: Low fat dairy/lactaid milk is an excellent source of protein, calcium, and vitamin D If you are looking for a dairy free option, pea protein and soy milk are also good sources of protein - look for fortified with calcium/vitamin D! Other milks such as coconut, almond, and oat milk can be lower in calories however are often not a good source of protein YOGURT: When choosing a yogurt make sure it has more protein than sugar Greek/Icelandic style yogurts are often a great source of protein If choosing a plant-based yogurt choose one that is higher in protein like pea protein or soy Regular yogurt made with milk has less protein but more calcium then greek yogurt, BARS: Protein bars in particular are generally higher in protein (10g+) and lower in sugar (<10g) Granola or \"energy bars\" often don't have much protein and may have more sugar. These bars are often made with oats. When choosing a granola bar be sure it has 3g+ of fiber and pair with a protein source, such as yogurt! CHIPS, CRACKERS, PRETZELS: Be aware of marketing terms such as \"all-natural\" as there is no real definition of this term Baked/Low-Fat- today, a lot of snack foods are prepared with plant oils which can improve heart health, however these products can have less of these oils and potentially more starches and sugars \"Multigrain\" -this means there is a mixture of different grains in the snack, remeber to choose \"whole grain\" whenever possible Vegetable chips- these are often made with potato flour and added coloring with not much actual vegetables! Protein chips- can have added protein which may help with satiety, With any snack be sure to follow the serving size! Your Guide to Grocery Shopping A repeat from our Summer 2020 EditionTry writing a letter of gratitude to someone who did something for which you feel grateful. Describe in detail what they did and how it helped you. The process of writing the letter has benefits to you, whether you choose to share it with the person or not! Write about a time in the past when you had a success. This could be any positive event where you helped to make it happen, and you feel happy or proud about your contribution. Then, think about which personal qualities you used to make that success happen. Are there ways you could apply those qualities now to help meet your goals? When you are being physically active, pay attention to positive emotions you may be experiencing during exercise. Do you feel determined? Proud? Joyful? By noticing these you can start to make physical activity a more positive experience over time. Imagine an optimistic future for yourself in one year. If everything goes as well as it could, what will your life look like in a year? Are there steps you can start to take now to move in that direction? Thinking positively is linked to many health benefits! People who are more optimistic and who experience more gratitude and life purpose tend to have lower rates of cardiovascular disease and even live longer. One explanation for these long-term health benefits may be that people who are more positive tend to engage in healthier behaviors, like exercising and following a healthy diet. The good news is that there are simple exercises you can do to boost positive thinking: The GOALS Project is currently recruiting people 6-12 months post-surgery who want to get more active!
