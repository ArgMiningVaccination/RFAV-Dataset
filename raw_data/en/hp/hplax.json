First, let's take a look at the herbs themselves. Herbs for Memory Support and Brain Health* 1) Saffron [Saffron](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/saffron), scientifically known as Crocus sativus, comes from the pistil of the autumn crocus flower. It is used in the kitchen in dishes like Saffron rice and Spanish paella and has a history of use in ancient Greek, Egyptian, Persian, and Indian systems of medicine. In traditional medicine, [Saffron](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/benefits-saffron%20) was used to support brain, liver, and lung function as well as women's health.* Current research continues to indicate a use for this herb for memory support and brain health specifically, noting its ability to support healthy brain aging, focus, and mood.* The literature also suggests that Saffron and its components can [support learning and memory](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/herbs-to-help-support-healthy-eyesight-and-protect-against-screen-fatigue) and \"can be considered as promising agents to support the nervous system.\"*1 And, scientists report that Saffron has \"neuroprotective effects\" that not be ignored.*2 2) Ginkgo [Ginkgo,](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/ginkgo) or Ginkgo biloba, is a hardy tree, unique in that it is the oldest surviving species of tree on the planet. The extract of this plant is effective in supporting the body in various ways, including [maintaining healthy brain function](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/love-ginkgo-herb-supports-brain-health-focus).*3 It has quite a long history of traditional use (Ginkgo properties were first recorded around 2,800 B.C.). Today, its benefits are well-researched, with studies backing its use to [support cognitive functions](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/love-ginkgo-herb-supports-brain-health-focus) such as recall, recognition, memory, attention, concentration, mood, and energy levels.* 3) Spearmint While this herb is used in all sorts of products, from jams to mouthwash, it is also used to support health and well-being.* It can help with occasional digestive complaints, support relaxation, and, perhaps most noteworthy of all, help support memory.*4 [Spearmint](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/spearmint) is, of course, a member of the mint family and is known scientifically as Mentha spicata. You probably know this herb well from its culinary uses and because it grows in nearly every temperate climate, though it is native to Europe and Southwest Asia. For example, one study noted that supplementation with Spearmint extract supported the \"quality of working memory and spatial working memory accuracy.\"5 4) Lemon Balm Another member of the mint family, Melissa officinalis, commonly referred to as Lemon Balm, is a culinary, cosmetic, and medicinal herb. It has been used to support [digestion](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/digestive-health), [promote a sense of calm](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/3-calming-herbs-stress-daily-self-care-routines), and [maintain balance for the nervous system](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/why-we-love-lemon-balm).* Extracts of this herb have \"been shown to bind directly to both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in human brain tissue,\" which play a role in learning and memory processes.*6 Lemon Balm may also [promote focus and a sense of calm](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/time-to-relax-natural-herbs-tips-for-calming-the-mind-and-body) in order to help support a tired brain.* 5) Bacopa [Bacopa](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/bacopa) (Bacopa monnieri) also goes by the names water hyssop, herb of grace, and Indian pennywort. This pretty, water-loving succulent is prized within Ayurvedic medicine as a [nootropic](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/what-are-nootropics-all-about-herbs-and-activities-for-long-term-brain-health), or an herb that supports mental performance.* Research indicates that [Bacopa](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/discover-bacopa-a-traditional-herb-for-brain-health) can support learning as well as help maintain short-term and long-term memory.*7 In particular, studies highlight its potential to [support cognitive performance](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/how-to-focus-better) in the aging population as well as memory free recall.*8,9,10 For example, one study involving adults between the ages of 40 and 65 showed that Bacopa supports the retention of new information.*11 6) Lion's Mane Mushrooms Up to this point, we've focused on plants and herbs for memory support and brain health, but we'd also like to mention a mushroom called [Lion's Mane](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/lions-mane-mushroom-benefits) (Hericium erinaceus). It has a rich history of use within Traditional Chinese Medicine as a [mushroom for brain and neurological health](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/lions-mane-mushroom-benefits).* Modern research also suggests this fungus has the ability to support brain health.* One study involving older adults suggests that Lion's Mane can help support improvement of mild cognitive impairment.12,13 Though more research is needed to draw specific conclusions, this study shows that Lion's Mane has the potential to support brain health in positive and significant ways.* 7) Gotu Kola Finally, we'd like to talk about the herb [Gotu Kola](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/gotu-kola) (Centella asiatica), which is a member of the parsley family and is regarded as a spiritual herb. It is used to improve meditation, develop the crown chakra, and is known as a rejuvenative herb within Ayurvedic medicine.* Gotu Kola is often used to support hair, skin, and nail health, but it is also a [nervine](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/nourishing-nervine-herbs-for-stress-support).* These herbs help support healthy neurotransmitter function, mental alertness, and memory.* One particular preclinical study notes that the aqueous extract of Gotu Kola \"has [a] cognitive enhancing effect.\" While we cannot be certain this result directly applies to humans and more research is needed, the findings are promising.*14 Herbal Supplements for Memory and Brain Health* Now that you know a bit more about some of the most popular herbs for memory and brain health, we'd like to share the easiest way to work them into your day-to-day wellness routine: taking single-herb supplements as well as expertly formulated herbal blends.* Single Herb Supplements Bacopa Gaia Herbs [Bacopa](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/bacopa) is a full spectrum, single-herb, concentrated extract designed to support brain health during all stages of life.* This supplement is made with Bacopa grown right in our own greenhouse in North Carolina.
