Jenner injected an eight-year-old boy with cowpox matter from a blister on the hand of an English milkmaid. He then repeatedly attempted to \"challenge\" the cowpox inoculation by exposing the boy to smallpox material\u2014but the boy never fell ill. Jenner had demonstrated smallpox immunization. Undaunted, Jenner experimented on several other children, including his own 11-month-old son. In 1798, the results were finally published and Jenner coined the word vaccine from the Latin 'vacca' for cow. But the obvious advantages of vaccination and the protection it provided won out, and vaccination soon became widespread. Jenner became famous and now spent much of his time researching and advising on developments in his vaccine. Jenner carried out research in a number of other areas of medicine and was also keen on fossil collecting and horticulture. He was testing his theory, drawn from the folklore of the countryside, that milkmaids who su\u00b1ered the mild disease of cowpox never contracted smallpox, one of the greatest killers of the period, particularly among children. Jenner subsequently proved that having been inoculated with cowpox Phipps was immune to smallpox. He submitted a paper to the Royal Society in 1797 describing his experiment, but was told that his ideas were too revolutionary and that he needed more proof. How do vaccines work vaccines are prioritized in this order: Vaccines that fight diseases that cause the most deaths and damage, like meningitis Vaccines that prevent severe diseases like measles and influenza Vaccines, like the one for rotavirus, that prevent significant su\u00b1ering The vaccine is administered. It contains weakened or dead forms of the disease. The immune system identifies these foreign substances (viruses and bacteria), also known as antigens. Once antigens are identified, the immune system develops proteins that circulate in the blood. These proteins are called antibodies. They fight the infection by killing the antigens. Antibodies are made by white blood "}
