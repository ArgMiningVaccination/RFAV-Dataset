While I was at a loss as to which size to choose, I was on backorder for sizes other than this (tube type)... I use it all over my body. I feel that it is harder than the aloe gel I have used so far. It's a gel so it spreads well. It's smooth and easy to use. Especially dry areas are mixed with cream and oil. There is no smell, so it's in the mood at that time. When I use it on my face, it stings my eyes. So... I mostly use it on my body, so I will buy the large type when it arrives. I've used aloe vera gel from various manufacturers, but this is the first time I've used 100% gel! good! ! Perfect for summer skin. The purupuru stretches smoothly on the skin and calms the skin exposed to the sun. The skin is smooth. I think it's thanks to aloe vera that my elbows and knees are smooth. Wonderful, alcohol-free, refreshing daily. I use it in my care routine, and my skin is sensitive. It suited me, and I repeated the purchase. The package is large and suffices me for a long time. A product that I do not dispense with for moisturizing, cooling, and skin sensitivity after shaving or insect bite. The benefits are many, many. The pump-type container is convenient. It is in gel form. The size is bigger than both hands. I purchased this container with recycling in mind. There is a bit of eye irritation, but I like to apply it on my face and body and reapply it from time to time. However, if you have sensitive skin, it may take some preservatives, but I feel more uncomfortable about cosmetics going bad, so I use it with confidence because it is a cosmetic product with a lot of moisture, so the smell is unscented. And since I reapply it 4-5 times every day, I don't think there will be any problem even if I buy a larger capacity. Adjust the frequency of application by yourself! There is no smell, it is excellent for skin care, especially before shaving, the quality is amazing, the size is large, it refreshes the skin, especially if it is cold, the packaging is good, the benefits are before shaving or for sunburn, or if it turns out that you are refreshing your skin, put it cold and even on the scalp. If necessary It is useful.. I recommend it.. The ingredients and the quality are beautiful and wonderful. I benefited very much, the quality is excellent, more than wonderful. I used it .. and I liked it. Please give me likes. The size is large, the smell is beautiful, and the use is a lot. The lesson is great. interest above required. Rich formula.
