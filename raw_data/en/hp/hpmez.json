No holiday in Thailand will be complete unless you indulge your senses in the magic of a Thai spa session. Besides the facials, body scrubs and aromatherapy treatments that are offered by spa around the world, spas in Thailand have become famous for offering a traditional Thai massage. The Wear and Tear of Being on Holiday Holidays are meant to be relaxing. But for healthy and active people, they can be just as taxing and tiring as a long day at work. The tropical environment also exposes people to heat, sun, sand and saltwater, and each of these elements can also take their toll on your body. Add in all the various water sports, hiking, sightseeing, and nightclubbing that people on holiday in Phuket typically experience, and an active holiday in Phuket is likely to be the cause of a bit of wear and tear on your body. The aches and pains that may result from pursuing all these fun holiday activities can all be treated by a visit to a Phuket spa. Thai Massage The Thai massage is an ancient practice that is derived from Chinese and Indian influences and combines physical elements that will make your body more limber, supple and improve your circulation. There are varying degrees of a Thai massage. In a traditional Thai massage, your limbs are stretched and pulled to realign your joints and tendons. This element of the massage was adopted from Hatha Yoga. In Thai foot massage, the reflexology concept of traditional Chinese medicine has been adopted to ease the aches and pains of the feet. This concept is used on the hands as well. You're in control of a Thai massage session. Some people who are used to the traditional Thai massage can instruct their massage therapist to stretch and pull their limbs to their limits. Others may just want to enjoy the easing of aches and pains that comes from having their muscles rubbed and kneaded. Relief from Your Lifestyle For many people, a visit to a Phuket spa is the perfect antidote to a long night of celebrating while on holiday in Phuket. A soothing facial, an aromatherapy session and a relaxing massage are just what the doctor ordered after a hard night of drinking and dancing. A body scrub can rid your skin of all the harmful effects caused by sun and saltwater and have you looking years younger. And a Thai herbal steam bath can help relax your muscles, and both soften and hydrate your skin. The Experience of a Lifetime For tourist and travellers visiting Phuket for the first time, a visit to a Phuket spa can provide you with an eye-opening experience that can change your life for the better. You'll feel refreshed, rejuvenated and you'll forward to your next visit to Thailand. "}
