This season the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also known as the \"nasal spray\" flu vaccine, will NOT be available through Vaccines for Children (VFC). This is due to data revealing that the effectiveness of the LAIV is approximately 3%, indicating no protective benefit could be measured. The annual influenza vaccine continues to be recommended, with either the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) or recombinant influ- enza vaccine (RIV), for everyone 6 months old and older. All persons aged 6 months old and older are recommended for an- nual vaccination, with few exceptions. Please visit http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/whoshouldvax.htm for more information on exceptions to the administration of the flu vaccine. Children aged 6 months to 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine (administered >4 weeks apart) during their first season of vaccination with annual vaccination subsequently to optimize immunity . The final annual recommendations on the prevention and control of influenza with vaccines will be published in a CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), Recommendations and Reports in late summer or early fall. For more information, please visit the following link: http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/s0622 -laiv-flu.html 2 CMDP Immunization Audit CONGRATULATIONS to our Providers! . CMDP did extremely well in our 2015 immunization audit. Due to your hard work, our members, the children in foster care, achi eved a high rate of immunization. We still have some areas to improve on, and together with you, we will work to increase the protec tion that immunization provides our children . Sara Park MD, FAAP Chief Medical Officer CMDP EPSDT to Improve Child Health CMDP covers all EPSDT Services. The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) program was developed to fit the standards of pediatric c are and to meet the special physical, emotional, and developmental needs of children. Since 1967, the purpose of the EPSDT program ha s been \"to discover, as early as possible, the health problems that impact our children\" and to provide \"continuing follow up and tr eatment so that their healthcare needs are met.\" The elements of EPSDT: EPSDT is a mandatory set of services and benefits for all individuals under age 21 who are enrolled in Medicaid. Think of it as the child health coverage package of Medicaid. Early Identifying problems early, starting at birth Periodic Checking children's health at periodic, age -appropriate intervals Screening Doing physical, mental, developmental, dental, hearing, vision, and other screening tests to detect potential problems Diagnostic Performing diagnostic tests to follow up when a risk is identified, and Treatment Treating the problems found What is included under EPSDT: At each EPSDT visit, a Provider must: Screen to detect physical and mental conditions Screening by the provider must include: comprehensive health and developmental history an unclothed physical exam appropriate immunizations dental screening vision and hearing screening laboratory tests health education - developmentally targeted education on safety, nutrition, discipline, educational achievement, emotional regulation, family planning, sex education and STIs, risk taking behaviors and addiction as appropriate . Provide diagnostic services for, and treatment of, any conditions discovered by the screening services. Please make sure your patients are coming in for their EPSDT (well) visits. CMDP members are all children in out -of-home foster care and they may not have had routine well care in the past. The EPSDT is a n integral part of their care. As the child's PCP, you may be the only provider who has seen the child and can identify signs of abuse or neglect, or previo usly unde- tected medical issues. Please do not hesitate to see children for their EPSDT, but also, frequently thereafter to follow up a nd treat their medical conditions, behavioral health conditions and social well -being. 3 DES/CMDP Childhood Immunization: Measurement Period CYE CYE Relative NCQA Commercial & Medicaid Means Exceeds Minimum Performance Standards 4 Asthma Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood. The primary care and emergency visits that result from asthma complications have significant implications for the families of children with asthma, for schools and the healthcare system. According to the Healthy Children website, more than 23 million Americans have asthma and more than one -quarter of them are children younger than 18 years . Good asthma self -management improves long -term asthma outcomes and behavioral modification. Providers should: Routinely review each patient's asthma action plan and assess understanding and adherence to the plan and medication regimen Develop partnerships with patients Educate, beginning at diagnosis; reinforce and review understanding Educate to the child's developmental level and understanding Review the signs and symptoms of good asthma control versus poor control Review the role of asthma medication and continually instruct on the proper use of inhalers and spacers Review strategies for trigger avoidance Observe medication delivery during a face -to-face visit; do not rely on printed materials alone Schedule visits quarterly (or more frequently if needed) to monitor asthma status and control Proper documentation affects reimbursement. ICD -10 and CPT codes must be adequately supported by chart documentation to ensure optimal and timely reimbursement. Asthma education is integral to moving the treatment of this disease away from a focus on acute -care needs and toward improved long-term patient outcomes. If CMDP can be of any assistance, please contact the Medical Services Unit at 602 -351-2245. AHCCCS has expanded its coverage of podiatry services. Beginning October 1, 2016, podiatry services performed by a licensed podiatrist, pursuant to A.R.S. Title 32, Chapter 7, are covered for all AHCCCS members when ordered by a primary care physician or primary care practitioner. Provider Profile Updates Please make sure your provider profile is up to date by going to the Lexus Nexus link https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/ NPPES/Welcome.do . Updating your demographic infor- mation, as well as your specialty designation will help to ensure a more streamlined process for providing services to children in care and for claims management. Change in Coverage for Podiatry Services 5 FDA Alerts and Black Box Warnings All Liquid Products through PharmaTech, LLC On July 16, 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the all -lot recall of Rugby's branded product, Diocto Liquid (docusate sodium), manufactured by PharmaTech, LLC. On August 9, 2016 the FDA announced that PharmaTech, LLC is recalling all lots of liquid products produced from October 20, 2015 through July 15, 2016 manufactured by PharmaTech, LLC. Now the recall has expanded to include both drug products and dietary supplement products under various labels, including Rugby, Major, Bayshore, Centurion, Virtus, and Metron. Affected PharmaTech, LLC products (drug products and dietary supplement products) include Diocto syrup (Rugby), Senexon liquid (Rugby), (Rugby), Cerovite liquid (Rugby), D3 Vitamin liquid (Rugby), Ferrous sulfate liquid (Rugby), and others. This recall includes all lots of the affected products manufactured between October 20, 2015, through July 15, 2016. These products are being recalled due to contamination with Burkholderia cepacia. Use of contaminated product may result in serious infections that could be life -threatening in patients with compromised immune systems and in patients with chronic lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis. CDC has confirmed one product as having B. cepacia complex growth; however, because of epidemiologic links, CDC is concerned about potential contamination of multiple liquid docusate products, pending FDA's ongoing investigation of shared ingredients in the products in question. At this time, both FDA and CDC continue to recommend that clinicians and patients not use any liquid product for any medical purpose. This recommendation is now expanded to all patient populations. If an oral liquid docusate stool softener is medically necessary, alternative medicines should be used. For additional information regarding the recall, please visit Mobile Continuous Glucose Monitoring System Receivers The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that Dexcom, Inc. has voluntarily recalled their continuous glucose monitoring system receivers because the audible alarm may not activate in the receiver piece when hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia is detected. This system includes a sensor placed under the skin to measure blood glucose readings that are sent to a hand -held receiver. The systems are used in combination with standard home glucose monitoring devices in the management of diabetes. Relying on this product for notification of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia could result in serious adverse consequences, including death, because the auditory alarm may not alert the user of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Medimpact would notify CMDP if there were any members who received the specific lot number. No members have been identified. Additionally, MedImpact placed a POS message with hard stop on the affected NDCs stating, \"FDA product recall, do not dispense this product.\" Sterile Drug Products from Pharmakon Pharmaceuticals On April 11,2016 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that Pharmakon Pharmaceuticals refused to initiate a drug recall and refused to cease sterile drug production, as requested by the FDA. Therefore, at this time the FDA is alerting health care professionals to avoid use of any drug products that are intended to be sterile and that are produced and distributed nationwide by Pharmakon Pharma- ceuticals, Inc. in Noblesville, Indiana. Pharmakon subsequently issued a nationwide voluntary recall of all sterile compounded products on April 20, 2016. All recalled products have a label that includes the Pharmakon Pharmaceuticals name, address and expiration date. The sterile products were distributed nationwide to hospitals between March 4, 2016 and April 15, 2016. The FDA recently inspected the Pharmakon Pharmaceuticals facility (following a recent voluntary partial lot recall of morphine sulfate 0.5mg/mL preservative -free 1mL syringes to incorrect potency) and found unsanitary conditions, poor sterile production practices, environmental contamination for multiple sites within the clean rooms, and other deficiencies. MedImpact has not approved claims for any of the active NDCs of Pharmakon products over the last 120 days. Additionally, MedImpact has placed a POS message with hard stop on the affected NDCs stating, \"FDA product warning due to lack of sterility assurance, do not dispense this product.\" Healthcare professionals should immediately check their medical supplies and quarantine any drug products marketed as sterile from Pharmakon. These products should not be administered to patients; administration of non -sterile drug products that are intended to be sterile could result in serious and potentially life -threatening infections or death.

As a result, the number of deaths caused by prescription opioids has quadrupled as well \u201478 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose. Prescription abuse is not just a problem, it is an epidemic and it is severely affecting the lives of children and teens all over the state. Arizona currently ranks 6th highest in the nation for individuals 12+ years of age misusing and abusing prescription drugs. It is common perception among prescribers that the opioid addiction is characterized by illicit use of street drugs, and that a handful of prescribers are to blame for prescription drug misuse. However, all providers can prescribe opioids to patients in pain. This can often be the first step down the road to addiction. Your patient may also be obtaining their medications from other members in the house \u2014grandpa who just had spinal surgery, or mom who just had a baby. 3 out of 4 Arizona Youth who have misused prescription drugs in the past 30 days report getting them from friends, family or right out of the home. What can providers do to stem this epidemic? Discuss the safe storage of medications at each well check. Include counseling on Anticipatory Guidance: Poisoning Overdose The risk of opioid addiction The risk of death with the use of opioids (especially when taken with other medications or alcohol, which often occurs at pill parties). The judicial use of opioids for the control of pain. Exploring and prescribing other modalities for pain control. Review the Controlled Substance Prescribing Monitoring Program (CSPMP) prior to prescription of controlled substances. Discuss the effects of opioids and the potential for addiction, when prescribing the medication. Address the possibility of intrauterine drug exposure and the neonatal abstinence syndrome when prescribing opioids to patients of child -bearing age. Address the patient's expectations of controlling pain. Studies show that addiction to opioids at a young age can lead to subsequent heroin use and the adoption of high -risk behaviors. The Controlled Substances Prescription Monitoring Program (CSPMP) was specifically developed to detect the abuse and misuse of prescription medications. The CSPMP can help the provider determine whether patients have received medications from other providers, or are doctor shopping. It can help alert the provider to the possibility of opi- oid abuse and help the provider direct the patient to treatment. As a provider you can check your patient's controlled substances in the CSPMP yourself, or have your designee review the CSPMP for you. To register for CSPMP, or assign a designee, visit: https://pharmacypmp.az.gov/ If you need to report opioid abuse, please call our Corporate Compliance Hotline at (602) 771 -3555. Or, for help dealing with abuse, call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Helpline at 1 -800-662-HELP. http://www.medicineabuseproject.org For a toolkit about opioid awareness, visit: http://azcjc.gov/ACJC.Web/Rx/toolkit.aspx To get help with referring a child for substance abuse treatment, call our medical services unit at (602) 351 -8529.

Rise in Prescription Drug Misuse and Abuse Impacting Teens . Children and Adolescents Are You Screening? Chlamydia trachomatis is the cause of the most common, reportable sexually transmitted bacterial infection in the United Stat es. There is a need for annual screening for chlamydia in sexually active adolescents and young adults. Most infections are asymptomatic and occur in adolescents and young adults under 25 years of age. Because the infection is asymptomatic in 75% of females and 50% of males, it is under -diagnosed and therefore not treated. A high clinical index of suspicion for chlamydial infection (e.g., pelvic inflammatory disease or epididymitis) and prompt tr eatment are necessary to resolve symptoms, prevent complications, and prevent transmission to sexual partners. Repeat infection with chlamydia is common. Multiple chlamydia infections increases a woman's risk of serious reproductive hea lth complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and infertility. Men and women with chlamydia should be re- tested about three months after treatment of the initial infection, regardless of whether they believe their partners were tr eated. Chlamydia is easily diagnosed and treated. Nucleic acid amplification tests are the preferred diagnostic tests because of their superior sensitivity, and they can be performed on easily collected specimens, such as urine or vaginal swabs. There are highly efficacious treatment options including single -dose oral azithromycin or a 1 -week course of doxycycline. The cornerstone of chlamydia detection and treatment is screening. Young women should be scr eened for infection because most of the reproductive complications of chlamydia occur in women. On the basis of strong research evidence, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for chlamydial infecti on for all sexually active non pregnant females 24 years and younger and for older non -pregnant females who are at increased risk of in fection. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for c hlamydia and gonorrhea in men. However, the medical staff at CMDP urges you to screen all young adolescents who are sexually active, a s Chlamydia is so often an asymptomatic infection. Maternity Care Package Claim In the most recent update to the AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual, Chapter 400, changes were made related to the Maternity Care global claim package. The policy change does NOT impact how care or services are paid for by the Comprehensive Medical & Dental Program (CMDP). However, the policy change now requires CMDP to imple- ment processes to ensure that all claim forms for maternity care include all dates of service. Effective immediately, all Maternity Care Providers are required to: Submit an initial claim for the member's initial office visit When the total Maternity Care package is billed, include all individual prenatal visits separately on the claim Bill CMDP individually after each ultrasound is performed because ultrasounds are still excluded from the Maternity Care glob al claim package In addition to the claims submission change, CMDP is taking a more active role in ensuring that all members receive the best Prenatal and Postnatal care possible. We are certain this can be completed with the help of everyone involved with our members' care. This in- cludes the Provider, Case Manager and Care Giver. Please inform CMDP when a member has missed an appointment. CMDP will then contact the member to stress the importance of all prenatal and postnatal visits. For further information or clarification, please contact CMDP Maternal Health Coordinator at (602)771 -1283 or the Provider Servi ce Department 8 Family Planning -Are You Counseling? PCPs have an important role in adolescent reproductive health. Their relationships with patients and families can help them p romote healthy decision making regarding sexuality, abstinence, family planning and risky sexual behaviors. This is particularly tru e of the Provider's relationship with CMDP members. CMDP members, the children and adolescents in the foster care system, may not have oth- er sources of this valuable information. Opportunities to counsel members include EPSDT visits, as well as other visits throughout the year, counsel the adolescent an d facilitate the discussion between the caregiver and the adolescent, on this important topic. Reminder - CMDP does cover: Birth Control Pills Birth Control Injections Birth Control Implants Condoms Diaphragms Intrauterine Device (IUD) Patches Spermicides Testing for all sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including Chlamydia Testing for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Education on abstinence, preventing pregnancy and STDs CMDP has developed an Adolescent Health Tool Kit as a resource to help caregivers facilitate the discussions with adolescents .

Become a Trading Partner today! As October nears CMDP is preparing for a couple changes from AHCCCS. Differential Payments Differential Payments distinguish providers which have committed to supporting designated actions that improve patients' care experi- ence, improve members' health, and reduce cost of care growth. Effective dates of service are 10/1/16 - 9/30/17. This will affect qualifying hospitals and Nursing Facilities along with Integrated Clinics. Three new Provider Types Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBA) are a new provider type which will be effective 10/1/16. Free Standing EDs (FrEDs) are relatively new to Arizona. Freestanding outpatient treatment centers are subclasses of outpatient treatment centers. The new provider type is effective 1/1/2017, with all registration paperwork submitted to AHCCCS by 10/1/ 16. The Treat and Refer Provider Type has been created for a healthcare event with a member who has accessed 9 -1-1 or a similar emergency number, but whose illness or injury does not require ambulance transport to an ED. The purpose of this new provider type is to recognize EMS agencies that demonstrate optimal patient safety and quality of care by matching treatment, transpor t, and care destination options to the needs of members via payments for Treat and Refer services. This new provider type will be ef fective soon. AHCCCS has not verified an effective date. Please direct any questions to Rachel Kiesecker at 602 -771-3675 11 Billing Members is Prohibited Under most circumstances, CMDP foster caregivers and CMDP members are not responsible for any medical or dental bills incurre d for the provision of medically necessary services. Please note that an AHCCCS registered provider shall not request or collect pa yment from, refer to a collection agency, or report to a credit reporting agency an eligible person or a person claiming to be an e ligible person in accordance with Arizona administrative Code R9 -22-702. Civil penalties may be assessed to any provider who fails to comply with these regulations. Providers who may have questions regarding exceptions to this rule are encouraged to contact the CMDP Provider Services unit at 602-351-2245 for clarification.

There are many influenc es on one's cultural beliefs. First, find out if the person fits the generalization. Ask patients what they think caused their illness Not every patient thinks a \"germ\" or \"virus\" caused their disease. They may attribute a variety of causes such as stress, spi ritual forces or bodily imbalances. Respect their beliefs, even if they appear strange to you Often patients are afraid to tell a health care provider what home treatments they may be using or what other practitioners t hey may be seeing because of ridicule they have experienced in the past. When and if possible, incorporate into your treatment plan the patient's beliefs about treatment and prevention that are not contraindicated Patients will likely go ahead and use their own treatments anyway, but if you incorporate their beliefs into the treatment pl an, they are more likely to follow your treatment plan. Do not neglect the patient's family In many cultures, important decisions are made by the family, not simply the individual. Involving the family in decision -making process and treatment plan will help gain the patient's compliance with treatment. Respect and do not discount a patient's concern about supernatural influences on his/her health and well being Do not minimize the patient's concerns. Your minimization will not change the patient's beliefs. Listen respectfully to the p a- tient's concerns and when possible, involve an appropriate spiritual healer/advisor in the patient's care. Learn about the beliefs and practices of the patient populations in your community This will help you better understand your patient's attitudes and behaviors. You may also use this knowledge to question a patient to learn more about their own individual practices.
