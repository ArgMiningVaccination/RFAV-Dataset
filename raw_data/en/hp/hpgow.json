The Guidelines detail the program for occupational health and safety in regards to animal use on our campus. They are modeled after the guidelines set forth in the Guide for the Care and Us e of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Council, 1996) and the Occupational Health and Safety in the Care and Use of Research Animals guidebook (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Counci l, 2003). The program is administrated under NDSU's Safety and Risk Management Program (bot h Workers Compensation and University Police and Safety Office ) with assistance from the IACUC Office (Office of Sponsored Programs Administration and the Office of the Vice President for Research, Creative Activities and Technology Transfer). Questions about the Occupational Health and Safety P rogram can be directed to the U niversity Police and Safety Office (231- 7759, Animal Nutrition and Physiology Center South B uilding), Workers Compensation (231- 9587,), the IACUC Attending Office (231 -8114, 1735 NDSU Research Park Drive). Additional copies of the NDSU Guidelines for Occupational Health and Safety in the Care and Use of Anim als are available from the University Police and Safety Office and IACUC Office . NDSU does not discriminate in its programs and activities on the basis of age, color, gender expression/identity, genetic information, marital status, national origin, participation in lawful off -campus activity, physical or mental disability, pregnancy, public assistance status, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, spousal relationship to current employee, or veteran status, as applicable.

A hazard is the inherent danger involved in working with a particular animal, mat erial, equipment, process, procedure or system. What is risk? Risk is a measure of the likelihood of a consequence from working with a certain hazard. What are the hazards involved in working with animals and animal projects? There are many hazards invol ved in working with animals. These hazards range from minor to very serious, and can include things like allergies, bites, zoonotic diseases, working with hazardous chemicals or radiation, and handling contaminated waste. Information follows in this document that describes many of the potential hazards individually. What are the risks involved in working with animals? The risks involve d range from a low to high potential of injury or illness from the identified hazards. What can be done to avoid hazards and reduce risk? The primary way to avoid problems in work with animals is to know what the hazards are and what precautions to take in order to avoid them. Part B : Animal Workplace Hazards & Risks 1. Types of Hazards The following chart outlines som e, but not all categories and types of potential hazards that may be present in work with animals. Example : Types of Hazards that May be Present during Work on Animal Protocols. Types Examples Physical Hazards Bites, sprains, scratches, sharps, lasers, machinery, slips, falls Chemical Hazards Burns, skin irritations, inhalation, ingestion Zoonosi s Human diseases acquired from animals Allergens Allergies to rodents, cats, dogs (urine, contaminated litter, dander, hair) Ergonomics Heavy lifting, repet itive motion, body mechanics, posture Infectious Agents Bacteria, fungi, parasites, protozoa, rickettsia, viruses, blood - borne pathogens NDSU Guidelines for OHS in the Care & Use of Animals 12 (1997; rev. 2001, 2005 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 ) 2. Animal -related Hazards & Risks This m odel animal risk assessment summary is for risk ranks of animal -related activities for immunocompetent adult humans. Risk ranks are based on both the likelihood of an incident and the seriousness of the possible abnormal condition. Risk levels for experimental agents are not included in the chart, and use of experimental hazardous agents requires review and approval of the appropriate safety committee. Risk of Bite wound (a) Scratch wound (a) Microbial flora exposure (b) Allergy development Chick embryo 1 1 2 1 Fish 1 1 2 1 Reptiles 3 1 2 1 Amphibians 1 2 2 1 Mouse 2 2 1 3 Rat 3 2 1 3 Hamster 3 2 1 2 Guinea Pig 2 2 1 3 Rabbit 2 3 1 3 Cat 3 3 3 3 Dog 3 2 2 2 Sheep, Goat 1 2 3 2 Pig 2 1 3 2 Wild mammals & birds 4 (if handled) 4 (if handled) 3 2 Cattle 1 1 3 2 Bison 1 1 3 2 Horse 1 1 1 1 Key: 1 = No known risk 2 = Minor risk 3 = Moderate risk 4 = Significant risk 5 = High risk a = Potential microbial contamination and physical trauma are both included. Tetanus prophylaxis is required for all staff members. b = Risk of inhalant, ocular, or oral exposure to microbial or parasitic agents from animals acquired through institutionally approved vendors. Zoonosi s. Diseases communicable from anim als to humans are called zoonosi s. In many cases the animals show little, if any, sign of illness. A bacterium in th e normal flora of a healthy animal may cause a serious disorder in a person exposed to it. While the animals have developed \"resistance\" to these microorganisms, humans with no previous exposure to the agent lack this protective immunity. Therefore, one should always be aware of possible consequences when working with each type of animal and then take precautions to minimize the risk of infection. Information can be found in the Animal Welfare and IACUC Blackboard Course Documents . Zoonosi s can be acqui red through various routes of infection, including contact with animal products, the animal itself, or a byproduct of the animal . The routes of infection include ingestion, inhalation, and penetration of broken or unbroken skin, wound penetration, and contact with the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth via the following: NDSU Guidelines for OHS in the Care & Use of Animals 13 (1997; rev. 2001, 2005 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 ) Animal bites and scratches; Contact with animal tissues and cultures, body fluids, and excreta; Inanimate objects that are contaminated by the animal or animal contact; and Exposure to aerosols produced as a result of activities such as cleaning cages. Individuals whose work involves substantial exposure to or handling of animals and animal tissues, body fluids, and cell cultures should be aware of the possibility of the illnes ses that may be transmitted by conta ct with animals. In the zoonosi s training module, at -risk individuals are informe d of laboratory -acquired zoonosi s, causative microorganisms, animals most commonly in contact with humans, appropriate animal handling procedures, p ersonal hygiene, and protective equipment specifi c to the animal type and use . Information can be found in the Animal Welfare and IACUC Blackboard Course Documents . All known human exposure to a zoonotic disease is considered an incident and must be immediately reported by the individual to their supervisor or principal investigator for appropriate medical treatment and investigation. An NDSU Report of Occupational Incident /Injury/Illness/Exposure Report must also be filed immediately or with in 24 hours to the UP&SO . If a zoonotic disease is suspected in an animal, the principal investigator or super visor and the NDSU Attending Veterinarian shall be notified immediately for appropriate action. Allergens. Approximately 20% of people who work with animals have animal allergies. Animal allergies may be present before an individual begins formal work w ith animals, or the allergy may develop during the course of the individual's work with animals. Animal hair, fur, skin, dander, urine, saliva, scratches, etc., can cause or aggravate allergies to animals. Physical Hazards. Physical hazards associated w ith animal contact can include animal bites, scratches, and kicks; noise; waste; and physical methods of euthanasia. Further information follows regarding physical hazards and ways to minimize the risk of injury from physical hazards. Infectious Agents. Animal contact can bring personnel into contact with infectious agents, either from the animal itself or from agents introduced for the research project. 3. Non -Animal Risks Possible Risks and Hazards Present During Work on Animal Protocols . Item Examp les Potential Risk Latex Gloves, masks Allergies Freund's complete adjuvant Can cause sensitization to TB Steam/hot water Used extensively for sanitation and sterilization Can cause severe thermal burns Chemicals Detergents, acidic de -scaling agents, alcohol, cleaning products, flammables Can cause chemical burns or toxicity Pharmaceuticals Anesthetics, antibiotics, analgesics, tranquilizing agents, test drugs Can be toxic Heavy items Lifting feed bags, caging, Can cause lifting injuries NDSU Guidelines for OHS in the Care & Use of Animals 14 (1997; rev. 2001, 2005 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 ) animals Wet floors Mopping floors and cleaning labs or animal housing facilities Slipping and falling Carcinogens, mutagens, teratogens, and other hazardous test substances Cancer -causing agents, spills Agents can cause genetic mutation; disruption of normal cell ular development in an embryo or fetus Biological toxins Poisons and venoms Agents capable of causing illness and/or death Ultraviolet (UV) light Germicidal lamps, outdoor work Can damage eyes and skin Sharps Needles, scalpels, broken glass May produ ce physical damage Infectious agents E. coli , Salmonella , parasites, Hanta virus, rabies Risk of infection and illness Husbandry Cleaning bedding, cages Exposure to contaminated bedding, waste Flammable materials Chemicals, bedding, paper towels and go wns Burns, property damage Pressure vessels Compressed -gas cylinders, high - pressure washing equipment Risk of explosion and personal injury Lasers Lasers Eye damage due to viewing; burns Electricity Electrical hazards are present wherever electric current is present; absence of plate on wall socket; frayed or exposed wires Electric shocks, burns Ionizing radiation Using radioisotopes in research animals, X rays, gamma rays Exposure to radiation Noise Working in a loud environment with machinery and ani mal noise Hearing damage, loss of concentration, distraction Machinery Excessive noise; dangerous equipment Hearing damage; injury Ergonomic hazards Heavy and repeated lifting (of cages, large animals), pinch points Risk of injury 4. Risk Factors to I ndividual Personnel Examples of Risk Factors to Individual Personnel . Personnel type Risk(s) Caused by Women of childbearing age Threat to fetus Exposure to cat feces (toxoplasmosis), sheep and goats (Q fever) Individuals with chronic or pre-existing c onditions (e.g., asthma, allergies, serious disease of liver, kidney, or spleen; immune system deficiencies; steroid, radiation, or chemotherapy patients; heart valve disease) Worsening of pre -existing condition; further illness or complications Exposure t o animal skin, dander, fur, urine, etc.; exposure to Q fever or other zoonotic agents NDSU Guidelines for OHS in the Care & Use of Animals 15 (1997; rev. 2001, 2005 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 ) Part C: Levels of Risk and Participation in the OHS Program 1. Risk Self -Assessment Questions PI's, departments, s upervisors and employees must consider the hazards and risks involved with each task or project conducted in their lab or facility. PI's, departments and s upervisors must discuss the potential hazards and risks associated with the animal work tasks that will be performed. Supervisors mu st complete a Haza rd and Risk Assessment for each position they supervise (the Hazard and Risk Assessment form is attached as Appendix B of this document). This Hazard and Risk Assessment addresses broad issues and questions like: 1) What are the potential work -related animal, non- animal, and individual hazards and risks involved with the work you will be performing or supervising? 2) What preventive measures or actions are available (e.g., training courses, medical examinations, immunizations or vaccinations, personal protecti ve equipment, avoiding contact with certain species) that could reduce, avoid, or eliminate identified hazards and risks? Upon completion of the form, a copy must be given to the individual f or review. They will use this form to aid in the completion of their Health Assessment Form ( Appendix D). A copy will also be provided to the Medical Provider as they proceed with the occupational health evaluation. The Hazard & Risk Assessment Form ( Appendix B ) will be sent to the provider along with Appendix D . All NDSU sites in North Dakota will submit the evaluation to Sanford Clinic Occupational Medicine in Fargo for review. If a medical consultation is recommended for those not living in the Fargo area, that exam may take place at the individual's Designated Medical Provider location. 2. Health Assessments/Examinations: As part of the hazar d and risk assessment, individuals should carefully consider the information provided in these Guidelines as they complete the Health Assessment for Persons Involved in Animal Projects Form (Appendix D ). The answers to these questions are intended to provide the Medical Provider with information on the health hazards , demands and r isks involved with the work that will be performed . A Designated Medical Provider will complete an evaluation of the Health Assessment Form as a medical reference baseline. Once the Medical Provider has completed the evaluation of the Health Assessment ( Appendix D ), the Safety Office will be notified as to whether or not a physical exam /vaccinat ion is recommended. The Safety Office will then notify the individual. Cost of the evaluation, exams, vaccinations, immunizations, or other recommended medical procedures will be paid on a case -by-case basis, but is the responsibility of the department/f acility /student . Vaccinations may be recommended based on the Health Evaluation. Individuals must participate unless they can provide supporting documentation for not completing them. 1.) Tetanus immunization: Boosters are suggested every 10 years. The history of immunization will be determined at the time of the initial assessment. Additional immunizations will be administered as needed. NDSU Guidelines for OHS in the Care & Use of Animals 16 (1997; rev. 2001, 2005 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 ) 2.) Rabies immunization: Pre-exposure immunizations with follow -up antibody titers every two years; repeat immunizations are required as follows if personnel: A. Work directly with the rabies virus B. Have direct contact with animals quarantined for rabies surveillance C. Are exposed to animals or animal parts with potential of containing the rabies virus D. Are responsible for the co ntrol of wild animals on campus 3.) Other: Based on the health and hazard assessment , the consulting physician will collaborate with the UP&SO to advise of or determine the need for other or additional immunizations (such as tuberculosis or hepatitis). 4.) Serum Banking: Serum banking serves as a reference sample if zoonosi s transmission is suspected. Post -offer/pre -hire serum collection is advisable only in specific circumstances as determined by the consulting physician. 5.) Allergies: Allergies should be identified and documented post -offer/pre -hire ( Appendix E ). Individuals with pre -existing allergic tendencies will be encouraged to seek help from their private physician. 6.) Special Precautions for Women of Childbearing Age: Serological samples may b e taken on all women handling high- risk species prior to beginning work to avoid confusion about the significance of various positive antibody tests in case of subsequent pregnancy. Female caretakers, especially those known to be pregnant, should not be e xposed to pregnant sheep, cattle, goats , and cat feces (possibility of toxoplasmosis infection ). Working with hazardous drugs, agents or toxic chemicals during pregnancy is also strongly discouraged. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn at all times and additional precautions observed for pregnant women, as outlined by the pri ncipal investigator, supervisor or physician prior to the start of work with animals. Communicate your work conditions to your medical provider. 3. Medical Provider Reports Following the medical exam , the health care provider will provide a copy of the Medical Provider Health Assessment Report to NDSU ( Appendix E ) to the Safety Office to indicate: 1.) No existing health condition has been identified that could alter the employee's exposure- risk profile. OR 2.) A health condition exists that affects the employee's exposure -risk profile , but the risk can be minimized (and will provide example precautions or preventive measures - e.g., vaccinations; wearing gloves, masks, etc.; avoiding contact with certain species - that would minimize or eliminate the hazards and risks). OR 3.) A health condition exists that affects the employee's exposure -risk profile that cannot be eliminated or minimized. Upon complet ion of the Hepatitis B Vaccination Series , the DMP will provide a copy of the form (Appendix C ) to the individual and the Safety Office. The Safety Office will record into a database and forward to Human Resources for retention in the individual's medical file. NDSU Guidelines for OHS in the Care & Use of Animals 17 (1997; rev. 2001, 2005 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 ) All medical records are confidential. They will be maintained by the Designated Me dical Provider and Human Resources and will be shared only with the patient /individual . As noted previously, the individual may be asked to authorize the release of limited information from the healt hcare provider to the University Police and Safety Office regarding any necessary precautions or restrictions necessitated by any physical limitations or conditions which could affect personal health or the health of the animals. These could include current conditions and possible future conditions. If a health condition exists , or there is a change in one's health that could alter the individual's exposure -risk profile, the individual will inform their supervisor of th e medical provider's recommendations for eliminating the risk. 4. Levels of Risk & Participation Occupation al Health Program Participation Based on Risk / Rank of Animal -Related Activity.

The cost of health assessments, medical exams and vaccinations/imm unizations are to be paid by principal investigators, departments, or individual personnel. Students may be accountable for certain medical costs (e.g., the cost of a tetanus shot) if such treatment is required for a course involving animals (i.e., students pay for a shot just as they would for a textbook). Part D: Avoiding Hazards & Risks: Prevention & Control Strategies 1. Exposure Control & Prevention Exposure Control Methods : (Includes some, but not all, strategies for avoi ding, reducing, or eliminating exposure to hazards and risks). Hazard or Risk Types Prevention Strategy Examples Engineering Controls Practice product substitution; use barriers; allow for adequate filtration and ventilation; maintain proper temperature and humidity controls; regula rly check fire extinguishers, alarms, sprinklers Work Practice Controls Alter animal handling and transport to reduce exposure; pay attention to personal hygiene, housekeeping, and waste management practices; be informed of and practice Safe (or Standard ) Operating Procedures (SOPs) NDSU Guidelines for OHS in the Care & Use of Animals 18 (1997; rev. 2001, 2005 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 ) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Wear gloves, uniforms, gowns, aprons, hard hats, safety glasses, steel -toed boots, respirators , etc. Training & Education (also see below) Participate in university and departmental spec ific training program; follow SOPs (Mandatory Baseline Safety Training and Supervisor Safety Training).

Hazardous Material Use Follow SOPs; attend university training in lab and chemical safety Waste Disposal Follow university policies and procedures for hazardous was te removal (allow UP&SO to dispose of the waste properly) Animal Transportation Do not transport animals through common, non -animal corridors or facilities (may expose non- animal personnel); use proper techniques and tr ansport devices Emergency Procedures Know the contact people for each facility; be sure emergency phone numbers are posted in animal facilities; be familiar with standard emergency procedures like evacuation routes and emergency exits, what to do in the event of a chemical spill, which medical providers to go to in medical emergencies, and how to report i njuries to the University Police and Safety Office, Claims Management Specialist. Zoonosi s Obtain appropriate immunizations or vaccinations; wear gloves and protective clothing when handling species with zoonotic disease potential; participate in medical consultations and surveillance; avoid high -risk animals and situations Animal Handling Learn proper handling techniques; wear protective gloves, clothing, respirators, etc. Good Housekeeping Maintain a clean and organized work area that is free from clutter Personal Hygiene & Safety (also see below) Wash hands; wear PPE, as necessary Women of Childbearing Age Avoid all exposure to possible toxoplasmosis infection and/or do not have contact with cat feces; Avoid contact with hazardous chemicals - especially during the first trimester; wear PPE Medical Assessments & Immunizations/Vaccinations Receive the recommended immunizations to prevent disease transmission; Learn strategies (such as wearing a mask) that would reduce or eliminate exposure to health -altering situations (like allergies) NDSU Guidelines for OHS in the Care & Use of Animals 19 (1997; rev. 2001, 2005 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 ) 2. Information on Education & Training The extent of an individual's personal involvement in the program will be determined by the assessment of the potential risks to the individual's position at the University. Departments, supervisors and principal investigators w ill be responsible to provide training f or the students and employees working under their supervision. The training will be specific to the species and procedures to be used. Departments will be responsible for maintaining the documentation of the Departmental Specific Training. Training requ irements use a fiscal year calendar and documentation must consist of the following information: date of training, topics covered, name of the person providing the training, and the participants acknowledgement of attendance. Records should be maintained for five years, unless otherwise specified. The University Police and Safety Office will manage the documentation of the mandatory University safety training. NDSU's Police and Safety Office will provide training and/or training resources that outline general health and safet y issues at NDSU . The IACUC serves as a primary resource, and assists principal investigators and supervisors in assuring proper animal care and use training of those they supervise. The IACUC has developed and organized a colle ction of training modules to cover the spectrum of animal activities undertaken by NDSU faculty , staff, and students in regard to animal use. Some of these modules are developed and in -place, while others are continually being developed and added to the program. The training and education programs utilize the programs and resources of the University Police and Safety Office, and the IACUC Office/Office of Sponsored Programs Administration/Office of the Vice President for Research and Creative Act ivity. 3. NDSU T raining Program The key element to a successful accident prevention program and in any occupational safety and health program is effective job orientation and safety and health training. NDSU's Risk Management Program will address the basic safet y training and continuing education of the job elements, on -the-job safety, general health, and the prevention of injury and illness (Baseline Safety Training). The program include s an employee orientation process in which all employees learn the general safety rules, safe operating procedures, ergonomic hazards, and claims management procedures. The program will, at a minimum, require departments to complete orientation and initial training for new, transferred and reassigned employees to different posit ions, along with periodic regular training on at least an annual basis for all employees. Required training will consist of documentation on the following : Mandatory Annual Baseline Safety Training Mandatory Annual Supervisor Safety Training Department Sp ecific Safe Operating Procedures Mandatory Upon Hire ( examples of specific department training ) Lab a nd Chemical Safety Training ( refresher recommended every 3 yrs.) Radi ation Safety Training ( refresher every 5 yrs.)

You may contact the director of the IACUC for further information. Future access through the IACUC website will be made available. 4. Emergency Procedures & Reporting Incidents, Injuries, or Illnesses Emergencies Dial 911 in the event of fires, medical emergencies, or other serious threats. University police may also be contacted at 231 -8998 for non- emergencies. Follow the procedures outlined by your department in the event of emergencies. If the emergency or problem involves the animals, refer to the emergency contact placards posted in the animal facility for the names and phone numbers of the appropriate contact person(s) for that facility. The NDSU Attending Veterinarian can also be contact ed in the event of animal emergencies (231 -7830 ). Reporting Work Place Incidents, Injuries, Illnesses, or Near Misses To promote a safe work environment, all work related near misses, incidents, injuries, illnesses and exposures will be reported immediate ly or within 24 hours by the employee to their immediate supervisor or next person in charge at the time of injury , and the Safety Office. When a work related inc ident/injury/illness/exposure occurs, whether medical attention is needed or not , the following steps must be followed: NDSU Guidelines for OHS in the Care & Use of Animals 21 (1997; rev. 2001, 2005 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 ) 1. Assess the injury. Is medical treatment needed, or is first aid adequate? If it is an emergency, call 911. 2. If non- emergency medical care during regular business hours is required, seek treatment at NDSU's Designated M edical Provider . If it is after hours or if you are out of town, seek medical attention at the nearest medical facility. 3. Immediately after you have received medical treatment, or within 24 hours, you must bring the Workers' Compensation First Report of Injury form (which you would have completed at the Designated Medical Provider's office) to the Claims Specialist at the Safety Office. All other Workers' Compensation forms required for your injury will also need to be completed at this time. 4. Complete the NDSU in cident report for every incident and fax this report to the Safety Office (231- 6739) within 24 hours . Per NDSU P olicy 166 , it is a requirement that incident reports be completed and submitted to the Safety Office immediately, no matter if the incident requires medical attention or not . 5. The Supervisor is required to assess the event/incident for immediate hazards and conduct an investigation. The Supervis or must identify and document corrective actions to prevent similar incidents from occurring again. 6. The injured individual is required to follow all medical restrictions, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 7. It is the responsibility of the injured worker to comm unicate with the Claims Specialist (231- 6740) and his or her Supervisor, so as to keep them informed of any referrals, restrictions and medical visits. When there is a potential for an incident to occur, or when a hazard is identified, the employee will file a Near Miss Report with their immediate supervisor. The supervisor will assess the near miss and make certain that corrective action is complete to prevent recurrence. The completed Near Miss Report should then be sent or faxed to the Safety Office ( 231-6739) . North Dakota State University incident report forms and near miss forms can be found on the Downl oadable Forms webpage . 5. Animal Care after Human Injury Special pr ocedures may be required to identify the risk of human exposure to diseases for a particular animal. All samples, animals, or equipment involved in a human injury shall be preserved and have special identification to aid in further testing and/or procedur es. The principal investigator or supervisor and the NDSU Attending Veterinarian should be notified immediately for appropriate care of the animal, investigation of the incident, and corrective action. If the animal is used for teaching or research, medi cal information and care required shall be relayed to all participants. Part E: Students in Classes, Volunteers and Ancillary Personnel 1. Students in Classes As part of the Animal Care and Use Protocol for teaching, the instructor will complete the Haz ard and Risk Assessment F orm; train students on the risks associated with the class and discuss prevention techniques. 1. The Hazard and Risk Assessment form will include a brie f description of the class, the species of animals involved, and a description of student contact with the animals. NDSU Guidelines for OHS in the Care & Use of Animals 22 (1997; rev. 2001, 2005 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 ) 2. If a course is determined to be High Risk, the instructor will discuss with the clas s the potential hazards, zoonosi s and the student's options for individual medical assessment. a) High Risk - High probability of an adve rse health effect, for exam ple, students working with wild- caught mammals, or involved with lambing. b) Low Risk - Low to moderate probability of adverse health effects. c) Following the training, the instructor will have each student complete and sign the \" Participation Waiver \". 3.

Ancillary personnel will be provided, by their supervisor or designee, information based on their need for entry into animal care facilities. a) The availability of , and the option to request medical evaluation and treatment of a medical condition b) Educational material regarding general i nformation, potential hazards, universal precautions and personal h ygiene c) Other potential health and safety hazards NDSU Guidelines for OHS in the Care & Use of Animals 23 (1997; rev. 2001, 2005 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 ) SECTION III : PROGRAM PROCESS Step 1: Faculty, staff, principal investigators and students involved in the use of animals must review the Guidelines for Occupational Health and Safety in the Care and Use of Vertebrate Animals and complete the quiz Step 2: Departments, supervisors, and principal investigators identify and require personnel who have substantial contact with animals to participate in the Occupational Health and Safety in the Use of Vertebrate Animal Program. This is done pr imarily through review of the functional demands and environmental factors associated with the work to be performed (position description, class or project). Step 3: The supervisor/department/PI, in coordination with the NDSU Attending Veterinarian comp letes a Hazard and Risk Assessment (Appendix B) for the project/class/protocol and gives a copy to each person working with animals in his or her lab, class or facility. This form needs to be completed only one time for each individual under their supervi sion unless one or more of the following has changed: duration of animal exposure, type of activity, equipment, chemical, type of animal an d/or change in the individual's health status, Maintain a copy of this assessment in the employee's file and forward a copy to the Safety Office or have the individual deliver to the Safety Office at the time of their meeting . Step 4: After the supervisor reviews the Hazard and Risk Assessment with the in dividual, he/she will be se nt to the Safety Office with their comp leted Health Assessment (Appendix D) and Hazard and Risk Assessment (Appendix B ) Forms . The Safety Office will explain the process and complete the medical authorization form. The individual must have complete d the Health Assessment for Persons Involved i n Animal Projects (Appendix D) . Please enter requested vaccinations records. After reviewing the process , the Safety Office will mail the forms (B & D) to the Designated Medical Provider (Sanford Clinic Occupational Medicine or Essentia Health West Fargo Clinic ) for review. The Medical Provider will review the assessment forms and make recommendations. If an exam is recommended , the Medical P rovider will notify the Safety Office and the Safety Office will notify the individual. Individuals needing the e xam must participate in the medical examination/vaccinations. If the Medical P rovider recommends vaccinations only, individual must participate unless supporting documentation can be provided for not completing the recommended vaccinations. The Medical Provider will return the \"Medical Provider Health Assessment Report to NDSU\" (APP E) to the NDSU Safety Office. The NDSU Safety Office will maintain information in a database and send the final medical reports to HR/PR for recordkeeping. The NDSU Safety O ffice will forward any precautions or preventive measures to the supervisor/department/PI. Supervisor/department/PI will implement any and all precautions or prev entive measure outlined by the Medical P rovider. Employee is required to comply with precautio ns or preve ntive measures outlined by the Medical Provider. Only when indicated by the Medical Provider, the i ndividual is to r eturn the Hepatitis B Form (App C) to the Safety Office when the series of shots have been completed. This will be maintained in the individual's HR/PR medical file. Step 5: The Safety Office will maintain a database for all individuals and send out a report annually to all supervisors/departments/PI. Re -evaluation is b ased on the nature of the hazards (respirators, substantial r isk areas, etc.) and when there are changes in work assignments (change in species, contact level, etc.). These hazards and risks will be determined by the supervisor, principal investigator, faculty, etc. Step 6: Complete all University required training prior to beginning work and annually thereafter.
