In some cases, we provide greater detail for you so that you will be equipped to answer technical questions. Please ask questions throughout!Approved COVID -19 vaccines in the U.S. Approved 4-8 weeks Approval status: Fully approved for 18+ Type of vaccine: Viral vector Approved population: 18+ Dosing: 1 shot Approval status: EUA There are 2 COVID -19vaccines that have received the FDA's full approval, and 1 approved with emergency use authorizati on (EUA). Several other COVID -19 vaccines are currently in development. Primary series vaccination protocol shown here. As of March 2022 Named :Comirnaty Type of vaccine : mRNA Approved population :5+ Dosing : 2 shots, 3-8 weeks apart Approval status : Fully approved for 16+; EUA for 5 -15 ALL 3 vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death. The CDC has updated its recommendation with a preference for mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna), in most situations, where possible. Refer to your healthcare provider and/or the CDC website for dose timing recommendations and considerations.Who can get the COVID -19 vaccines? 8Everyone age 5+ regardless of allergies, medications, pregnancy, or underlying medical conditions is eligible to receive a COVID -19 vaccine. Children under 5 years old for Pfizer (Comirnaty), and under 18 years old for Moderna (Spikevax ) and Johnson & Johnson. No vaccine has yet been authorized for children under 5, butapprovals may be coming soon. Those who experience a severe allergic reaction to the first dose of a two dose COVID -19 vaccine.The only groups NOT eligible to receive COVID -19 vaccination are: All vaccines provided through the U.S. government will be free of charge to all, including those without insurance. For those who have insurance, information will be collected, but there will be no out of pocket cost to the individual. COVID -19 vaccines for children 5 years and older Children 5 years and older are eligible to receive the two -dose Pfizer vaccine The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID -19 vaccination for all children and adolescents 5 years of age and older who do not have contraindications using a vaccine authorized for their age. Pfizer's two -dose vaccine received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for kids ages 5 -11in November 2021 ; older children have been eligible since July 2021 The vaccine is administered in two doses three weeks apart Kids 5 -11 receive 1/3 the dose of adults The vaccine can be safely and effectively administered at the same time as other vaccinesFacts about vaccines for children 5+Vaccine FAQs Children can get their vaccine at a variety of locations: Pediatrician's office School -based clinics Pharmacies Children's hospitals Other sites, such as county health clinics COVID -19 vaccines for children 5 years and older Why should my child get vaccinated? The vaccine is safe and effective at preventing children from becoming severely ill from COVID -19. Most children with COVID -19 have mild symptoms, but some can become extremely ill, resulting in hospitalization and death. Vaccination safeguards your child's health, and protects others who may be elderly, immunocompromised, or too young to become vaccinated. Vaccination will allow children to return safely to activities that foster mental, physical, and intellectual growth.Are there short -term or long -term side effects? Side effects are usually mild, last 1 -3 days, and are similar to those experienced by adults: pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, chills, muscle pain, fever, and joint pain. Regulatory agencies are monitoring limited reports of heart issues after COVID -19 vaccination. These cardiac issues are extremely rare, and therisk of these conditions is higher for those who become infected with COVID -19. The CDC, FDA, public health and medical experts are constantly monitoring the safety of the vaccines. Speak with your pediatrician to address any concerns over vaccine safety.Are the COVID -19 vaccines safe for pregnant people and their babies? Yes, the benefits of getting a COVID -19 vaccine far outweigh the risks for both mothers and their babies. Getting vaccinated against COVID -19 while pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding is safe, effective, and recommended . Evidence suggests that COVID -19 infection increases many pregnancy -related risks for both mother and baby, not COVID -19 vaccines. There is noevidence that vaccines cause miscarriage orinfertility. There is evidence that people vaccinated during pregnancy pass high levels of antibodies to their babies, and that people vaccinated against COVID -19 transfer SARS -CoV-2 antibodies to their breastfed infants, giving their babies passive immunity against COVID -19.As of 3/15/22, about 68.6% of pregnant people have been fully vaccinated, and many pregnant people remain unprotected. Source: CDC Why is vaccination critical for pregnant people? Vaccines safely reduce thelikelihood pregnant people will develop severe COVID -19. Pregnant people with COVID -19 are at an increased risk for preterm labor, preeclampsia, and maternal mortality . They are 2x as likely to require admission to the ICU, and 70% more likely to die than those who aren't pregnant. Babies whose mothers have COVID -19 are also more likely to face severe complications, such as premature birth, stillbirth, or death. Source: CDC,JAMA The role of a trusted messenger Stay up -to-date on COVID -19 vaccine information, emphasizing the safety and effectiveness at preventing harm to both the mother and the baby. Protecting the baby is the most stated reason apregnant person is likely to get vaccinated. Include the family in vaccine conversations, reiterating the safety of a fully vaccinated household forthe baby, who cannot yet be vaccinated. Family has a drastic impact on a mother's decision to getvaccinated. Connect expectant mothers to other peer and support groups. Listening and sharing testimonials and stories about COVID -19 experiences while pregnant can provide confidence to make the right decision. Vaccination rates among pregnant people remain alarmingly low, especially in Black and Latinx communities. Nearly 57% of pregnant people say they are not confident vaccines are safe for them ( KFF).What can I do to help?How were these vaccines created so quickly while ensuring that they are safe? Vaccines are reviewed and approved for use by the FDA through a rigorous process: In Summary... FDA safety evaluations were not changed or compromised during COVID -19 vaccine development. The vaccine process was faster because research and development, clinical trials, manufacturing, and plans for distribution are occurring at the same time, with unprecedented levels of government spending. Even after EUA, there is ongoing and rigorous monitoring for adverse events. On Aug 23, 2021, the FDA granted full approval of the Pfizer (Comirnaty) vaccine. OnJan 31, 2022, the FDA granted full approval of the Moderna ( Spikevax ) vaccine.Scientists already knew a lot about vaccine technology and were able to use this knowledge to design vaccines for trial1 The companies were able to start manufacturing planning in parallel with trials, with the help of huge $ investments from the government2 After strong evidence from 3 phases of trials, the vaccines received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)3 Continued monitoring & collection of (Spikevax ) received Jan 20224mRNA is a normal part of human biology. Your body is full of mRNA right now! These vaccines work by using mRNA as a \"messenger\" that contains a blueprint for the COVID -19 spike protein. This tells your body: make this protein. You then develop antibodies against COVID -19 spike proteins, creating immunity. Once your cells make the protein, the mRNA breaks down and does not stay in your body permanently. mRNA does notenter your cell's nucleus and cannot alter your DNA.No.While the Pfizer vaccine has been FDA approved and both Pfizer & Moderna are EUA recipients, research on mRNA for other diseases, such as Zika, cancer, and the flu, has been underway for 10 years. Vaccines based on injecting viral proteins (flu, tetanus, pneumonia) or live virus (oral polio, Chickenpox) take longer to produce. Because mRNA vaccines work off a blueprint, they can be created quickly. The COVID -19 vaccine passed every regulatory step for authorization. No corners were cut in thecreation of these vaccines.Explaining mRNA vaccines: Pfizer & Moderna Is mRNA new technology? How does it work? The vaccine cannot give you COVID -19because it contains no virus. Explaining viral vector vaccines: Johnson & Johnson Viral vector vaccines use a common virus [\"adenovirus\"] to alert your body's immune system. The virus is weakened and cannot cause disease . Like mRNA, the harmless virus delivers a blueprint, telling your body to make COVID -19 spike proteins. Antibodies develop to the spike protein, creating immunity. The harmless virus does not stay in your body.No, Johnson & Johnson has already used this method to develop an approved Ebola vaccine, and the technology has been used for a long time for gene therapy. The AstraZeneca vaccine, currently approved for use in other countries, and in final vaccine trials in the U.S., uses the same technology. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is an approved viral vector vaccine under EUA for COVID -19 and passed every FDA safety step .Are viral vectors new technology? How does it work? This vaccine cannot give you COVID -19because it uses a different, harmless virus to create immunity. For most people, side effects from the vaccine are mild 17Minor side effects are common after vaccination. These are short -lived and can include: Redness or swelling on the arm where you get the shot Weakness, fatigue Fever Muscle aches Headache Talk to your doctor or vaccine provider about theuse of over - the-counter medicine for side effects. Note: Experiencing side effects does not mean that you have COVID - 19. It is your body developing an immune response -which is a good thing. Not everyone has side effects. Both are normal.Side effects are caused by your own body's immune response to the vaccine. You will wait for 15 minutes after vaccination to make sure you have no serious reaction. If you have known allergies to an injectable medication, you'll wait 30 minutes.Severe reactions are very rare All vaccine sites have epinephrine on site (the medicine stored in an EpiPen) to address the rare possibility of a severe allergic reaction. Go to your primary care provider, clinic, or alert your vaccination site if: Side effects do not go away within 3 -4 days You received the J&J vaccine and are experiencing symptoms of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) Your risk of severe illness from COVID -19 infection is much higher than the risk of a severe reaction to the vaccine.Additional Doses: What is a booster? 18How do I know if I need one?A booster shot is an additional dose of a vaccine given after the initial recommended dose. Boosters are administered as an additional layer of defense to restore protection which may have decreased over time. Anyone 18+ who received J&J vaccine at least 2 months ago is eligible to receive a booster dose of any kind. Any adult (18+) who received the second dose of either Pfizer or Moderna vaccines at least 5 months ago is eligible to receive a booster dose of any kind. Children 12+ are also eligible for a booster dose of Pfizer 5 months after their second dose, which is recommended to increase protection against the Omicron variant. Immunocompromised children ages 5 and up may also receive a third dose of Pfizer's vaccine (Comirnaty) 28days after their second dose. *Note: The CDC has updated its recommendation with a preference formRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna), in most situations, where possible.Additional Doses: Mixing and Matching 19Yes. You may choose (depending on supply on site). If you do receive a booster vaccine that is different from the one you received for your primary dose, you should do so at the recommended interval for the booster dose of your original vaccine. If you initially received the J&J vaccine, you are eligible to receive abooster of any kind at least 2 months after your initial dose. Ifyou initially received either thePfizer (12+) orModerna (18+) vaccines for your primary series, you are eligible to receive a booster dose of any kind at least 5months after your second dose.Can I receive a different type of vaccine from my original primary series dose as a booster dose? Bing stock imageAdditional Doses for the Immunocompromised Third doses: Those with compromised immune systems may receive a third dose of either mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/Comirnaty or Moderna) as a part of their initial series May be referred to as an \"immune primer\" as it will \"prime\" immune levels for those whose bodies cannot develop immunity as well as others Can be received no sooner than 28 days after a second dose Some younger children (5 -11) who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may be eligible for an additional dose 28 days after their second shot of the Pfizer vaccineThird DosesVaccine FAQs Booster doses: Immunocompromised adults who completed anmRNA vaccine primary series and received a third mRNA dose may receive a single booster dose of any COVID -19 vaccine at least 3 months after their third Pfizer or Moderna dose, or 2 months after a J&J dose, fora total of four COVID -19 vaccine doses . This information is constantly evolving; immunocompromised people should speak to their clinical provider to learn more about appropriate timing of vaccination.COVID -19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe outcomes among the general population. However, some immunocompromised people require additional layers of protection.Will the vaccines still work against the variants? 21All viruses change naturally as they replicate. Mutations are expected. Sometimes, viruses change in a way that helps them become better at infecting people or faster at replicating. These changes canallow the viral variants tospread more easily from person to person. Low rates of vaccination and inequities in access persist globally and contribute totheemergence of new variants.Why do viral variants arise? What are the key COVID -19 variants? Experts are confident that current vaccines will provide protection against severe disease . Increasing vaccination will help prevent new variants from developing. It is important that you are fully vaccinated and receive your booster when eligible to ensure protection against the current variants , as well as those that may emerge in the future . You can help by wearing a mask and social distancing, regardless of whether or not you've been vaccinated. This will help protect those who cannot yet be vaccinated, including children, and those who are considered high -risk, such as the elderly, or those who are immunocompromised.Alpha (B.1.1.7): Emerged in September 2020 Beta (B.1.351): Emerged in September 2020 Gamma (P.1): Emerged inOctober 2020 Delta (B.1.617.2): Emerged in December 2020 Omicron (B.1.1.529 ):Emerged in November 2021 (Current dominant strain in U.S. as of March 2022)The Delta Variant: What made it different? 221Delta was far more contagious than other variants . 2Delta impacted children more than previous variants . 3Delta caused more severe illness than previous strains among unvaccinated people .Facts about Delta It was estimated to be 2x more infectious than previous strains. Pediatric COVID -19 cases drastically increased with Delta, esp. before those under 12 were able to receive a vaccine. Vaccines still proved quite effective against severe disease. 4The Delta variant more than doubled the risk of severe illness requiring hospitalization for unvaccinated people. Getting vaccinated and wearing a mask, regardless of vaccination status, helped to prevent COVID -19 spread in communities.HIGH TRANSMISSIBILITY INCREASED SEVERITY LIMITED IMMUNE ESCAPE Now, here's Omicron. How does it measure up? Omicron has dominated headlines since it was detected by public health authorities in late November. The Omicron variant (and its subvariants) has rapidly replaced Delta as the predominant strain. https://www.nytimes.co m/interactive/2021/12/ 14/science/omicron -variant -science.html1 2 3 4Omicron carries ~50 mutations not seen in this combo before - including 30 in the spike protein. Omicron spreads very easily, even more quickly than Delta. Incubation period is shorter; symptoms similar. Omicron causes milder illness than Delta. Risk of hospitalization appears to be lower. Vaccination and previous infection provide lower protection from infection than with other variants (though vaccination offers protection against severe disease); boosters provide protection.Breakthrough Cases: Why are fully vaccinated people still getting COVID? 24A person who is fully vaccinated and tests positive for COVID - 19 is considered a breakthrough case . No vaccine can provide full protection from any disease, but this does not mean they are ineffective. The available vaccines provide a high level of protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. In most breakthrough cases, the symptoms are mild, and do not require hospitalization or result in death.No vaccine is 100% effective, and breakthrough cases are expected. The vaccines drastically reduce your risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death. In addition to protecting you, vaccines provide protection for those around you. Full vaccination reduces your chances of catching and transmitting COVID -19. Not everyone is yet eligible for vaccination, such as children under 5. For others, such as those with compromised immune systems, COVID -19 vaccines provide less protection.Why should I get the vaccine if I still can get COVID? What are breakthrough cases?Vaccine FAQs Vaccines are still some of our best tools in protecting against the COVID -19 variants.Source: CDCVaccination is one measure to help stop the pandemic; other personal protection measures remain important.

Boston Health Care for the Homeless workers help to vaccinate the staff at St. Ambrose Shelter in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston.Masking and distancing -even if not required by your jurisdictions -are still useful tools to protect ourselves and those around us. As guidance changes, the onus shifts increasingly on toindividuals tounderstand and manage risk: Consider the environments you'll be in and for how long - ventilation, indoor/outdoor, ceiling height, duration, etc. Consider who is in your network -many of the highest risk among usremain vulnerable The CDC provides a tool to help communities decide what prevention steps to take based on the latest data. See the COVID -19 Community Levels tool here ,but know that you may choose to be more cautious depending on the circumstances above. You must still adhere to federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance, which may require masking.Many people face challenges in trying to get the vaccine Populations/communities who may experience more significant challenges - many of whom are already disproportionately impacted by COVID -19 -include the following: Low-income Non-English speaking or reduced literacy The elderly Medically frail or disabled (physical, mental, cognitive, and sensory) Isolated (due to geography, documentation status)Potential barriers to accessing the COVID -19 vaccine Source: CDC Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response, \"Public Health Workbook,\" https://emergency.cdc.gov/workbook/p df/ph_workbookfinal.pdf Structural Limited access to health care provider and trusted systems for social support Inability to navigate a complex health care system Information Inaccessibility of information on vaccine safety, efficacy, available distribution points, and scheduling options Pervasive misinformation Logistical Challenges in scheduling (for example, no computer) Lack of convenient locations, schedules, and / or available transportation Lack of personnel or equipment to administer vaccines27Your role as a community leader Information on COVID -19 vaccine efficacy and access Vaccine confidence Actions for community leaders Share key messages about vaccine safety, efficacy, distribution Enable access in your community Be an advocate Next steps in supporting your communityTRAINING AGENDA\"You can't look at that hesitancy at face value.

It is the responsibility of the public health system and health care providers to be trustworthy: listening to the concerns of everyone, answering questions and providing equitable care.Racism and inequityMany communities of color and indigenous people have suffered from generations of racism and inequality . Policies/structures that have caused harm include those related to education, economic opportunities, police violence, and housing conditions . Health system discriminationDiscrimination against people of color is embodied in unequal access to care, different health outcomes, and limited resources in poor communities. It is not just the legacy of experimentation (Tuskegee) but the lived experiences of limited and unequal access and care.

T hese side effects are usually mild and last 1 -3 days. Generally, side effects are more common in younger vs. older patients, and the 2nddose associated with more side effects than the 1st.Talk to your doctor or vaccine provider about taking over -the-counter medicines for managing any discomfort you may experience after getting vaccinated. Historically, long -term effects from vaccines are very rare. But just to reassure you, the CDC will continue to watch very closely as this is rolled out more widely.What side effects will the vaccine have? Are there going to be long -term side effects? Getting the COVID -19 vaccine helps prevent you from getting sick with COVID -19. COVID -19 can cause very serious illness and death. Older adults and persons with health conditions like diabetes or obesity are at an even greater risk. The more people who getthe vaccine, the better we can protect our families and communities, including those yet eligible for vaccination.Why should I get the COVID -19 vaccine? Medical and public health experts trust the very serious and thorough FDA approval process for the vaccines, as well as the ongoing public health regulatory system that constantly monitors ongoing vaccine safety and effectiveness. Results from both cli nical trials and real-world experiences reveal that the vaccines are very safe and work very well at preventing illness.Are the vaccines safe?Sample FAQ overview continued See complete list of FAQs for more messaging guidanceThe CDC recently updated its masking guidance, relaxing previous recommendations for near -universal mask wearing. Under the current guidance, most people in the U.S. (living in areas classified as low or medium risk) can now go maskless indoors in most cases. The CDC recommends continued mask use in communities at high risk where serious cases of COVID -19 are straining hospitals. You can check your community's COVID -19 risk level here . The CDC does recommend continued and consistent mask use for people who are personally at high risk, and for people with COVID -19 symptoms or a positive test, or exposure to someone with COVID -19. You must continue to adhere to local guidelines for mask wearing that may include settings such as public transportation or healthcare settings. Additionally, you can active ly take steps to continue to protect yourself and your family by getting vaccinated and boosted, masking and social distancing i n poorly ventilated spaces and crowds, cleaning and handwashing , and socializing largely outdoors . Do I still need to wear a mask and follow social distancing protocols after I take the vaccine? The speed of COVID -19 vaccine development is nota result of compromised safety or quality. The vaccine process is happening faster because research and development, clinical trials, manufacturing, and plans for distribution are occurring at the same time, with unprecedented levels of government spending. This method removes delays that occur when these processes are carried out sequentially. No standards in the safety evaluations have been changed during this process. Why were the vaccines developed so fast? I'm concerned that these vaccines did not undergo enough testing as other vaccines. "}
