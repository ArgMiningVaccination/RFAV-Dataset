WSmith is an important origin plant of the famous Tibetan medicine of HERBA LAGOTIS. It was clinically documented in Tibetan medicine as a drug used to treat 'Chi Ba Disease', whose symptoms are similar to ulcerative colitis (UC). Aims of this study: We investigated the effective materials and holistic mechanisms of L. integra W. W. Smith against UC. Materials and methods: The ingredients of L. integra W. W. Smith were comprehensively analyzed using UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS method. The mechanisms were investigated using network pharmacology method, which included target prediction, protein-protein interaction network analysis, and gene enrichment analysis. Then, the mechanisms were verified using DSS-induced UC. Finally, the core active components were further screened through molecular docking. Results: The results showed that 32 major components were identified, which included 8 flavonoids, 9 phenylpropanoid glycosides, 13 iridoid glycosides and 1 phenolic acid. 76 potential core therapeutic targets and top 5 key targets, which were AKT1, VEGFA, TNF-, EGFR and CASP3, were screened out according to network pharmacology analysis. Animal experiments confirmed that those compounds could downregulate the protein expression levels of the 5 key target proteins in colonic tissue of mice to exert excellent anti-UC effect. Molecular docking results showed that the main active ingredients were Echinacoside, Hemiphroside B, Plantamajoside, Plantainoside D and 10-O-trans-isoferuloyl catalpol and Scutellarioside II. Conclusions: For the first time, our study provides insights into the effective materials and molecular mechanisms of L. integra W. W. Smith treating ulcerative colitis, which contributes to the understanding of its mechanism of action. Keywords: L. integra W. W.
