It is...", "sitename": "bartleby.com", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "The findings of this survey showed that 73.6% agreed with the use of traditional medicines for health maintenance, 79.2% agreed for benign illness, such as colds or sprained ankles, and 90.3% agreed for palliative care (Zubek, 1994, p. 1926). Where they disagreed the most was with the use of traditional healing in the intensive care units, only 16.9% agreed with the use of this treatment for serious illness, such as cardiac or respiratory compromise, whether in the hospital (21.2% agreed) or as outpatients (26.4% agreed). Nearly half (48.6%) agreed with using traditional medicines for chronic illnesses, such as non-insulin dependent diabetes or Parkinson's disease (Zubek, 1994, p. 1926). One instance where physicians were unwilling to allow their patients to use Native medicine was while the patient is in the hospital, because the physician could be held legally responsible for any treatment administered while admitted under their care. There is also the problem of differentiating between legitimate Native healing practitioners and those who would take advantage of anyone not aware of the proper rituals and techniques that need to be performed (Zubek, 1994, p. 1929). This could be overcome by having a formalized licensing organization such as is used by Western practitioners (i.e. American Society of Clinical Pathology [ASCP]). That poses another problem though, as to whether traditionalists would be willing to have such an organization. Throughout the years there have been two traditions within the practice of medicine. One is the 'art of healing ' which involves its own specialised brand of training. The art of healing is dependent on the prescriber 's foreknowledge and the clients' viewpoint of the prosperous results. The 'Science of healing ' is based on scientific and technological ideas. This tradition results in a lower liability for practitioners regarding the showing of an original approach to medicine, however the results of this method are more calculable (Kayne 2002). It is believed that the tradition of the 'art of healing' is increasing in popularity. The World Health Organisation states ' 'that the terms ' 'complementary medicine ' ' or ' 'alternative medicine' ' are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country 's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system\" (World Health Organization 2000). This type of treatment, is commonly known as 'Complementary and alternative medicine' (CAM). The word complementary derives from the meaning 'together with' established practices and the word alternative refers to 'in place' of established practices. Some patients choose to participate in complementary therapies along with the medication prescribed by their general practitioner whilst others prefer complementary therapies as opposed to the medications It could be considered that conventional medicine has indirectly contributed to the rise of complementary and alternative medicine. A broad definition of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is \"a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system\" (The World Health Organisation, n.d.). Expanding on this definition it is important to address the variable similarities of CAM modalities. CAM therapies across the various modalities have in common a shared, in varying degrees, holistic approach and subscribe to some form of vitality - a contrast from the science-based view point of conventional medicine prevalent in western society. In spite of CAM therapies empirical nature and efficacies, it is suggested that dissatisfaction of conventional medicine underpins the popularity it has garnered, thus, it will be examined further as to how and why. A further discussion will be made to related dangers of both alternative and science-based medicine; providing an opportunity to constructively educate the public on the differences between the two systems. In modern medicine, alternative therapies are poorly understood and studied. The preference for alternative therapies, and herbal medicine were indicated, and the fear of relinquishing information regarding these practices were almost paralyzing. It seemed as though they were ashamed to admit to cultural healing practices, and did not divulge information to practitioners regarding their usage. The cultural disconnect was present as alternative/complimentary medicines are valued as a culture, and \"modern\" practitioners cast judgment on their usage. This perceived stigma additionally limited the information shared by the cultural participants with modern medical treatments, potentially causing additional harm, as some herbals are potentially toxic. An Art of Balance: The Role of Holistic Medicine in Modern Healthcare By: Alex C. Thau Bioethics 4242 12/3/16 Over the last 10,000 years, humans have evolved more than any other species that has ever set foot on planet Earth. As a population we have grown exponentially and made changes to our society that allow us to do things that have not been done before. In 1878, Thomas Edison recognized the ability of a bamboo filament that was connected to platina wires, to burn for significant periods of time: resulting in the first formation of the light bulb. Suddenly, the human race no longer had to endure the darkness that each night brought at the end of a 12-hour light period. There are still many people on both sides of the spectrum that are skeptical about treatment methods that differ from what they are used to. The validity of an herbal healer in the western world is more likely to be questioned than that of a medical doctor; while in the east, families may have been seeing a healer for decades and are more likely to question the validity of a doctor practicing western Holistic Healthcare-How Should Nursing Support Patients' Rights? Healthcare treatments are no longer being determined by set protocols for a particular diagnosis or disease process. Increasingly more common, individualized, patient-driven adaptations are being implemented to improve adherence and compliance with treatment. Society as a whole is changing. The influx Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a term that describes health and wellness therapies that have not been part of conventional medicine. Complementary treatments is with conventional medicine, and alternative treatments is used in place of conventional medicine. It can include treatments and therapies such as massage, natural products, meditation, yoga, vitamin supplements, herbs, chiropractic, acupuncture, and lots more. But problems arise when CAM is questioned if it scientifically helps patients overcome a disease. Is there really health benefits? Are some of the products natural? Do they come with risks? These are questions that can be asked when looking into CAM. Alternative medicine should not be funded because it is not as successful as conventional treatments. Holistic medicine is nothing more than the study of natural products in an effort to scrutinize what herbs help in a dietary way or revitalize health. When has the study of natural and dietary products become \"alternative\"? David Gorski an associate professor at Wayne State University argues that the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) should not be funded because the agency promotes alternative and complementary therapies in the absence of rigorous scientific evidence that they are effective. Conventional treatments become conventional treatments due to rigorous testing. Rigorous testing is required because it \"The Alternative Medicine Racket\" talks about how a few people tried to introduce alternative medicine into American Culture. The National Institute of Health took supposed \"mystical\" therapy from what they called fraud sources, and implanted them directly into the heart of the medical establishment. In 1984, the government released a report on fraudulent medicine in America and concluded that billions of American taxpayer money was being swindled by untested herbs and energy therapies that filled the aisle of stores and pages of magazines. These were aimed towards a vulnerable population: the elderly, desperate, and terminally ill. Fifty experts called for a crackdown (or should I say \"quackdown\") on the alternative therapies (that we'll refer to as \"quackery\"). In the late 1980's, a senator named Tom Harkin was positive that bee pollen had cured his hay fever and wondered \"Why isn't anyone funding this?\", leading him to establish the Office of Alternative Medicine. HERBALISM IN RUSSIA Heather Riley RUSC 101: Culture and Society of Russia 4 October 2015 Thesis: Efficacy of traditional herbal remedies combined with a cultural faith in those traditions, combats modern medicine 's inherent distrust of traditional healing. Mainstream medicine, defined as methods such as drugs, radiation, and surgery used to treat illness, is contrasted against natural medicine, defined as unorthodox therapies used to treat illness that are not accepted by the mainstream medical community. Natural medicine was used throughout history in many different cultures for treating all sorts of maladies and diseases. The discovery of penicillin brought on the dispensation of, what is referred to as, the mainstream medical era until the comeback of alternative remedies and natural medicine in the 1970s. Mainstream medicine is practical in certain situations in which the cause can easily be ascertained and prevented in future cases. It is also used to cover up symptoms of illness or disease in situations where a root problem needs to be discovered and addressed. These are the situations in which natural medicine should be utilized. Acupuncture, chiropractic, massage therapy, and reflexology are a few practices that have been shown to greatly reduce pain and stress in the body. These techniques have also been displayed as effective methods in promoting the restoration of the body to homeostasis, a relatively stable balance. Natural medicine should be viewed as a feasible option, alongside Introduction Alternative healthcare options also known as alternative medicine is \"any of various method of healing or treating disease that is not included under traditional medical practice in the United States and Britain\" (Webster dictionary). These alternatives include methods such as hypnosis, acupuncture, aromatherapy, chiropractic therapy, spiritual or faith healing amongst others. Alternative medicine is the term used for medical products and practices that are not part of the standard of care. Standard of care is what medical doctors, doctors of traditional medicine, and allied health professionals, such as nurses and physical therapists, practice. Alternative medicine is used in place of standard medical care. Examples of alternative practices that do not include traditional medicine are aroma therapy, diet therapy, herbalism, homeopathy, massage therapy, reflexology, chiropractic therapy, cannabis, faith or spiritual healing and acupuncture amongst others (Medicine.net). Alternative medical systems are built upon complete systems of theory and practice sometimes these systems develop into something substantial; some if these systems have even developed in western cultures. Examples of alternative medical systems that have developed in Western cultures are homeopathic medicine and naturopathic medicine. Examples of systems that have developed in non-Western cultures include traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda (Medicine.net). There are more than a hundred \"You have a sprained ankle? Let's go to my friend who does acupuncture;\" mom, \"Yeah I have depression? But I just dance it all off;\" Maxine.\" While we are given hard evidences that alternative medicines, such as herbalism, natural remedies, or even ancient techniques, work miracles. Society still wants to discredit alternative medicine and some even go through great lengths trying to remove it completely as it is \"misleading the public\" (Quackery). Especially big pharmaceutical companies because the \"idea of people could heal themselves or could grow their own medicines or relying on themselves or each other. This terrifies the medical establishments, it terrifies the pharmaceutical giants, it terrifies doctors and the hospitals\" (Adam). These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
