The Times of India on Sunday reported, based on state figures, 525 fatalities. 1,266 fresh cases were recorded on Saturday. - Fatalities across the world are 160,925 (over 2.33 million infections). [TODAY'S TAKE] [As lockdown eases, another test begins] - With a possible relaxation in the lockdown in some districts due from tomorrow, the race to tame Covid-19 is likely to shift gears too \u2014 with those with the fewest number of red zones, or containment zones, likely to see a resurgence in economic activity. Kerala and Tamil Nadu (TN), the two states which may be [flattening the curve](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-tamil-nadu-on-way-to-flattening-covid-19-curve/articleshow/75213804.cms?utm_source=nl_landingpage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=covid_bytes_daily_newsletter) against Covid-19 \u2014 Kerala saw just 32 new cases between April 11-17 while TN saw nearly twice as many people being discharged from hospitals than those who got admitted on Friday \u2014 have independently ordered the rapid testing antibody kits. While 1 lakh kits are due to arrive in Kerala, Tamil Nadu has ordered 4 lakh testing kits, of which [1 lakh are due to reach](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-expecting-to-receive-one-lakh-more-rapid-test-kits-by-next-weekend/article31378861.ece?utm_source=nl_landingpage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=covid_bytes_daily_newsletter) within a week. - Other states and UTs, like Chhattisgarh, Goa, Haryana, J&K, Jharkhand and Karnataka are also getting [aggressive in testing for Covid-19](https://indianexpress.com/article/coronavirus/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-kits-kerala-delhi-maharashtra-cases-death-toll-6368759/?utm_source=nl_landingpage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=covid_bytes_daily_newsletter), with the focus now shifting to anyone showing influenza like illness (ILI) and also to check community transmission. In J&K and Jharkhand, for instance, the focus will be on testing in the hotspots or the red zones while Haryana will be deploying the rapid test kits to check the healthcare workers and police personnel who are directly exposed to the virus carriers. - In states like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Bihar, the governments have asked pharmacies and chemist shops to note down the names, phone numbers and addresses of all those who are [buying medicines for cold, cough or fever](https://indianexpress.com/article/coronavirus/states-ask-shops-to-keep-records-of-those-buying-fever-cold-drugs-6368811/?utm_source=nl_landingpage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=covid_bytes_daily_newsletter) \u2014 the suspicion being that people may be trying to hide Covid-19 symptoms. - The need to restart the economy has been gathering urgency, with PM Narendra Modi in his address on April 14 making the relaxation in the lockdown from tomorrow conditional on how well the outbreak is contained. Kerala's proposal of [opening up restaurants and pubs](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-set-to-open-restaurants-start-odd-even-for-cars/articleshow/75227893.cms?utm_source=nl_landingpage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=covid_bytes_daily_newsletter) in the state from tomorrow has been accepted by the Centre. Along with that, it will also enforce an odd-even rule for vehicles. According to the health ministry, 47 districts across 23 states [haven't reported a single new case](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-case-in-47-districts-across-23-states-in-14-days/articleshow/75227929.cms?utm_source=nl_landingpage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=covid_bytes_daily_newsletter) of Covid-19 for the last 14 days. [TELL ME ONE THING] [Obesity could be a risk] - Emerging research into severe coronavirus cases has found that obesity appears to pose a much greater risk than expected. People with obesity often have other medical problems as well, but new studies \u2014 in the [US](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057794v1?utm_source=nl_landingpage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=covid_bytes_daily_newsletter), [France](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/oby.22831?utm_source=nl_landingpage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=covid_bytes_daily_newsletter) and [China](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3556658&utm_source=nl_landingpage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=covid_bytes_daily_newsletter) \u2014 point to obesity itself as the second most significant complicating factor in severe coronavirus cases, after age. Young adults with obesity appear to be at particular risk, even if they have no other health issues. - It's not yet known why, though doctors note that some coronavirus patients with obesity may already have compromised respiratory function that preceded the infection. Abdominal obesity, more prominent in men, can cause compression of the diaphragm, lungs and chest capacity. Obesity is known to cause chronic, low-grade inflammation and an increase in circulating, pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may play a role in the worst Covid-19 outcomes. - Obesity's link to chronic diseases is well known, but the experience with H1N1 influenza in 2009 revealed that people with obesity are also more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Studies have also shown that they do not get the same protection from influenza vaccinations that others do. [STAY SAFE] [Paper towels over hand dryers] - While regular, 20-second handwashes are a must, the method used to dry hands can also help reduce microbial contamination not just on hands but also on the body and the environment outside the washroom. And according to researchers, including those from University of Leeds in the UK, using paper towels are substantially more effective than jet dryers for removing viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19. - For the [study](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/ditch-jet-dryers-paper-towels-more-effective-in-removing-coronavirus-after-washing-hand/articleshow/75200138.cms?from=mdr&utm_source=nl_landingpage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=covid_bytes_daily_newsletter), four apron-clad volunteers washed their hands after being contaminated with a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria and is harmless to humans). They dried their hands with either paper towels or an air dryer in a hospital public washroom. After drying, they were asked to cross their arms with aprons on, then rest their hands on armchairs. The researchers then took samples from surfaces they touched, such as the armchairs, doors, stair rails, elevator buttons, chairs, phones and intercoms, etc. - While both paper towels and air dryers significantly reduced the virus from contaminated hands, on all the surfaces tested, more contaminate was found after air drying than after using paper towels. In fact, average surface contamination was more than 10 times higher after air drying than after using paper towels, the researchers found. - Also, more than five times the contamination was found on the aprons and clothing and surfaces touched by clothing after air drying than drying with paper towels. Only after air drying was contamination found on the armchairs via the crossed arms, the researchers noted. |Follow news that matters to you in real-time.| Join 3 crore news enthusiasts. [THE GOOD NEWS] [Oxford promises early vaccine] - Researchers at the University of Oxford are aiming to get efficacy results of a clinical trial and be able to produce a million doses [by September](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52329659?utm_source=nl_landingpage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=covid_bytes_daily_newsletter). The researchers have recruited 500 volunteers from the age group of 18 to 55 for early and mid-stage randomised controlled trials, reports Bloomberg. It will then be extended to older adults and to a final stage trial of 5,000 people, Sarah Gilbert, the lead researcher developing the vaccine, said. - The team at the University of Oxford had been preparing for an event like the Covid-19 pandemic before the current global outbreak, reports BBC. They had already created a genetically engineered chimpanzee virus that would form the basis for the new vaccine. They then combined it with parts of the "}
