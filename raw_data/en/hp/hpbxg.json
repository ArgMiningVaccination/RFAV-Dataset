It is acceptable to offer and deliver influenza immunisation to these children with their class peers under this PGD . 4 Exclusion under this PGD does not necessarily mean the medicat ion is contraindicated, but it would be outside its remit and another form of authorisation will be required 5 Residues from the manufacturing process may include details. v1 1.00 Valid from: 1 September 2022 Expiry: 1 April 2023 Page 9 of 18 Cautions including any relevant action to be taken Individuals with a bleeding disorder may develop a haematoma at the injection site (see Route of Administration ). Individuals with a severe anaphylaxis to egg which has previously required intensive care can be immunised in any setting using an egg -free vaccine, for instance QIVc or QIVr. Individuals with less severe egg allergy can be immunised in any setting using an egg -free vaccine or an inactivated influenza vaccine with an ovalbumin content less than 0.12 micrograms/ml (equivalent to 0.06 micrograms for 0.5 ml dose). For details of the influenza vaccines available for the 2022 to 2023 season and their ovalbumin content see All influenza vaccines marketed in the UK for the 2022 to 2023 season . Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination especially in adolescents as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic -clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. Action to be taken if the patient is excluded The risk to the individual of not being immunised must be taken into account. The indications for flu vaccination are not exhaustive, and the healthcare practitioner should consider the risk of flu exacerbating any underlying disease that a n individual may have, as well as the risk of serious illness from flu itself . Where appropria te, such individuals should be referred, or a PSD obtained for immunisation . In case of postponement due to acute illness, advise when the individual can be vaccinated and ensure another appointment is arranged. Document the reason for exclusion and any action taken in the individual's clinical records . Seek appropriate advice from the local Screening and Immunisation Team, local Health Protection Team or the individual's clinician as required . Inform or refer to the GP or a prescriber as appropriate . Action to be taken if the patient or carer declines treatment Informed consent, from the individual or a person legally able to act on the person's behalf, must be obtained for each administration (see Additional Information ). Where a person lacks the cap acity, in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act 2005 , a decision to vaccinate may be made in the individual's best interests. For further information on consent see Chapter 2 of 'The Green Book '. Advise the individual/parent/carer about the protective effects of the vaccine, the risks of infection and potential complications if not immunised. Document advice given and the decision reached.

See product SPCs , available from the electronic medicines compendium website , for indication of current black triangle status. Off-label use Continued over page Where a vaccine is recommended off -label, as part of the consent process, consider informing the individual/parent /carer that the vaccine is being offered in accordance with national guidance but that this is outside the product licence. 6 QIVe is suitable to offer to these children but as a second option. QIVe has not been procured by the UKHSA for this age group. 7 Including those turning age 65 years by 31 March 2023 8 JCVI recommended use of QIV -HD in this age group but this is not curre ntly available in the UK market. Inactivated 1.00 Valid from: 1 September 2022 Expiry: 1 April 2023 Page 11 of 18 Off-label use (continued) The aQIV is licensed for administrati on to individuals aged 65 years and over. It may be administered under this PGD to those aged 64 years and turning 65 years of age by 31 March 202 3 in accordance with the recommendations for the national influenza immunisation programme for the 2022 to 2023 season (see Appendix C of the annual flu lett er dated 22 April 2022 ). QIVc is licensed for those aged from 2 years. QIVc , which is egg -free, can be administered under this PGD to egg allergic children aged 6 months to less than 2 years as advised by JCVI (see Appendix D of the annual flu letter dated 22 April 2022 ). Vaccine should be stored according to the conditions detailed in the Storage section below. However, in the event of an inadvertent or unavoidable deviation of these conditions refer to Vaccine Incident Guidance . Where vaccine is assessed in accordance with these guidelines as appropriate for continued use this would constitute off -label administration under this PGD. Note: Different influenza vaccine product s are licensed from different ages and should be administered within th eir licence when working to this PGD , unless permitted off -label administration is detailed above . Refer to products ' SPCs , available from the electronic medicines compendium website , and All influenza vaccines marketed in the UK for the 2022 to 2023 season for more information. Route / method of administration Continued over page Administer by intramuscular injection, preferably into the deltoid region of the upper arm. The anterolateral aspect of the thigh is the preferred site for infants under 1 year old. Individuals on stable anticoagulation therapy, including ind ividuals on warfarin who are up to date with their scheduled INR testing and whose latest INR was below the upper threshold of their therapeutic range, can receive intramuscular vaccination. A fin e needle (23 gauge or 25 gauge ) should be used for the vaccination, followed by firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. If in any doubt, consult with the clinician responsible for prescribing or monitoring the individua l's anticoagulant therapy. Individuals with bleeding disorders may be vaccinated intramuscularly if, in the opinion of a doctor familiar with the individual's bleeding risk, vaccines or similar small volume intramuscular injections can be administered with reasonable safety by this route. If the individual receives medication/treatment to reduce bleeding, for example treatment for haemophilia, intramuscular vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such medication/treatment is administered. A fine needle ( 23 gauge or 25 gauge ) should be used for the vaccination, followed by firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. The individual/parent/carer should be informed about the risk of haematoma from the injection. Influenza vac cines licensed for both intramuscular or subcutaneous administration may alternatively be administered by the subcutaneous route. Note: QIVc , QIVr and aQIV are not licensed for subcutaneous administration so should only be administered intramuscularly unde r this PGD. When administering at the same time as other vaccines care should be taken to ensure that the appropriate route of injection is used for all the vaccinations. The vaccines should be given at separate sites, preferably in different limbs. If given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart. The site at which each vaccine was given should be noted in the individual's records. Inactivated influenza PGD v1 1.00 Valid from: 1 September 2022 Expiry: 1 April 2023 Page 12 of 18 Route / method of administration (continued) If aQIV needs to be administered at the same time as another vaccine, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. Shake vaccine before administration. Inspect visually prior to administration and ensure appearance is consistent with the description in the products SPC. The SPCs provide further guidance on administration and are available from the electronic medicines compendium website . Dose and frequency of administration Single 0.5ml dose to be administered for the current annual flu season. Children in a clinical risk group aged 6 months to less than 9 years old who have not previously received any doses of influenza vaccine should be offered a seco nd dose of vaccine at l east 4 weeks later. The influenza vaccines are interchangeable, although the individual 's age , recommended vaccine and vaccine licence should be considered (see Off-label use section) . JCVI has advised that whe n a choice of either a 0.25ml or 0.5ml dose is indicated in the SPC, the 0.5ml dose of inactivated influenza vaccine should be given to individuals from age 6 months because there is evidence that this dose is effective in young children. Duration of treatment Single 0.5ml dose for the current annual flu season (1 September 20 22 to 31 March 202 3). Children aged 6 months to less than 9 years old in a clinical risk group who have not received influenza vaccine previously should be offered a second dose of the vacc ine at least 4 weeks later. Quantity to be supplied / administered Single dose of 0.5m l per administration . Supplies Centrally procured vaccine is available via ImmForm for children. Supplies for administration to adults should be ordered from the influenza vaccine manufacturers/wholesalers as in previous years. Protocols for the ordering, storage and handling of vaccines should be followed to prevent vaccine wastage ( see the Green Boo k Chapter 3 ). Storage Store at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C. Do not freeze. Store in original packaging in order to protect from light. In the event of an inadvertent or unavoidable deviation of these conditions vaccine that has been stored outside the conditions stated above should be quarantined and risk assessed for suitabilit y of continued off -label use or appropriate disposal. R efer to Vaccine Incident Guidance . Disposal Equipment used for immunisation, including used vials, ampoules, or discharged vaccines in a syringe or applicator, should be disposed of safely in a UN-approved puncture -resistant 'sharps' box, according to local authority arrangements and guidance in the technical memorandum 07 -01: Safe management of healthcare waste (Department of Health, 2013). Drug interactions Continued over page Immunological response may be diminished in those receiving immunosuppressive treatment, but it is important to still immunise this group. Because of the absence of data on co -administration of Shingrix\u00ae vaccine with adjuvante d influenza vaccine, it should not be routine to offer Inactivated influenza PGD v1 1.00 Valid from: 1 September 2022 Expiry: 1 April 2023 Page 13 of 18 Drug interactions (continued) appointments to give this vaccine at the same time as the adjuvanted influenza vaccine. Based on current information, scheduling should ideally be separated by an interval of at least 7 days to avoid i ncorrect attribution of potential adverse events. Where individuals attend requiring both vaccines, however, and require rapid protection or are considered likely to be lost to follow up, co -administration may still be considered. Inactivated influenza vac cine may be given at the same time as other vaccines (See Route / method of administration ). Where co -administration does occur, individuals should be informed about the likely timing of potential adverse event s relating to each vaccine. If the vaccines are not given together, they can be administered at any interval, although separating the vaccines by a day or two will avoid confusion over systemic side effects. As all of the current COVID -19 vaccines are cons idered inactivated (including the non -replicating adenovirus vaccine), where individuals in an eligible cohort present having recently received COVID -19 vaccination, influenza vaccination should still be given. A detailed list of drug interactions is available in the SPC for each vaccine, which are available from the electronic medicines compendium website . Identification and management of adverse reactions Pain, swelling or redness at th e injection site, low -grade fever, malaise, shivering, fatigue, headache, myalgia and arthralgia are among the commonly reported symptoms after intramuscular vaccination. A small painl ess nodule (induration) may also form at the injection site. These sympt oms usually disappear within 1 to 2 days without treatment. Immediate reactions such as urticaria, angio -oedema, bronchospasm and anaphylaxis can occur. A higher incidence of mild post -immunisation reactions has been reported with adjuvanted compared to non -adjuvanted influenza vaccines. The frequency of injection site pain and systemic reactions may be higher in individuals vaccinated concomitantly with i nactivated influenza vaccine and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV23 ) compared to vaccination with influenza vaccine alone and similar to that observed with PPV23 vaccination alone. Influenza vaccine and PPV23 may be administered at the same visit or at any interval from each other . A detailed list of adverse reactions is available in the SPC for each vaccine, which are available from the electronic medicines compendium website . Reporting procedure of adve rse reactions Healthcare professionals and individual s/parents/carers are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) using the Yellow Card reporting scheme or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store. QIVe vaccine from Viatris (formerly Mylan ), QIVc, QIVr and aQIV are black triangle. Therefore , any suspected adverse reactions should be reported via the Yellow Card Scheme . Any adverse reaction to a vaccine should be documented in the individual's record and the individual's GP should be informed. Written information to be given to patient or carer Offer marketing authorisation holder's patient information leaflet (PIL) provided the vaccine. PGD v1 1.00 Valid from: 1 September 2022 Expiry: 1 April 2023 Page 14 of 18 Patient advice / follow up treatment Individuals should be advised regarding adverse reactions to vaccination and reassured that the inactivated vaccine cannot cause influenza. However , the vaccine will not provide protection for about 14 days and does not protect against other respiratory viruses that often circulate during the flu season. Immunosuppressed individuals should be advised that they may not make a full immune response to the vaccine. Therefore, consideration should be given to the influenza vaccination of their household contacts. Inform the individual /parent/carer of possible side effects and their management. The individual /parent/carer should be advised when to seek medical advice in the event of an adverse reaction. When applicable, advise the individual/parent/carer when to return for vaccination or when a subsequent vaccine dose is due. Special considerations / additional information Ensure there is immediate access to adrenaline (epinephrine) 1 in 1,000 injection and easy access to a telephone at the time of vaccination. Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation may be postponed until they have fully recovered. For children under the age of 16 years, those assessed as Gi llick competent can self -consent (for further information on consent see Chapter 2 of 'The Green Book '). Individuals with learning disabilities may require reasonable adjustments to support vaccination (see Flu vaccinations: supporting people with learning disabilities ). A PSD may be required. The licensed ages for the 20 22 to 2023 season influenza vaccines are: QIVe licensed from 6 months of age QIVc licen sed from 2 years of age (see Off-label section) QIVr licensed from 18 years of age aQIV licensed from 65 years of age (see Off-label section) For 50 to 6 4 year olds, the advice of JCVI is the most vulnerable cohorts should be prioritised over the otherwise healthy 50 to 64 year olds and given the most effective vaccines available first, QIVr or QIVc where possible, while QIVe should be reserved for otherwis e healthy 50 to 64 year olds. However, QIVe is suitable to offer as a second option for vulnerable cohorts. School aged children will be offered the flu vaccination through the school age immunisation service via school or community settings. Primary schoo l aged children will be prioritised earlier in the season with secondary school aged children in years 7, 8 and 9 being invited later. Should vaccine supplies allow , further secondary school years may be included upon the instruction of the Commissioner. The date from which individuals in these additional cohorts may be vaccinated will be communicated directly with the Provider by their Commissioner.

All records should be clear, legible and contemporaneous. As a wide variety of influenza vaccines are available on the UK market each year, it is especially important that the exact brand of vaccine, batch number and site at which each vaccine is given is accurately recorded in the individual's records. It is important that vaccinations given either at a general practice or elsewhere (for example at antenatal clinics) are recorded on appropriate health records for the individual (using the appropriate clinical code) in a timely manner. If given elsewhere, systems should be in place to ensure a record of vaccination is returned to the individual 's general practice to allow clinical follow up and to avoid duplicate vaccination. For pregnant women, also record immunisation in the hand held and electronic mate rnity record if available. A record of all individuals receiving treatment under this PGD should also be kept for audit purposes in accordance with local policy.
