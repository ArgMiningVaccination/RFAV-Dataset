[BNT162b2]and Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1-S [vaccines]against confirmed covid-19 symptoms (including the UK variant of concern B.1.1.7), admissions to [hospital], and deaths. DESIGN:Test [aged]70 years and older [who]reported symptoms of covid-19 between 8 December 2020 and 19 February 2021 and were successfully linked to [vaccination]data in the National Immunisation Management System. INTERVENTIONS: [Vaccination]with reaction]confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, admissions to [hospital]for covid-19, and deaths with covid-19. RESULTS:Participants [aged]80 years and older vaccinated with [BNT162b2]before 4 January 2021 had a higher odds of testing positive for covid-19 in the first nine days after [vaccination]( [odds ratio]up to 1.48, 95% [confidence interval]1.23 to 1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying [risk]of [infection]. [Vaccine effectiveness]was therefore compared with the baseline post- [vaccination]period. [Vaccine]effects were noted 10 to 13 [dose]a [vaccination] [effectiveness]of 89% (85% to 93%) was found compared with the increased baseline [risk]. Participants [aged]70 years and older vaccinated from 4 January (when ChAdOx1-S delivery commenced) had a [similar]underlying [risk]of covid-19 to With [BNT162b2], [vaccine effectiveness]reached 61% (51% to 69%) from days after [vaccination], then plateaued. With ChAdOx1-S, effects were seen from 14 to 20 days after [vaccination], reaching an [effectiveness]of 60% (41% to 73%) from 28 to 34 days, increasing to 73% (27% to 90%) from day 35 onwards. On top of the [protection]against symptomatic [disease], a further [BNT162b2]. received [emergency] [hospital]admission. Follow-up to assess the effect of ChAdOx1-S on [mortality]. Combined with the effect against symptomatic [disease], a [single dose]of either [vaccine]was about 80% effective at [hospital]with covid-19 and a [single dose]of [BNT162b2]was 85% one [dose]of [BNT162b2]or ChAdOx1-S was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic covid-19 in older [adults], and with further [protection]against severe [disease]. Both [vaccines]showed [similar]effects. [Protection]was maintained for of follow-up (>6 weeks). A second [dose]of [BNT162b2]was associated with further [protection]against symptomatic [disease]. A clear effect of the [vaccines]against "}
