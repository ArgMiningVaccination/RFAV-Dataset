All Maine emergency physicians and the regional EMS programs were invited to participate in the review and adoption of these protocols through their MEMS Regional Councils. The Regional Medical Directors agree that when treatments are adopted in their regions, they will be consistent with these protocols. The protocols will be continually reviewed. New or revised protocols will be listed on the Protocol Errata form located on the Maine EMS website.

Advanced Airway means the skills of endotracheal intubation and use of other airway modalities such as Blind Insertion Airway Devices (BIAD) performed only by those who have completed practical training in each of these skills. AEMT (Advanced EMT) means the ability to provide Advanced EMT level of care (previously called Intermediate EMT). AHA means the American Heart Association ALS (Advanced Life Support) means the ability to provide advanced level of medical care, which in the prehospital realm means Paramedic . The ALS skills may include the following: IV access, advanced airway, cardiac monitoring, and/or oral or parenteral medications. ALS (Advanced Life Support) If Available means that the patient shall receive the highest appropriate ALS intervention as soon as possible. The decision in this realm as to which interventions may be appropriate rests with the Paramedic, if available. If any skills other than basic life support are deemed necessary or initially implemented, an ALS response should be sought, with simultaneous dispatch if possible. The use of a medical priority dispatching program, approved by the State Medical Director, is encouraged. When this cannot happen, the crew in attendance should bring ALS care and the patient together in the fastest of three ways: (1) ALS back-up at the scene; (2) ALS back-up met en route; or (3) ALS by hospital staff in the emergency department if prehospital rendezvous is not possible. The BLS providers on the scene may modify the ALS response as appropriate. BP in these protocols refers to the systolic blood pressure. Continuous Nebulization is administration of 3 unit doses of albuterol or albuterol-ipratropium without interruption; that is, put all 3 unit doses into the nebulizer at the same time (if volume allows) and administer until complete OR administer 1 unit dose x 3 without waiting between administrations. Emergency Department means a hospital that provides an organized Emergency Service or Department that is available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week and has the capability to provide On-Line Medical Control, to evaluate, treat, stabilize, and to refer to an appropriate outside resource all persons who present themselves for treatment. For Historical Purposes OnlyDefinitions Page 7 Purple 2Emergency Medical Responder The MDPB recognizes the Emergency Medical Responder (EMR) scope of practice to include the following: a. Airway management, including manual maneuvers, suctioning, application of supplemental O 2, and use of the following airway adjuncts - pocket mask, OPA/NPA, BVM b. Acquisition of manual vital signs c. Application of medications for force protection only (such as the Mark 1 kit) d. Performance of manual CPR and use of AED e. Assistance in normal childbirth f. Manual stabilization of the cervical spine or extremity injuries g. Hemorrhage control, including use of a tourniquet h. Emergency moves i. Eye irrigation The Maine EMS EMR may practice within this scope of practice to include these skills EMS Provider means any person or service licensed by Maine EMS to provide emergency medical services. End-tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2) is a measurement of carbon dioxide in exhaled air used to assess ventilation, also referred to as capnography. The capnography monitoring must be continuous and with a device that displays a waveform Fluid Bolus indicates maximum fluid administration achievable without pumps or other special equipment in the field setting. Specifically, running a large bore IV wide open until the desired clinical condition or blood pressure, based on the patient? s underlying condition, is achieved. A true IO bolus, at the appropriate dose with a syringe/3-way stop-cock assembly or pressure bag, is acceptable. Pediatric boluses are 20 mL/kg, and may be repeated one time if patient remains hypotensive, unless a specific alteration is noted in the protocols. Unless a specific volume of fluid is specified in the specific protocol, if the patient requires more than 40 mL/kg of IV fluid, contact OLMC to further guide fluid administration. Hypoglycemia is a blood glucose less than 60 mg/dL. IO in these protocols, means intraosseous access. IO may be used by the Advanced EMT or Paramedic. The IO route should be considered in any patient if an IV is not established within two attempts or 90 seconds and that patient has one of the following: a. Altered mental status (GCS less than or equal to 8) b. Respiratory failure (SpO 2 less than or equal to 90% after appropriate oxygen therapy, respiratory rate less than 10 or greater than 40 breaths per minute) with alteration of mental status c. Profound hypovolemia or hemodynamic instability with alteration of mental status or other evidence of shock ? recall, the use of an IO for volume resuscitation requires the use of a pressure bag/3-way stop-cock to achieve optimal flow rates d. Cardiac arrest (medical or traumatic) (Continued on next page) For Historical Purposes OnlyDefinitions Page 8 Purple 3(continued) Additionally, the provider may choose to utilize the IO route first in critical patients for whom IV access may be difficult. With discussion with OLMC, may consider IO placement for the following conditions: a. Profound hypovolemia (Systolic BP less than 90 mmHg) without alterations in mental status or other evidence of shock b. Burn patients with bilateral upper extremity burns *IO is CONTRAINDICATED in the following conditions a. Fracture of the tibia or femur in lower extremity placement or fracture of the humerus in upper extremity placement b. Infection at insertion site c. IO within the prior 24 hours in the same bone d. Knee replacement (identified by midline vertical scar over the patella) e. Tumor near site f. Inability to locate landmarks g. Excessive tissue at insertion site h. IO access is not intended for prophylactic use Approved Sites (one per bone): Per manufacturer recommendations Paramedic: If infusion of medications or fluids causes significant pain, consider the following: 1. Adult: Consider lidocaine 2% (preservative free) 40 mg slow push followed by 10 mL Normal Saline flush. If pain continues, contact OLMC for OPTION of additional 20 mg bolus 2. Pediatric: Consider lidocaine 2% (preservative free) 0.5 mg/kg (MAX 40 mg) slow push followed by 10 mL Normal Saline flush. If pain continues, contact OLMC for OPTION of additional 0.25 mg/kg (MAX 20 mg) slow push IV means any balanced electrolyte solutions may be used, such as Lactated Ringers, Normal Saline and 5% Dextrose in Water. IV solutions, as defined in this document, DO NOT include other additives (such as potassium) or medications. Normal Saline is the fluid of choice for patients with history of renal failure, not Lactated Ringers. Recommended catheter size for rapid fluid resuscitation in adults is 14-18 gauge. If rapid fluid resuscitation is not required, smaller catheter sizes and heparin/saline locks may be used. Heparin used for this procedure is not considered a medication. MDPB means Maine EMS Medical Direction and Practices Board, which consists of the six Regional Medical Directors, a physician representing the Maine Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians, an At-Large physician representative, a Clinical Pharmacist or Toxicologist, the State Assistant EMS Medical Director and the State EMS Medical Director. NR means a non-rebreather oxygen mask. O2 means oxygen therapy as appropriate for patient. For Historical Purposes OnlyDefinitions Page 9 Purple 4On-Line Medical Control (OLMC) refers to the on-line physician/physician assistant/nurse practitioner who is licensed by the State of Maine and authorized by a hospital to direct emergency medical services persons consistent with the protocols developed by the MDPB. Other Appropriate Destination means a facility that has been approved by the Board of EMS to receive, via ambulance, patients who are in need of emergency care. Paramedic Back-up means use of an advanced life support resource when a presenting patient needs more than basic life support. As noted above, in the prehospital setting this indicates a Paramedic response. An ALS back-up agreement should be written between EMS provider services routinely offering and accepting ALS back-up support. This would establish medical/operational/ liability expectations of both services. These protocols cannot mandate any service to routinely offer or receive back-up. However, any decision in this regard, particularly to refuse to offer or accept ALS back-up, should be grounded in reasonable medical, operational, or financial considerations and should be reviewed by the individual service? s legal counsel. Pediatric Patient in these protocols, means pre-pubertal (without pubic, axillary, or facial hair). PPV means Positive Pressure Ventilation such as (in order of preference): two- person bag-valve-mask technique with oxygen, one-person bag-valve-mask technique with oxygen, mouth-to-mask ventilation with oxygen, and mouth-to-mask ventilation without oxygen. For Historical Purposes OnlyForeword Page 10 Brown 1These protocols were developed for the following reasons: 1. To provide the EMS provider with a quick field reference, and 2. To develop written standards of care which are consistent throughout the State of Maine Users of these protocols are assumed to have knowledge of more detailed and basic patient management principles found in EMS textbooks and literature appropriate to the EMS provider? s level of training and licensure. EMS providers are encouraged to contact OLMC in any situation in which advice is needed, not only in situations as directed by theses written protocols. To use these protocols as they were intended, it is necessary to know the philosophy, treatment principles, and definitions which guided the physicians and other EMS providers who drafted these protocols: - Delays in treatment should very RARELY delay transport! This is especially true for trauma patients, patients with chest pain and patients with suspected stroke. IVs should be started en route except in those situations where treatment at the scene is in the patient? s best interest, such as shock, prolonged extrication, or a cardiac patient when full ACLS care is available. Delays in transport should be discussed with OLMC. - Inability to establish voice contact with OLMC: There are rare situations where the patient is unstable and delay in treatment threatens the patient? s life or limb. If, after good faith attempts, the EMS provider cannot contact OLMC, then the EMS provider is authorized to use any appropriate treatment protocols as if they were standing orders. In such cases, treatments must still be consistent with the EMS provider? s training and licensure. Continue attempts to contact OLMC and document these attempts on the patient run record. - Transports and transfers: During transports and transfers, ambulance crews will follow these MEMS protocols, including use of only those medications and procedures for which they are trained and authorized by protocol. - Hospital destination choice : If a patient needs care which the ambulance crew, in consultation with OLMC, believes cannot be provided at the most accessible hospital, the patient will be transported to the nearest facility capable of providing that care upon the patient? s arrival. If, with OLMC consultation, a patient is believed to be too unstable to survive such a diversion, then the patient will be transported to the most accessible hospital with an emergency department. Diversion is also non-binding, and if a patient insists or if the crew deems that bypass is not in the patient? s best interest, then going to a hospital ?on diversion? is appropriate. If OLMC contact is not possible, the ambulance crew is authorized to make this determination. OLMC cannot legally refuse these patients. For Historical Purposes OnlyForeword Page 11 Brown 2- Regional destination : Each region has the authority to develop protocols which designate the appropriate destination for patients transported from the scene. Any such protocol should be patient-centric and created exclusively to offer patients emergent care only available at selected regional sites. Examples of such protocols include the Maine EMS Trauma System. - Treatments/medications should be given in the order specified . However, the MDPB recognizes that often treatments are delivered simultaneously and more than one protocol may be used. OLMC may request treatments/medications out of sequence for medical reasons. - MEMS patient/run record will be legible and thoroughly completed for each call or for each patient when more than one patient is involved in a call. This document is our legacy of patient care and holds valuable information for hospital providers. This information is essential to patient care and safety. Services must provide a patient care document before leaving the hospital. In MOST circumstances, this document will be a completed copy of the patient run report, although, in rare circumstances, when it is not possible to complete the electronic patient care record before leaving the hospital, services may provide the hospital with a Maine EMS-approved, one page, patient care summary. THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT REPLACE THE COMPLETED RUN REPORT. These documents may become part of the patient? s hospital record and, in an effort to ensure excellent patient care, all information on this written summary must reflect the information in the electronic run report. Services must still complete the electronic patient care report and make the report available to the hospital as soon as possible. - Quality Assurance: All EMS providers and services must be in compliance with the Regional and State Quality Improvement Program to the satisfaction of the Regional Medical Director. - Assuming and Reassessing care already provided: EMS providers who will be assuming the responsibility for patient care will also be responsible for assessing the care provided before their arrival, and for all subsequent care after they arrive up to and including their level of training and licensure. If an EMS provider has not been trained in a particular treatment listed at his level, or if that treatment is not within the EMS provider? s scope of practice, the provider may not perform the treatment. - If there is a Paramedic on scene that is willing to: a. Accompany the AEMT on the call, and b. Accept responsibility for the AEMT? s actions Then the Paramedic may direct the AEMT to administer medications that are within the AEMT? s scope of practice. This may be accomplished without contacting OLMC as long as the medication administration would not require OLMC for the Paramedic. If the Paramedic is unwilling to accept the above responsibilities, then the AEMT must contact OLMC before administering any medications. For Historical Purposes OnlyForeword Page 12 Brown 3- Defibrillations : Advanced EMTs are expected to follow these protocols within the limitations of the monitor/defibrillator available to them. - Carbon monoxide monitors : Carbon monoxide monitors may be used for informational purposes only. Any alterations of treatment based on pulse carboximetry readings must be approved by OLMC. - Medical Control permission: If a treatment is listed as requiring Medical Control permission at one level and is listed again without requiring OLMC permission at a higher level, the higher-level EMT need not seek OLMC permission. - Deviation from protocols: These protocols represent a consensus of the MDPB. In unusual situations, OLMC may deviate from these protocols if done in the patient? s best interest. The deviation in care ordered must be within the scope of practice, training and skill of the EMS provider. The reasons for deviating from these protocols must be documented in the patient? s chart. Under such circumstances, if the ALS provider agrees, the ALS provider will verify and will comply with OLMC orders, will fully document the deviation on the patient run record, and will not consider the care rendered to be an emergency medical treatment to be routinely repeated. - Arrival of officially dispatched EMS personnel: Once EMS personnel have arrived on the scene, they may interact with other medical personnel on the scene who are not a part of the organized EMS system responses in the following manner: - Maine EMS licensees not affiliated with one of the responding services may only provide care within their scope of practice with the approval of the ambulance crew-member in charge of the call. - The patient?s own physician , physician assistant, or nurse practitioner may direct care as long as they remain with the patient (in their absence, direction of care is subject only to these protocols and OLMC). You may assist this person within the scope of your practice and these protocols. Only a physician, physician assistant authorized to offer OLMC by their hospital, or independent nurse practitioner may give orders outside of the MEMS protocols. Questions in this regard should be resolved by OLMC. You may show this person Black 1, the ?Non-EMS System Medical Interveners? protocol to assist with your explanation. - Other unsolicited medical interveners must be Maine licensed physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners or physician assistants whose assistance you request. The Black 1 ?Non-EMS System Medical Interveners? protocol describes this, and should be shown to such interveners. - Other healthcare providers in the home: Other healthcare providers in the home attending the patient (i.e. R.N., L.P.N., C.N.A., Nurse Midwife, etc.) are a valuable source of information and assistance. Any aid or treatment they wish to give must be authorized by OLMC. Any dispute over treatment or transport should be settled by OLMC. For Historical Purposes OnlyForeword Page 13 Brown 4- Home healthcare devices and appliances : Many patients will have devices and appliances (drains, ports, LVAD, insulin pumps, etc.) with which they are routinely discharged home. Patients (or their licensed care providers or previously instructed family members), are expected to maintain them on their own. These devices have some risks associated with them, but are generally considered safe in the home environment. As such, EMS providers are not restricted in the care or transfer of these patients based solely on the presence of these devices or appliances. If an issue arises and unfamiliarity with, or any questions concerning these devices that cannot be immediately resolved by the patient or caregivers, it should be referred to OLMC . - Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) : A surgically implanted pump to assist left ventricular function. An LVAD can be a bridge to a heart transplant (although used for chronic care as well). Inform OLMC as soon as possible when interacting with a patient with an LVAD, as diversion to a hospital with a higher level of care may be suggested. Direct contact with the cardiac service responsible for this patient is also suggested at the earliest possible moment. The patient or patient? s family should have this contact information readily available. No cardiac arrhythmia should be treated if the LVAD is functioning, as judged by an audible sound or pulse, without medical control approval for any treatment. Be sure to bring the patient? s batteries (including the 24-hour battery), the large battery charger and all other accessories. Local EMS services may receive specialized training and protocol exemptions to extend help to these patients by working with regional EMS Medical Directors and MEMS. - Graduates with a current certification from a Maine EMS-approved wilderness EMT course may apply the principles of care taught in that course with the approval of the service Medical Director and when patient arrival at a definitive care setting will be more than 2 hours. - Repeated Treatment: Unless otherwise indicated, any treatment included in these protocols may be repeated after reassessment and with OLMC permission. - External Pacing (where indicated in these protocols) should be performed if a pacer is available. - Oxygen supplementation will be by nasal cannula or non-rebreather mask as appropriate. - Patient Sign-Offs : There exist three origins for patient sign-offs: a. A patient refuses transport and the provider agrees transport is not warranted b. The patient refuses transport but the provider does not feel this is safe c. The patient requests transport but the provider refuses (this final example is called an EMS System-initiated sign-off) For Historical Purposes OnlyForeword Page 14 Brown 5Patient-initiated sign-offs should only be considered in patients with decision-making capacity and resources available to care for themselves and when non-transport is considered safe. These sign-offs do not require discussion with On-Line Medical Control. In situations which the patient requests sign-off but the EMS provider deems inappropriate, please refer to OLMC. EMS System-initiated patient sign-offs (i.e.: when the patient requests transfer but the EMS provider refuses) are tremendously risky interactions and are not permissible. These sign-offs must be approved by OLMC and the service is expected to review all of these events through the service?s quality assurance mechanism. Patient medical records must be completed for all of these interactions. - Maine EMS Special Circumstance Protocols : Maine EMS protocols are intended to address the vast majority of medical emergencies encountered by an EMS provider. While intended to be comprehensive, certain patients exist with rare medical conditions that require highly specialized emergent care. In such situations, Maine EMS has created the ?Special Circumstance Protocols?. These are prearranged medical protocols specialized to individual patients, suggested by the patient? s medical provider and ratified by the EMS service Medical Director. Patients will present with a ?Maine EMS Special Circumstance Protocol Form? that outlines the patient? s individual protocol and is signed by the patient? s physician, the EMS service Medical Director and the State of Maine EMS Medical Director. These special circumstance protocols should be made known to local EMS services and providers. In cases of question or uncertainty regarding the nature of the protocol, please refer to OLMC. - During transport , patients should be secured to the stretcher utilizing both lateral and shoulder straps. - Paramedics and AEMTs are expected to perform all duties in their listed scope of practice as well as those of the prior scopes of practice in the appropriate logical order. - Vagus Nerve Stimulators (VNS) are implanted devices that are used to treat refractory partial seizures by stimulating the vagus nerve. They are not currently approved to treat generalized seizures. The exact mechanism is unclear but the devices provide continuous on-off cycles of vagal stimulation to prevent seizure. Patients with a VNS typically have a magnet that they can use to trigger an additional 30 second stimulation period when they feel a seizure coming on or when they are having a seizure. Caregivers are typically trained to assist with the magnet. In the event no one is available who is trained to use the magnet, the EMS provider at any level may assist the patient if the patient can confirm that the device is a VNS and after the EMS provider consults with medical control. - In the critically ill patient , vascular access may be difficult to obtain. The decision on which technique to use first, IV versus IO, is based on the assessment and judgment of the provider. Ultimately, an IV is the superior form of vascular access but the IO is appropriate for the initial resuscitation of the critically ill patient if, in the provider? s judgment, attempts to obtain IV access would lead to an unreasonable delay in initiating fluid resuscitation. For Historical Purposes OnlyForeword Page 15 Brown 6- Option to Cancel ALS policy : If the patient meets the protocol specific cancellation criteria, the EMT and AEMT, in consultation with OLMC, may determine that it is appropriate to cancel the ALS response based on transport time, patient co-morbidities, and any other applicable factors. - All equipment referenced in these protocols must be ?Maine EMS-Approved.? In addition, it is expected that all providers will be appropriately trained before using any piece of equipment, device, or technique. TASER PROBES The use of a TASER does not automatically necessitate an EMS response or involvement. In assessing such patients, be cognizant of the potential for underlying metabolic dysfunction. TASER probes may be removed from the subject by the deploying officer. Probes that are embedded in a sensitive area (i.e. face, neck, breast, and genital area) may need to be removed by medical personnel. In these cases, the subject should be transported to the hospital for examination and removal of the probes by medical personnel at the hospital. Other adverse affects, if any, (i.e. respiratory difficulty, seizures, etc.) should be treated as appropriate by the applicable protocol(s). For Historical Purposes OnlyPage 16 Blue 1Maine EMS recognizes 2 major classes of Blind Insertion Airway Devices (BIADs). The first class, periglottic devices, includes the LMA\u00ae and Cobra PLA\u00ae. The second class, transglottic or potentially transglottic devices, includes the Combitube\u00ae and King LT\u00ae. Any FDA-approved devices from these classes are approved for use. A c-spine collar should be considered to help protect placement of all endotracheal intubations, periglottic and transglottic airway devices. There are periglottic devices on the market that can be used to facilitate endotracheal intubation (i.e. ILMA\u00ae, LMA\u00ae). If these devices are placed without an attempt at endotracheal intubation, they may be treated as any other periglottic device. If they are used to assist in placing an endotracheal tube, that tube must be treated and confirmed as any other endotracheal intubation. It is recommended to have NO MORE THAN one device per class (periglottic and transglottic). If a service elects to have multiple options per class, then training and maintenance in proficiency for all devices available are required.Maine EMS Statement on ?Rescue? or ?Alternate?

For Historical Purposes OnlyPage 22 Blue 7Post-Intubation/BIAD Pain Control All patients with an ETT or BIAD inserted who are not currently in cardiac arrest are at risk for pain, anxiety and self-extubation. Therefore, appropriate pain control and anxiolysis are required for all intubated patients. Signs of inadequate pain control/sedation include eye opening, coughing or gagging, sweating, tearing, new or worsening hypertension and/or tachycardia, tachypnea, or attempts to self-extubate. EMT 1. Minimize stimulation ADVANCED EMT 2. Place IV for anticipated medication administration PARAMEDIC 3. Pain control a. Fentanyl 0.5 - 1 mcg/kg IV/IO every 15 minutes to a maximum cumulative dose of 5 mcg/kg 4. Anxiolysis - Contact OLMC for ONE of the following options: a. Midazolam i. 0.5 - 2.5 mg IV/IO every 5 minutes, may repeat x 3 to a max cumulative dose of 5 mg ii. 1-5 mg IM every 5 minutes, may repeat x 3 to a max cumulative dose of 10 mg -OR- b.

Therefore, it is recommended to treat pain first and anxiolysis (if needed) second. Anxiolysis should be treated with either midazolam OR ketamine, not a combination of the two as this could cause profound hypotension.

EPINEPHrine 0.3 mg IM of 1mg/1mL (1:1000) solution every 20 minutes c. For patients in status asthmaticus or not responding to repeated nebulizers or the above therapy, consider Magnesium Sulfate 2 grams IV/IO over 10 minutes, consider placing this medication on a pump. Asthmatic patients : Airway management of asthmatic patients is primarily pharmacological, not mechanical. Therefore, the focus should be on taking those actions that enable the provider to provide inhaled bronchodilators and, in patients with severe bronchospasm, obtain rapid IV or IO access, administer IV dexamethasone, IV magnesium, and consider IM EPINEPHrine. Due to the pathophysiology of asthma, positive pressure ventilation (facemask, BIAD, or endotracheal intubation) rarely, if ever, is an effective treatment without pharmacological intervention. Therefore, unless the patient is apneic, provider supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather and focus on providing pharmacological interventions. CPAP is a last resort and a bridge to intubation.

Pulmonary hypertension is a disease in which a patient's pulmonary arterial pressures are elevated and can be due to multiple factors, including heart disease, chronic lung disease, or thromboembolic disease. Additionally, in some cases of pulmonary hypertension, the etiology is uncertain. Patients manifest with multiple clinical symptoms, including dyspnea, chest pain and syncope. Pulmonary hypertension is NOT a disease that will be diagnosed in the prehospital setting. Increasingly, patients are being treated for the disease with medications that cause pulmonary vascular vasodilation, such as Remodulin. EMT Transport Destination Preferably, patients suffering from pulmonary hypertension who are treated by a specialist should be transported to the hospital managing their disease for ALL emergencies whenever feasible or operationally reasonable. If operational circumstances or the patient's needs dictate otherwise, please transport to the closest reasonable facility. Please consult OLMC for any questions. ADVANCED EMT Medication Interruption Remodulin and other medications used to treat pulmonary hypertension are provided by central access, typically through a pump. Patients are often treated with both IV and oral medications. Disruptions of the patient's IV medications can lead to increased symptoms. Most medication interruptions are NOT related to the pump, but rather the patient's central line and loss of access. In the case of interruptions of IV medication due to loss of central access: 1. Establish peripheral access PARAMEDIC 2. Verify the patient's medication and dose 3. Re-initiate the patient's medication through the newly-established peripheral access 4. Consider the transport destination suggestions as listed above. E A P A P PEARLS FOR PULMONARY HYPERTENSION COMPLICATIONS Most medications used to treat pulmonary hypertension have a high pH and if left running through a peripheral line too long (greater than 4 hours) may cause peripheral vein phlebitis and sclerosis. Please document the time the medication was initiated through the peripheral line and alert treating Emergency staff. For any questions, please contact On-Line Medical Control. P For Historical Purposes OnlyPage 28 Red 1For all patients with chest pain, evaluation for acute coronary syndrome should occur. Commonly, it is difficult with the tools available to EMS providers to completely rule out a cardiac cause of chest pain. Therefore, all patients should be transported for emergency medical evaluation. Cardiac disease is but one of the many causes of chest pain and the EMS provider should consider various causes such as esophageal, chest wall, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, spontaneous pneumothorax, etc. Patients commonly fall into one of three categories: suspected cardiac, traumatic, or uncertain cause of chest pain. ***The cardiac monitor/defibrillator should be brought to the patient's side during the initial assessment. ***Chest Pain - General Chest Pain Suspected Cardiac Origin, follow Red 2 Traumatic, follow Green 10Uncertain Etiology, follow Red 6 Consider cardiac origin chest pain in the following: - Chest pain or discomfort in other areas of the body (i.e. arm, jaw, epigastrium), shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. - Atypical or unusual symptoms are more common in women, the elderly and diabetic patients.

Hypotension may occur in any MI, not just inferior MIs with right ventricular involvement. P For Historical Purposes OnlyPage 31 Red 4Guidelines to the Prehospital Use of 12-Lead ECG by the ALS Provider 1. Prehospital 12-lead ECG is now a standard of care for increasing diagnostic information regarding the chest pain/cardiac arrest patient 2. Acquisition of a 12-lead ECG should be done in all patients with chest pain or a potential cardiac complaint/diagnosis such as syncope or shortness of breath. Given the frequency of atypical presentation in the elderly, responders must have a high index of suspicion in the elderly patient 3. Transmission of 12-lead ECG or presentation of prehospital 12-lead ECG to treating providers at the receiving ED is intended to augment patient triage and facilitate rapid identification of a potential thrombolytic or PTCA candidate 4. In the case of STEMI, notify the receiving ED immediately ***Advanced EMT and the Use of 12-lead ECGs*** AEMTs are not certified to interpret the 12-lead ECG or change the ALS response based on obtaining the 12-lead ECG.

Post-resuscitation amiodarone bolus OnlyPage 36 Red 9Cardiac Arrest #2 Effective chest compressions and defibrillation are the most important therapies to the patient in cardiac arrest. Effective chest compressions are defined as: a. A rate of greater than 100 - 120 compressions/minute b. Depth of between 2-2.5 inches c. Allow for complete chest recoil d. Minimize interruptions in compressions e. Rotate rescuers every 2 minutes f. Avoid excessive ventilation. Ventilations should not exceed 8-10 breaths per minute g. Quantitative end-tidal CO 2 should be used to monitor effectiveness of chest compressions. If ETCO 2 is < 10 mmHg, attempt to improve chest compression quality h. Consider additional monitoring with biometric feedback Resuscitate on scene as the effectiveness of chest compressions decreases during any patient movement. Resuscitation on scene should be the goal, with the only exceptions being safety concerns for the responding crew OR inability to effectively resuscitate in the patient's current location. All services MUST have an organized and structured response to the care of patients in cardiac arrest. This approach must be pre-arranged and may be modeled on the Maine EMS ICS for OHCA Program or other well-accepted structured approach to patient care. Also, EMS services are encouraged to train providers to these systems of care and to regularly train providers in high-performance CPR. Use capnography during resuscitation for confirmation and monitoring of advanced airways and for prolonged use of BVM as well as monitoring effectiveness of chest compression and return or loss of spontaneous circulation. Note: The algorithms for cardiac arrest or arrhythmias reflect the MEMS Medical Direction and Practices Board's interpretation of ACLS guidelines, as they should be used in the prehospital setting. In the case of peripartum cardiac arrest, provision of high-quality CPR remains a priority. If a patient's fundus height is at or above the level of the umbilicus, manual left uterine displacement is the preferred method of relieving aortocaval compression during chest compressions. Additionally, local hospital resources for advanced care should be activated immediately upon recognition of peripartum cardiac arrest. Contact OLMC to discuss the potential of additional therapies. For Historical Purposes OnlyPage 37 Red 10Refractory VF/VT Prior to attempting double-sequential defibrillation (DSD), at least one shock should be given at maximal energy using a different vector. i.e. apply a new set of pads in the anterior-apex position if anterior-posterior has failed. Do not allow the pads to touch one another (see diagram below). DOUBLE-SEQUENTIAL DEFIBRILLATION: This can only be performed with MANUAL defibrillators. ****Check with the manufacturers of your manual defibrillators re: the warranty if used in double-sequential defibrillation**** INDICATION : refractory VF/VT after 5 unsuccessful shocks (with vector change), administration of EPINEPHrine and amiodarone. PROCEDURE : 1. Assure that controls for the second manual defibrillator are accessible to the team leader 2. Verify that both cardiac manual defibrillators are attached to the patient, that all pads are well-adhered, and simultaneously charge both manual defibrillators 3. When both defibrillators are charged to maximum energy settings and all persons are clear, push both shock buttons as synchronously as possible 4. May repeat procedure every 2 minutes as indicated if refractory VF/VT persists- Recurrent VF/VT is defined as SUCCESSFULLY CONVERTED by standard defibrillation techniques but subsequently returns. It should NOT be treated by DSD.

Focus attention on the family or bystanders. Explain the rationale for termination 2. Consider accessing support for family: other family, friends, or social support such as clergy 3. If termination of resuscitation occurs, one must consider management of patient's remains. No one option is correct for all circumstances and factors on scene will likely dictate the best option. Refer to Grey 4. If questions remain regarding disposition of the patient's remains, contact OLMC*Survival and functional neurologic outcomes are unlikely if ROSC is not obtained by EMS.

Contact OLMC for magnesium sulfate 1-2 grams IV over 5 minutes Treatment of pre-excitation rhythms (such as WPW) include blocking at the level of the AV node, using adenosine or beta-blockers. Patients with pre-excitation AND A-fib should NOT receive any agents that block the AV node, as this could cause VF. WPW with A-fib may be recognized by a very fast rhythm, a predominance of wide QRS complexes with occasional narrow complexes and an irregular rhythm. When WPW with A-fib is suspected, the patient should NOT receive any medications that block the AV node because this will force all impulses through the accessory pathway and can cause VF. Instead, these patients should be cardioverted when they become unstable. Do NOT give adenosine to a patient with Polymorphic VT or Torsades.

The blood pressure, if measurable, may not be an accurate measure of perfusion. Although automatic non-invasive blood pressure cuffs are often ineffective in measuring systolic and diastolic pressure, if they do obtain a measurement, the MAP is usually accurate. Doppler? s may be more accurate at determining both pulse and blood pressure and, if available, should be used. - Patient may be awake with a functioning pump in VF, VT, PEA or asystole. If the patient is responsive AND the encountered rhythm is thought to be new, ACLS therapies, including defibrillation may be attempted, however chest compressions are not necessary if the patient is awake and alert. Evaluate clinical condition and provide care in consultation with VAD coordinator. - The patient? s emergency travel bag should accompany him/her at all times. If feasible, bring the patient? s Power Module, cable and Display Module with patient to the hospital. - The most common cause for VAD alarms are low batteries or battery failures - Primary pump failure is a very rare occurrence. The most common VAD complications, in descending occurrence, are: - Infection - Bleeding - Arrhythmias - CHF - Aortic Insufficiency - Stroke/TIA - Cardiac Tamponade - Follow the protocol most appropriate, based on the patient's clinical condition. - For questions, contact OLMC and the patient's VAD Coordinator. - All patients with a VAD are anticoagulated, typically with warfarin (Coumadin).

PEARLS for Allergy/Anaphylaxis Children with a known recent exposure to common triggers of allergic reactions (peanuts, medications, bee stings) should be considered at risk for having an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. Children with asthma should be considered high risk for a severe reaction. Severity should be differentiated between anaphylaxis and non-anaphylaxis (ie: Allergic reaction only). Only patients with anaphylaxis (as defined in Gold 3) should receive EPINEPHrine. Anaphylaxis in children should be treated for those exhibiting hypotension after exposure to a known allergen, respiratory compromise with acute onset of skin or mucosal involvement, or two or more of the following after exposure to a likely allergen: gastrointestinal symptoms, skin/mucosal involvement, respiratory compromise, or hypotension. Evidence does not support the routine use of cardiac monitoring for patients who receive one dose of EPINEPHrine.

Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any ONE of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled: Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) AND at least ONE of the following: a. Respiratory compromise (eg, Expiratory Flow end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) OR TWO or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch- flush, swollen lips, (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced incontinence) d. abdominal pain, vomiting) several hours): OR Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours) a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic BP* b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mmHg or greater than 30% decrease from that person? s baseline 2. In every case when anaphylaxis is identified, EPINEPHrine should be provided. The best route of administration is via the IM route in the anterolateral thigh 3. Patients may require repeated doses EPINEPHrine. Typically, these repeated doses are also provided via the IM route 4. When errors occur EPINEPHrine delivery, it is commonly due to providers failing to check that they are using the proper concentration of EPINEPHrine. Be careful to recheck when using EPINEPHrine and ensure that the desired concentration is being utilized For Historical Purposes OnlyPage 51 Gold 4Allergy/Anaphylaxis #4 IV EPINEPHrine infusion drip, utilizing a pump, should be started for patients unresponsive to IM EPINEPHrine administration in either of the following settings: - Cardiovascular collapse (hypotension with altered mental status, pallor, diaphoresis, or delayed capillary refill) OR - Hypotension that is unresponsive to 60 mL/kg isotonic fluid boluses and repeat doses of IM EPINEPHrine Evidence does not support the prophylactic use of EPINEPHrine in the asymptomatic patient, after exposure to a known allergen. Children experiencing cutaneous signs of an allergic reaction with no systemic symptoms should be evaluated by a medical provider.

Abnormal sensory or motor exam?Unreliable?** (Intox/Alt LOC/ Acute stress reaction) Distracting injury?***Manage spine Green 7Do not immobilize No NoNoNo Yes Yes YesYes * High risk mechanisms of injury in the pediatric population include, but are not limited to, the following: motor vehicle collisions, recreational vehicles (all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles), axial loading, substantial torso injuries, and falls greater than 10 feet. ** Clearance of the spine requires the patient to be calm, cooperative, sober, and alert. Note that the smell of alcohol on the breath is not necessarily the same thing as intoxication; a single beer can be detected on the breath, but does not necessarily cause significant intoxication. The real question is not about the presence or absence of any alcohol, etc.; it is whether or not the patient and the exam are reliable. *** Distracting injury includes any injury that produces clinically apparent pain that might distract the patient from the pain of a spine injury. The real question is not about the presence or absence of any other injuries, it is whether or not the patient and the exam are reliable. Remember that patients can fracture the spine at any level, not just the C-spine. If a fracture at another level of the spine is suspected, the entire spine must be immobilized, including the cervical spine. Patients with thoracic or lumbar fractures will commonly have associated cervical spine injuries. For Historical Purposes OnlyPage 69 Green 7Spine Management #1 Patient requires spinal management Does the patient have a helmet on? Is the patient in a seated position and able to self-extricate? Immobilize cervical spine with collar or alternate method -THEN- Extricate with long board OR other extrication device -OR- If child is in car seat, extricate in the car seat if child already strapped in with harnessPlace cervical collar and allow patient to self-extricateManually remove if clinically indicated (for airway management hemorrhage control, etc.) NoYes Yes Yes No Once patient is on the EMS litter, remove the long board UNLESS safe transport requires the use of a long board (see PEARLS). Transfer patient to appropriate hospital based on trauma triage decisions. If patient is in a car seat, appropriately secure car seat to the stretcher or captains? s seat.* Patients are able to self-extricate from a motor vehicle or seated position to an EMS litter when all of the following conditions are met: 1.Able to reliably follow commands including instructions to maintain neutral spine position 2.Without injury that would preclude patient from ambulating 3.The patient ambulates as little as possible. Ultimately the EMS litter should be in close proximity to the patient Patients in the lying position should be moved to the EMS litter by scoop/long board or other similar device. Only patients in a seated position (i.e. a vehicle) are candidates for self-extrication. Proper methods of self-extrication limit patient movement as much as possible. For instance, patient movement should be limited to standing and pivoting to the litter. Please use caution when considering self-extrication and recognize that some vehicles are difficult to self-extricate from. Use judgment when considering self-extrication, recalling the goal of minimizing spine movement. If, in your judgment, self-extrication would lead to more spine motion than an alternate method of extrication, proceed with the alternate method. For Historical Purposes OnlyPage 70 Green 8PEARLS for Spine Management Role of Backboards - While the MDPB is attempting to limit the use of backboards, prehospital and hospital providers should recognize there remain circumstances in which use of a backboard is appropriate. Backboards should be utilized to extricate patients from vehicles or other situations when they are unable to extricate themselves (critical patients, patients with lower extremity injuries, severe head injuries, etc.). In most instances, once on the EMS litter, the backboard is redundant and can be removed. However, in some settings, it may be appropriate for the backboard to remain. Those settings include, but are not limited to the following: 1.Cases in which the backboard is being utilized as an element of the splinting strategy (such as multiple long bone fractures) 2.Cases in which the patient is at risk for vomiting but unable to protect their own airway (such as intoxication, head injury, etc.) and may need to be turned to the side for airway protection during transport. 3.Cases in which the patient is unresponsive or agitated (i.e. head injury) 4.Cases in which removal of the backboard would otherwise delay transport to definitive care in a critical patient Preferred Position - The preferred position for all patients with spine management is flat and supine. There are two circumstances under which raising the head of the bed should be considered: a. Patients in respiratory distress. Populations at risk for developing respiratory distress when laying flat include the elderly with underlying lung disease, patients with morbid obesity and late term pregnant patients b. Patient with suspected severe head trauma Under these circumstances, consider raising the head of the bed to no more than 30 degrees Inter-Facility Transport - Long backboards do not have a role in the transport of patients between hospitals EVEN IF SPINE INJURY IS DIAGNOSED. Use of long boards during inter-facility transport is associated with increased pain and potential for pressure sores and ulcers. Patients should instead be managed with cervical collar (if appropriate) and firmly secured to the EMS stretcher. If a sending facility has placed the patient on a long board or requests use of a long board, EMS providers should discuss the option of foregoing backboard use with the sending physician. If a back board is used, it must be padded adequately to maximize patient comfort. Penetrating Injury - The incidence of incomplete, unstable spine injury in penetrating trauma is low. Spine immobilization on a backboard is associated with an increased risk of death in patients with penetrating injuries to the neck, especially gun shot wounds, due to unrecognized hemorrhage and airway compromise. Spine immobilization does not appear to prevent progression of neurologic injury in cases of penetrating cervical trauma and may negatively affect patients with vascular and airway injuries. Penetrating trauma such as a gunshot wound or stab wound should not be immobilized on a long board and should instead be secured firmly to the EMS litter. Emphasis should be on airway and breathing management, treatment of shock, and rapid transport to a Level 1 or 2 Trauma Center. Special Patient Populations - Caution should be exercised in older patients (i.e. 65 years and older) and in very young patients (i.e. less than 3 years of age), as spinal assessment may be less sensitive in discerning spinal fractures in these populations. However, age alone should not be a factor in decision-making for prehospital spinal care, yet the patient? s ability to reliably provide a history should be considered. - In children using a booster seat or lap/shoulder belt during a motor vehicle collision, consider allowing the patient to self-extricate him/herself after applying a cervical collar, if needed. For the infant or toddler who is already strapped in a car seat with a built-in harness, extricate the child while strapped in his/her car seat. - Children who do not require spinal immobilization or lying flat may be safely transported when restrained in an age-appropriate car seat secured to the stretcher. Children who do require spinal immobilization or lying flat should be directly secured to the stretcher. Helmet Use - Padding should be applied, if necessary, to maintain neutral cervical spine positioning depending on the type of sports and presence or absence of shoulder pads. Management - In patients who have suffered a potential spinal injury and need to be moved onto or off of a backboard, consider using the lift and slide technique rather than the log roll technique, when feasible.Spine Management #2 For Historical Purposes OnlyPage 71 Green 9Glasgow Coma Scale Adult Pediatric Score Eye Opening Response Same as Adult Open spontaneously 4 Open to voice command 3 Open to painful stimuli 2 Eyes remain closed 1 Best Motor Response Same as Adult Moves on command 6 Pushes painful stimuli away 5 Withdraws from painful stimuli 4 Decorticate (flexion) 3 Decerebrate (extension) 2 No motor response to pain 1 Best Verbal Response OrientedAppropriate words or social smile, fixes and follows5 Confused Cries but consolable 4 Inappropriate words Persistently irritable 3 Incomprehensible sounds Restless, agitated 2 No sounds None 1 Total 3-15 For Historical Purposes OnlyPage 72 Green 10Chest Trauma EMT 1.O2 as appropriate 2.Assist ventilations (PPV) if needed 3.Request ALS if available 4.Impaled Objects a.

Tourniquets should be applied proximally on the affected limb for the following reasons: i. Injuries are commonly more proximal than anticipated, and ii. Double bone structures lower in both the forearm and the leg effectively splint the arteries and prevent tourniquets from working properly b. Tourniquets should be as tight as possible i. Due to associated pain, request ALS if available c. If hemorrhage continues after application of the tourniquet, ensure the tourniquet is applied as tightly as possible. If hemorrhage continues, consider placement of a second tourniquet, proximal to the first. Experience has shown applying two tourniquets greatly reduces the incidence of hemorrhage, especially in injuries to the lower extremity 3.If life-threatening bleeding is not controlled by the above or is located in an area not amenable to placement of a tourniquet, consider applying a Maine EMS approved hemostatic agent by packing the agent in the wound and applying/maintaining pressure over the agent for a minimum of 5 minutes. Check for ongoing bleeding. If bleeding has stopped, bandage appropriately, if bleeding continues, reapply pressure for a minimum of 5 minutes. If bleeding continues after the second period of pressure, remove the initial hemostatic agent and repeat with a new hemostatic agent. Remember, for these agents to have maximal effectiveness, they must be packed inside the wound as close to the bleeding tissue as possible 4.Treat for shock if indicated and manage airway as appropriate 5. If amputation, rinse severed part briefly and gently with sterile saline to remove debris a.

Classification of Hemorrhagic Shock Compensated Mild Shock Blood Loss<15% (1000 Respiration Normal Mild TachypneaMarked Tachypnea Respiratory Collapse Mental StatusNormal or AgitatedAgitated Lethargic/ Obtunded PEARLS for the use of TXA: Tranexamic acid is a lysine analogue that competitively binds to plasminogen therefore interrupting interactions with fibrin and preventing fibrinolysis or clot break down. Patients in hemorrhagic shock from either blunt or penetrating trauma may benefit from Tranexamic acid (TXA). TXA must be provided as soon as possible, preferably within 1 hour of injury and absolutely before 3 hours from injury. Please ensure that receiving hospital staff: 1. Know the time of injury, 2. Are aware that the patient received TXA , 3. Are aware of the 1 gram dose as the patient may need to be re-dosed upon arrival, and 4. Flag the IV line that the patient received TXA through with a labeled piece of tape as some medications and blood products should not be provided through the same line. Additionally, discuss the use of TXA in patients on anticoagulants as these patients may require anticoagulation reversal and the combination of TXA and some of the reversal agents may have additive thrombotic effects. There are few adverse effects of this medication. TXA may cause hypotension if provided rapidly. The full dose should be provided over 10 minutes to prevent hypotension. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is contraindicated in - Isolated head injuries, - Patients greater than 24 weeks pregnant (or pregnant with fundus above umbilicus), - Patients with known hypercoagulable states, - The patient is more than 180 minutes (3 hours) from the time of injury.

A true medical emergency that requires radical field treatment, usually, but not always, associated with heat exhaustion. Heat stroke is characterized by multisystem organ injury and failure. CNS dysfunction characterized by alterations in mental status is a hallmark distinguishing between heat exhaustion and heat stroke. ASSESSMENT : If core temperature is obtained it is 105\u00b0 F (40.6\u00b0 C) or greater. Abnormal consciousness and/or CNS function; seizures are common. Any acute change in consciousness/CNS function in the context of a significant heat challenge should be managed as heat stroke without delay. Skin and sweating are variable, depending on volume status. Note that red, dry skin is not a dependable sign of heat stroke. TREATMENT : Immediate radical cooling is the urgent priority, followed by volume replacement. EMT 1.Cool the patient immediately by any means practical, such as: a. Initiate Radical Cooling which includes: Immerse the patient up to the neck in cold water b. Also consider non- radical cooling which includes, ice packs, wet patient, cool wet sheets, and air conditioning en route c. Consider moistening the skin and fan vigorously. This method is effective only at low ambient humidity 2.Discontinue radical cooling if: a. Shivering begins b. Core temperature falls to 102\u00b0 F (38.8\u00b0 C). ADVANCED EMT / PARAMEDIC 3.

PPearls for Agitation/Excited Delirium Agitation - is defined by excessive, purposeless cognitive and motor activity or restlessness, usually associated with a state of tension or anxiety Excited Delirium - is a sub-category of agitation, with a potential for higher mortality and morbidity. It can be defined by a patient presenting with the following constellation of symptoms (based on the 2009 ACEP White Paper) with frequency in parenthesis: - Exceptional/abnormal (100%) - (90%) - Police Noncompliance (90%) - Lack of tiring against restraint (90%) - Inappropriate clothing for environmental temperature (70%) - Violent and paranoid behavior - Rapid development of symptoms - Rapidly and fluctuating periods of calm and then delirium These symptoms may be caused by a number of intoxicants, including, but not limited to alcohol, etc). Early contact of OLMC is essential for proper preparation of the receiving facility and staff. For Historical Purposes OnlyPage 95 Yellow 14Agitation/Excited Delirium #3 Pearls for Midazolam/Ketamine Midazolam - Patients with underlying medical conditions (including COPD/CHF/CAD) as well as patients older than 60 are more likely to suffer adverse effects from midazolam. Consider lower doses in this population. - WARNING: May cause respiratory depression, arrest, or apnea. - Assess patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. - Administration: IM - Administer undiluted deep IM into large muscle. - Administration: IV - Do not administer intra-arterially. Administer by slow IV injection over at least 2 minutes using a concentration of 1 mg/mL or a dilution of the 1 or 5 mg/mL concentrations. - Concomitant use with opioids: [US Boxed Warning]: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Ketamine - Document the patient's Altered Mental Status Score (AMSS) in the run report. - Patients with an AMSS less than 4 are more likely to require airway management. - Maine EMS Services will be stocking the 100mg/mL concentration to accommodate the wide dose ranges in the protocol. This is to avoid carrying two very different concentrations and risk a serious dose error. - WARNING: Overdose may lead to panic attacks and aggressive behavior; rarely seizures, increased ICP, and cardiac arrest. Very similar in chemical makeup to PCP (phencyclidine), but it is shorter acting and less toxic. - Administration: IM - Inject deep IM into large muscle mass. - Administration: IV - According to the manufacturer, administer bolus/induction doses over 1 minute or at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/minute; more rapid administration may result in respiratory depression and enhanced pressor response. Some experts suggest administration over 2 to 3 minutes (Miller 2010). - The 100 mg/mL concentration should not be administered IV unless properly diluted with an equal volume of Sterile Water for Injection, NS, or D 5W.

Carbon monoxide is odorless. Only 40% are able to detect the almond smell of CN. Cyanide is generated by combustion of synthetic materials present in many structural fires. - Appropriate PPE includes self-provided air/oxygen source (i.e. SCBA). Scene safety is the top priority. No patient decontaminaion is required for victims evacuated from CN gas exposure. - It is rare for viable CO exposed patients to have persistent unconsciousness requiring intubation. - Sources of CN: Structural cyanide salts*, unripe cassava, apricot pits, laetrile, etc. - If injuries incompatible with life, DO NOT GIVE ANTIDOTE. *may persist on skin, however water decontamination may liberate HCN gas.

For patients with Vagus Nerve Stimulator who are having repeated/continuous seizure activity, consider activation of the Vagus Nerve Stimulator, if not already attempted, by holding the patient's hand-held magnet over the Vagus Nerve Stimulator.P For Historical Purposes OnlyPage 106 Pink 8Pediatric Respiratory Distress EMT 1.

Bronchiolitis is a self-limited viral illness of the bronchioles, marked by edema but not smooth muscle contraction. Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of wheezing in children under the age of 2. The treatment goals are to maintain oxygenation and hydration and to monitor for apnea and respiratory distress. Because the etiology is different than asthma, the treatment options are also very different. Patients suffering from bronchiolitis should not receive inhaled albuterol or intravenous steroids. Instead, provide oxygen to ensure O 2 sats greater than or equal to 90% and nasal suctioning with bulb syringe. Patients who fail these measures or decompensate may benefit from nebulized epinephrine. Monitor for apnea or respiratory distress and, if encountered, manage the patient? s airway as indicated per Blue 5, Pediatric Airway Algorithm. EMT Contact OLMC for the following OPTIONS: 1. Assist the patient in self-administering 5 puffs of their rescue inhaler. 2. If uncertainty regarding the type of inhaler, contact OLMC for permission to assist patient with self-administered bronchodilator (using spacer if available*). Inform OLMC of the name of the inhaler. OLMC will prescribe the number of puffs * If Spacer unavailable and Advanced EMT/Paramedic present, they should use nebulizer instead ADVANCED EMT 3.

Ipratropium bromide 0.5 mg /albuterol sulfate 3 mg nebulizer if greater than 1 year of age and more significant respiratory distress, and may repeat one time c. For patients known to have asthma: dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg to a max dose of 10 mg IV/IM/IO x 1 dose 5. Contact OLMC for the following options: a. Epinephrine: If < 30 kg, 0.15 mg IM of 1:1,000 (1mg/mL), If > 30 kg, 0.3 mg IM, 1:1,000 (1mg/mL) in anterolateral thigh OR inhalation of nebulized solution of 1 mL, 1:1,000 (1mg/mL) epinephrine mixed with 2 mL normal saline solution. * b. For patients in status asthmaticus or not responding to repeated nebulizers or the above therapy, consider Magnesium Sulfate 25-50 mg/kg IV/IO x 1 dose over 10 minutes, (maximum single dose is 2 grams) consider placing this medication on a pump * Nebulized epinephrine may be contraindicated in children with a history of congenital heart disease.P Asthmatic patients : Airway management of asthmatic patients is primarily pharmalogical, not mechanical. Therefore, the focus should be on taking those actions that enable the provider to provide inhaled bronchodilators and, in patients with severe bronchospasm, obtain rapid IV or IO access, administer IV magnesium, administer IV dexamethasone, and consider IM EPINEPHrine. Due to the pathophysiology of asthma, positive pressure ventilation (facemask, BIAD, or endotracheal intubation) rarely if ever is an effective treatment without pharmacological intervention. Therefore, unless the patient is apneic, provide supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather and focus on providing pharmacological interventions. For Historical Purposes OnlyPage 110 Pink 12Pediatric Respiratory Distress with Inspiratory Stridor Inspiratory stridor may be due to many causes in the pediatric population, including croup, foreign body aspiration, or epiglottitis. Stridor refers to upper airway obstruction as in laryngotracheitis/croup, and is often accompanied by hoarseness and/or a barking cough (seal-like cough). As stridor worsens in severity, the following may also be observed: tachypnea, retractions, accessory muscle use, nasal flaring, fatigue from respiratory effort, and cyanosis. EMT / ADVANCED EMT 1.

The earliest signs and symptoms of pediatric shock include delayed capillary refill, alterations in mental status, rising pulse, and increasing respiratory rate. By the time blood pressure drops, circulatory collapse is near. Consider sepsis in certain high-risk clinical settings. PEARLS for High Risk Features: High-risk features for invasive infection include malignancy, bone marrow or solid organ transplant, asplenia, presence of indwelling central line/catheter, or other situation with immune deficiency, compromise or suppression.

PEARLS for Medical Shock Many pediatric patients with shock have associated hypoglycemia. Mortality is increased if this is not addressed. Also, the presenting symptoms of shock and those of hypoglycemia can be very similar. Patients in shock require frequent reassessment. The following physiologic parameters are appropriate endpoints for therapy: normalization of heart rate, capillary refill, mental status, resolution of existing hypotension and, if available, presence of urine output. In children under the age 6, prompt IO placement after one failed IV attempt should be considered, since timely, successful IV placement in this age group is shown to be difficult for pre-hospital providers. For Historical Purposes OnlyPage 115 Pink 17Pediatric Cardiac Arrest (Non-breathing, pulseless patient) Pediatric cardiac dysfunction is usually due to a respiratory cause and is thus more likely to initially respond to effective oxygenation and ventilation, then fluid administration and then medications may be needed. Defibrillation alone is rarely successful. EMT 1. 100% O 2 and ventilate with bag valve mask 2. CPR first, and use AED per current AHA guidelines 3.

When to Start Resuscitation: As soon as the absence of pulse and respiration is established. II. When Not to Start Resuscitation: A. All Patients: Any patient displaying obvious and accepted signs of irreversible death such as rigor mortis, dependent lividity, decapitation, decomposition, incineration, other obvious lethal injuries, evidence of central freezing (such as ice in the airway), core temperature less than 50 degrees F, chest wall so stiff that compressions cannot be performed, or patients submerged in cold water (for specific recommendations in drowning, refer to Drowning Protocol, Yellow 17 ) B. All Normothermic Patients: Major trauma victims who have no respiration and no pulse, no sign of life at the time of Maine EMS licensed crew member arrival C. When a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order is presented in one of three forms: 1. EMS DNR orders from other state EMS/DNR programs. If the order or device (i.e., plastic bracelet, jewelry, or card) appear to be in effect, and understandable to the crew, follow the order? s specific instructions. If there are no specific instructions beyond ?DNR?, follow Maine EMS Comfort Care/DNR Guidelines 2. Non-EMS actionable medical order (i.e. POLST/MOLST, etc.): A written order executed by a patient? s personal physician/PA/NP should be honored if it is understandable to the crew and if it is dated within 1 (one) year. Follow the order as written. If it is nonspecific as to care to provide or withhold, follow the MEMS Comfort Care/DNR guidelines 3. Maine EMS Comfort Care / DNR Program - A Maine EMS Comfort Care/DNR order does not have an expiration date. Once activated, it remains in effect until the patient or someone acting on their behalf as described and authorized on the Comfort Care/DNR form cancels it. (Note: Although no longer distributed by Maine EMS, extant DNR/Comfort Care ?orange? forms, wallet cards and plastic bracelets remain valid) D. When a signed Maine EMS Do Not Resuscitate Directive form or Maine EMS- approved Do Not Resuscitate Directive jewelry is presented to EMS personnel. Once executed by the patient and signed by a physician, physician? s assistant or nurse practitioner, the Do Not Resuscitate Directive remains in effect until the expiration date on the form or, if no expiration date is noted on the form, until the patient cancels it E. A photocopy is acceptable as proof of the existence of valid DNR Order or DNR Directive, provided that the photocopy is legible and understandable by EMS personnel (continued next page) Grey 1 For Historical Purposes OnlyDo Not Resuscitate (DNR) Guidelines #2 Page 123III. Treatment/Comfort Care F. When treating a patient with a Maine EMS Comfort Care/DNR Order or Do Not Resuscitate Directive, the responding EMS provider should perform routine patient assessment and resuscitation or intervention until EMS personnel verify: 1. That an EMS Comfort Care/DNR Order or Do Not Resuscitate Directive exists; or, 2. That a Maine EMS-approved EMS Comfort Care/DNR wallet card, plastic bracelet or Maine EMS-approved DNR jewelry is present, intact and not defaced. The plastic bracelet may be worn on the wrist or ankle or on a necklace; or, 3. That Maine EMS-approved Do Not Resuscitate Directive jewelry is present, intact and not defaced; and, 4. The identity of the patient through family or friends present, or with photo ID such as a driver? s license. A good faith effort only is required G. Follow these EMS Comfort Care/DNR procedures in all cases: 1. These comforting interventions are encouraged: a. Open the airway manually (NO intubation, No BVM unless invited by conscious patient); b. Suction and provide oxygen; c. Make the patient comfortable (position, etc.); d. Control bleeding; e. Pain and other medications of comfort to a conscious patient only (ALS per On Line Medical Control); f. Be supportive of the patient and family; g. Contact patient? s physician/PA/NP or On Line Medical Control if questions or problems 2. Resuscitative measures to be avoided: (to be withheld, or withdrawn if resuscitation has begun prior to confirmation of EMS Comfort Care/DNR Order or Do Not Resuscitate Directive status). a. CPR; b. Intubation (ET Tube, or other advanced airway management); c. Surgical procedures; c. Defibrillation; d. Cardiac resuscitation medications; e. Artificial ventilation by any means; f. Related procedures per On Line Medical Control. (continued next page) Grey 2 For Historical Purposes OnlyDo Not Resuscitate (DNR) Guidelines #3 Page 124IV. Revocation, Documentation & When to Stop Resuscitation H. Who may revoke an EMS Comfort Care/DNR Order or Maine Do Not Resuscitate Directive: 1. The patient (by destroying EMS Comfort Care/DNR Order Form, wallet card, plastic bracelet and DNR jewelry, or by destroying the Do Not Resuscitate Directive and DNR jewelry, or verbally withdrawing the order or directive); 2. For the EMS Comfort Care/DNR Order form only: a. The patient? s physician/PA/NP who signed the order; b. The Authorized Decision-Maker for the patient who signed the order. I. Documentation: 1. Use the Maine EMS patient/run report. 2. Describe assessment of patient? s status. 3. Document which identification (i.e., form, wallet card, plastic bracelet or DNR jewelry) was used to confirm EMS Comfort Care/DNR or Do Not Resuscitate Directive status and indicate that it was intact and not canceled. 4. Indicate the patient? s physician/PA/NP name, on the patient/run report. 5. If the patient has expired on arrival, comfort the family and follow your EMS agency? s procedure for death at home. A Maine EMS patient/run report still needs to be completed. 6. If transporting the patient, EMS providers should keep the original EMS Comfort Care/DNR Order Form, wallet card, plastic bracelet, Do Not Resuscitate Directive Form or DNR jewelry with the patient. J. When to Stop Resuscitation: Resuscitation should be terminated: 1. Unwitnessed Arrest: a. When the patient regains pulse/respiration b. When the patient remains in a non-shockable rhythm (PEA/Asystole) for > 20 minutes OR unresponsive to advanced cardiac life support with a non-shockable rhythm after 20 minutes of resuscitation. c. When irreversible signs of death, such as dependent lividity, pupils fixed and dilated, palpable hypothermia (not from exposure) and no audible heart sounds are noted in a patient with unknown downtime or downtime > 20 minutes. d. When the rescuers are physically exhausted or when equally or more highly trained health care personnel take over e. When it is found that the patient has a DNR order or other actionable medical order (i.e. POLST/MOLST etc.) form. f. Continue resuscitation if conditions on scene are NOT amenable to cessation of resuscitation g. Continuation of resuscitation beyond these protocols must be in consultation with OLMC (continued next page) Grey 3 For Historical Purposes OnlyDo Not Resuscitate (DNR) Guidelines #4 Page 1252.

Management of Bodies If resuscitation efforts are discontinued, follow your service? s policy for disposition of patient remains. In cases of uncertainty, arrangements should be made with On Line Medical Control with regards to disposition of the body. Contact your local ED with regard to tissue donation options and procedures in advance. Grey 4 For Historical Purposes OnlyDeath Situations for Emergency Responders #1 Page 126PREPARED JOINTLY BY: Attorney General, Office of Chief Medical Examiner, and Maine State Police. GENERAL AIM: Preservation of scene, including body as found, for investigative purposes within practical limits consistent with the role and responsibilities of emergency medical care givers. Death Situation Guidelines I. Preserve life: While forensic guidelines emphasize that the scene should not be disturbed, the first and most important course of action is to follow all usual procedures to ensure the preservation of life. II. Once Death is confirmed: If the decedent is clearly dead, the body should not be moved or disturbed unless there is a danger that the body may be lost or further damaged. A. Maine statutes do not require a pronouncement of death. B. The scene should be secured and left undisturbed. 1. If the police are present, they should take charge in order to determine whether the case falls under the jurisdiction of the Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or may be certified by the private attending physician. 2. If there is no police officer present, EMS should call the local police or call the OCME directly to report the case, so that a determination may be made as to the need for further investigation into the cause and manner of death. OCME emergency line to report deaths: 1-800-870-8744. 3. If it is determined not to be a Medical Examiner case, try to accommodate the family? s request or contact OLMC for guidance. 4. Consider contacting the New England Organ Bank 1-800-446-6362 C. Tubes and medical devices should be left in place. Certain reusable equipment may be removed to resupply the ambulance; however written documentation of any such action must be given to investigators. D. Any clothing or property should be left undisturbed. III. What is a Medical Examiner (ME) case?: A. Any suspected HOMICIDE B. Any suspected SUICIDE C. Any death involving any ACCIDENT or INJURY D. Any death of a CHILD E. Any death in CUSTODY F. Deaths caused by SUSPECTED GROSS NEGLIGENCE during a Medical Procedure G. SUDDEN DEATH from an UNKNOWN cause or any death where there is no private attending physician H. UNIDENTIFIED persons I. OCCUPATIONAL Deaths (Work related) J. Unnatural Deaths in a Mental, Residential Care of DHS Facility K. Any death that might ENDANGER or THREATEN the Public Health Grey 5 For Historical Purposes OnlyDeath Situations for Emergency Responders #2 Page 127IV. Deaths in Children: A. All deaths in children under the age of three automatically become medical examiner cases unless the death is expected based on previously diagnosed natural disease. B. Determination of the cause of death in infants and children is very difficult. While the OCME understands the concerns of the parents, the child must be left undisturbed until investigating police officers have finished the initial investigation. SIDS is not an acceptable reason to transport a deceased infant or allow the infant to be moved prior to investigation. V. Reports and follow- up on Medical Examiner cases: A. If families have questions, they may be referred to the OCME. Families should call the office using the 24 hour business line at 207-624-7180 B. Copies of EMS run sheets should be given to police investigators and/or the OCME. C. If any EMT wishes follow-up information on any specific case, or if there is a question of infectious exposures, call the OCME on the business line, 207-624-7180. Grey 6 For Historical Purposes OnlyMass Casualty/Disasters/HazMat #1 Page 128GENERAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR DECEASED PERSONS: The Office of Chief Medical Examiner is responsible for deceased victims of mass disasters including identification and removal from the scene. The Office of Chief Medical Examiner (1-800-870-8744, restricted emergency call number) should be informed immediately of any multiple fatality situations. 1. BODIES SHOULD BE LEFT IN PLACE AT SCENE except when they must be moved to preserve them from destruction or when they block access. The resting place of the victim may be critical for identification of the body and/or reconstruction of the incident. They can be tagged as fatalities to prevent other medical personnel from repeating examination. 2. IF DEATH OCCURS EN ROUTE TO THE HOSPITAL, the body need not be returned to the scene but can be brought to the hospital or other suitable storage place as determined by distances and needs of other patients in the ambulance. If the body is left anywhere other than the hospital or designated temporary morgue, the body should be tagged and the Office of Chief Medical Examiner should be advised. 3. THE SITE A VICTIM IS REMOVED FROM SHOULD BE NOTED on a tag along with the name and agency of the person who removed it whenever removal is needed and in cases of death after removal. Such information may be critical for identification of the body and/or reconstruction of the accident. 4. IF AN IDENTIFICATION OF A PATIENT IS MADE, a tag with at least the name and date of birth of the patient/deceased along with the identifier? s name, relationship, address and where he/she can be located should be put on the body. 5. PERSONAL PROPERTY SHOULD BE LEFT WITH THE BODY including clothing removed from a patient if the victim dies. Nothing should be removed from those already deceased. Consistent with New England EMS Council MCI Management, the action priorities for the first medical crews arriving on the scene are: 1. Assess and avoid exposure to existing dangers 2. Notify dispatch of type of MCI and estimate of number and type of patients a. Request EMS, fire, police assistance b. Request hospital notification 3. First ambulance or other vehicle with medical frequencies becomes EMS command vehicle ? locate near fire and police command vehicles. Strip equipment/supplies ? place in equipment area (near planned patient collection/treatment area). 4. Designate, in the following order, the following positions as qualified personnel become available: EMS CONTROL OFFICER ? Reports to Incident Commander. Responsible for overall patient triage, treatment, and transportation. Procures EMS back-up, supplies, equipment, transport vehicles as needed, supervises and assigns all other medical personnel. (continued next page) Grey 7 For Historical Purposes OnlyMass Casualty/Disasters/HazMat #2 Page 129PRIMARY TRIAGE OFFICER ? Rapidly assesses all patients then assigns personnel to provide treatment to those patients in most need of immediate treatment, who will most benefit from immediate care with the resources available. Treatment is limited to: - Bleeding ? rapid pressure dressing if severe - Airway ? reposition patient - Shock ? elevate extremities SECONDARY TRIAGE OFFICER ? Rapidly tags all patients, or assigns personnel to do tagging (with METTAGS, SMART Tags, or other locally approved Triage System) and, supervises immobilization after classification, and oversees transfer to collection/treatment area. Tag categories are: RED (I): Conditions requiring immediate transport by ambulance to prevent jeopardy to life or limb and which will not unduly deplete personnel/equipment resources (examples: progressive shock, major blood loss, major multiple injuries, severe respiratory distress. Cardiac arrest ? only if personnel can be spared). YELLOW (II): Not requiring immediate transport to prevent jeopardy to life or limb, but eventually will require ambulance transport to hospital for attention. GREEN (III): Minor conditions probably not requiring ambulance transport to hospital. BLACK (O): Are obviously dead, or dying from lethal injuries, or requiring CPR when no personnel available to do so without compromising other patients. TREATMENT OFFICER ? Sets up / supervises patient collection / treatment area. Reassesses and re-tags (if necessary) patients, assigns patients and personnel to treatment areas. Prioritizes for transport. Coordinates with Loading/Transport officer to make single radio transmission to receiving facility (pt. ID#, METTAG priority, nature of injury, ambulance, and ETA ONLY). LOADING OFFICER ? Stages ambulances in holding area. Instructs crews to put all available equipment in equipment area. Assigns patients to vehicles. Directs drivers to hospital(s). Instructs not to contact hospital unless OLMC required for condition change. Notifies hospital, or coordinates communication to hospital notification times, patient ID#? s and destination of all transporting vehicles. In the event of a public health emergency or declared disaster, EMS providers may be asked to divert selected patients with certain conditions to hospital-established or state-established alternate care sites by OLMC. Grey 8 For Historical Purposes OnlySuggested Scene Organization (Not for HazMat) Page 130 Grey 9 For Historical Purposes OnlySexual Assault Victim Page 131ALL LEVELS 1. Treat any life-threatening emergency first and according to these protocols. 2. Try to attend to maintenance of forensic evidence. Try not to cut through tears or stains in clothing. Do not cleanse any skin area more than necessary to provide immediate care. 3. If the patient so desires and/or mandated reporting is indicated, police should be called if they have not already been notified. 4. If no life-threatening situation is present, prehospital care may require waiting for police to secure the scene which is a potential crime scene. 5. Victims of sexual assault commonly have much guilt, and may require psychological support. Please respect the stress that they are enduring. 6. By nature of this event, any touch may be traumatic for this patient. Overtly and repeatedly explain what you are doing to try to lessen the impact of procedures and touching. 7. Advise the patient not to eat, drink, smoke, bathe, change clothing or go to the bathroom if at all possible in order to preserve any forensic evidence. If they must urinate, request that they do not wipe. 8. If the patient has removed any clothing worn in the assault, each piece of clothing should be separately bagged in paper bags and brought to the hospital with the patient. 9. When transporting the patient, it is preferable whenever possible to have a same sex provider as the primary provider. If the assault is a same sex assault, than a provider of the opposite sex may be more comfortable for the patient. 10. To maintain privacy and confidentiality, use a land-line for hospital reporting whenever possible and do not clarify the type of assault, only that you are transporting a ?victim of assault.? 11. The patient should be encouraged to go to the hospital for a sexual assault forensic examination that would allow not only the option to have collection of forensic evidence, but also treatment of possible injuries and the chance to obtain pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease prophylactic treatment. 12. If the patient refuses treatment and/or transportation to the hospital, document all findings and observations as completely as possible. When signing the patient off at the scene, try to have a police officer witness this sign off. Grey 10 For Historical Purposes OnlyChild Abuse Management and Reporting #1 Page 132CHILD ABUSE (Title 22 MRSA, Chapter 1071, Subsection 4011-A) All levels - Child abuse and child neglect are sufficiently widespread to guarantee that virtually every EMS provider will encounter them at least once during his/her career. - It is estimated that approximately 2-3 million cases occur each year or approximately 11 cases per every 1,000 children within the U.S. Each year at least 2,000 children die from physical abuse. - The most commonly identified forms of abuse by the EMS provider are physical abuse and severe physical neglect, although sexual abuse may on occasion be observed. - The EMS provider must at all times demonstrate and maintain a supportive and non- judgmental attitude with primary caregivers. Accusation and confrontation delay immediate treatment as well as transportation to a definitive care facility. - When abuse is a possibility, the healthcare professional has two major responsibilities: first, to provide medical care to the child; and second, to collect and document all information that may possibly establish the occurrence of abuse or neglect. Refrain from asking the child too many questions and specifically do not ask any leading questions ? keep questions simple and open-ended such as ?What happened?? and ?Are you hurt?? - As an EMS provider, you must report immediately to Child Protective Services any child whom you have ?reasonable cause to suspect? has been abused or will be abused. Failure to do so is punishable as a civil violation. It is not enough to tell someone else of your suspicions. If a child is abused and unreported, there is a 50% chance that the child will be abused again and a 10% chance that the child will die from future abuse. Possible Indicators of Abuse 1. Injured child under two years of age, especially hot water burns or fractures 2. Facial, mouth, or genital injuries 3. Multi-planar injuries (front and back, right and left) ? especially when not over bony prominences 4. Poor nutrition or poor care 5. Delay in seeking treatment 6. Vague, inconsistent, or changing history 7. Refer to appropriate protocol for the comatose child, Pink 5, the child in shock, Pink 14 or the child in cardiac arrest, Pink 17 Treatment of suspected child abuse in the field 1. Suspect abuse but do not accuse the caretaker. Every time a child is encountered by the healthcare professional having a traumatic injury, the question that should come to mind is, ?Could this be abuse??. In most cases the answer will be an obvious ?no?; however, enough uncertainty will exist in some cases to warrant further assessment. 2. Follow normal initial assessment priorities of the ABC? s and mental status when caring for the child. 3. Provide the appropriate intervention procedures for any abnormal findings such as respiratory, trauma, or other medical emergencies; shock; or altered mental status. Grey 11 For Historical Purposes OnlyChild Abuse Management and Reporting #2 Page 1334. EMS providers are in key positions to assess environmental conditions and the observable interactions of family and child. Environmental signs of possible abuse or neglect may include but are not limited to: unsanitary conditions; garbage scattered about the house; unsafe conditions such as open, unguarded windows or potentially dangerous objects within reach of children. 5. Perform a detailed physical examination on any child in stable enough condition to allow for such. Examine all parts of the body for deformities, ecchymosis, lacerations, abrasions, punctures, burns, tenderness, and swelling. It is vitally important that injuries of the mouth and sternum be observed in detail prior to the initiation of resuscitative measures and documented that such injuries were found prior to resuscitation. 6. It is important to transport all children having evidence of abuse or neglect due to the possibility of additional injuries not immediately obvious. Transport of potentially abused or neglected children ensures that they receive the appropriate and necessary social service. Assistance may be necessary from law enforcement, OLMC, etc. 7. Convey your impressions and information to the hospital staff. 8. Write a detailed and descriptive report, which provides an accurate and clear record of all observations and treatment from the time of the initial call through transfer of the patient to the ED staff. Do not make a diagnosis of abuse, and refrain from including personal opinions, emotional overtones, or interpretations. Primary caregiver quoted statements must be documented as such with quotation marks, and exactly word for word as stated by the person. As well, this legal document must be legible. 9. You must contact Adult and Children? s Emergency Services at 1-800-452-1999 to make a report. This is a 24-hour a day reporting number. You will be protected by law from civil liability for making such a report if made in good faith. Title 22 MRSA, Chapter 1071, Subsection 4014 AN ACT TO STRENGTHEN THE LAWS GOVERNING MANDATORY REPORTING OF CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT. (Title 22 MRSA Section 4011-A, Subsection 7) Children under 6 months of age or otherwise non-ambulatory. A person required to make a report under subsection 1 shall report to the department if a child who is under 6 months or age or otherwise non-ambulatory exhibits evidence of the following: a. Fracture of the bone b. Substantial bruising or multiple bruises c. Subdural hematoma d. Burns e. Poisoning, or Injury resulting in substantial bleeding, soft tissue swelling, or impairment of an organ Grey 12 For Historical Purposes OnlyAdult Abuse, and Intoxicated Drivers Page 134ADULT ABUSE (Title 22 MRSA, Chapter 958-A, Subsection 3477) ?Reasonable cause to suspect. The following persons while acting in a professional capacity? ambulance attendant, emergency medical technician or other licensed medical service provider, Unlicensed assistive personnel shall immediately report to the department when the person knows or has reasonable cause to suspect that an incapacitated or dependent adult has been or is likely to be abused, neglected or exploited.? Call Adult Protective Services: 1-800-624-8404 (24 hours a day). Similar protection from liability for reporting exists. INTOXICATED DRIVERS (Title 29- A) \u00a7 2405 (1) ?Persons who may report If, while acting in a professional capacity a...emergency medical services person? knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a person has been operating a motor vehicle, hunting or operating a snowmobile, all-terrain vehicle or watercraft while under the influence of intoxicants and that motor vehicle, snowmobile, all-terrain vehicle or watercraft or a hunter has been involved in an accident, that person may report those facts to a law enforcement official.? \u00a7 2405 (2) Immunity from liability. A person participating in good faith in reporting under this section, or in participating in a related proceeding, is immune from criminal or civil liability for the act of reporting or participating in the proceeding. \u00a7 2524 (1) Persons qualified to draw blood for blood tests. ?Only a physician, registered physician's assistant, registered nurse or person whose occupational license or training allows that person to draw blood samples may draw a specimen of blood for the purpose of determining the blood-alcohol level or the presence of a drug or drug metabolite.? \u00a7 2528 Liability. ?A physician, physician's assistant, registered nurse, person whose occupational license or training allows that person to draw blood, hospital or other health care provider in the exercise of due care is not liable for an act done or omitted in collecting or withdrawing specimens of blood at the request of a law enforcement officer pursuant to this chapter.? Grey 13 For Historical Purposes OnlyTransport Protocol #1 Page 135*A patient without decision making capacity would be one who has one of the following: an altered mental status or intoxicated, confused, delirious, psychotic, comatose, unable to understand the language, or is a minor, etc. 1. If there is a question of decision making capacity or the patient does not appear to understand the consequences of his/her refusal of transport, then contact OLMC. 2. The patient must be informed of the consequences of his/her refusal to be transported. This must be documented in the patient care report. 3. This screening may typically arise when an ambulance is requested by someone other than the patient (i.e. the police, a bystander). The EMS run report must always be completed. 4. If the patient refuses transport and is judged to be without decision making capacity, the EMT must speak directly with OLMC. If unable to reach OLMC, the patient is transported. 5. EMS System initiated patient sign offs are tremendously risky interactions and are not condoned by Maine EMS. 6. The service is expected to review all patient sign offs through the service?s quality assurance mechanism. Patient medical records must be completed for all of these interactions, including the following information: a. The patient must be calm, competent, sober, and alert with the absence of an acute medical/surgical or traumatic process that impairs the patient? s capacity b. Greater than 18 years, emancipated, or contact with guardian c. Service(s) offered d. Reason service(s) declined e. Statement of risks and patient understanding of risk f. Discussion of alternatives to service offered and potential consequences of declining offered service g. Discussion with patient that EMS services may be accessed at any time, and that the patient had decision making capacity. Grey 14EMS Provider Assesses Patient Patient Accepts Treatment/Transport? Patient Transported Decision Making Capacity? YES NO Patient WITH Decision Making Capacity NOT TransportedPatient WITHOUT Decision Making Capacity* TransportedNO YES For Historical Purposes OnlyTransport Protocol #2 Page 1367. In some circumstances, patient transport is requested by an off site medical provider. Should a patient refuse transport and be found to have decision making capacity, EMS providers should communicate the discovery of decision making capacity and the patient? s right to refuse transfer with invested parties. OLMC or the physician ordering transport must be contacted by EMS in this decision making process. It is suggested that the consulted physician discuss directly with the patient. 8. When the patient is found to lack decision-making capacity but continues to refuse transport, contact OLMC for assistance. Should the patient continue to refuse transport, consider accessing other community advocates and resources (such as family/friend when appropriate and/or police). Consider direct dialogue between OLMC and the patient or OLMC and law enforcement to assist in resolving the conflict. Grey 15 For Historical Purposes OnlyTransport of Mentally Ill Patients Page 137Maine EMS personnel are generally called to transport a mentally ill patient in one of two situations: Emergency Transport Safety for the patient and the crew is the primary concern in the transport of the mentally ill patient. Personnel should make sure they do a thorough evaluation of the patient to find and treat possible medical causes of the behavior. Refer to the Agitation/Excited Delirium Protocol, Yellow 12 . EMS personnel are authorized under Maine law as physician extenders to physically restrain any patient who poses a threat to themselves or others. Providers are cautioned to use physical restraint as a last resort, preferably with the assistance of local law enforcement. Once the decision is made to restrain a patient, the patient should remain restrained until arrival at the emergency department, unless it interferes with the delivery of medical care. Non-Emergency Transfer Mentally ill patients who are being transferred usually fall into one of these categories: Voluntary Committal ? These patients have agreed to be transferred to a facility for evaluation and treatment of an underlying mental illness. It is important to get a thorough report on the patient prior to transport to avoid surprises en route. Voluntary committal patients can change their mind during transport. In this case, it is the responsibility of the EMS personnel to discharge the patient at a safe location, preferably at the originating facility. If it is not possible to return the patient to the originating facility, notify local law enforcement to meet you at your location. Involuntary Committal ? Patients who are being committed involuntarily must have committal papers (blue papers) completed prior to transport. Between the hours of 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. a judge has to sign the committal papers. After 11 p.m. and before 7 a.m. the papers do not have to be signed except for Riverview Psychiatric Center (formerly AMHI) ? this is known as the ?pajama clause?. Make sure that the transporting service is listed correctly on the papers. According to Maine law, the patient must be transported in the least restrictive form of transportation available. Make sure you get a thorough history to determine whether restraints will be necessary. If the receiving facility refuses to accept the patient after evaluating them, the transporting service is required by law to transport the patient back to the originating facility. Grey 16 For Historical Purposes OnlyProtective Headgear Removal Page 138The decision to remove protective headgear from an injured patient rests with the EMS provider on scene unless a Maine licensed physician is on scene and takes responsibility for the patient. It is important to immobilize the patient in a neutral in-line position, regardless of whether or not you choose to remove the helmet. This requires that you evaluate each patient and determine if other equipment (i.e. shoulder pads) must be removed or if additional padding under the shoulders or head is necessary. In the case of an athletic injury, the EMS provider should consider input from athletic trainers. Disputes should be referred to OLMC for resolution. When deciding whether to remove protective headgear, please evaluate the following criteria: Grey 17Can You Access the Airway? Does the Helmet Fit Snugly? Can you adequately immobilize the spine while maintaining neutral in-line Remove the Headgear Leave the Headgear in PlaceYES YES YESNO NO NO For Historical Purposes OnlyDefibrillation/Cardioversion Setting Page 139 Grey 18Initial Second Adult 360 J 360 J Pediatric 2 J/kg 4 J/kgThird Subsequent 360 J 360 J 4 J/kg 4 J/kgDEFIBRILLATION SETTING* * Adult 360 J monophasic or MEP or equivalent biphasic for all attempts Initial Second Adult (VT) 100 J 200 J Adult (SVT) 50 J 100 JThird Subsequent 300 J 360 J 200 J 300 J Pediatric 0.5-1.0 J/kg 2 J/kg 2 J/kg 2 J/kgCARDIOVERSION SETTING* * Use closest machine setting possible For biphasic defibrillation device, use monophasic equivalents as noted above For Historical Purposes OnlyMaine EMS Medication List Page 140The following are medications currently approved for use by Maine EMS licensees - as authorized by the Maine EMS Protocols.
