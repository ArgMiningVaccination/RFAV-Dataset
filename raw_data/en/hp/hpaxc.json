I wanted to share my (mostly non-toxic) favorites. Even though non-toxic products cost more, you can always buy used from mommy social media groups, facebook marketplace, ask mommy friends for hand me downs or add it to your registry as a group buy. Since products are always changing, I wanted to share basic guidelines I use when looking for a product: General Guidelines to protect the health of your baby: Organic and Natural Fabrics: clothing, sheets, towels, mattresses. Natural fabrics like linen and cotton are best. Pure personal care items. No fragrance, petroleum ingredients, pesticide preservatives, ethoxylated ingredients, etc. This includes soap, shampoo, creams, laundry detergent, dishwasher soap and cleaning materials. Avoid Endocrine Disruptors: such as BPA, parabens and phthalates interfere with hormones and have harmful developmental, reproductive and neurological effects. No synthetic flame retardants: If you are unsure, ask the company if their product includes flame retardants. Flame Retardants are toxic and are often used in: bedding and mattress, car seats, clothing and stuffed toys. Bath: Bathrobe: Natemia (organic cotton or bamboo bathrobes) https://natemia.com/collections/organic-towels Water Filter: Cuz'n Bath Ball Water Filter (if the water in your home is not filtered, I recommend this bath ball) Tub: PUJ (BPA & PVC free) This was great once my son was a little older around 7 months. It is non toxic so a great choice. I didn't find a great non-toxic one for newborns so we pretty much used the PUJ but it wasn't supportive so we had to hold the baby the entire time. [https://puj.com/products/puj-baby-bathtub](https://puj.com/products/puj-baby-bathtub) Wash Cloths: Green Sprouts https://greensproutsbaby.com/products/muslin-washcloths-made-from-organic-cotton-4-pack?variant=29831209320508 Shampoo and body soap: Weleda Diapers: Diapers: Cloth are the best for the environment. I use disposable DYPER & Honest Diapers ( chlorine-free processing, no latex, fragrance, or parabens, 100% plant-based, cruelty-free and never tested on animals and recyclable). Diaper Changing Pad: Naturepedic ( organic cotton fabric, clear food-grade waterproof from non-GMO sugarcane, non-allergenic, easy-to-clean). https://www.naturepedic.com/organic-changing-table-pads Diaper Bag: this is really your style preference for the brand and style.... Diaper Changing Table: Pottery Barn (if you are on a budget look for holiday sales, facebook mommy groups or marketplace for buying used). Diaper Cream: Weleda (made with calendula and chamomile, free from synthetic preservatives, fragrances, colorants or raw materials derived from mineral oils. Dermatologically tested and highly skin-friendly even for sensitive skin). https://www.weleda.com/product/d/calendula-diaper-care-cream Diaper Wipes: Made Of (organic, non gmo, gentle baby wipes) https://madeof.com/collections/organic-baby-products Diaper Pail: UBBI (also love the UBBI wipes holder and UBBI diaper bags for https://ubbiworld.com/pages/diaper-pail Food: Bibs: Mushie Bottles: Joovy Boob (Glass is better and also not good to heat plastic because it releases toxic hormone disruptors) [https://joovy.com/boob-baby-bottle-glass/](https://joovy.com/boob-baby-bottle-glass/). We also love the silicone Comotomo bottles but I only use the glass ones for heating. Bottle Sanitizer: Baby Brezza (love!!) Bottle Green Sprouts (organic) Formula: If you need to supplement or are unable to breastfeed, Dr Sura loves the homemade formula in the Nourishing Traditions book. It is a game changer compared to the other formulas on the market - even the European organic ones!! You can find the recipe in that book and online here: https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/childrens-health/formula-homemade-baby-formula/ Clothes: In general, look for organic materials and natural fabrics (such as cotton and linen) are best. Newborns get cold more easily than adults. I love putting my little one in the onesies with long sleeves and that also covered the feet. Some days we went through four outfits a day and some days only one. It depends on how often you want to do laundry when deciding how much clothing and blankets to buy. This is generally the most gifted section but you may want to invest in some essentials in high quality organic fabric. You will need swaddle blankets, onesies (short sleeve, long sleeve), pants, hats, mittens, bibs and socks. Depending on the weather, you may also need a jacket or swimwear. I love the kimono onesies from Petit Bateau because you don't have to pull it over the head - super easy to come on and off. Also, the Petit Bateau onesies are organic and made from cotton - which I love! Sleep: Side Sleeper: Babybay little one LOVES his Nuna Aire Sena...he started sleeping better when we used this basinet of this for his nighttime sleep) https://nunababy.com/usa/sena-aire-mini-play-yard?color_ref=16372 Crib & Organic Mattress: You won't need a crib for a few months if you are co-sleeping or using a bassinet. But when you do purchase it, splurge on an organic mattress and sheets if you can or look for a hand me down. The organic mattress is the most important for baby overall. I love the COCO Crib Mat [https://www.purebabyandchild.com/product-page/the-coco-mat-our-crib-mattress.](https://www.purebabyandchild.com/product-page/the-coco-mat-our-crib-mattress.) Avocado and Naturepedic also have great options for a baby mattress. You don't have to spend a lot of money on the crib. Untreated wood is best. IKEA has an affordable option (Sniglar). If you are splurging on both - I love the Pottery Barn cribs for the quality. Travel: Baby Wearing: Solly: [https://nunababy.com/usa/sena-aire-mini-play-yard?color_ref=16372](https://nunababy.com/usa/sena-aire-mini-play-yard?color_ref=16372) (great newborns) or Baby K'tan Organic: [https://www.maisonette.com/product/baby-carrier-organic](https://www.maisonette.com/product/baby-carrier-organic).
