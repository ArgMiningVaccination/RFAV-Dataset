The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were designed to achieve sustainable development in its three dimensions: economic, social, and environmental in a balanced and integrated manner.[ [1]] The SDGs have received recognition from environmental academics for their commitment to \"achieving peace with nature,\" and focusing on how human civilizations affect the environment in line with strong sustainability.[ [2]] SDG 8 calls for \"sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all\" covering a range of areas, including diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, promotion of decent work, entrepreneurship, growth of micro-small and medium-sized enterprises, financial inclusion, global strategies and cooperation to aid for trade, and youth employment.[ [1]] Sustained and inclusive economic growth is essential for prosperity which can only be possible if steps will be taken in direction of building dynamic, sustainable, innovative, and people-centered economies, promoting youth employment, strengthening the productive capacities of the countries in all sectors, and adopting policies to increase productive employment. This further calls for the involvement of nonpublic, more especially private firms, and strengthens the role of a multifaceted entrepreneurship approach to include business operations in the roadmap to sustainability. AYURVEDA FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Ayurveda, the oldest health-care system, has gained wide recognition and popularity globally. Ayurveda adopted the management approach which goes beyond just being a curative system of medicine to being a preventive and promotive health-care system. Ayurveda has a significant edge over contemporary medicines and it has emerged as a huge entrepreneurial opportunity for the economic development of the nation. Ayurveda has a significant global presence with its product market in India worth Rs. 515.5 billion (US$ 6.6 billion) in 2021 and is projected to record 19.8% growth from 2022 to 2027.[ [3]] The pandemic of COVID-19 has adversely impacted the business sector and economy of the nation. However, the era of the pandemic has witnessed a boost in the Ayurveda sector. With growing concern about the need for good health and strong immune systems, the demand for herbal food products, nutritional food supplements, and immunity boosters has grown tremendously across the globe. With the changed perspective of health from curative medicine to proactive and preventive health care, consumers are focusing more on adopting various means of maintaining long-term health with health and wellness coming into the spotlight. There is an increased demand for all-natural alternatives, which are helping to grow the global market for herbal medicines. With an acceleration in the rising incidence and prevalence of long-term ailments such as diabetes mellitus, rheumatic disorders, heart diseases, stroke, and other noncommunicable diseases, the growing geriatric population, mounting health concerns over side effects of modern medicine has led to wider adoption of Ayurveda-based health-care products, Ayurvedic nutraceuticals, Ayurvedic medicines, and dietary supplements. A significant notable shift in the nutritional choices of the urban population toward healthier herbal-oriented eating choices, and growing preferences for traditional foods have led to an increase in more innovative ways to meet consumer demands. This has inflated the significant proportion of Ayurveda-based products such as ready-to-drink juices, confectionary products, and Ayurveda/healthy ready-to-eat food ranges in the food and beverages segment of the fast-moving consumer goods sector. The ease of accessibility, price, and growing awareness of the benefits of Ayurvedic food products and medicines has fueled the market expansion. ROLE OF MICRO, SMALL, AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES IN THE INDIAN ECONOMY India is considered one of the biggest economies in the world. Indian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has risen from Rs 2.7 lakh crore at the time of independence to now close to Rs 150 lakh crore, making it the fifth-largest economy in the world at present.[ [4]] The nation has faced the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in GDP growth recovering to 6.2% in 2020 and 6.4% in 2021 after dipping to 5.8% in 2019.[ [5]] The Indian Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector is one of the major contributors to the GDP of the country. In the document \"Economic Survey 2021-2022\" released by the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, it has been stated that the relative importance of MSMEs can be gauged from the fact that the share of MSME GVA in total GVA (current prices) 30.50% and 26.83%, respectively.[ [6]] The contribution of MSMEs to the economy consists of 90% of enterprises, 80% of the nonagriculture labor force, 6.11% of GDP manufacturing, 24% of GDP service sector, 33.4% in manufacturing activities, and 45% in total export.[ [7]] Further, as per the information received from the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, the share of export of specified MSME-related products to all India exports during 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 (up to August 2022) was 45.03% and 42.67%, respectively. Furthermore, the total number of persons employed in MSMEs in the year 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 (up is 13,019,919 and 8,423,452, respectively.[ [8]] MSMEs play an important role in the wider ecosystem of firms where startups and young firms are considered the primary source of net job creation and are the driving force of innovation and sustainability in the private sector.[ [6]] The MSMEs in India are playing a crucial role by providing large employment opportunities and it has been creating 11.10 crore jobs (360.41 lakhs in manufacturing, 0.07 lakh in noncaptive electricity generation and transmission, 387.18 lakhs in trade, and 362.82 lakhs in other services) in the rural and the urban areas across the country, thereby assuring a more equitable distribution of national income and wealth.[ [9]] MICRO, SMALL, AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES AND AYURVEDA SECTOR - PROSPECTIVE AND OPPORTUNITIES The Ayurveda industry is dominated by MSMEs accounting for more than 80% of the enterprises. Addressing the Nation at the 9th World Ayurveda Congress at Panjim, Goa, the Hon'ble Prime Minister of the Nation, Narendra Modi claimed that about 40,000 MSMEs are active in the Ayush sector emphasizing the huge scope for Ayush startups and opportunities budding in the field of Ayurveda such as the farming of herbs, manufacturing and supply of Ayush medicines, and digital services.[ [10]] It has been observed that small businesses are frequently the impetus behind innovations that are crucial for economic growth because they have the flexibility to work outside of the dominant paradigms and take advantage of technological or commercial opportunities to make knowledge that would otherwise go untapped commercially viable. A varied range of Ayurvedic cosmetics and toiletries are produced by MSMEs in the country, in addition to the other major industry giants in the Ayurveda industry. The key challenge for MSMEs in the Ayurveda sector is to identify and connect to appropriate knowledge partners and networks at the local, national, and global levels, and develop appropriate skills and management practices for integrating knowledge created by external partners with in-house practices and innovation processes.[ [11]] Supporting MSMEs in the Ayurveda sector requires development and imbibing the attitude of the utilization of new technologies and business fields for integration. It certainly demands capacity building, knowledge and technology transfer, financial resources, and an enabling policy framework conducive to promoting the ease of doing business. The Government of India has launched a Scheme of Funds for the Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI). The Government of India has launched cluster-based SFURTI with an aim to recognize the talent, creativity, and enterprises of hard work of rural artisans from varied sectors ranging from food products to Ayurvedic medicines, to build up innovated and traditional skills, improved technologies, advanced processes, market intelligence subsequently empower, and converting them as self-governing entrepreneurs.[ [12]] MSMEs offer employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for young people. There is a need for the development of the \"entrepreneurial ecosystem\" in the Ayurveda sector with a focus on certain aspects such as policy, finance, culture, business development supports, human capital, and markets. The Ministry of Ayush (MoA) has launched an \"AYUSH Entrepreneurship Development Program\" in collaboration with the Ministry of MSMEs for promoting the Ayush sector in the country under different schemes. The objectives were to strengthen the Ayush sector, create more enterprises, and job creation to support the nation's economy. Various other initiatives such as Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and cluster development introduced by different government agencies to promote entrepreneurship applicable to Ayurveda. Another Scheme for the Development of Ayush Clusters by MoA is aimed to fill the gaps in the sector related to standardization, quality assurance, control, productivity, marketing, infrastructure, and capacity building through a cluster-based approach which would be implemented on support from MoA through the way of grant to the Special Purpose Vehicle, formed by a group of entrepreneurs from Ayush sector.[ [12]] This cluster-based approach is increasingly being recognized as an effective and sustainable strategy for the competitiveness enhancement of MSMEs which leverages the geographical proximity of the enterprises on the \"collaborating while competing\" principle providing critical mass for customization of interventions.[ [13]] MoA has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of MSME for the promotion of Ayush enterprises and has conducted various activities such as awareness programs on the digital advertisement, e-marketing, GST and GeM, and seminar/workshop on packaging and marketing, and Export Promotion of Ayush Products.[ [14]] On a similar ground, Academia-industry Research Incubation for Value-chain Up-gradation has also been setup by the Central Council of Research in Siddha to promote innovation, entrepreneurship by translating novel ideas into products, processes, and services for commercial exploitation, and various collaborative efforts with other scientific organizations such as Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Indian Council of Agricultural Research were also taken to promote research, innovation, and management.[ [14]] The MoA and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, has formulated regulations of safety and quality standards for Ayurveda food products under the \"Ayurveda Aahara\" category.[ [15]] Since the generation of millennials is prioritizing healthy eating, the introduction of this newer food category not only ensures the production of high-quality Ayurvedic food products and aids in the expansion of the international market for Made-in-India products but will also foster the entrepreneurship culture in Ayurveda food sector. This new regulation will certainly reinforce India's global position in the entrepreneur market as a custodian of the Ayush system. At its 75th session on March 5, 2021, the United Nations General Assembly named 2023 the \"International Year of Millets,\" as an opportunity to raise awareness and direct policy attention toward harnessing the nutritional and health benefits of millet consumption as well as highlighting the benefits of creating a sustainable market for millets.[ [16]] There are many healthy and wholesome meal preparations indicated in Ayurvedic Classics that can broaden the scope for suitable use of millet. This has encouraged the food industry to widen its horizons and a whole new era of \"Millet entrepreneurship in Ayurveda\" will emerge. Advances in information technology (IT) have the potential to help diverse stakeholders in the Ayush sector to achieve better health outcomes. Artificial intelligence-based solutions in Ayurveda diagnostics, bio-sensors and trackers are a few of the innovations to enhance Ayush health-care systems by empowering the Ayush health professionals and Ayush industries to achieve the vision of health for all. A whole new segment of opportunities in the digital-health market encircling the Ayush system has emerged in the recent past to realize the untapped potential of Ayurveda with the appropriate integration of technology and a professional approach. The All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) has set up an incubation center, i.e. AIIA Incubation Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (AIIA-iCAINE) to foster entrepreneurship by leveraging a network of cutting-edge businesses in Ayush. The incubation center supports entrepreneurs through capacity building, and mentoring and welcomes Innovators and entrepreneurs to seek guidance and opportunities through AIIA-iCAINE outreach programs. AIIA-iCAINE has also supported start-ups at the India International Trade Fair at Pragati Maidan selected under the categories - Food Innovations and Cosmetics; Ayur-bio-instrumentation; and IT-Innovations in Ayush Sector. AIIA has also been recognized as the Host Institute under the Ministry of MSME to identify and provide opportunities to innovators while nurturing and developing their ideas to produce market-ready and commercially viable products. TACKLING THE CHALLENGES - PROBABLE SOLUTIONS The formalization and growth of Ayurveda entrepreneurship require overcoming a number of obstacles, including insufficient R and D, a slow rate of technological upgradation, and lack of targeted marketing and branding, and inadequate focus on human resource development. These obstacles call for the creation of more enabling policy and regulatory frameworks as well as increased access to the high-quality infrastructure needed for successful operations. There should be appropriate business strategies backed by very strong research and development support to conceptualize new ventures in Ayurveda. There is a dire need to introduce various \"Apprenticeship\" and entrepreneur programs for young and enthusiastic fellows who want to invest and work in the field. It is essential to recognize the close relationship between programs that foster entrepreneurship and employment. Recognizing the contextual aspects and challenges encountered within this entrepreneurial ecosystem in Ayurveda is crucial for becoming more inclusive and meeting the needs of all young people and stakeholders of the sector. The SDGs encourage efficient usage of resources and increased industrial process adoption which is sustainable for the environment and economy. With the rise in business opportunities in the Ayurveda sector due to expanding demands for Ayush-based products, especially in personal care and food products segments, and an increase in the demand for customized products; the role of MSMEs is well-positioned to reproduce and commercialize the recent expansion in Ayurveda sector.
