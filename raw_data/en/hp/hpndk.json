History The National Health and Medical Research Council ( NHMRC ) has been engaged by the Department of Health (Department) to update the evidence underpinning the 2015 Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Ther apies for Private Health Insurance (2015 Review) (1). The seven natural therapies to be reviewed in the first tranche are naturopathy, Pilates, Rolfing, shiatsu, Tai Chi, western herbalism and yoga. These therapies are among those excluded from the private health insurance rebate as of 1 April 2019. To support the NHMRC in their evidence review , Health Technology Analysts (HTAnalysts) has been engaged to conduct a systematic review of the evid ence of clinical effectiveness of Tai Chi . Eligible studies received from the Department's public call for evidence , the Natural Therapies Review Expert Advisory Panel (NTREAP ) and the Natural Therapies Working Committee (NTWC) will also be included in the evidence evaluation . This Research Protocol has been developed by HTAnalysts, in conjunction with the NHMRC , the NTWC and the NTREAP to provide a framework outlining the methodology that will be used to review the evidence regarding Tai Chi . It is intended that all associated materials will be developed in a robust and transparent manner in accordance with relevant best practice standards (2, 3) .

The 2015 review was underpinned by an overview of systematic review s that focused solely on Tai Chi and were published in the English language between 2008 and January 2014. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that were reported within included SRs and assessed Tai C hi delivered to treat any clinical condition were included , with outcomes selected according to predefined criteria . In this 2020 update , the evidence review will build upon the 2015 review but will not be limited by publication date and a broader range of study types will be eligible for inclusion (inclusive of pseudorandomised studies and, for certain populations and outcomes, nonrandomised studies of interventions [NRSIs] ). The updated review will also include studies that assess Tai Chi delivered for primary prevention. Similar to the 2015 review, eligible comparisons will be Tai Chi versus control and Tai Chi versus other intervention s. Studies not published in the Englis h language will not be translated, and databases in languages other than English will not be searched. The process for conducting the review is built upon the following framework : source the clinical evidence by performing a systematic literature search o f the literature, identify eligible studies published in English and indexed in English language databases , incorporat e additional literature identified through non -database sources received from the Department's public call for evidence, the Department's NTREAP and NTWC , critically apprais e and present the evidence, and determin e the certainty in the evidence base for each question, using a structured assessment of the body of evidence in accordance with GRADE methodo logy (6). Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 8 1.1 Description of condition a nd setting Tai Chi is practiced for a range of reasons and is intended to improve general health and wellbeing. Practicing Tai Chi is claimed to improve health outcomes for a variety of clinical and pre -clinical conditions, including : cardiovascular disease s, such as heart failure (7) and hypertension (8); pulmonary disease s, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (9) and asthma (9); conditions associated with chronic pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis (10), osteoarthritis (11), peripheral n europathy (12), fibromyalgia (13), migraine (14), and non specific low back pain (15); conditions associated with impaired physical functioning, such as m ultiple sclerosis (16), Parkinson's disease (17), or rehabilitation after stroke (18); conditions related to cancer survival (19-23); mental or behavioural disorders, such as depression (24), anxiety (20, 25) ; and conditions associated with ag eing , such as osteoporosis (26), dementia (27), and mild cognitive impairment (28). The current review is not limited to one particular condition or setting (see Section 3.1.2 Types of participants ) and therefore a concise description of each condition or problem addressed , and the relevant settings, will be provide d after conduct of the full text review . Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 9 1.2 Description of intervention Tai Chi is a mind -body movement practice developed from a traditional Chinese martial art 'Wushu ', that combines slow physical movements with deep breathing and meditation (10). Practiced since at least the 16th Century , the integrated belief of a balance between mind, body and b reath to achieve greater awareness , strength and a sense of well -being has evolved in agreement with Chinese philosophical principle of Yin -Yang (the balance of opposite, yet interdependent forces e.g. masculine/feminine, light/dark) (29). By nurturing, balancing and promoting the free flow of a person's lif e energy or vital force, termed in Chinese philosophy as 'qi', Tai Chi is believed to correct imbalances and interruptions to an individual's overall functioning and wellbeing . Also known as taijiquan, tai ji, or Tai Chi chuan , there are m any different forms and styles of Tai Chi . 'Forms' refers to a routine of individual ly choreographed movements performed in a specific sequence and style (30). There are several styles of Tai Chi (e.g. Chen, Yang, Sun, Wu and Hao ) each of which have their own set of forms (or movements) . Underlying all styles of Tai Chi are the fundamental principles of 'movement control ' (soft, slow , continuous and precise rhythmic movements that flow with evenness and gentle resistance ), 'body structure ' (upright , supple posture maintained with a lowered centre of gravity and mindfulness for balance and weight transference ) and 'internal components ' (deep breathing and mental quietness to keep limbs and ligaments relaxed and enable aware ness of the presence and movement of the body within its ow n space ) (31-33). Since the 1 980s, Tai Chi has gained popularity in the West as a therapeutic and/or preventative physical activity (33). The practice of Tai Chi typically includes a warm -up followed by sets of movement , called forms or routines , which are performed in a certain way according to the style of Tai Chi being practiced . Forms may be described as 'short' or 'long' , with the longer forms described as more physically and mentally demanding. Each style has its own established length of practice , and, like many exercise movement therapies, the proficiency and experience of an individual influences the speed, duration, and frequency of practice. For many, the aim is to maintain a daily practice , which can last anywhere from 5 minutes up to 2 hours (34). Tai Chi practice may also incorporate Qigong, an ancient Chinese form of exercise that aims to cultivate qi through breath, movement and meditation. Tai Chi can be practiced at any t ime and in any location where there is sufficient space (35). It does not require specialist facilities, expensive equipment, or dedicated clothing and can be practiced regardles s of age or level of fitness . In the Australian setting, Tai Chi is commonly taught and practiced in groups , both indoors and outdoor s, usually under the instruction of a Tai Chi master. Individuals may also practice Tai Chi at home, whil e viewing or liste ning to professional Tai Chi videos or other multimedia . There is currently no regulatory method of certifying teachers or instructors in Tai Chi in Australia. Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 10 1.3 How the intervention might work As a low-impact, moderately intense aerobic exercise involving complex motor control and deep diaphragmatic breathing , Tai Chi is thought to benefit the mind and body of practitioners by build ing strength from 'within ' (10, 33, 35) . This is achieved by combining isometric and isotonic exercise of deep stabili ser muscles and joints with relaxation , controlled breathing , and meditation (36). Isometric exercises involve static strength training, where specific muscle group s are contracted and held in one position , whereas isotonic exercises , involve repetitive lengthening or shortening of the muscle group in a way that causes joint movement . The potential physical benefits of Tai Chi are related to the r egular practice of isotonic exercise , which enhance s cardiopulmonary fitness through optimisation of oxygen utilisation, increasing exercise capacity and improving muscle strength , flexibility and endurance (35, 37, 38) . In ad dition, the slow and deliberate weightshifting feature of Tai Chi requires the muscles of the lower legs and feet to work considerabl y, as forms are completed with knees bent in a squatlike position . It is suggested that the intensity of Tai Chi (Yang st yle) does not exceed 50 -55% of the individual's maximum oxygen intake (39-42) and changes in heart rate and blood pressure are similar to those for walking at a speed of 6 km/hr (43, 44) . The potential psycho physio logical benefits of Tai Chi (such as impro ved attentiveness and sleep, and reduced fatigue , stress and anxiety) , may be explained by the relaxation response theory that includes the homeostatic balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems (45), reduced cellular inflammatory responses (46, 47) , or through modulating or stimulating the connectivity of key brain regions involved in mood regulatio n and executive function (48-50). Further research is required to clarify and understand the mechanisms underlying the possible association between Tai Chi and other observed physiological responses such as reduced hypertension (51), improved immune function (52), and improved blood glucose control (53). Movement Qigong with meditatio n has similar proposed me chanisms of action, and therefore is expected to have the same benefits as Tai Chi (54). Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 11 1.4 Why it is important to do this review In Australia, complementary therapies , including Tai Chi , are most often used in conjunction with conventional medicine and other strategies for maintaining good health and wellness. For this reason, i t is important to synthesise the evidence for the effectiveness of Tai Chi , to enable consumers, health care providers and policy mak ers to make informed decisions about care . The 2015 review (4) identified 37 systematic reviews containing evidence fr om 117 unique RCTs involving 8852 participants across 16 clin ical conditions and concluded that, compared with control, there is (a) very low quality evidence to suggest that Tai Chi may have some beneficial health effects in a limited number of conditions for a limited number of outcomes including the elderly (muscle strength), heart disease (quality of life), hypertension (SBP, DBP), and osteoarthritis (physical function) , and (b) low to very low quality evidence that Tai Chi may have no effect on selected outcomes in people who are elderly (falls) an d people with heart disease (HRV, exercise capacity). Compared to active comparators , the 2015 review concluded that there is (a) very low quality evidence that Tai Chi may have beneficial effects relative to active comparators on selected outcomes in peo ple with osteoarthritis (pain, physical function) , and (b) very low quality evidence that suggests there may be no difference between Tai Chi and another active comparator in a limited number of conditions and for a limited number of outcomes including hyp ertension (SBP, DBP), osteoporosis (bone mineral density) and type 2 diabetes (HbA1c, FBG, total cholesterol). The evidence for these findings is largely based on small, poor quality studies and was rated as very low for almost all outcomes (4). The magnitude and clinical significance of any potential health benefits were uncertain. For many outcomes, the health effects of Tai Chi were uncertain. A key limitation of the overview wa s the overall poor quality of information reported in the identified systematic reviews, and the implied poor quality of the RCTs they included. In addition, four submission s were received, with two additional RCTs identified that were not identified by s ystematic reviews included in the overview (5). One RCT assessed Tai Chi in the elderly (community dwelling) and did not materially change the findings or interpretation of the evidence in the overview for this group. The other RCT assessed Tai Chi in people with low back pain, which was not included in the overview because there w ere no systematic reviews identified for this patient group. The interpretation of results for low back pain were therefore limited to this single study. The rationale for conducting this review is to update and enhance the evidence and guidance used to inform the 2015 Overview of Tai Chi (4). That is, to identify whether any high -quality studies have been published since, or were not included in , the 2015 review, and address the evidence gaps noted. This is to ensure recommendations relating to the use of Tai Chi remain relevant and up to date . Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 12 2 Objectives To conduct a systematic review of RCTs that evaluate the effectiveness of Tai Chi in individual s with a described injury, disease, medical condition, or preclinical condition. This will be supplemented with a systematic review of NRSIs for certain populations , settings or outcomes when a NRSI study design is more appropriate or feasible, in line with Cochrane recommendations (55). The intent is to evaluate the evidence representative of the populations and conditions commonly seen by Tai Chi instructors in Australia , the intervention(s) commonly used by the instruc tor, and outcomes that align with the reasons why patients use Tai Chi and/or instructors administer Tai Chi . Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 13 3 Methods Methods reported in this protocol are based on that described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (56) and relevant sections in the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's manual (57). Covidence (www.covidence.org), a webbased platform for producing systematic reviews, will be used for screening citations and recording decisions made. Covidence is compatible with Endnote and Microsoft Excel, which will be used for managing citations and data collection , respectively . Where appropriate, RevMan (58) will be used for the main analyses and GRADEpro GDT softwar e (www.gradepro.org) will be used to record decisions and derive an overall assessment of the certainty of evidence for each outcome guided by GRADE methodology (6). The final approved review protocol is to be registered on the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPER O). To identify the evidence base for the clinical question a systematic search of published medical literature will be conducted. All potentially relevant studies will be identified after applying prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria as outlined below. Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 14 3.1 Criteria for considering studies for this review 3.1.1 Types of studies Study design Eligible studies are RCTs that examine the effectiveness of Tai Chi compared to control or another intervention . As per Cochrane reco mmendations, NRSIs are only eligible for inclusion for certain populations , settings or outcomes that may be more appropriately or more feasibly evaluated using NRSI (55). The relevant populations, settings or outcomes will be determined via a blinded approach as specified in Sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.4 . The primary study of interest is an RCT. Cluster -randomised trials and crossover trials are also eligible for inclusion, and will be analysed using methods appropriate to the design (see Section 3.3.9 ) (59). If the method of randomisation is not specifically stated , or not strictly random, then the study will be judged to be pseudorandomised . Pseudorandomised controlled trials will be evaluated alongside RCTs, with methods of randomisation examined in the risk of bias assessment and any concer ns about risk of bias addressed in the synthesis. For c ertain populations and/or outcomes (see Sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.4 ) NRSIs with design features as outlined in Table 1 are also eligible for inclusion. To be eligible for inclusion, the minimum design features of the NRSI include: allocation to, or practice of, the intervention occurs by choice (by the partici pant or other) the effect of the intervention in individuals (or clusters of individuals or groups) is compared with a contemporaneous control group NRSIs in which the effect of the intervention is compared to a historical (or non -parallel or non - concurre nt) control group are not eligible for inclusion due to concerns regarding risk of bias ( e.g. due to residual confounding or unmeasurable changes in clinical practice over time). Single arm studies with either post -test or pre -test/post -test outcomes, cros s-sectional studies, case series, and case reports are also not eligible for inclusion, as it is too problematic to assess the effect of the intervention in such studies with any confidence (60, 61) . NRSIs are included to ensure the evidence review adequately covers the breadth of health conditions and outcomes to inform health policy, particularly in populations or settings where the intervention is either not likely, or not able, to be assessed using a randomised design, or where evidence from RCTs is incomplete for certain populations, settings or outcomes that may be more feasibly evaluated using NRSI (55). This is likely to occur when the length of follow -up for the outcome is not feasible for an RCT, or the event rate of the outcome is so small that it requires a population -wide study for a measurable effect to be observed. In rare instances, it may be because of a strong preference for the intervention by prospective participa nts prevents the conduct of a suitable RCT (62), or the RCT evidence for a particular health condition and outcome is indirect and the question is better answered by available NRSI evidence (63). Eligible NRSIs that are assessed to be at critical risk of bias for one or more domain (see Section 3.3.7 ) will not be included in the evidence synthesis because results from these studies are likely to lead to misinformed judgements about the effect estimate. Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 15 Table 1 Eligible design fe atures of nonrandomised studies of interventions Definition / design features Design features of NRSIs included in the review An experimental study in which people are allocated to the intervention/treatment being studied or a control/placebo group and the outcomes compared. The method of allocation is by choice, availability, or chance. A study in which outcomes from a defined group of people (the cohort) are followed over time, to examine associations between exposure and no n-exposure to an intervention or factor under study. Outcome are recorded as they occur. A 'prospective' cohort study recruits participants before any intervention and follows them into the future. A study in which outcomes from a defined group of people (the cohort) are identified to examine associations between exposure and non -exposure to an intervention or factor under study. A 'retrospective' cohort study identifies subjects from past records describing the interventions received and follows th em from the time of those records. A study that uses observations at multiple time points before and after an intervention (the 'interruption') is introduced to a group of people, and then compared to the outcomes at the same time points for a group of p eople that do not receive the intervention. The design attempts to detect whether the intervention has had an effect significantly greater than any underlying trend over time. A study in which observations are made before and after the implementation of an intervention, both in a group that receives the intervention and in a control group that does not and compared at the same timepoint. A study that compares people with a specific outcome of interest ('cases') with people from the same source populatio n but without that outcome ('controls'), to examine the association between the outcome and prior exposure (e.g. having an intervention). This design is particularly useful when the outcome is rare. Source: Adapted from NHMRC (61, 64) ; Chapter 24 Including non -randomized studies on intervention effects (55); Cochrane Childhood Cancer (65); Publication date There are no limitations on publication date, however , studies published after the systematic review literature search date will not be eligible for inclusion. Studies that are published (or submitted to the Department) after the literature search date will be listed within the ' Studies awaiting Classification ' table of the evaluation report. These studies will not be subject to a formal evidence evaluation, however, a brief statement about the study and its potential impact on the overall conclusions of the evidence review will be included under the relevant sections of the review (e.g. 'Overall completeness and applicability of evidence' ). Studies published in languages other than English The literature search, as well as the Department's call for evidence, will not be limited by language of publication. Databases in languages other than English will not be searched, however , studies in languages other than English may be identified via the English -language databases. For pragmatic reasons, potentially eligible studies will not undergo full -text translation or data extraction, but will be documented via a process outlined in Section 3.3.1 'Studies published in languages other than English . 3.1.2 Types of participants People of any age with any injury, disease, medical condition or pre -clinical condition are eligible for inclusion. This includes disease prevention in at-risk healthy populations , which is broadly defined as those who are at increased risk of becoming ill or injured based on social, biomedical or behavioural risk factors (66). For the purposes of this review, social determinants include factors such as income, education, employment and social support; biomedical factors include a person's age, genetic ma ke -up and health status (such as obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, age, vitamin Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 16 deficiency); and behavioural factors include a person's lifestyle choices ( e.g. alcohol consumption, diet, exercise, tobacco and other drug use, etc.). Healthy participants seeking health improvement, such as general wellbeing, fitness, aesthetic improvements, resilience and cognitive or emotional intelligence are not eligible for inclusion ; however, a study with eligible and ineligible populations may be included if separate data is available for the eligible population /s. NRSIs will only be eligible for inclusion for certain populations , settings or outcomes as outlined in Section 3.1.1 . (55) . These populations will be identified by the NTWC in parallel with the process for selecting critical and important outcomes (see Section 3.1.4 ). This will involve NTWC consider ing a list of the populations identif ied in included RCTs, whil e remaining blinded to the details and characteristics of the RCTs (e.g. risk of bias, outcome results) . The NTWC will specify eligible populations from those listed, and will also nominate any other population s expected to be covered in the evidence review, for which RCTs may not be feasible, or where NRSIs may present the best available evidence due to the factors outlin ed in Section 3.1.1 . 3.1.3 Types of interventions Intervention All styles and forms of Tai Chi are eligible for inclusion. That is, any activity in the name of Tai Chi instruction delivered to an individual or a group of individual s, or self -practiced . There are no limits on intensity, duration of practice, or mode of delivery and s tudies will be included irrespective of whether the intervention is delivered by a n instructor or through other media ( e.g. instructional videos) . Studies that include Tai Chi delivered in combination with Qigong will be included , however, studies in which the sole focus is Qigong will be excluded. Studies that include Tai Chi in combinat ion with other forms of exercise will be excluded , unless the effect of Tai Chi alone can be discerned. To allow for potential subgroup analysis (and to inform decision -making), studies will be stratified based on whether the participants receive instructo r-led Tai Chi in a group or individual setting (see Section 3.3.15 ). Comparators There are no restrictions on the type of eligible comparator s, noting that the analysis will stratify the evidence into two comparisons: (i) control ( including no intervention, wait list or usual care); and (ii) other comparator (inclusive of exercise, education, and usual care if considered active). Where usual care is poorly described or where usual care is described with Tai Chi as an adjunct (i.e. Tai Chi pl us usual care vs usual care alone), it will be considered an inactive (control) intervention. 'Other' comparators could include (but will not be limited to) pharmacologic treatments, manual therapies, exercise programs, or other forms of physical activit y designed to improve health. Cointerventions such as diet, education programs, life style modification, or medic ation may be administered simultaneously to the intervention and comparison group. Studies with co interventions will be included if all arms of a study receive the same cointerventions (i.e. the effectiveness of Tai Chi is not confounded ). Restrictions: Studies comparing different styles, forms or components of Tai Chi with one another will be excluded. Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 17 3.1.4 Types of o utcome measures Outcome role Outcomes will not be used as a criterion for including or excluding studies . Outcome domains of interest Outcomes are intended to align with the reasons why patients use the therapy and/or practitioners prescribe the therapy. This includes recovery, rehabilitation, and changes in disease outcomes and symptoms ( e.g. pain, joint range of motion, strength, balance, and accepted surrogate outcomes such as HbA1C for diabetes , body mass index for weight gain or loss , lung function tests), health related psychological/behavioural outcomes, health related quality of life , self-reported benefits , symptoms and function al ability , medication use or compliance with conventional medicine treatment; and injury or disease specific p revention outcomes ( e.g. falls prevention, smoking cessation). Restrictions: Consistent with the terms of reference of NTREAP, personal health care preferences, patient -reported experience measures (PREMS) (e.g. satisfaction with care) , safety , quality and economic outcomes are out of scope . Outcome measures and timepoints of interest Any effectiveness outcome anticipated to demonstrate a treatment achieves its intended purpose is eligible for inclusion. Ther e are no limit ations on time points (e.g. short and long -term outcomes ) or outcome measure ( e.g. objective and subjective measures such as clinical and laboratory assessments and patient -reported outcome measures [PROMS], preferably measured using validated tools, are eligible) . As there are a broad range of populations eligible for inclusion in the review, it is not possible to pre - specify outcomes. All pre -specified outcomes measured in each eligible RCT or NRSI will be listed in the ' Characteristics of included studies ' tables; however, res ults will only be extracted for those outcomes identified as critical or important to the review. For each identified population , results for a maxim um of seven critical (or important ) outcomes will be reported in GRADE 'Summary of Findings ' tables and corresponding evidence statements (see Section 3.3.17 ). Outcome selection will occur after identificat ion of eligible studies using a pre -specified approach . To avoid introducing bias, outcomes will be prioritised by the NTWC, who will be provided with a list of conditions, outcome domains and outcome measurements (including measurement tools and time points) to prioritise. This list will be derived from the outcomes reported in studies identified for inclusion in the review , and, where available, core outcome set/s for a particular condition (identified by searching COMET [http://www.comet -initiative.org/ ]). Throughout the prioritisation exercise, the NTWC will remain blinded about the characteristics or results of included studies to prevent knowledge of study results or other characteristics (such as study design) from influencing decision -making . In determining the critical and important outcomes , the NTWC will be guided by GRADE (6), and focus on the relevance and validity of outcome measures . At this time, the NTWC will also identify outcomes for which evidence from NRSIs will be considered, in line with the rationale provided in Section 3.1.1 . Outcomes r eported at different timepoints will be grouped and considered as follows: short term, intermediate term, long term, or not specified. Determining whether something is considered short, intermediate or long term for a population will be guided by the publi shed evidence, the NTWC and Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 18 COMET. To avoid unit -of-analysis issues associated with repeated observations (see Section 3.3.9 ), data from a single time point will be selected for each outcome, as determined by the NTWC during outcome prioritisation. Where multiple timepoints are assessed as critical or important to decision making (e .g. short - and long - term remission in symptoms) separate outcomes will be specified fo r each timepoint. Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 19 3.2 Search methods for identification of studies 3.2.1 Electronic searches The literature search strategy (see Appendix A) was developed in Ovid (for Embase , MEDLINE , and Emcare ) based on the key element of research question (i.e. the intervention) . The search is not limited by population or outcome, but rather by study type ; with me thodological filters for identifying RCTs and NRSIs and exclusions for publication types developed and published previously (67). In developing the search strategy, we appraised and adapted the relevant search strategies provided in the 2015 review ; wit h recent SRs identified in the scoping report and studies suggested by the NTWC also reviewed to identify other potentially relevant concepts. Terms or concepts proven not suitable were removed and other terms added. No date, language or geographic limitations will be applied when conducting the search of English language databases . Non-English language databases will not be searched . The search strategy will be adapted to suit the required syntax for the following electronic bibliographic databases : Embase (via Ovid) MEDLINE (via Ovid) Emcare (via Ovid) - coverage of all nursing specialty areas PsycINFO (via Ovid) - cover age of behavioural science and mental health AMED (via Ovid ) - coverage of Allied and Complementary Medicine Cochrane Central Register of Contr olled Trials (via Cochrane Library) PEDro - coverage of physiotherapy CINAHL (via EBSCOHost ) - Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature SPORTDiscus (via EBSCOHost ) - coverage of exercise physiology, medicine, biomechanics, coaching, counsel ling, psychology, and sports medicine PubMed (limited to inprocess citations and citations not indexed in MEDLINE) - to retrieve citations not yet indexed in OVID Pan American Health Organization ( PAHO ) Virtual Health Library (VHL) - includ ing Lilacs (Health information from Latin America and the Caribbean countries ), PAHO IRIS (institutional repository for information sharing), and BRISA (Regional Base of Health Technology Assessment Reports of the Americas ) As the populations and/or outcomes for which NRSIs will be eligible will be specified by the NTWC after initial screening of RCTs (see Sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.4 ) the search strategy will be implemented in two phases. First, all eligible RCTs will be searched using the strategy outlined at Appendix A. Populations and/or outcomes eligible for inclusion of NRSIs will then be identified, and the search strategy at Appendix A will be augmented with population -specific search strings, to identify relevant NRSIs, with additional search terms approved by the NTWC prior to implementation. Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 20 3.2.2 Other sources Reference lists of key relevant articles will be checked to identify any additional studies not identified through searches of the primary databases. The public will also be invited by the Department to submit references for published research evidence (not examined in the 2015 Review) , however , any grey literature will be excluded. Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 21 3.3 Data collection and analysis Included studies will be critically appraised, appropriate data extracted into data extraction tables, and the results analysed and summarised into a ppropriate categories or sub groups according to identified populations and conditions and comparators . Summary of Findings tables will be developed for up to seven critical and important outcomes , guided by the GRADE framework. 3.3.1 Inclusion decision s Studies identified in the literature searches Title/abstract screening Citations (title/abstracts) retrieved by the literature searches will be imported into EndNote and duplicates removed. Citations will then be imported to Covidence (www.covidence.org), an online tool that streamlines the screening and data extraction stages of a systematic review. Each citation (titles and abstract) will be screen ed by one evidence reviewer who will discard ineligible studies (marked as irrelevant and tagg ed with a reason for exclusion) and retain those with relevant data or information (mar ked a s relevant or maybe) . Where there is uncertainty regarding relevance , a decision will be made through discussion with the lead reviewer , who will either decide to mark the citation as irrelevant or take it through to full text . Citations that are in a language other than English will be tagged and managed as described in the below under Studies published in languages other than English . Full text screening Full text articles identified for possible inclusion in the evidence synthesis will be retrieved and assessed for inclusion by one reviewer . A pre specified , hierarchical approach as outlined in Appendix B will be used to annotate reasons for exclusion , with t he results of the study selection process illustrated in a PRISMA diagram. Ineligible s tudies will be marked with a reason for exclusion and listed i n a table in the technical report under 'Characteristics of excluded studies '. Where there is uncertainty regarding inclusion, a decision will be made through discussion with the lead reviewer. The lead reviewer will also reinspect a random 20% sample of articles marked as excluded to ensure adherence to the a priori exclusion criteria and any differences will be resolved by discussion. If additional expertise or advice regarding the application of the PICO criteria is required, further follow up with the NTWC will occur ( noting that the NTWC will be presented with exce rpts from the publication relevant to the query while remaining blinded to the other identifying details such as study design, size, risk of bias , or results ). If a study does not contain the required PICO information for a decision to be made regarding eligibility, the information will be sought from the study's authors through an open -ended request . Trial registration numbers, author names, and study titles, locations and dates will be used to identify multiple reports arising from the same study. Eligible studies that are not available in English will be noted and managed as described in the below under Studies published in languages other than English . Evidence provided th rough the Depar tment's public call for evidence Potentially relevant primary studies identified by the NTWC, NTREAP, and other key stakeholders will be considered for inclusion if they satisfy the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1 above . Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 22 All of the submitted literature will be collated, tabulated , and c ross reference d with the evidence identified via literature searches as described in Section 3.3.1 . In-scope studies not identified in the literature search will be incorporated in to the evidence evaluation . A rationale for exclusion (as noted in Appendix B) will be provided for all studies considered out of scope (documented in a table within the technical report). Studies published in languages other than English Studies published in l anguages other than English will undergo title and abstract translation using Google translate (or an equivalent tool). If online translation does not facilitate understanding of the title and abstract, then these studies will be listed in a table as 'Stud ies unable to be translated or interpreted at the title/abstract stage' . Translated titles and abstracts will be screened to remove irrelevant citations, with articles excluded at title and abstract screen reported in the 'Results of the search' . Transla ted titles and abstracts will be reviewed and evaluated against the criteria for considering studies for inclusion in the review. Full text translation will not occur to determine eligibility. Studies assessed as potentially eligible for inclusion in the r eview will be recorded in a 'Studies Awaiting Classification' table. This information will also be reflected in the PRISMA flow diagram. The potential risk of language bias and its implications for the evidence evaluation will be discussed in relevant sect ions of the Evaluation Report (such as ' Overall completeness and applicability of evidence ' and ' Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews '). 3.3.2 Data collection process For each included primary study, one reviewer will extract data using a standard pretested data extraction and coding form (see Appendix D). Pre-testing will involve all reviewers, who will each data extract the required information from the same three primary studies specifically selected to cover the breadth of the PICO and anticipated study designs identified for inclusion in the review. The lead reviewer will inspect the forms to ensure the relevant data are extracted as planned and any necess ary revisions will be made to ensure consistency. All d ata extraction forms will be checked for completeness and accuracy by the lead reviewer. Where there is uncertainty or disagreement regarding inclu ded data , a decision will be made through discussion. 3.3.3 Requests for data Eligible primary studies not published in English , ongoing trials and studies published as conference abstracts with incomplete results will be identified for inclusion. S tudy authors will be contacted through an open -ended request for further information . If no results are available, the study will be noted as 'Ongoing ' or, if information on study eligibility is lacking, the study will be recorded as 'Studies Awaiting Classification ' and will not be included in the evidence appraisal . No attempts will be made to obtain or clarify data from published peer -reviewed studies . 3.3.4 Data items The following characteristics of included studies will be extracted: study design , year conducted , setting and location , participant characteristics (including demographics, comorbidities, etc. ), intervention and comparator characteristics (including number of treatment session s, frequency of Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 23 practice, program duration, cointerventions ), outcomes (including measurement meth od, timing, or severity) , and funding sources. 3.3.5 Missing data No imputation for missing data will be conducted. Studies wi th missing data will be included alongside other studies for that condition; either in the narrative (non -quantitative) synthesis of results or on forest plots showing the sample size . Implications of the missing data will be considered when interpreting the evidence and will be discussed under ' Overall completeness and applicability of evidence '. Investigations into missing data within a study ( e.g. a review of the clinical trial protocol) will be noted when assessing the risk of bias for that study (see Section 3.3.7 ). 3.3.6 Tools to assess risk of bias in individual studies The risk of bias of included studies will be assessed using the most appropriate risk of bias assessment tool according to the type of study as follows: Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool v2.0 (68, 69) ROBIN S-I: a tool for assessing risk of bias in nonrandomised studies of interventions (70) Randomised controlled trials The risk of bias of RCTs will be assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (68). This tool is made up five domains assessing bias arising from the randomisation process; bias due to deviations from intended interventions; bias due to missing outcome data; bias in measurement of the outcome; and bias in selection of the reported result. Each domain will be assessed for bias, which will be recorded as 'high', 'low', or ' some concerns '. An o verall risk of bias for each outcome in the RCT will be judged based on the following criteria: overall low risk of bias - low risk of bias for all key domains some concerns - at least one domain has some concerns raised, but none are found to be at high risk of bias overall high risk of bias - high risk of bia s for one or more key domains Nonrandomised studies interventional studies (NRSIs) Critical a ppraisal of NRSIs will be guided by the methods described by Cochrane (70) using the ROBINS -I tool. Potential confounders and cointerventions for a population identified for inclusion will be identified and agreed through discussion with the NT WC prior to assessment of the risk of bias. ROBINS -I evaluates the risk of bias observed in the following domains: confounding, selection of participants, classification of interventions, deviations from intended interventio ns, missing data, measurement of outcomes, and selective reporting . Each domain will be judged for risk of bias, which will be recorded as 'low', 'moderate', 'serious', 'critical', or 'no information provided'. The overall risk of bias judgement for a specific outcome will use the follow ing guide: overall low risk of bias - the study is comparable to a well -performed RCT and is judged to be a low risk of bias for ALL domains overall moderate risk of bias - the study appears to provide sound evidence for a nonrandomised study but cannot be considered comparable to a well -performed randomised trial. The study is judged to be a low or moderate risk of bias for ALL domains Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 24 overall serious risk of bias - the study has some important problems and is judged to be at serious risk of bias in at least ONE domain, but not a critical risk of bias in any domain overall critical risk of bias - the study is too problematic with regards to this domain to provide a ny useful evidence on the effectiveness of the intervention. The study is judged to be at critical risk of bias in at least ONE domain no information - there is no information on which to base a judgement about overall risk of bias. There is no clear indication that the study is at serious or critical risk of bias AND there is a lack of information in one or more key domains of bias Studies rated as at critical risk of bias in any domain will be excluded from the reporting of results, synthesis, and conclusion ; however, study details will be included under ' Characteristics of included studies '. 3.3.7 Risk of bias assessment process The risk of bias for each included study will be assessed by one reviewer. The lead reviewer will then check and confirm all assessments made. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion, with advice sought from a third reviewer if agreement cannot be reached. To ensure consiste ncy among reviewers, pre -testing of risk of bias assessments will be achieved by all reviewers completing assessments for three RCTs and three NRSIs (using RoBv2.0 and ROBINS -I, respectively). Studies will be selected to cover the breadth of the PICO and i ncluded study designs. The lead reviewer will inspect the forms to ensure consistency, and any differences will be resolved through discussion . For each outcome , we will report our judg ement of risk of bias ( e.g. low, moderate, high, critical, unclear) by domain and provide a rationale for the judg ement with supporting information. Overall risk of bias judg ements will be described in the 'Characteristics of included studies ' table. 3.3.8 Measures of effect Dichotomous data will be presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals and pvalues . Continuous data will be reported as mean difference (MD) (along with the standard deviation (SD) and number of participant s). Standardi sed mean difference (SMD) will be used when different scales are used to measure the same conceptual outcome (e.g. function ). To ensure that all the scales point in the same direction of effect, data from one set of studies will be adjusted before standardisation by multiplying the mean value by -1 to be consistent with the ot her set of studies. Time-to-event data will be presented as hazard ratios and, if analyses of covariance have been used to adjust for baseline measures, the adjusted effect estimates will also be recorded . To reduce effects of confounding, s ummary statist ics from NRSIs will be reported as adjusted effect estimates ( e.g. adjusted odds ratios (OR) from logistic regression or adjusted rate ratios from Poisson regression analyses ). The variables that have been used for adjustment will be recorded . As there are a broad range of populations eligible for inclusion in the review, it is not possible to pre - specify the minimal clinically important differences for each outcome. However, w here possible, the minimal clinically important difference will be sourced from published reports or will be guided by advice from the NTWC. Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 25 3.3.9 Unit-of-analysis issues No imputation for unit-of-analysis issues will be performed. While intervention -related c lustering is a possibility in this review, it is considered unlikely that included studies will have provided adequate details to enable clusters to be accounted for in their analyses. No adjustments will be made for intervention -related clustering using a statistical method. However, where such clusters are identified, this will be noted in the relevant part of the review along with discussion of the potential impacts of the clustering on the review findings. Cluster -randomi sed trial To avoid a unit -of-analysis error in a cluster -randomi sed trial we will extract and report effect estimates from analyses undertaken by the trial authors. Information regarding the approach used to account for the cluster design will be recorded. If the study authors have not p rovided information relating to the method of adjustment ( i.e. the estimate of the relative variability within and between clusters), the implications of the missing data will be considered when interpreting the evidence and will be discussed under ' Overal l completeness and applicability of evidence '. Crossover trial To avoid a unit -of-analysis error in a crossover trial, only data from the first period will be included in the analysis. Studies reporting paired analysis will be discussed separately, and t he potential impact of selective reporting will be discussed under ' Overall completeness and applicability of evidence '. Repeated observations To avoid a unit -of-analysis error in studies reporting results from more than one timepoint, results from a single timepoint will be selected for any given outcome , and only data from that timepoint will be presented in the analysis. The timepoint selected will be based on that determined to be critical or important for decision making as outlined in Section 3.1.4 . 3.3.10 Studies with more than two intervention groups If the included studies have multiple treatment groups, only single pairwise comparisons of the intervention with a comparator (i.e. ' control' or 'other') will be considered. If appropriate to combine like groups, we will combine to create a single pairwise comparison. The combining of summary statistics across groups will be as described in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook (71). 3.3.11 Quantitative synthesis Synthesis will only be undertaken for studies that compare Tai Chi with 'control'. Results data from studies comparing Tai Chi with 'other' interventions will be extracted and presente d in data tables but will not be synthesised further , except where requested by the NTWC. These data will be presented as an 'evidence inventory' to provide a snapshot of the available evidence comparing Tai Chi with 'other' interventions. The NTWC may req uest that data comparing Tai Chi with another active intervention be synthesised, where: 1) at least two studies compare the effect of Tai Chi with the same active comparator, and the comparator is sufficiently homogenous across studies to support synthesis, and 2) at least two of these studies are at low or moderate risk of bias, and Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 26 3) the comparator represents an accepted, evidence -based 'gold standard' of care for the population in question. Such cases will be identified by the NTWC through blinded discussions w ith the evidence reviewer at the data synthesis stage, or prior to provision of the first draft evaluation report. Data from RCTs Data synthesis from RCTs will be performed using RevMan 5.3 and forest plots presented . Within each comparison we will combine effect estimates across studies for each outcome using a random effects model to take into account expected differences between studies . Statistical h eterogeneity will be assessed by visually inspecting the overlap of confidence intervals on the forest plots, formally test ing for heterogeneity using the Chi2 test (using a significance level of =0.1), and quantify ing heterogeneity using the I2 statistic (72). Effect estimates will not be combined acro ss outcomes if analyses of covariance have been used to adjust for baseline measures, or for time -to-event data reported as hazard ratios. Data from NRSIs For those populations and/or outcomes for which NRSI s are included, data synthesis from NRSI s will be performed using RevMan 5.3 (where appropriate) and forest plots will be presented. Within each comparison we will combine effect estimates across studies for each outcome using a random effects model to take into account expected differences between stud ies. Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed by visually inspecting the overlap of confidence intervals on the forest plots, formally testing for heterogeneity using the Chi2 test (using a significance level of =0.1), and quantifying heterogeneity usin g the I2 statistic (72). Effect estimates will only be combined across outcomes if the included NRSIs are judged to be at low to moderate risk of bias (see Section 3.3.7 ) and are sufficiently homogenous to be combined. This means the PICO criteria of the NRSIs must be sufficiently similar and the study design features should be comparable. 3.3.12 Non-quantitative synthesis The evidence review will provide a structure d, narrative summary of the results for each condition identified , along with risk of bias assessments, and other intervention characteristics, in tables structured by compar ator ('control ', or 'other' interventi on), outcome domain , and study design (ordered and grouped by risk of bias, then study size). Where possible, a visual representation of the results of included studies will be presented in a forest plot (without a summary estimate) grouped by study design features and risk of bias . The narrative summary will include a brief description of the condition and studies identified (including study design, size, and population demographics). This will be followed by a summary of results grouped by comparator and outcome domain. Result from each study will be reported, with the range and magnitude of observed effects noted. For studies where the results are incompletely reported (e.g. no effect estimate is reported, but the direction of effect is reported along wi th a p value), we will report the available information. If the reported information allows for calculation of effect estimates or imputation of missing statistics ( e.g. SD), we will perform the calculations as described in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbo ok (71). Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 27 To describe an overall effect across multiple studies for each outcome (for studies comparing Tai Chi with control only) , we will describe the magnitude, range and distribution of obs erved effects across the studies using a simple vote count based on direction of effect ( e.g. X/Y studies reported an effect favouring the intervention for the outcome Z). Studies that are judged to be at low risk of bias and are powered to demonstrate an effect will take precedence over studies that are underpowered and or judged to be at moderate or high risk of bias ( i.e. will be called out and highlighted in the text). Any important differences in study size or design features that may influence the int erpretation of results will be considered and discussed in the text. Qualitative descriptors describing the size of the effect (small, large etc.) will be used only where appropriate and will be based on the smallest difference that patients perceive as b eneficial (or detrimental) for that outcome. 3.3.13 Risk of reporting bias across studies Given the size and breadth of this review, it is expected that a broad approach to data synthesis will transpire. This means, summary estimates will include an outcome domain ( e.g. pain) measured at a rough time point ( e.g. latest timepoint reported), using any instrument. This will increase the number of studies that will be eligible for inclusion in a summary estimate. As noted in Section 3.3.6 , the implications for missing data within studies will be considered when interpreting the evidence. Similarly, judgements regarding missing data across studies will be made based on available information ( e.g. 'Studies awaiting classification ') and discussed under ' Overall completeness and applicability of evidence ', noting that supplementary approaches for assessing bias due to missing studies (such as searching clinical tri al registers, grey literature, or other reports) will not be performed. If more than 10 RCTs are included for a particular PICO, f unnel plots (of effect estimates against their standard errors) will be generated in RevMan 5.3 in order to determine possibl e reporting biases. If, after visual inspection of the funnel plot there is evidence of asymmetry (suggesting small -study effects or missing results ), a brief statement about the potential impact on the overall conclusions of the evidence review will be in cluded under the relevant sections of the review (including the ' Overall completeness and applicability of evidence '). Other possible reasons for funnel plot asymmetry will also be considered at this time ( e.g. poor methodological quality, true heterogenei ty, chance) (73). No additional statistical analysis for testing for small -study effects will be conducted. 3.3.14 Addressing risk of bias All RCTs will be included in the review, regardless of judgements made regarding risk of bias. A description of the risk of bias of included studies in individual domains will be presented along with the effect estimate . To examine the impact of risk of bias, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted, with studies judged to be at high risk of bias to be removed from the analysis. The impact of this change will be noted and discussed under ' Quality of evidence '. NRSIs rated as being at critical risk of bias will not be in cluded in the reporting of results, synthesis, and conclusion. A brief statement about the potential impact on the overall conclusions of the evidence review will be included under the relevant sections of th e review (including the ' Overall completeness and applicability of evidence '). Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 28 3.3.15 Subgroup analyses We do not plan to undertake any subgroup analyses of subsets of participants within studies ; however, i f there is inconsistency between effect estimates , subg roup analysis will be used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity relating to the delivery of the intervention. Studies will be group ed according to intervention characteristics ( i.e. intensity, duration, mode of delivery, or who delivers) and a standard test for heterogeneity across the subgroups will be reported . 3.3.16 Certainty of the evidence Across each population , we will assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach (6). Evidence from RCTs and NRSIs (where included) will be evaluated separate ly and only evidence comparing Tai Chi with 'control' will be presented. The GRADE process provides a framework for determining the certainty of the evidence and is based on consideration of the following five factors : Risk of bias. Based on the summary a ssessment across studies for each outcome reported for a comparison (74). Inconsistency. Based on heterogeneity in the observed intervention effects across studies that suggests important differences in the effect of the intervention and wheth er this can be explained (75). Imprecision. Based on interpretation of the upper and lower confidence limits in relation to a minimal clinically important threshold (i.e. the confidence interval includes both appreciable benefit and harm); and whether the optimal information size has been reached ( i.e. the total number of patients meets the required sample size for a sufficiently powered individual study). In the absence of a published clinically important threshold a rough guide will be used ( i.e. a 25% relative risk reduction or increase) (76). Indirectness. Based on important differences between the review questions and the characteristics of included studies that may lead to important differences in the intervention effects (77). Publication bias. Based on the extent to which the evidence is available. Publication bias would be suspected when the evidence is limited to a small number of small trials (78). The certainty of evidence will be categorised as follows : High ( ): further research is very unlikely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect Moderate ( ): further research is likely to have an important impact in the confidence in the estimate of effect Low ( ): further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate Very low ( ): any estimate of effec t is very uncertain For each domain , a judgement will be made about whether there are 'serious ', 'very serious ' or 'no concerns ', resulting in an overall GRADE describing the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Footnotes will be used to record judgements made about downgrading (or upgrading) the evidence (see 3.3.17 ). Scoring of the certainty of the evidence will begin as 'high' for RCTs and NRSIs Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 29 (score=4) , which can be downgraded by -1 for each domain with serious concerns or -2 for very serious concerns (6, 79) . The certainty of evidence can also be upgraded in certain circumstances. Factors that will be considered for upgrading the evidence include the following: Large magnitude of an effect. When large or very large effect estimates are observed, and there is m ore confidence in the results (sufficient number of events to be precise). Dose -response gradient. When there is a clear relation between outcome and increasing exposure levels . Effect of plausible residual confounding. If there are clear factors that have likely led to an under -estimate of the true effect such as unmeasured or unknown determinants in the adjusted analysis that are likely to be distributed unequally between intervention and control groups (6). 3.3.17 'Summary of findings ' table s For each population, findings for the critical and impo rtant outcomes (see Section 3.1.4 ), will be reported in summary of findings tables that will be prepared using the GRADEpro GDT software (www.gradepro.org ). The findings from RCTs and NR SIs will be presented separately. Estimates of treatment effects for each outcome will be reported as absolute and relative risks (or SMD) . In the absence of quantitative data, a narrative synthesis will be provided (see Section 3.3.12 ). All critical and important outcomes will be reported, regardless of whether the findings demonstrate a clinically meaningful change. The summary of findings tables will provide a summ ary of each of the included outcomes and the certainty of evidence rating for each outcome in a quick and accessible format (6). As part of the summary of findings table, an evidence statement pertaining to each outcome will be included. This statement will be guided by the following format: The practi ce of Tai Chi in [population] [is suggested to, may, results] in [little to no effect, reduce, increase, promote etc.] on [outcome] compared with [ control ]. A technical report that presents, in detail, the evidence base for each research question by outcome will be developed and will include the following information: the methodology used to identify the evidence base (documented systematic literature search, inclusion and exclusion criteria described ) the characteristics of included studies (data extraction and risk of bias forms ) detailed results, presented by outcome , which will contain comprehensive information about the evidence assessment Research protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI 30 Contributions of authors MJ wrote and developed t he draft Research Protocol with contributions in writing sections, providing comment and proofreading final drafts from SA, SB, AM, and AS.

Bias due to deviations from intended interventions High risk Some concerns Low risk Describe the method used to conceal t reatment allocation : were participants aware of their assigned intervention during the trial ? were carers and people delivering the interventions were aware of participants' assigned intervention during the trial ? consider the potential effect of deviations due to assignment and deviations due to adherence Bias due to missing outcome data High risk Some concerns Low risk Describe the completeness of outcome data for each primary/secondary outcome, including whether data for this outcome were available for all, or nearly all, participants randomi sed; (if applicable) there was evidence that the result was not biased by missing outcome d ata; (if applicable) missingness in the outcome was likely to depend on its true value (e.g. the proportions of missing outcome data, or reasons for missing outcome data, differ between intervention groups). Bias in measurement of the outcome High risk Some concerns Low risk Describe whether: the method of measuring the outcome was inappropriate; measurement or ascertainment of the outcome could have differed between intervention groups; outcome assessors were aware of the intervention received by study pa rticipants; (if applicable) assessment of the outcome was likely to have been influenced by knowledge of intervention received. Bias in selection of the reported result High risk Some concerns Low risk Describe whether: the trial was analysed in accordance with a pre -specified plan that was finali sed before unblinded outcome data were available for analysis; the numerical result being assessed is likely to have been selected, on the basis of the results, from multiple outcome measurements within t he outcome domain; the numerical result being assessed is likely to have been selected, on the basis of the results, from multiple analyses of the data.
