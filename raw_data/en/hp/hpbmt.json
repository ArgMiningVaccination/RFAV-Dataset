President CEO: Isao Teshirogi, Ph.D.; hereafter \"Shionogi\") announced that Shionogi presented results from the Japanese Phase 2/ 3 clinical trial of S -268019, a recombinant protein- based vaccine for COVID -19, caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS -CoV -2), at the 96th Meeting of The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases . This clinical trial was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of S -268019 in Japanese adults ( including na\u00efve*1 subjects, vaccinated subjects*2, and subjects with history of infection*3) and elderly individuals . This is an open label t rial including more than 3,000 patients. The evaluation period is 28 days after the second inoculation (Day 57), and the observation period is one year after the second inoculation. * 1 Subjects with no history of SARS -CoV -2 infection and SARS -CoV -2 vaccination * 2 Subjects with a history of SARS -CoV -2 vaccination with or without a history of SARS -CoV -2 infection * 3 Subjects with a history of SARS -CoV -2 infection and no history of SARS -CoV -2 vaccination The results can be summarized as follows: Safety At the time of the interim analysis (Day 57 assessment completed for all subjects ), solicited treatment -related adverse events (TRAEs)1 after inoculation w ere observed in many subjects, but no serious safety concerns were found, and tolerability was confirmed. There was no significant difference in the incidence of solicited TRAEs among 2,957 na\u00efve adult , 76 vaccinated adults , and 68 with a history of i nfection . 118 na \u00efve elderly subjects were enrolled with a rate of solicited TRAE s lower than in other na\u00efve adult s. 1 TRAEs that occurred up to 7 days after inoculation of the investigational drug: solicited systemic TRAEs (fever, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, headache, malaise, muscle pain), solicited local TRAEs (pain , erythema/redness, inoculation pain, swelling at the injection site) ) Immunogenicity Immunogenicity after S -268019 vaccination was confirmed in adults (304 n a\u00efve, 76 vaccinat ed, 68 with history of i nfection) and 115 na\u00efve elderly. In na\u00efve adults , the geometric mean antibody titer (GMT) of SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibod ies 14 days after the second inoculation of S -268019 was confirmed to be significantly higher than the GMT in recover ed patient serum. In na\u00efve elderly, an increase in GMT of SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody titer was confirmed 14 days after the second inoculation of S -268019. In vaccinated subjects and those with a history of infection, an increase in GMT of SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody titer was confirmed after the first inoculation of S-268019. The seroresponse rate of SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody titer 2 28 days inoculation na\u00efve adult s: 95.9%, vaccinat ed adults : 100%, subjects with a history of infection : 97.0%, n a\u00efve elderly: 85.5% 2 Percentage of subjects whose SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody titer was 4 times or more that of the baseline. Press Release 2/4 Shionogi has been conducting five pivotal clinical trials of S -268019, including this trial. Starting in February 2022, we have engaged in prior consultations with the Pharmaceuticals a nd Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in preparation for the approval application in Japan. We will continue to consult closely with the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, PMDA and other organizations based on the results from these pivotal clinical trials. Shionogi is committed to \"Protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases\" as our key focus. We are working towards total care for infectious diseases, through building awareness, epidemiological surveillance, prevention, diagnosis, and addressing exacerbations, as well as treating the infection itself. As SARS -CoV -2 continues to have a major impact on people's lives and to represent a global threat, we will seek to contribute to re -establishing the safety and security of s ociety by developing, delivering, and producing, in Japan, a vaccine for COVID -19.

For more information about this clinical trial, please refer to jRCT No.:2031210269 . Subject registration for this trial has been completed. In the evaluation up to 28 days of two doses of the vaccine, confirmed tolerability and safety, neutralizing antibody titer equal to or higher than that of convalescent serum. About a Japanese Phase 2/3 clinical trial2 The Phase 2/3 clinical trial is an open -label study to evaluate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of s-268019 in 3,100 adults and elderly people. For more information about this clinical trial, please refer to jRCT No.: 2031210383 . Subject registration for this trial has been completed. About a Japanese Phase 2/3 additional dose clinical trial3 This clinical trial is a randomized, active controlled, double -blind trial. In this trial, the efficacy and safety of an additional dose of COMIRNATY or S -268019 in 200 adults, 6 months or more after receiving a primary series of COMIRNATY , will be compared.
