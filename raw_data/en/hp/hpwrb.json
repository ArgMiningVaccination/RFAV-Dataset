The plant is scientifically known by the name of Protium Heptaphyllum, also commonly known as Breu Branco. Like Frankincense and Palo Santo, it belongs to the fragrant species of the Burseraceae family. As well as having a scent akin to that of Frankincense, yet fresher with a slight citrus fragrance, its chemical composition is also very similar, as are some of its properties.

There are quite a few species of Proteum which produce resins and these other trees' resins are used for incense too. In fact, Breu Claro, Breu Branco, and Copal Blanco, other resin incenses, all come from trees in the Burseraceae family. And if this family ever had a reunion, Palo Santo, Frankincense and Myrrh trees would be in attendance. - Breu's resin has some of the same therapeutic and aromatic properties as its cousins since it belongs to the same botanical family. Popularly, the tree is known as Breu, but if there is confusion as to who's who at that family reunion, it would be with good cause. This tree is also known as Alm\u00e9cega, Amesla, Alm\u00e9cega Brava, Breuzinho, Witch Herb, White Pitch of the Field, Mescla, Brazilian Myrrh, and a few others.

These two were highly prized substances and required in some religious rites. Across the ocean in the New Americas, especially Meso and South America, it was the cousin counterparts, Breu and Copal, which were discovered and used. Both continue to be used in religious and sacred ceremonies today. - Aromatic Properties of Breu Branco Breu Branco resin has a fresh, clean, purifying scent with hints of lemon and pine.

The tree gives off an aromatic fragrance, has a dark red bark, and grows to 10 to 20 meters in height and can be 50 to 60 centimeters in diameter at the base. When a cut is made in the trunk the resin exudes, which has a white-green color and a very pleasant, fragrant aroma. When the resin comes in contact with air, it hardens. The resin is collected from the trunk and the ground manually, all year round, but especially in the summer. After it is collected it must be dried in the shade and then stored in sacks made of fibers, such as jute. Cuts on a tree to extract the resin can be first made when the tree is 8 to 10 years old. To harvest the resin of this species sustainably, it is recommended that each tree receives only 2 to 3 cuts per year. Yields vary according to the process of extraction. The process of hydrodistillation yields 11% resin whereas steam distillation yields approximately 2.5% resin.
