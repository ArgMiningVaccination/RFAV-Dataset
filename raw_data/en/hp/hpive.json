Executive Summary: 1. Summary Paragraph This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) supports public health infrastructure, data and partnerships to identify and respond to existing and emerging injury threats with data-driven public health actions. These actions are intended to increase protective factors and reduce risk factors using the best available evidence for injuries and death. Such an approach includes engaging in robust state-based data and surveillance, strengthening strategic collaborations and partnerships, and conducting assessment and evaluation. The overall goal of this approach is to inform public health action for injury prevention. An enhanced funding component is available for recipients to implement and evaluate prevention strategies while incorporating novel surveillance activities, with the goal of contributing practice-based evidence to strengthen the overall evidence base for injury prevention. While all recipients will focus their strategic efforts on prevention of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), transportation safety, and traumatic brain injury, recipients are encouraged to examine their data and use up to 25% of their award to address identified priority injury topics of local concern (e.g. drowning, older adult falls, suicide or other recipient-identified priority topics).

Funding Opportunity Description Page 4 of 62 1. Background a. Overview CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) is committed to collaborating with its partners to promote public health action to reduce unintentional injuries, self-directed injuries, and death, by connecting data, science, and action. Such an approach includes engaging in robust state-based data and surveillance, strengthening strategic collaborations and partnerships, conducting assessment and evaluation, and monitoring the effectiveness of State Injury Prevention Program (SIPP) activities. Injuries are the leading cause of death for Americans age 1 to 44, and a leading cause of disability for all ages, regardless of sex, race and ethnicity, or socioeconomic status [1]. Each year, more than 28 million people suffer non-fatal injuries requiring emergency department (ED) visits [2]. More than 240,000 individuals in the United States die each year as a result of injuries. Most events that result in injury and/or death could be prevented if evidence-based public health strategies, practices, and policies were used throughout the nation. This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) supports public health infrastructure, data and partnerships to identify and respond to existing and emerging injury threats with data-driven public health actions. This NOFO includes a BASE and ENHANCED option: implementation and enhanced evaluation with optional novel surveillance. BASE: Support to states to strengthen their injury prevention programs and policies and demonstrate impact in the reduction of risk factors for adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), transportation safety, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Strategies that address injury prevention through the lens of shared risk and protective factors are encouraged to promote maximum impact of limited resources. By concentrating efforts in three priority injury prevention areas and demonstrating and sustaining general capacity in the three priority focus areas, states will be better able to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. To allow for some flexibility, this announcement includes an option that 25% of the funding may be used to address identified priority injury topics of local concern. ENHANCED: Support to states to increase implementation of public health actions to prevent injury in disproportionately-affected communities. As such, the purpose of the enhanced component is to strengthen the evidence base for injury prevention, supportive of sustaining advancement and improvement in injury prevention practices and outcomes. State injury prevention programs should develop enhanced methods and an evaluation plan for program or policy interventions. In support of implementation and enhanced evaluation, states have the novel surveillance option to identify and/or develop advanced analytic data science methods to effectively advance the use of new and existing sources of data. The result of this work should be sustained advancement and improvement in injury prevention practices and outcomes. [1]Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (n.d.).

Other National Public Health Priorities and Strategies This funding opportunity supports the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) Strategic Plan (Strategic Objective 3.2: Safeguard the public against preventable injuries and violence or their results ). More information about HHS's Strategic Plan is available here: https://www.hhs.gov/about/strategic-plan/strategic-goal-3/index.html e. Relevant Work This funding opportunity builds upon ongoing efforts since 1999 to 1) decrease injury and violence related morbidity and mortality and 2) increase sustainability of injury prevention programs and practices. This funding opportunity builds upon the following past NOFOs: Core State Violence and Injury Prevention Program - CORE SVIPP (CDC-RFA-CE16- 1602) - This funding helped states implement, evaluate and disseminate strategies that address the most pressing injury and violence issues including: child abuse and neglect, traumatic brain injury, motor vehicle crash injury and death, and intimate partner/sexual violence. https://www.cdc.gov/injury/stateprograms/index.html Core Violence and Injury Prevention Program - CORE VIPP (CDC-RFA-CE11-1101) - This funding helped strengthen state capacity to collect and use data to understand local injury issues and challenges, plan injury prevention and control efforts, and carry out and evaluate life-saving interventions to protect their residents. https://www.cdc.gov/injury/stateprograms/svipp_summary.html 2.

The recipients' proposed short-term and mid-term outcomes will be presented in their application. Measures for these will be finalized post-award in consultation with CDC. iii. Strategies and Activities As depicted in the logic model, this NOFO includes three overarching strategies: 1) Engage in robust data/surveillance for public health action; 2) Strengthen strategic collaborations and partnerships for public health action; and 3) Conduct assessment and evaluation for public health action. The three strategies are linked by a continuous quality improvement approach and a social determinants of health lens. Topical areas of focus for the three strategies include prevention of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), transportation safety, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recipients will be allowed to utilize up to 25% of their budget to address an additional topic area of site-specific priority. Examples of relevant data-driven public health actions include but are not limited to: Identify populations either experiencing disproportionate impact of injuries or whom are at disproportionately higher risk for injuries Respond to outbreaks, clusters, and emerging injury threats Facilitate strategic collaborations and partnerships across a wide range of multi-sectoral partners Use data to examine the intersections and relationships between injuries and other public health issues Use data to guide selection of interventions to address identified injury prevention issues Identify, reduce, and prevent injury risks and hazards Educate policy makers about public health approaches to injury prevention Inform policy makers, communities, and/or other stakeholders about potential injury health risks and solutions Disseminate of the best available evidence around successful strategies for injury prevention Applicants should consult with implementation partners in selecting activities, with an emphasis on selecting approaches within each of the three overarching strategies that have a science-based approach to prevent injury. Applicants may apply for additional enhanced funding for implementation and enhanced evaluation with optional novel surveillance, as described below. Recipients of this enhanced funding will be required to achieve all the BASE level deliverables. BASE STRATEGIES Page 9 of 62 To achieve the purpose of the BASE component, recipients will be responsible for the activities below for each of the three overarching strategies listed in the logic model. Applicants are expected to prioritize activities under all three strategies for populations who are disproportionately-affected by adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), transportation safety, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). This may result in three disproportionately-affected populations of interest: one for ACES activities, one for transportation safety activities and one for TBI activities. Applicants funded for CDC-RFA-CE20-2006 (Preventing Adverse Childhood Experiences: Data to Action) should ensure that proposed ACES activities under Core SIPP align with, but do not duplicate, approved work plans for CDC-RFA-CE20-2006. While not required, applicants are also encouraged to examine their data and utilize up to 25% of their proposed budget within the BASE component to address identified injury topics of local concern and/or identified as an emergent threat (e.g. drowning, older adult falls, or suicide). Applicants not currently funded under CDC-RFA-CE19-1906 (Emergency Department Surveillance of Nonfatal Suicide-Related Outcomes), and/or CDC-RFA-CE20-2001 (Comprehensive Suicide Prevention) may choose to focus on these topics. If applicants are awarded under those NOFOs and choose to propose up to 25% flexibility on these topics, proposed activities a) must still align with the 3 main strategies detailed below under Core SIPP; and b) must not duplicate their proposed work plans under the awarded NOFOs referenced above. Information about each injury topic area, as well as potential activities and required activities for Year 1 and beyond are explained below. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). ACEs are preventable, potentially traumatic events that occur during childhood (0-17 years) such as neglect, experiencing or witnessing violence, and having a family member attempt or die by suicide[1],[2]. Also included are aspects of a child's environment that can undermine their sense of safety, stability, and bonding, such as growing up in a household with substance use, mental health problems, or instability due to parental separation or incarceration of a parent, sibling or other member of the household.[1],[2]. These examples do not comprise an exhaustive list of childhood adversity, as there are other traumatic experiences that could impact health and wellbeing. Additional information is available at https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/aces. ACEs often occur together, can result in toxic stress, and are associated with a wide range of adverse behavioral, health, and social outcomes, including substance use, depression, overweight/obesity, lower education and earnings potential, and chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer (see CDC Vital Signs on ACEs, November 2019). ACEs are preventable. A CDC-developed resource, Preventing Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs): Leveraging the Best Available Evidence , can help states and communities use the best available evidence to prevent ACEs from happening in the first place, as well as lessen harms when ACEs do occur. This resource features six strategies drawn from the CDC Technical Packages to Prevent Violence . Transportation Safety. Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death in the United States, resulting in approximately 38,000 deaths and over 3 million nonfatal injuries every year. The financial impact of motor vehicle crashes is also substantial. In 2018, motor vehicle crash deaths resulted in approximately $55 billion in medical and work loss costs. [3]Fortunately, many effective strategies for preventing motor vehicle crashes are known. The Community Guide and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Countermeasures that work: A highway safety countermeasures guide for State Highway Safety Offices both provide comprehensive Page 10 of 62 information about the science and evidence behind what strategies work, as well as strategies that do not work or need more research. Although much is known about strategies that can prevent motor vehicle crash deaths and injuries, many of these proven strategies are not widely implemented across the United States. For example, publicized sobriety checkpoints are effective for reducing alcohol-impaired driving, but they are only permitted in 38 U.S. states and D.C. CDC's Motor Vehicle Prioritizing Interventions and Cost Calculator for States (MV PICCS) can help states to prioritize and select from 14 effective interventions and determine how many lives could be saved, injuries could be prevented, and costs could be averted if certain interventions were to be implemented. Important gaps in data and research also exist. For example, the prevalence of drug- and polysubstance-impaired driving and the contribution of drugs to motor vehicle crashes is not well understood [4]. Standardized toxicology testing for fatal crashes and for impaired driving arrests would provide important data about the role that these substances play in motor vehicle crashes. Also, comprehensive data about information before, during, and after a crash are sometimes lacking, especially for nonfatal motor vehicle crash injuries. Data from police reports are often not connected to hospital data and other data sources. CDC's Linking Information for Nonfatal Crash Surveillance (LINCS) Guide can help states establish or improve existing data linkage programs to get the full picture of motor vehicle crashes and therefore provide important information for prevention. Traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is a major cause of death and disability in the United States. From 2006 to 2014, the number of TBI-related ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths increased by 53%. In 2014, an average of 155 people in the United States died each day from injuries that include a TBI[5]. Those who survive a TBI can face effects that last a few days, or the rest of their lives. Effects of TBI can include impairments related to thinking or memory, movement, sensation (e.g., vision or hearing), or emotional functioning (e.g., personality changes, depression). These issues not only affect individuals but also can have lasting effects on families and communities. The leading causes of TBI include falls; being struck by or against an object; motor vehicle crashes; and suicide. Data has shown the following: In 2014, falls were the leading cause of TBI-related ED visits. Falls accounted for almost half (48%) of all TBI-related ED visits. Falls disproportionately affect children and older adults, with almost half (49%) of TBI-related ED visits among children 0 to 17 years and four in five (81%) for older adults aged 65 years and older. Being struck by or against an object was the second leading cause of TBI-related ED visits, accounting for about 17% of all TBI-related ED visits in the United States in 2014. Over 1 in 4 (28%) TBI-related ED visits in children less than 17 years of age or less were caused by being struck by or against an object. Falls and motor vehicle crashes were the first and second leading causes of all TBI- related hospitalizations (52% and 20%, respectively). 39% of all TBI-related deaths were categorized as suicide in 2015-2017 [6].

Strategy 1: Engage in Robust Data/Surveillance for Public Health Action: Recipients will work to build or enhance injury surveillance systems to increase understanding of injury burden and related risk and protective factors and identify emerging injury threats. Recipients should focus on surveillance activities for both the state level and for disproportionately-affected populations. In turn, injury surveillance data should inform the approach to public health actions taken under this and subsequent strategies within this NOFO. Recipients will be responsible for submission of annual injury indicators. Applicants may be at varying levels of capacity for data/surveillance activities. Applicant should propose activities for each element (below) as appropriate for their current capacity. In addition, this strategy will be engaged in and informed by the CQI process for the duration of funding. Activities should be iterative and build on one another over the course of the period of performance. Identify data sources for surveillance of emerging injury topics of interest and disproportionately-affected populations Analyze data and produce surveillance products for topics of interest and disproportionately-affected populations Translate and disseminate products to community stakeholders and other partners to drive public health action Participate in a national learning community for robust injury data and surveillance methods (e.g. Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) general injury epidemiology workgroup or similar). Example injury topic area-focused activities for consideration under this strategy may include: ACEs: Identify and use community-level data sources to create reports to inform: 1) partner-led community-level interventions; 2) Use of established syndromic surveillance for monitoring of specific ACES (e.g. CDC Suspected and Confirmed Child Abuse and Neglect, Intimate Partner Violence) 3) Use of ACES questions in Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) or other surveillance systems to inform future data products. Page 12 of 62 TBI: Use surveillance activities to identify differential rates of TBI-related morbidity, mortality, or risk factors in racial and ethnic minority groups, rural communities, and/or people who are medically underserved to better target prevention efforts. Transportation Safety: Identify and use data sources to create occupant injury reports for use by stakeholders. Examples of general data and surveillance activities that could be considered under this strategy include: Linking data (e.g. use health IT data and other linked data sets for surveillance/prevention efforts for injury prevention). Utilizing child death review processes to collect additional data around death circumstances. Partnering to develop surveillance indicators, special emphasis reports, syndromic surveillance case definitions, and other surveillance methodology activities that could be standardized and used across jurisdictions. Year 1 activities include: Collecting baseline health impact measures (e.g. morbidity and mortality data) for injury topic areas of focus and identify disproportionately-affected populations. Developing plan for data-driven public health action. The plan should address the applicant's approach to implementing the required activities for this strategy. Annual activities include: Completion and submission of injury indicator data and special emphasis reports to CDC o Applicants must have access and ability to receive state-level mortality and hospitalization data on an annual basis to complete this activity. Disseminating surveillance and evaluation information collected, to include Data Quality and Impact: o Data Use and Impact - Recipients are required to demonstrate the use and impact of both general state-level surveillance data and data focused on disproportionally-affected populations. This may be accomplished by submitting state data reports, topic specific data reports, data use summary statements, and various other reports that show the use and impact of surveillance data at multiple levels. o Surveillance Data for Strategic Partnership and Assessment and Evaluation Purposes - Recipients are expected to use surveillance data to identify disproportionately affected populations and to inform strategic collaboration and partnership (Strategy 2) and assessment and evaluation (Strategy 3) activities. o Participate regularly in a national learning community for robust injury data and surveillance methods. Recipients will be expected to participate in national learning communities for robust injury data and surveillance methods (e.g. Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) workgroups or other national learning communities). Page 13 of 62 Strategy 2: Strengthen Strategic Collaborations and Partnerships for Public Health Action Recipients are expected to pursue strategic collaborations and partnerships to drive subsequent public health actions and achieve impact. Applicants should have an existing multi-disciplinary public/private collaborative group, representing all CDC funded Injury and Violence Prevention (IVP) programs in their jurisdiction, which is focused on identification and implementation of injury prevention strategies (e.g. an Injury Community Implementation Group [ICIG]). For this strategy, applicants should utilize existing partnerships and collaborative structures as a base for subsequent activity. Creative collaborations with both traditional and non-traditional public health partners that are multi-sectoral and cross-cutting in nature are highly encouraged. Identified collaborations should be strategically pursued for achieving public health action. In addition, this strategy is to be engaged in and informed by the CQI process for the duration of funding. Whenever possible, applicants should convene and solidify cross-cutting and multi-sectoral partnerships to collaboratively identify high-impact, upstream shared risk and protective factors for injury topics of interest. Focusing partnership and collaboration conversations around identifying possible leverage points can be very helpful in driving upstream prevention. Shared learning and peer-to-peer support from similar recipient injury prevention programs is a critical element to sharing of programmatic successes and best practices. Recipients are expected to participate in regional or national networking groups, such as regional network sub- groups supported by national IVP non-profit groups. Example injury topic area-focused activities for consideration under this strategy include: Identify and build relationships with key partners (traditional and non-traditional) that are multi-sectoral and cross-cutting that can be sustained across priority topic areas, to include ACEs, Transportation Safety, and TBI. Identify, engage, and collaborate with partners who have expertise and reach into populations disproportionately-affected by ACEs, Transportation Safety, and/or TBI- related injuries to reduce injury-related health disparities. Leverage partnerships to collaboratively determine appropriate data-driven public health actions to prevent ACEs, Transportations Safety, and/or TBI-related injuries. Utilize partnerships to move actionable data from surveillance, assessment, and evaluation activities to inform public health action (e.g. collaboration with local YRBS administrators to include ACES questions). Participate in regional or national networking groups. Year 1 activities include: Identify and build relationships with key partners (traditional and non-traditional) that are multi-sectoral and cross-cutting that can be sustained across priorities. Utilize partnerships to move actionable data from surveillance, assessment, and evaluation activities to inform public health action. Annual activities include: Page 14 of 62 Regularly participate in regional or national networking group. Recipients will be expected to participate in regional and national peer networking groups such as the Regional Network convening groups. Strategy 3: Conduct Assessment and Evaluation for Public Health Action Assessment and evaluation are Core SIPP functional capacities that integrate and inform BASE strategies 1 and 2 to advance data-driven public health action to prevent injury. Recipients are expected to assess factors influencing the disproportionate impact of injury across the state population. They are also expected to conduct CQI-focused evaluation activities across strategies. Applicants may choose to propose activities within one of the following three categories for year 1, with the understanding that as one element is completed, they will advance to the next. These three elements are: Conduct assessments to identify unique risk and protective factors that impact disproportionately-affected populations Conduct assessments to identify needs in disproportionately-affected populations Utilize assessment findings to identify appropriate evidence-informed strategies to prevent injury in disproportionately-affected populations Recipients are expected to develop and implement an integrated CQI approach for the duration of program funding that enables them to: Evaluate activities undertaken to inform data-driven decision-making and ongoing programmatic improvement Recipients will report on assessment and evaluation activities as part of annual progress reporting. A detailed evaluation plan is not required in support of this application; however, applicants are expected to describe their capacity and general approach to accomplish Strategy 3 activities. Example activities for consideration under this strategy: Year 1: Utilize Strategy 1 findings related to statewide injury burden and disproportionately- affected populations to develop population-specific assessment(s) to identify risk factors, protective factors, and needs related to injury prevention topics (ACEs, TBI, Transportation Safety, and [optional] additional topic of site-specific importance). Assess partnerships to determine if additional partners are needed to help advance work related to risk or protective factors or needs related to injury prevention topics of interest (ACEs, TBI, Transportation Safety, and [optional] additional topic of site-specific importance). Utilize surveillance and assessment findings to identify appropriate evidence-informed strategies to prevent injury in disproportionately-affected populations for injury prevention topics (ACEs, TBI, Transportation Safety, and [optional] additional topic of site-specific importance). Page 15 of 62 See the table below for examples of strategy-specific CQI activities that ensure progress under one strategy is leveraged to advance other strategies. BASE Strategies EXAMPLE CQI Activities 1. Engage in Robust Data/ Surveillance Assess injury surveillance system performance attributes (simplicity, flexibility, data quality, acceptability, sensitivity, predictive value positive, representativeness, timeliness, stability). https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5013a1.htm Develop a feedback loop to evaluate surveillance processes and products for utility in driving public health action in recipient and partner organizations. Track the use of surveillance products in data-driven public health action in recipient and partner organizations. 2. Strengthen Strategic Collaborations & Partnerships Assess partnerships according to state injury burden to determine if the necessary partnerships are in place to advance injury prevention in disproportionately-affected populations. Evaluate communications with partners. Determine if communication is overly focused on one-way dissemination or takes an integrated approach where collaborative learning shapes injury prevention activities. Develop a feedback loop to evaluate how data are used to inform public health actions under this strategy in recipient and partner organizations. 3. Conduct Assessment & Evaluation Assess risk and protective factors unique to disproportionately- affected populations. Use these factors to identify gaps in injury prevention activities and to inform future approaches and partnerships. Evaluate the use of data for decision making within injury prevention leadership and partnership groups. Evaluate the use of data to inform public health actions. Identify key activities for inclusion in CQI processes. Identify and track barriers, challenges, and solutions over time as they influence recipient and partner abilities to implement public health actions. Annually : Implement CQI-focused evaluation activities to inform data-driven decision-making and programmatic improvement. Report annually on assessment and evaluation activities to CDC and partners and use the information for programmatic decisions and continuous program improvement. Page 16 of 62 Engage regularly with CDC evaluation staff for technical assistance related to assessment and CQI activities. BASE recipients will be included in a CDC-led assessment of economic costs and resources employed to carry out CORE SIPP activities. This analysis will measure non-paid resources employed and the magnitude of additional resources leveraged, in addition to funding provided under this NOFO, for recipients, and examine the factors that facilitate success in leveraging. Reporting for this analysis will take place through submission of Annual Progress Report Data and will be supported by provision of tracking tools. Recipients may have site-specific evaluation questions they wish to pursue in addition to those required under Strategy 3. CDC encourages this and will provide evaluation-related technical assistance to BASE recipients who choose to conduct additional evaluation activities of site- specific importance. All recipients must: Annually : Participate with CDC-appointed technical and evaluation advisors to conduct program and policy evaluation activities, including but not limited to the submission of annual progress reports using the Partners Portal. Participate in monthly calls with CDC-appointed project officer, evaluation officer, and appropriate technical advisors. Participate in peer-to-peer learning opportunities where participants share project status, successes, challenges, and engage in peer support. Attend annual recipient meetings. OPTIONAL ENHANCED COMPONENT In addition to the BASE Component, applicants may apply for the Core SIPP Enhanced Component. Applicants must be approved and funded for the BASE Component to be considered for the Enhanced Component funding. Enhanced Component proposals should focus on implementation and evaluation of exploratory and/or pilot projects or adaptations to ongoing projects (e.g., adapting an evidence-based intervention for challenges unique to a disproportionately-affected population). Enhanced funding is to be used to strengthen the evidence base for injury prevention through rigorous evaluation, innovative surveillance methods, or improved understanding of the impact of injury prevention programming on incidence. Eligible injury prevention topic areas include ACEs, Transportation Safety, and/or TBI and should focus on one or more disproportionately-affected populations within the context of statewide injury burden. Functional capacities, activities, and partnerships funded under BASE may also support the ENHANCED component; however, work proposed under the ENHANCED component will significantly increase the BASE scope of work and justify additional funds. ENHANCED component recipients are expected to produce a minimum of one peer-reviewed journal article as part of their overall dissemination plan. In addition to the Implementation and Enhanced Page 17 of 62 Evaluation Component, recipients have the option of conducting work under the Novel Surveillance Option to advance analytic methods, employ data linkage for non-traditional data sources, or other innovative surveillance approaches to strengthen their enhanced work. When funded, recipients are expected to work in partnership with their assigned CDC Project Officer and Evaluation Officer to finalize their project and evaluation plans, and throughout implementation for the duration of the funding cycle. Specialized technical assistance will be available from CDC subject matter experts under the ENHANCED component. Required activities descriptions for the ENHANCED component are below: IMPLEMENTATION and ENHANCED EVALUATION Support and/or pilot implementation of public health interventions to prevent injury in disproportionately-affected populations within the context of statewide injury burden (this may include a shared risk and shared protective factor approach). Develop and implement an enhanced evaluation plan for program and/or policy interventions. Develop and implement an evaluation dissemination plan. NOVEL SURVEILLANCE OPTION Identify and develop advanced analytic data science methods to effectively advance the use of new and existing sources of data in support of BASE-funded activities and/or the Implementation and Enhanced Evaluation project. The following are examples of appropriate evaluation projects that can be considered across the topic areas for this component. While applicants are free to propose their own projects, proposed projects should be directly related back to one of the three topic areas and result in at least one peer-reviewed journal article. Example Implementation and Enhanced Evaluation activities related to ACEs, Transportation Safety, and/or TBI for consideration are listed here. Applicants may also propose alternative projects of site-specific importance under this component. All enhanced projects are to result in at least one peer-reviewed publication to advance the evidence base for injury prevention. ACES - o Identify ACEs prevention strategies and approaches from CDC's Preventing Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs): Leveraging the Best Available Evidence technical package that are appropriate for adaptation, implementation, and evaluation within one or more disproportionately-affected populations; partnering with Essentials for Childhood, PACE or other local efforts to implement and evaluate one or more of the selected strategies/approaches; and share lessons learned from this work with key stakeholders. o Identify key indicators of risk and protective factors to measure the impact of ACEs prevention efforts within the applicant's jurisdiction. Implement and Page 18 of 62 evaluate public health actions taken to mitigate risk and advance protective factors to inform ongoing programmatic improvements. o Partner with existing screening and assessment efforts (e.g. Safe Environments for Every Kid - SEEK) to evaluate referral connections ensuring disproportionally- affected populations who are screened are then efficiently and effectively connected to services. Transportation Safety - o Implement or improve implementation of CDC's Transportation Safety approach to Linking Information for Nonfatal Crash Surveillance (LINCS) to identify the role of risk and protective factors (e.g. alcohol use, restraint use) in non-fatal crashes within the jurisdiction. Using linked data and partnerships, identify, implement, and evaluate high-leverage strategies to prevent transportation-related injury. o Conduct a policy evaluation using legal epidemiology methods to determine the impact of transportation safety laws on transportation-related injuries and deaths. https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/resources/legalepimodel/ind ex.html o Partner with law enforcement, labs, and other entities to implement and evaluate a protocol for standardized toxicology testing for impaired/fatal crash incidents. Traumatic Brain Injury - o Evaluate the implementation and use of the CDC Mild Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury Guideline to identify clinical decision support needs and resources to strengthen uptake of the guideline. o Evaluate the implementation of state Return-To-Learn policies to identify best practices and/or areas and methods for implementation support. Develop, implement, and evaluate support resources. o Evaluate current practices for TBI management in rural areas to identify best practices, identify and address gaps, and strengthen TBI management in rural areas. o Develop an enhanced surveillance approach to estimate TBI-related disability. In conjunction with partners, identify populations disproportionately affected by TBI-related disability and associated risk and protective factors. Implement and evaluate public health actions to mitigate risk and advance protective factors. Example Novel Surveillance Option Activities Identify and/or develop advanced analytic data science methods to effectively advance the use of new and/or existing sources of data.

Page 31 of 62 Risk Assessment Questionnaire Requirement CDC is required to conduct pre-award risk assessments to determine the risk an applicant poses to meeting federal programmatic and administrative requirements by taking into account issues such as financial instability, insufficient management systems, non-compliance with award conditions, the charging of unallowable costs, and inexperience. The risk assessment will include an evaluation of the applicant's CDC Risk Questionnaire, located at https://www.cdc.gov/grants/documents/PPMR-G-CDC-Risk-Questionnaire.pdf , as well as a review of the applicant's history in all available systems; including OMB-designated repositories of government-wide eligibility and financial integrity systems (see 45 CFR 75.205(a)), and other sources of historical information. These systems include, but are not limited to: FAPIIS (https://www.fapiis.gov/), including past performance on federal contracts as per Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of 2009; Do Not Pay list; and System for Award Management (SAM) exclusions. CDC requires all applicants to complete the Risk Questionnaire, OMB Control Number 0920- 1132 annually. This questionnaire, which is located at https://www.cdc.gov/grants/documents/PPMR-G-CDC-Risk-Questionnaire.pdf , along with supporting documentation must be submitted with your application by the closing date of the Notice of Funding Opportunity Announcement. If your organization has completed CDC's Risk Questionnaire within the past 12 months of the closing date of this NOFO, then you must submit a copy of that questionnaire, or submit a letter signed by the authorized organization representative to include the original submission date, organization's EIN and DUNS. When uploading supporting documentation for the Risk Questionnaire into this application package, clearly label the documents for easy identification of the type of documentation. For example, a copy of Procurement policy submitted in response to the questionnaire may be labeled using the following format: Risk Questionnaire Supporting Documents _ Procurement Policy. Duplication of Efforts Applicants are responsible for reporting if this application will result in programmatic, budgetary, or commitment overlap with another application or award (i.e. grant, cooperative agreement, or contract) submitted to another funding source in the same fiscal year. Programmatic overlap occurs when (1) substantially the same project is proposed in more than one application or is submitted to two or more funding sources for review and funding consideration or (2) a specific objective and the project design for accomplishing the objective are the same or closely related in two or more applications or awards, regardless of the funding source. Budgetary overlap occurs when duplicate or equivalent budgetary items (e.g., equipment, salaries) are requested in an application but already are provided by another source. Commitment overlap occurs when an individual's time commitment exceeds 100 percent, whether or not salary support is requested in the application. Overlap, whether programmatic, budgetary, or commitment of an individual's effort greater than 100 percent, is not permitted. Any overlap will be resolved by the CDC with the applicant and the PD/PI prior to award.

Applicants must name this file \"Indirect Cost Rate\" and upload it at www.grants.gov . 13. Funds Tracking Proper fiscal oversight is critical to maintaining public trust in the stewardship of federal funds. Effective October 1, 2013, a new HHS policy on subaccounts requires the CDC to set up payment subaccounts within the Payment Management System (PMS) for all new grant awards. Funds awarded in support of approved activities and drawdown instructions will be identified on the Notice of Award in a newly established PMS subaccount (P subaccount). Recipients will be required to draw down funds from award-specific accounts in the PMS. Ultimately, the subaccounts will provide recipients and CDC a more detailed and precise understanding of financial transactions. The successful applicant will be required to track funds by P-accounts/sub accounts for each project/cooperative agreement awarded. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate a record of fiscal responsibility and the ability to provide sufficient and effective oversight. Financial management systems must meet the requirements as described 45 CFR 75 which include, but are not limited to, the following: Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-funded activities. Effective control over, and accountability for, all funds, property, and other assets. Comparison of expenditures with budget amounts for each Federal award. Written procedures to implement payment requirements. Written procedures for determining cost allowability. Written procedures for financial reporting and monitoring. 14. Pilot Program for Enhancement of Employee Whistleblower Protections Pilot Program for Enhancement of Employee Whistleblower Protections: All applicants will be subject to a term and condition that applies the terms of 48 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) section 3.908 to the award and requires that recipients inform their employees in writing (in the predominant native language of the workforce) of employee whistleblower rights and protections under 41 U.S.C. 4712. 15.

The following factors may affect the order of the funding decisions: o No more than one applicant within a state will be funded o Achieving a geographically balanced spread of Core SIPP programs across the United States. o Ensuring access to required state level mortality and hospitalization data sets All components are scored on a maximum score of 100 points each. CDC will review the BASE and IEE components concurrently - however, only those applicants that are funded for the BASE component will be considered for funding for the Enhanced component. Review of risk posed by applicants. Prior to making a Federal award, CDC is required by 31 U.S.C. 3321 and 41 U.S.C. 2313 to review information available through any OMB-designated repositories of government-wide eligibility qualification or financial integrity information as appropriate. See also suspension and debarment requirements at 2 CFR parts 180 and 376. In accordance 41 U.S.C. 2313, CDC is required to review the non-public segment of the OMB- designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently the Federal Recipient Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)) prior to making a Federal award where the Federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined in 41 U.S.C. 134, over the period of performance. At a minimum, the information in the system for a prior Federal award recipient must demonstrate a satisfactory record of executing programs or activities under Federal grants, cooperative agreements, or procurement awards; and integrity and business ethics. CDC may make a Federal award to a recipient who does not fully meet these standards, if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the current Federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the effects of the non-Federal entity's risk in accordance with 45 CFR \u00a775.207. CDC's framework for evaluating the risks posed by an applicant may incorporate results of the evaluation of the applicant's eligibility or the quality of its application. If it is determined that a Federal award will be made, special conditions that correspond to the degree of risk assessed may be applied to the Federal award. The evaluation criteria is described in this Notice of Funding Opportunity. In evaluating risks posed by applicants, CDC will use a risk-based approach and may consider any items such as the following: (1) Financial stability; (2) Quality of management systems and ability to meet the management standards prescribed in this part; Page 49 of 62 (3) History of performance. The applicant's record in managing Federal awards, if it is a prior recipient of Federal awards, including timeliness of compliance with applicable reporting requirements, conformance to the terms and conditions of previous Federal awards, and if applicable, the extent to which any previously awarded amounts will be expended prior to future awards; (4) Reports and findings from audits performed under subpart F 45 CFR 75 or the reports and findings of any other available audits; and (5) The applicant's ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on non-Federal entities. CDC must comply with the guidelines on government-wide suspension and debarment in 2 CFR part 180, and require non-Federal entities to comply with these provisions. These provisions restrict Federal awards, subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal programs or activities. 2. Announcement and Anticipated Award Dates Successful applicants will anticipate a notice of funding by July 2, 2021, with a start date of August 1, 2021. F. Award Administration Information 1.

The GMO works closely with the program or project officer who is responsible for the scientific, technical, and programmatic aspects of the grant. Grants Management Specialist (GMS): A federal staff member who oversees the business and other non-programmatic aspects of one or more grants and/or cooperative agreements. These activities include, but are not limited to, evaluating grant applications for administrative content and compliance with regulations and guidelines, negotiating grants, providing consultation and technical assistance to recipients, post-award administration and closing out grants. Health Disparities: Differences in health outcomes and their determinants among segments of the population as defined by social, demographic, environmental, or geographic category. Health Equity: Striving for the highest possible standard of health for all people and giving special attention to the needs of those at greatest risk of poor health, based on social conditions.

Inclusion: Both the meaningful involvement of a community's members in all stages of the program process and the maximum involvement of the target population that the intervention will benefit. Inclusion ensures that the views, perspectives, and needs of affected communities, care providers, and key partners are considered. Indirect Costs: Costs that are incurred for common or joint objectives and not readily and specifically identifiable with a particular sponsored project, program, or activity; nevertheless, these costs are necessary to the operations of the organization. For example, the costs of operating and maintaining facilities, depreciation, and administrative salaries generally are considered indirect costs. Intergovernmental Review: Executive Order 12372 governs applications subject to Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs. This order sets up a system for state and local governmental review of proposed federal assistance applications. Contact the state single point of contact (SPOC) to alert the SPOC to prospective applications and to receive instructions on the State's process. Visit the following web address to get the current SPOC list: https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Intergovernmental_-Review- _SPOC_01_2018_OFFM.pdf . Letter of Intent (LOI): A preliminary, non-binding indication of an organization's intent to submit an application. Lobbying: Direct lobbying includes any attempt to influence legislation, appropriations, regulations, administrative actions, executive orders (legislation or other orders), or other similar deliberations at any level of government through communication that directly expresses a view on proposed or pending legislation or other orders, and which is directed to staff members or other employees of a legislative body, government officials, or employees who participate in formulating legislation or other orders. Grass roots lobbying includes efforts directed at inducing or encouraging members of the public to contact their elected representatives at the federal, state, or local levels to urge support of, or opposition to, proposed or pending legislative proposals. Logic Model: A visual representation showing the sequence of related events connecting the activities of a program with the programs' desired outcomes and results. Maintenance of Effort: A requirement contained in authorizing legislation, or applicable regulations that a recipient must agree to contribute and maintain a specified level of financial effort from its own resources or other non-government sources to be eligible to receive federal grant funds.
