The ends thus wear down over time. It has become a global burden affecting around 2.4 crore people. Worldwide estimates are that 9.6% of men and 18.0% of women aged over 60 years have symptomatic OA. 2.6 Crore people in India alone are affected by this dreaded devil. A lot of it has to do with lifestyle and age. Women are more prone to osteoarthritis than males, especially around age 50 and above. Total [knee](https://www.narayanahealth.org/blog/the-need-of-the-hour-know-about-knee-pain-in-elderly/) replacement is a surgery wherein deformed bones are replaced making a joint pain free and good as new. Let's see exactly how they are both associated. Indications of Total Knee Replacement: There are strictly defined guidelines for surgical candidates: - Pain in and around the knee that does not respond to medicines, physiotherapy, etc. Pain at rest. - If the scans (Xray, MRI) shows so - Restricted range of motion that interferes with daily living activities - Deformed knees like bowing outwards, waddling gait. - Severe swelling and inflammation Contraindications of the surgery are: - Systemic infections mean affecting the entire body such as [high blood pressure](https://www.narayanahealth.org/blog/learn-to-control-blood-pressure-the-right-way/), or systemic diseases, such as the flu or an infection in the bloodstream. - Muscular or neurological deficit surrounding the surgical site - Conditions where anesthesia cannot be administered. - Skin infections of the affected area like psoriasis or eczema - Uncontrolled diabetes - A vascular disease where circulation is inadequate - Dental problems like cavities or gingivitis - Malnutrition - Severe smoking or nicotine usage - Brittle bones or osteoporosis - Advanced age 80 or above Surgery vs. Medicine Numerous studies have reported greater improvements in post replacement surgeries than with a person on non-surgical treatment. Not to rule out the adverse effects caused due to prolonged consumption of NSAIDs and Steroids like liver damage, stomach bleed, stroke, heart attack, and vision-related problems. Enormously expensive pain care supplements have also captured the osteoarthritic market with results extremely questionable. The success rate of Knee Replacements: Research has concluded that more than 90% of surgeries result in successful outcomes like - Decreased pain - Upgraded function - Independent ambulation This is a common but major surgery recommended to all those who cannot be treated by medication and physical therapy. Effectiveness of replacement surgery: Factors affecting outcome and patient satisfaction - Post-surgical rehabilitation, strengthening, and range of motion [exercises](https://www.narayanahealth.org/blog/exercises-for-people-with-diabetes/) - Ambulation with the help of an assistive device as long as required 90% of patients rated their post-surgical experience as good to excellent within 6weeks of surgery. Most of them have returned to their normal personal and professional lives with 41% of people being able to perform activities like dancing, golfing, etc. How Long A Knee Replacement Does Stay? Approximately 90% of knee replacements last at least 15 years. The average life of a knee replacement is considered 18-20 years. In case the surgery is repeated after 20 years it is called revision knee replacement surgery and is extremely uncommon. All and all total knee replacement evolves as a safe and proven remedy for knee osteoarthritis, which improves the quality of life and promotes independence in the affected person.
