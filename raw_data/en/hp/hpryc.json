We are committed to finding solutions to your health concerns so that you can enjoy a better quality of life. Traditional Chinese Medicine has its origin in ancient Taoist philosophy which views a person as an energy system in which body and mind are unified, each influencing and balancing the other. Unlike allopathic medicine which attempts to isolate and separate a disease from a person, Chinese medicine emphasizes a holistic approach that treats the whole body. Our philosophy is rooted in our deep respect and compassion for our patients. We approach each patient individually, and look to design your treatment plan based on what will be the most expedient path to healing and recovery, while taking into account the very personal needs of each particular patient. We are devoted to the success and well being of our patients. Our Therapies Much of what we do at Chinese Medicine Lady has been in practice for thousands of years. Lydia is a 14th generation practitioner of Chinese Medicine and Stephanie is a 15th generation practitioner.

What is Your Health Concern? Traditional Chinese Medicine cares for the whole person. As a TCM primary care practitioner, I am here to care for any person at any age for any condition.
