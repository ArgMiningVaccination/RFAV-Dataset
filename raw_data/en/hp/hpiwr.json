This cautious approach may be unnecessary in many cases, because only a small proportion of medications are contraindi- cated in breastfeeding mothers or asso ciated with adverse effects on their infants. Information to inform physicians about the extent of excretion for a particular drug into human milk is needed but may not be available. Previous statements on this topic from the American Academy of Pediat- rics provided physicians with data con cerning the known excretion of spe- cic medications into breast milk. More current and comprehensive information is now available on the Internet, as well as an application for mobile devices, at LactMed (http:// toxnet.nlm.nih.gov). Therefore, with the exception of radioactive compounds requiring temporary cessation of breastfeeding, the reader will be referred to LactMed to obtain themost current data on an individual me dication. This report discusses several topics of interest surrounding lactation, such as the use of psychotropic therapies, drugs to treat substance abuse, narcotics, gal- actagogues, and herbal products, as well as immunization of breastfeed- ing women. A discussion regarding the global implications of maternal medications and lactation in the developing world is beyond the scope of this report. The World Health Organization offers several programs and resources that address the importance of breastfeeding (see http:// www.who.int/topics/breastfeeding/en/). Pediatrics 2013;132:e796 -e809 INTRODUCTION Lactating women can be exposed to medications or other therapeutics, either on a limited or long-term basis, depending on the need to treat acute or chronic conditions. Many women are advised to discontinuenursing or avoid taking necessary medications because of concerns aboutpossible adverse effects in their infants. 1Such advice is often not based on evidence, because information about the extent of drug excretion intohuman milk may be unavailable, and for many drugs, information islimited to data from animal studies, which may not correlate with humanexperience. In addition, not all drugs are excreted in clinically signi cant amounts into human milk, and the presence of a drug in human milkmay not pose a risk for the infant. To weigh the risks and bene ts of breastfeeding, physicians need to consider multiple factors. These fac-tors include the need for the drug by the mother, the potential effects ofHari Cheryl Sachs, MD, FAAP* and COMMITTEE ON DRUGS KEY WORD human milk ABBREVIATIONS AAP\u2014American Academy of Pediatrics FDA\u2014Food and Drug HPV\u2014human papillomavirus vaccine NSAID \u2014nonsteroidal antiin flammatory drug This document is copyrighted and is property of the American Academy of Pediatrics and its Board of Directors.

The age of the infant is also an important factor in the decision-making process, because adverse events asso- ciated with drug exposure via lactation occur most often in neonates younger than 2 months and rarely in infants older than 6 months. 2In the near future, pharmacogenetics may also pro- vide important guidance for individu-alized decisions. In large part because of efforts by Cheston Berlin, Jr, MD, a statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics(AAP) on the transfer of drugs and chemicals into human milk was rst published in 1983 3and underwent several subsequent revisions,4,5the most recent of which was publishedin 2001. 6Previous editions were intended to list drugs potentially used during lactation and to describe pos- sible effects on the infant and/or onlactation. Revisions for the statementcan no longer keep pace with the rapidly changing information available via the Internet, published studies,and new drug approvals. A morecomprehensive and current database is available at LactMed (http://toxnet. nlm.nih.gov). LactMed includes up-to-date information on drug levels inhuman milk and infant serum, possi- ble adverse effects on breastfeeding infants, potential effects on lactation,and recommendations for possible alternative drugs to consider.

An update re- garding the use of antidepressants,anxiolytics, and antipsychotics in the lactating woman is also provided, be- cause the use of psychotropic agents during lactation is still debated. Since publication of the last statement, nu- merous questions have been raised regarding the use of methadone in the lactating woman. For this reason, therapies for substance abuse and smoking cessation are discussed. Given thending that codeine use may be associated with toxicity in patients, in- cluding neonates with ultrarapid me- tabolism, a brief review of alternative agents to treat pain in the lactating woman is provided. The use of gal- actagogues is also reviewed because more women now endeavor to breast- feed adopted infants or preterm neo- nates. The increasing use of herbalproducts has invited a discussion of the merits of these alternative thera- pies in the nursing woman. Finally, immunization of breastfeeding women and their infants will be reviewed to assist pediatricians in encouraging immunization when needed in lactat- ing women and addressing parental reluctance to immunize breastfed infants. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Several factors should be considered when advising a woman regarding a decision to breastfeed her infant while she is on drug therapy. The bene ts of breastfeeding for both the infant and mother need to be weighed against the risks of drug exposure to the infant (or to the mother, in the case of agents intended to induce lactation). Many factors affect the individual risk/bene t decision, including speci c information about chemical and pharmacologic properties of the drug, which may be available from resources such as LactMed and in product labeling. Ingeneral, chemical properties of a drug, such as lack of ionization, small mo- lecular weight, low volume of distri-bution, low maternal serum protein binding, and high lipid solubility, facil-itate drug excretion into human milk. Drugs with long half-lives are more likely to accumulate in human milk, and drugs with high oral bioavailability are more easily absorbed by the infant. 8 The adverse event pro le of the drug is another property that affects the in- dividual risk/bene t ratio. Use of a drug with a signi cant adverse effect in a lactating woman (such as an ar- rhythmia) may be acceptable to treat a serious illness in the mother; how- ever, use of the same drug to increase milk production would not be accept- able. For drugs with an adverse event prole that correlates with increasing dosage, higher maternal doses may be associated with greater neonatal toxicity. In addition, the timing of ex- posure and the duration of therapy are other important considerations. Ad e c i s i o nt ob r e a s t f e e dw h e nc o n - tinuing treatment with an agent for which in utero exposure also has occurred differs from a decision to initiate a novel therapy in the early postpartum period. Similarly, the risks of a single-dose therapy or short-term treatment may differ from those of a chronic therapy. In addition to pharmacokinetic or chemical properties of the drug, the infant 's expected drug exposure is influenced by infant and maternal fac- tors beyond basic known pharmacoki- netic and chemical properties of the drug itself. For example, the risk of adverse reactions in a preterm infant or an infant with underlying chronic medical conditions may be higher than that for a more mature or healthier infant. Certain drugs may accumulate in the breastfed infant because of re- duced clearance or immaturity of of these same pathways may p r o t e c ta ni n f a n tf r o mt o x i cd r u g metabolites. Similarly, patients with speci c genotypes may experience drug toxicity, as evidenced by fatalities observed in individuals who demon-strate ultrarapid metabolism of co- deine. 9Finally, certain infant conditions, such as metabolic diseases, and ma- ternal health conditions may preclude nursing (eg, HIV) or require multiple therapies that are particularly toxic (eg, cancer treatment). CHANGES IN DRUG LABELING In the past, the lactation section in FDA-approved labeling was often limited tostatements that advise caution or contain an admonition to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue therapy, depending on the importance to the mother. In 2008, the FDA published a proposed revision to the regulations, which affects the pregnancy and lac- tation sections of labeling. The agency is currently working on the nal rule, which is intended to provide a clini- cally oriented framework for place- ment of pregnancy and lactation information into drug labeling and to permit the patient and physician to explore the risk/bene t on the basis of the best available data. Under the proposed rule, the current Nursing Mothers section is replaced by a sec- tion called Lactation. The Lactation section of labeling will contain 3subsections: Risk Summary, Clinical Considerations, and Data. The Risk Summary section will include a sum- mary of what is known about the ex- cretion of the drug into human milk and potential effects on the breastfed infant, as well as maternal milk pro- duction. The Clinical Considerations section will include methods to mini-mize exposure of the breastfed infant to the drug when applicable, as well as information about monitoring for e798 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICSDownloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/132/3/e796/1091444/peds_2013-1985.pdf by guest on 14 February 2022 expected adverse drug effects on the infant. The Data component will pro- vide a detailed overview of the existingdata that forms the evidence base for the other 2 sections. In addition to the proposed rule, the FDA published \"Guidance for Industry: Clinical Lactation Studies: Study De-sign, Data Analysis, and Recom- mendations for Labeling. \" 10 Along with outlining recommendations regarding lactation study design as well as the timing and indications forthese studies, this draft guidance includes advice on parameters (sev- eral of which are used in LactMed) that can be used to inform physicians about the extent of drug exposure. Using these parameters, drug expo- sure to the infant may be measured directly in infant serum or estimated on the basis of pharmacokinetic pa-rameters. These estimates of infant exposure (for example, relative infant dose) can be expressed as a percent of weight-adjusted maternal or, when known, weight-adjusted pediatric dose.ANTIDEPRESSANTS, ANXIOLYTICS, AND ANTIPSYCHOTICS Previous statements from the AAP cat- egorized the effect of psychoactive drugs on the nursing infant as \"unknown but may be of concern. \"Although new data have been published since 2001, in-formation on the long-term effects of these compounds is still limited. Most publications regarding psychoactivedrugs describe the pharmacokineticsin small numbers of lactating womenwith short-term observational studies of their infants. In addition, interpre- tation of the effects on the infant fromthe small number of longer-term stud-ies is confounded by prenatal treat-ment or exposure to multiple therapies. For these reasons, the long-term ef- fect on the developing infant is stilllargely unknown. 11,12 Many antianxiety drugs, antide- pressants, and mood stabilizers appear in low concentrations in human milk, with estimated relative infant dosesless than 2% of weight-adjusted ma-ternal dose and/or milk-plasmaratios less than 1. 13However, the per- centage of maternal doses that ap- proach clinically signi cant levels (10% or more) have been reported forbupropion, 14diazepam,13fluoxetine,15 citalopram,16lithium,17lamotrigine,18 and venlafaxine.19Data on drug ex- cretion in human milk are not avail-able for up to one-third of psychoactivetherapies. 13 Because of the long half-life of some of these compounds and/or their metab- olites, coupled with an infant 'si m m a - ture hepatic and renal function,nursing infants may have measurableamounts of the drug or its metabolites in plasma and potentially in neural tissue. Infant plasma concentrationsthat exceed 10% of therapeutic ma-ternal plasma concentrations anxiolytics, and 1). Mothers who desire to breastfeed their infant(s) while taking these agents should be counseled about thebenets of breastfeeding as well as the potential risk that the infant may be exposed to clinically signi cant levels and that the long-term effects of thisexposure are unknown. Consideration should be given to monitoring growth and neurodevelopment of the infant. DRUGS FOR SMOKING CESSATION OR TO TREAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE/ ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE Although many women are appropri- ately advised to refrain from smoking, drinking, and using recreational drugsduring and after pregnancy, in part because of adverse effects on their infants (see Table 2), some are unableto do so and may seek assistance afterdelivery. Maternal smoking is not an absolute contraindication to breast- feeding. 31Nonetheless, for multiple reasons, including the association of sudden infant death syndrome withTABLE 1 Psychoactive Drugs With Infant Serum Concentrations may in- clude active metabolites.

Exposure to alcohol or rec- reational drugs may impair a mother 's judgment and interfere with her care of the infant and can cause toxicity to the breastfeeding infant (see Table 2). Limited information is available re- garding the use of medications inlactating women to treat substance abuse or alcohol dependence or for smoking cessation. However, the pres- ence of behaviors, such as continued ingestion of illicit drugs or alcohol, and underlying conditions, such as HIV in- fection, are not compatible with breast- feeding. 49,50Patients also require ongoing psychosocial support to maintain abstinence.48 Methadone, buprenorphine, and nal- trexone are 3 agents approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of opioid dependence. Continued breastfeedingby women undergoing such treatment presumes that the patient remains abstinent, is HIV negative, and is en-rolled in and closely monitored by an appropriate drug treatment program with signi cant social support. 48,51 Potential adverse effects on breast- feeding infants from methadone (according to product labeling) and buprenorphine include lethargy, re- spiratory dif culty, and poor weight gain.52The long-term effects of meth- adone in humans are unknown. None-theless, methadone levels in human milk are low, with calculated infant exposures less than 3% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. 53,54 Plasma con- centrations in infants are also low (less than 3% of maternal trough concen- trations) during the neonatal period and up to 6 months postpartum.55,56 For these reasons, guidelines from theAcademy of Breastfeeding Medicine encourage breastfeeding for womentreated with methadone who are en- rolled in methadone-maintenance pro- grams. 48 Buprenorphine is excreted into human milk and achieves a level similar to that in maternal plasma.57Infant exposureappears to be up to 2.4% of the ma- ternal weight-adjusted dose.55,56,58 However, buprenorphine can be abused, and although the signi cance in humans is unknown, labeling for buprenor- phine and buprenorphine/ naloxone combinations states that use is not advised by lactating women, becauseanimal lactation studies have showndecreased milk production and via- bility of the offspring. FDA labeling also advises caution for use of nal-trexone in nursing infants of opioid-dependent women. Of note, published information on naltrexone is limited to 1 case report that estimates infantexposure to be low (7 g/kg/d, or 0.86% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose). 59 Transferred amounts of methadone or buprenorphine are metha-done. 51,61 Thus, breastfeeding should not be stopped abruptly, and gradualTABLE 2 Drugs of Abuse for Which Adverse Effects on the Breastfeeding Infant Have Been Reporteda Drug Reported Effect or Reason for Concern Reference Alcohol Impaired motor development or postnatal growth, decreased milk consumption, sleep disturbances.Koren 2002,34Backstrand 2004,35Mennella 200736 Note: Although binge drinking should be avoided, occasional, limited ingestion (0.5 g of alcohol/kg/d; equivalent to 8 oz wine or 2 cans of beer per day) may be acceptable.National Academy of Sciences 199137 Amphetamines Hypertension, tachycardia, and seizures.

Limited information is available for di- sulram and naltrexone, agents that are used to treat alcohol dependence. As noted previously, a low relative infant dose ( <1%) was observed in a single case report of naltrexone exposure ina 6-week-old breastfed infant. 59FDA labeling discourages use of disul ram and both the injectable and oral form of naltrexone in lactating women. Only one-third of women successfully discontinue smoking without pharma- cologic aids.62Nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline are agents indicated for use as aids to smoking cessation treatment. Nicotine replacement therapy is compatible with breastfeeding as long as the dose (assuming a cigarette delivers 1m g of nicotine) is less than the number ofcigarettes typically smoked, because nicotine passes freely into human milk and is orally absorbed as nicotine. Cotinine concentrations are lower than those related to tobacco use. Short- acting products (eg, gum or lozenges) are recommended. 62Infant exposure decreases proportionally with mater- nal patch doses.63 In contrast, bupropion is excreted into human milk with exposures that may exceed 10% (range, 1.4% -10.6%) of the maternal dose.14Although infant levels were not measured, there is a case report of a seizure in a 6-month-old breastfed infant potentially related tobupropion. 64Limited published in- formation is available for varenicline, but the varenicline label includes a boxed warning for serious neuro- psychiatric adverse events, including suicidal ideation or behavior. FDA la- beling discourages use of both these agents in lactating women. PAIN MEDICATIONS Rarely, normal doses of codeine given to lactating women may result indangerously high levels of its active metabolite morphine in breastfeeding infants. A fatality has been noted in aninfant of a mother with ultrarapid metabolism. 65In this infant, the post- mortem level of morphine (87 ng/mL) greatly exceeded a typical level in a breastfeeding infant (2.2 ng/mL), as well as the therapeutic range for neonates (10 -12 ng/mL). In addition, unexplained apnea, bradycardia, cya- nosis, and sedation have been repor- ted in nursing infants of mothers receiving codeine.2,66Hydrocodone is also metabolized via the CYP2D6pathway. On the basis of pharmacoki- netic data, infants exposed to hydro- codone through human milk may receive up to 9% of the relative ma- ternal dose. 67Given the reduced clearance of hydrocodone in neonates and the adverse events observed in ultrarapid metabolizers of codeine, caution is advised for use of codeine and hydrocodone in both the motherand nursing infant. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of neonatal as well as maternal toxicity is recom- mended. A commercial test to identify ultrarapid metabolizers is not yetwidely available. The incidence of this speci c CYP2D6 genotype varies with racial and ethnic group as follows: Chinese, Japanese, or Hispanic, 0.5% to 1.0%; Caucasian, 1.0% to 10.0%; AfricanAmerican, 3.0%; and North African, Ethiopian, and Saudi Arabian, 16.0% to 28.0%. 68 For these reasons, when narcotic agents are needed to treat pain in the breastfeeding agents otherthan levels of butorphanol are excreted into human milk. Morphine appears to be toler-ated by the breastfeeding infant, al- though there is 1 case report of an infant with plasma concentrations within the therapeutic range. 69Clear-ance of morphine is decreased in infants younger than 1 month and approaches 80% of adult values by 6 months of age.70Limited data suggest that use of hydromorphone for brief periods may be compatible withbreastfeeding 71,72; however, FDA label- ing discourages use. Regardless of the choice of therapy, to minimizeadverse events for both the mother and her nursing infant, the lowest dose and shortest duration of therapyshould be prescribed. Drug delivery via patient-controlled anesthesia or administration by the epidural routemay also minimize infant exposure. Other narcotic agents, such as oxy- codone, pentazocine, propoxyphene, and meperidine, are not recommended in thelactating mother. Relatively high amounts of oxycodone are excreted into human milk, and therapeuti c concentrations have been detected in the plasma of a nursing infant. 73Central nervous sys- t e md e p r e s s i o nw a sn o t e di n2 0 %o finfants exposed to oxycodone during breastfeeding. 74Thus, use of oxycodone should be discouraged. Limited pub-lished data are available about pentaz- ocine. However, respiratory depression and apnea occur frequently in infants,particularly in neonates or in preterm infants, who are treated pentazo- Propoxyphene has been associatedwith unexplained apnea, bradycardia, as well as hypotonia in nursing infants. 75,76 Moreover, pro- poxyphene was withdrawn from the market because signi cant QT pro- longation occurred at therapeuticdoses. 77Meperidine use is associated with decreased alertness of the infant and is likely to interfere with breast-feeding. 71Although estimates of meper- idine exposure are low (approximately 2% to 3% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose), the half-life of the active metabolite for meperidine is prolonged, and it may accumulate in infant bloodor tissue. 71,72 PEDIATRICS Volume 132, Number 3, September 2013 e801FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICSDownloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/132/3/e796/1091444/peds_2013-1985.pdf by guest on 14 February 2022 When narcotics are not required to relieve mild to moderate pain, other analgesic agents can be used. Pre-suming that pain relief is adequate, short-acting agents, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, are acceptable. 78 Although the half-life of ibuprofen maybe prolonged in neonates, particularlyin preterm infants (according to product labeling), minimal amounts of ibuprofen are excreted into humanmilk. 72Despite reduced clearance of acetaminophen,79 hepatotoxicity is less common in neonates than inolder infants, in part because of low levels of certain cytochrome P-450 enzymes, which convert acetamino- phen into aminophen is nonsteroidal antiin flam- matory drugs (NSAIDs) carry a boxed warning regarding gastrointestinal bleeding and potential long-term cardiac toxicity, according to their product la-beling and Gardiner et al, 81celecoxib, flurbiprofen, and naproxen are consid- ered to be compatible with breastfeed- ing, because less than 1% is excreted into human milk. In addition, a breast-feeding infant would receive less than 1% of the relative pediatric dose of cel- ecoxib prescribed for a 2-year-old(according to product labeling). How- ever, long-term use of naproxen is not recommended because of the drug 's long half-life and case reports of gas- trointestinal tract bleeding and emesis.Avoiding NSAIDs in breastfeeding infants with ductal-dependent cardiac lesions may be prudent. Limited published data and FDA labeling discourages their use for a variety of reasons. Although theimplications for humans are unknown, meloxicam concentrations in milk of lactating animals exceed plasma con-centrations. Di flunisal has a long half- life and is not recommended becauseof potential adverse events, includingcataracts and fatality, in neonatal animals. Similarly, mefenamic acid hasa prolonged half-life in preterm infants. Injectable and oral forms of ketorolac are contraindicated in nursing women, according to product labeling, because of potential adverse effects related to closure of the ductus arteriosus in neonates. Less than 1% of ketorolac nasal spray is excreted into human milk, and unlike the oral and in-travenous forms of ketorolac, use is not contraindicated (product labeling). Carisoprodol and its active metabolite, meprobamate, are concentrated in human milk (2 -4t i m e sm a t e r n a l plasma concentrations). Impaired milk production has been observed, and animal studies suggest maternal use may lead to less effective infant feeding (because of sedation) and/or de- creased milk production (according to product labeling). Low doses (75 -162 mg/d) of aspirin may be acceptable 82;h o w e v e r ,u s eo f high-dose aspirin therapy during breastfeeding is not advised, because the serum concentration of salicylate in breastfeeding infants has been reported to reach approximately 40%of therapeutic concentrations. Adverse events, such as rash, platelet abnor- malities, bleeding, and metabolic aci- dosis have also reported. 71 GALACTAGOGUES Galactagogues, or agents to stimulate lactation, are often used to facilitate lactation, particularly for mothers of preterm infants. They also may be used to induce lactation in an adoptive mother. However, evidence to support these agents, including use of dopa- mine antagonists, such as domper-idone and metoclopramide; herbal treatments; and hormonal manipula- tion, is 83Although a placebo-controlled study (n= 42) suggested that domperidone may increase milk volume in mothersof preterm infants, 84maternal safety has not been established. The FDA issued a warning in June 2004 re- garding use of domperidone in breast- feeding women because of safety concerns based on published reportsof arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and sudden death associated with intrave- nous therapy. Furthermore, treatment with oral domperidone is associated with QT prolongation in children and infants. 85,86 Domperidone is not an approved product in the United States, and labeling for oral formulations marketed outside the United States do not recommend use during lactation. Several small trials (each with fewer than 25 subjects) published before 1990 suggested that metoclopramide increases prolactin concentrations and/or milk production in mothers of both term and preterm infants.87 However, more recent controlledstudies do not replicate this nding. 88,89 Human milk concentrations of meto- clopramide are similar to therapeutic concentrations in adult plasma,88and measurable amounts can be detected in breastfeeding infants.90Clearance of metoclopramide in neonates is pro- longed, which may result in excessive serum concentrations and the risk of conditions associated with overdose, such as methemoglobinemia. Of concern,prolactin concentrations were increased in 4 of 7 infants exposed to metoclopra- mide via human milk. 90The safety pro le for metoclopramide includes adverse reactions, such as dystonia, depression, suicidal ideation, and gastrointestinal tract disturbances, as well as a boxed warning about the risk of tardive dyski- nesia. These risks to the mother limit the usefulness of this therapy. Although a pilot study in 8 lactating women performed decades ago sug- gested that oxytocin nasal spray e802 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICSDownloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/132/3/e796/1091444/peds_2013-1985.pdf by guest on 14 February 2022 increased human milk production, a larger placebo-controlled trial in 51 women has not con rmed that ob- servation.91Oxytocin nasal spray is no longer marketed in the United States. Similarly, anecdotal reports supporting the use of the herb fenugreek to facil- itate lactation have not been con rmed by controlled studies.92,93 Fenugreek contains coumarin, which may interact with NSAIDs.94Use of fenugreek in lac- tating women also is associated with maple-syrup odor in infants.95Available data do not support the routine use ofother herbal products, such as fennel, to facilitate lactation. 96 In summary, galactagogues have a lim-ited role in facilitating lactation and have not been subject to full assessments ofsafety for the nursing infant. Nursing mothers should seek consultation with a lactation specialist and use non- pharmacologic measures to increase milk supply, such as ensuring proper technique, using massage therapy, in- creasing the frequency of milk expres- sion, prolonging the duration of pumping, and maximizing emotional support. COMMONLY USED HERBAL PRODUCTS Despite the frequent use of herbal products in breastfeeding women (upto 43% of lactating mothers in a 2004 survey), 97reliable information on the safety of many herbal products is lacking. Herbal products are not sub- ject to the same standards for manufacturing and proven effective- ness and safety as are drug products before they are marketed.98In fact, the use of several herbal productsmay be harmful, including kava and yohimbe. For example, the FDA has issued a warning that links kava supplementation to severe liver dam- age. 99Breastfeeding mothers should not use yohimbe because of reports of associated fatalities in children.100In addition, from 2008 through 2010, theFDA recalled 10 or more dietary sup- plements each year because of the presence of potentially toxic un-declared ingredients in the supple- ment. 101Similarly, the US Government Accountability Of ce found that 16 of 40 common herbal dietary supple- ments obtained from retail stores contained pesticide residues.102 Safety data are lacking for many herbs commonly used during breastfeeding, such as chamomile,103black cohosh,104 blue cohosh,105chastetree,106echina- cea,107ginseng,108gingko,109Hypericum (St John 's wort),110,111 and valerian.112 Adverse events have been reported in both breastfeeding infants and moth- ers. For example, St John 'sw o r tm a y cause colic, drowsiness, or lethargy inthe breastfed infant even though milk production and infant weight do not appear to be adversely affected 110and relative maternal dose and infant plasma concentrations are low.113 Prolonged use of fenugreek may re-quire monitoring of coagulation status and serum glucose concentrations. 114 For these reasons, these aforemen- tioned herbal products are not rec- ommended for use by nursing women. Although supplementation of nursing mothers with iron and vitamins is safe as long as recommended daily allow-ances are not exceeded, the use of other nutritional supplements may not be. For instance, L-tryptophan has been associ- ated with eosinophilic myositis. 115There- fore, physicians should inquire about the use of herbal products and dietary supplements in lactating women and discuss the need for caution because of the paucity of data available. DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING When feasible, elective imaging pro- cedures should be delayed until a woman is no longer breastfeeding. For most radiopharmaceuticals, breast- feeding should be interrupted for a time period based on the rate of de-cline of the agent and dosimetry to avoid infant exposures greater than 1 mSv (100 mrem). For agents that maybe concentrated in breast tissue, close contact of the mother with the infant and, consequently, nursing may need to be avoided for a period of time, although expressed milk that has been refrigerated until the radioactivity has decayed may be safe. General guidelines based on Nuclear Regulatory Commis- sion regulations and International Com-mission on Radiologic Protection guidelines 116are cited in Tables 3 and 4. However, because there is consid- erable variability in milk radioactivity, and close contact with an infant may result in additional exposure, consulta- tion with a radiologist should be sought. If deemed necessary, individualized testing of expressed milk may be per-formed to ensure that radioactivity has reached background levels before breastfeeding is resumed. 117 Notably, because radiolabeled iodin- ated products are concentrated in the developing thyroid and radioactivity persists after imaging with most131I and125I radiopharmaceuticals (with the exception of125I- hippurate), breast- feeding should be interrupted for a minimum of 3 weeks. Similarly,22Na and67Ga (gallium) administration also require a Because the lac- a greater131Ia fnity than does the nonlactating breast, women should cease breastfeeding at least 4 weeks before whole-body pro- cedures with131I and should discontinue breastfeeding thereafter. Doing so will reduce the radiation dose and potentialcancer risk to maternal breast tissue. Traditionally, lactating women receiving intravascular gadolinium or iodinated contrast (as opposed to radiolabeled io- dine) are advised to discontinue nursing for 24 hours. However, a minimal amount (0.04%) of the intravenous dose reaches human milk, and, of that, less than 1% to PEDIATRICS Volume 132, Number 3, September 2013 e803FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICSDownloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-pdf/132/3/e796/1091444/peds_2013-1985.pdf by guest on 14 February 2022 2% is absorbed by the infant. Therefore, breastfeeding can be continued withoutinterruption after the use of iodinated contrast or gadolinium. 118 BREASTFEEDING AND VACCINES With rare exceptions, maternal immu- nization does not create any problems for breastfeeding infants, althoughquestions concerning 2 topics oftenarise regarding lactation and immuni-zation: the effect of lactation on theinfant 's immune response to a vaccine and a potential adverse effect on theinfant from maternal immunization.Breastfeeding does not interfere withthe infant 's immune response to most routine immunizations (eg, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular inactivated poliovirusvaccine, and hepatitis B vaccine [HBV]), 121 despite the presence of maternalantibodies in human milk. Seroconver-sion rates are also in formula-fed infants compared with ex-clusively breastfed infants, particularlyduring the has been dis-continued. 122Nonetheless, protectionduring the rst year is similar. Moreover, breastfeeding enhances the antibody response to pneumococcal and Haemo- philus in fluenzae type b vaccines.123 Breastfeeding may also decrease the incidence of fever after infant immuni- zation.124Therefore, the timing of infant feeding (including human milk) relative to immunization is not restricted, evenfor live vaccines, such as rotavirus. Lactating women may need to be im- munized. Inactivated vaccines (such as tetanus papillomavirus vaccine [HPV]) given toTABLE 3 Radioactive Compounds That May Require Temporary Cessation of Breastfeeding: Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiologic Protection Compound Examples Example of Procedures Recommended Time for Cessation of BreastfeedingComments 14C-labeled Triolein, glycocholic acid, urea Helicobacter pylori phosphonates (MDP), bone, lung, heart, tumors0 to 4 h, as long as no free pertechnetateConsider discarding at least 1 meal after procedure Microspheres, pertechnetate, WBC 12 -24 h Range depends on dose Sulfur-colloids, RBC in vivo 6 h I-labeled123I,125Io r131I-iodo hippurate Thyroid imaging 12 whole-body irradiation with131I requires prolonged cessation Others11C-11No r11O-labeled PET scans None Short physical half-life 57Co-labeled vitamin B 12 Schilling test 24 h Pomeroy 2005119 18F-FDG PET scans None, rst feeding should be expressed breast milk to avoid direct contact120Use alternatives for 10 half-lives (10\u00d7109 min= 18 h)a 51Cr-EDTA Renal imaging None 81mKr-gas Pulmonary imaging None No approved US products 82Rb chloride PET scan of myocardium May resume 1 h after last infusionHalf-life 75 sa 111In-octreotide SPECT, neuroendocrine tumors None 111In -WBC 1 wk dose 133Xe Cardiac, WBC, white blood cell. aFDA-approved drug labeling.

Several vac-cines, such as tetanus toxoid, reduceddiphtheria toxoid, and acellular per-tussis vaccine and in fluenza vaccine, are recommended for the motherduring the postpartum period to pro-tect the infant as well as the mother.Other routine or catch-up vaccines,such as HPV, hepatitis A vaccine, andHBV, can be given to the lactatingmother. HPV immunization is recom-mended for women younger than 27years. The incidence of adverse reac-tions in nursing infants within 30 daysof maternal immunization with HPV wassimilar to nursing infants of womenreceiving the control except for acuterespiratory illness (according to Gar- dasil labeling). Hence, caution is war- ranted when immunizing mothers ofinfants who are vulnerable to illnesses (eg, preterm infants,infants with congenital heart disease orchronic respiratory problems). Most live vaccines are not associated with virus secretion in human milk. Forexample, despite maternal serocon-version, neither the varicella virus norantibody to varicella DNA has in breastfeeding infants. 125 Although attenuated rubella can besecreted into human milk and recommended for women wholack immunity, especially to rubella. 126 In contrast, infants are considered tobe at high risk of developing vacciniaafter exposure to smallpox vaccine or encephalitis after yellow fever vaccine. Two cases of meningoencephalitis in nursing infants whose mothers had been immunized against yellow fever are documented in the literature. 127,128 Therefore, most vaccines, with the ex-ception of smallpox or yellow-fever vaccine, which are contraindicated in nonemergency situations, may be ad- ministered during lactation. SUMMARY The bene ts of breastfeeding outweigh the risk of exposure to most thera- peutic agents via human milk. Although most drugs and therapeutic agents do not pose a risk to the mother or nursing infant, careful consideration of the in- dividual risk/bene t ratio is necessary for certain agents, particularly those that are concentrated in human milk or result in exposures in the infant that may be clinically signi cant on the basis of relative infant dose or detect- able serum concentrations. Caution is also advised for drugs and agents with unproven bene ts, with long half-lives that may lead to drug accumulation, or with known toxicity to the mother or infant. In addition, speci c infants may be more vulnerable to adverse events because of immature organ function (eg, preterm infants or neonates) or underlying medical conditions. Several excellent resources are available for the pediatrician, including product la- beling and the peer-reviewed database, LactMed. Consultation with a specialist may be indicated, particularly when theuse of radiopharmaceuticals, oncologic drugs, or other therapies not ad- dressed by LactMed is contemplated.Additional information about topics outside the scope of this report, such as environmental agents, can be obtained from the third edition of the AAP text- book Pediatric Environmental Health . 129 LEAD AUTHOR Hari Cheryl Sachs, MD, FAAP COMMITTEE ON DRUGS, 2012 -2013 Daniel A.
