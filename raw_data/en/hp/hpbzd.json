It is an all-natural, non-invasive approach to aging. the BENEFITS of Cosmetic Acupuncture Cosmetic acupuncture promotes subtle, natural-looking changes to the skin over time. Benefits of cosmetic acupuncture include: Improved vitality and micro-circulation Diminished fine lines Reduction of wrinkles Lifted and toned facial muscles Finer, evened skin tone Lighter under-eye circles and overall reduction of eye puffiness Balanced complexion, reduction of redness, acne and cysts Dewier-looking skin What is Cosmetic Acupuncture? This centuries-old beauty secret is a gentle, organic method of restoring the skin's youthful glow. It is a whole-body approach to reducing the signs of aging on the surface, while addressing the internal factors that contribute to premature aging, inflammation, and hormone imbalance. How does it Work? Extremely tiny (think hair-thin!) needles are placed gently into specific areas of the body, head and face, causing local changes that increase blood flow and stimulate collagen production. This combination increases elasticity, muscle tone and vitality. This combination nourishes and repairs the skin, resulting in a natural glow, a \"lifted\" appearance, more open eyes, more defined cheekbones, a dewy glow and more youthful appearance. The average treatment course includes a total of 12 treatments, either two treatments per week for six weeks or one treatment per week for 12 weeks. While each person responds differently to treatment, there is a great likelihood that you'll see subtle changes after the very first treatment. Results will start to appear visibly longer lasting after the first five to six treatments. Deeper wrinkles will begin diminishing after about six to eight treatments, with longer lasting changes to skin tone, texture, overall complexion, and better muscle toning and tightness after 12 treatments. Follow-up treatments are encouraged to maintain results. Is it right for YOU? Julie specializes in personalized Cosmetic Acupuncture \u2014 each treatment is unique to you and your specific areas of concern. At your first acupuncture visit, Julie will recommend a treatment plan that will help you reach your skincare goals, whether that is reducing puffiness, addressing under-eye circles, defining your chin line, reducing redness, or treating acne. Most women and men looking for a holistic, natural approach to anti-aging and overall wellness are suitable for cosmetic acupuncture. Individuals who are not eligible for cosmetic acupuncture include pregnant women, those with hemophilia or contagious skin diseases, those with un-managed high blood pressure or migraines, those with a severe deficiency or weakness, or those who have undergone other cosmetic procedures such as injections and surgical procedures in the past 2-6 weeks. If you have questions about any of these, Julie is more than happy to discuss these individually. Are there any risks? Cosmetic acupuncture is an all-natural, organic, chemical-free approach to anti-aging. It is without the side effects, risks and downtime of more invasive cosmetic procedures. There is no swelling or redness, no delay in seeing immediate results (though the results last longer as the course of treatment progresses), and you do not have to worry about allergic skin reactions. Although the majority of patients do not experience any complications, a small amount of bleeding, bruising or puffiness may occasionally occur. A more radiant you is possible!
