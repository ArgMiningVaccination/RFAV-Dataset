The University of Maryland Medical System and the University of Maryland School of Medicine are leaders in patient care, medical education and biomedical research. This extraordinary partnership in the hospital, the boardroom, the classroom and the laboratory powers our mission to serve Maryland and beyond, now and into the future. Dynamic leadership happens when knowledge and innovation walk the same path, leading change in the right direction.MeDiCAL SySTeM and SCHOOL OF MeDiCine The dynamic partnership between the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the University of Maryland Medical System grows stronger each year. Together, we have achieved top-tier status, and have become a national leader in clinical and academic medicine and biomedical research. Our success contributes greatly to the well-being of our citizens and the economic health of our nation. UMMS/SOM 2 2013 Annual Report aShared ViSiON what distinguishes us is our unwavering commitment to providing the highest quality patient care and service excellence, while remaining committed to academic medicine and educating future health care professionals to work in the communities we serve.Robert A.

Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA Vice President for Medical Affairs, University of Maryland & Dean, University of Maryland School of Medicine faCiNg ThE ChallENgES hEad-ON Challenging times are upon us. We are critically affected by the budget cuts that have dramatically reduced federal support for many key institutions on which we rely for funding. Minimal hospital-rate increases, reduced Medicare payments and federal Sequestration cuts also have forced us to make hard choices. We are not alone in this. This series of adverse actions is experienced by all medical institutions throughout Maryland and the nation. What sets us apart is how we have chosen to respond to these challenges. We believe that smart, selective and strategic decision-making positions us for maximum success. In the face of the challenges upon us, we are adapting to a new, more nimble approach that will enable us to thrive in these times. ThE MEdiCal SySTEM ExPaNdS In Fiscal 2013, we welcomed our newest member hospital, University of Maryland St. Joseph Medical Center, into the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS). Several of our existing hospitals also completed the process of adding the University of Maryland brand to their names, making clear their affiliation with our flagship academic medical center, University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC). UMMS now provides the capital, fiscal stability and purchasing power of 12 member hospitals employing 23,000 people across Maryland. UMMS member hospitals have a combined total of 2,430 licensed beds and recorded 125,801 patient admissions in Fiscal 2013 \u2014 more than any other health care provider in Maryland. Physicians across the region referred more patients to UMMC this year; Maryland ExpressCare recorded 11,207 physician referrals for urgent patient transfers from community hospitals, a figure that has nearly doubled over the last 10 years. As more health care is shifting to the outpatient setting, UMMS also is increasing the capacity and accessibility of non-hospital-based medical care in communities across Maryland. UMMC is a hospital of choice throughout the Mid-Atlantic for its expertise in the delivery of time-sensitive critical care for patients with the most serious illnesses and injuries. In 2013, UMMC opened a new Critical Care Resuscitation Unit \u2014 modeled after the time-tested concept of its Trauma Resuscitation Unit \u2014 to evaluate and stabilize critically ill incoming patients. We are further distinguished by the intellectual capital of our faculty physicians and researchers from the UM School of Medicine, whose top priority is safe, high-quality care that is patient-centered and patient-friendly. Our faculty physicians provide compassionate, world-class care at several system hospitals in addition to the Medical Center and offer specialty services at more than 20 different locations throughout Maryland. A LeTTeR FROM CeO ROBeRT CHRenCik AnD DeAn e. ALBeRT ReeCe a MEdiCal SChOOl wiTh a riCh hEriTagE lOOkS TO ThE fUTUrE Founded in 1807, the UM School of Medicine is a preeminent biomedical research institution with more than 2,800 faculty members dedicated to training the next generation of physicians, biomedical research scientists and allied health professionals. Additionally, our continuing medical education programs serve more than 5,000 physicians and other health professionals each year. The University of Maryland founding campus in Baltimore provides our faculty with interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly with the schools of Nursing, Pharmacy, Dentistry and Social Work. This year the nearly $2 billion in budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health significantly impacted the biomedical research community. In Fiscal 2013, research grants and contracts totaled more than $370 million at the UM School of Medicine. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, we ranked seventh among all 76 public medical schools and 20th among all 140 public and private medical schools nationwide in research grant and contract expenditures. These statistics show a decline from Fiscal 2012 and could be viewed by some as a reason to find safe harbor and wait for the storm to pass. However, we have decided to implement a series of bold yet realistic initiatives to selectively and strategically take advantage of opportunity in the face of these challenges. In June, we launched \"Shared Vision 2020,\" our plan to accelerate the pace and scope of discovery, col- laboration, innovation and quality of patient-centered care. We already have seen progress. In September of 2013, we will break ground on the newest biomedical research facility on campus, which will house scien- tific investigators who are making significant contri- butions to improving human health and well-being. In November of 2013 we will host the inaugural UM School of Medicine \"Festival of Science,\" a day-long symposium to highlight the ongoing cutting-edge research throughout the school. This year we will focus on the departments of Surgery and Pharmacol-ogy and the Institute of Genome Sciences. ThE BEST iN PaTiENT SafETy aNd QUaliTy Of CarE Of more than 5,000 hospitals reviewed by U.S. News & World Report, only 3 percent have even one specialty area ranked in its \"Best Hospitals\" list. The University of Maryland Medical Center has five: Cancer; Ear, Nose and Throat; Gynecology; Nephrology; and Urology all ranked in the Top 50 nationwide. Our flagship hospital also is one of just two nationwide to make the annual Leapfrog Group Top Hospitals list every year since the award's inception seven years ago. Leapfrog recognizes hospitals based on patient care outcomes, use of best practices and patient safety initiatives. Our systemwide safety initiatives are built on an advanced information technology platform that supports clinical decision-making and secure sharing of data. UMMS/SOM 3 2013 Annual Report addrESSiNg ChallENgES iN hEalTh CarE Working together, we are dedicating energy and resources to identifying where physician and health care professional shortages exist and working with the community and our hospital partners on solutions. Residents throughout Maryland now have more ac-cess than ever to world-renowned transplant special-ists, neurosurgeons, cardiologists and pediatricians. For example, cancer and cardiac care services are ex- panding at Upper Chesapeake Health and University of Maryland St. Joseph Medical Center. The UM School of Medicine has taken a leadership role in combating health disparities among minorities and lower-income groups. Our faculty served on the Maryland Health Disparities Workgroup, convened by Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, whose recommendations led to passage of the Maryland Health Improvement and Disparities Reduction Act of 2012 and establishment of health enterprise zones (areas that will receive special incentives to reduce inequalities in health care) across the state. The Workgroup's innovative approaches were published in the July 17, 2013, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. fiNaNCial PErfOrMaNCE aNd ECONOMiC iMPaCT Despite the fiscal challenges faced by the health care industry nationwide, the Medical System and School of Medicine continued to demonstrate strong financial performance through responsible steward-ship across our organizations. In Fiscal 2013, the Medical System generated $3 billion in annual revenue and nearly $4.9 billion in economic activity. With almost $1 billion in additional revenue derived by the School of Medicine and the faculty physician practices, our combined organizations produced more than $6 billion in economic activity for our region. The Medical System also maintains an A2 bond rating from Moody's Investors Service, an A from Fitch Investors Service and an A- from Standard & Poor's. lEadErShiP iN aN Era Of ChaNgE We have sustained our level of leadership by adopting a goal-oriented, aggressive and strategic approach to maximizing our resources and expertise. In the pages ahead, we have highlighted select examples of the compassionate patient care, exciting discoveries and educational excellence that result from the collaboration between UMMS and the UM School of Medicine. The University of Maryland School of Medicine is facing a true \"leadership moment\" at this time in our history. We are confronted with unprecedented challenges. We have a greater need than ever to be more creative, more resourceful, more efficient and more strategic in everything we do. I am confident that we will successfully navigate through these uncertain times. We will succeed because of the tremendous partnership we share with the University of Maryland Medical System and the bold and innovative leadership provided by Dean Reece and Bob Chrencik. I continue to be amazed by the advances our physicians and scientists are making in the most critical areas of biomedical research, medical education and clinical care. Through strong and dynamic leadership, we will emerge from these challenging times stronger than ever before, as we work to improve the lives of citizens in the City of Baltimore, in the State of Maryland, and around the world. \u2014 Michael Cryor, Chair, SOM Board of VisitorsMedical System Board of directors Stephen A.

No facility is better prepared to ensure that patients will get the right care, at the right time, in the right place. Physicians at other hospitals throughout the region consult with UMMC 24/7 to determine if a patient should be transferred to one of UMMC's 10 highly specialized critical care units. When a consultation indicates a patient needs to be transferred to UMMC, a specialized team of physicians and nurses meets the ambulance or helicopter, ready to care for the arriv-ing patient. In 2013, UMMC opened a new Critical Care Resuscitation Unit (CCRU) \u2014 modeled after the time-tested concept of its Trauma Resuscitation Unit \u2014 to evaluate and stabilize critically ill incoming patients. From the CCRU, patients are then admitted to the unit most suited to their needs. Stroke patients go to the Neurocare Intensive Care Unit. Neeraj Badjatia, MD, MS, associate professor of neurology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and medical director for the unit, works with Brigid Blaber, MS, RN, the nurse manager of the unit, to lead a team that specializes in caring for stroke and other neurological disorders. Patients with infectious disease or kidney failure might go to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, led by medical director Carl B. Shanholtz, MD, associate professor of medicine at the School of Medicine, and nurse manager Kerry Sue Mueller, BSN, MBA, RN, CCRN. More than 30 percent of UMMC's nearly 38,000 admissions came via transfers through University of Maryland ExpressCare, whose staff specializes in the coordinated, safe and skilled transfer of patients between hospitals. Of those transfers, about 60 percent were transferred from hospitals outside of the University of Maryland Medical System. Time-sensitive critical care medicine is a hallmark of UMMC's service to the community, state and region \u2014 as well as around the world \u2014 through programs and gold-standard protocols that are training the current and next generation of physicians and other patient care professionals.

Kyle's father, Randy, had received a heart transplant eight years earlier at the University of Maryland Medical Center. \"We knew that Kyle would be in good hands with the team at the University of Maryland,\" Randy Wilkerson said. His wife, Denise, added, \"I always knew that Kyle was going to be all right. He was never afraid of having the transplant because he knew that Randy recovered completely and could do everything that he did before he got sick.\" It is rare for two members of the same family to undergo heart transplants, let alone a father and a son. Doctors explained that Kyle and Randy Wilkerson, who live in Pasadena, Md., share a gene that ultimately causes heart failure. Mr. Wilkerson was in his 40s when he had his transplant, so he and his wife were stunned when their normal, active teenager suddenly became ill in February 2013 and doctors told them he needed a new heart. Kyle had his surgery on April 16. \"Without the University of Maryland Medical Center, I might not have my two guys in my life today,\" Mrs. Wilkerson said. \"I am just so thankful that they are alive and doing well.\" UMMS/SOM 10 2013 Annual Report UMMC'S pet visitation policy made it possible for Kyle's dog to visit him, which his parents said was a turning point in his recovery.

The biggest move started in the summer of 2012, when negotiations began to welcome our newest member hospital \u2014 the University of Maryland St. Joseph Medical Center. This aquisition gives UMMS a presence in northern Baltimore County \u2014 the Towson area \u2014 and gives residents the benefit of a hospital that's connected to the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC). Over the next several months, all UMMS hospitals changed their names to better inform patients of their connection to the system's flagship academic medical center, UMMC, where many of them refer patients for specialty care. University of Maryland Baltimore Washington Medical Center and University of Maryland Medical Center Midtown Campus were the first of the newly named hospitals. Two separate groups of hospitals that joined UMMS several years ago \u2014 Shore Health and Chester River Health \u2014 merged their operations to become University of Maryland Shore Regional Health, offering a coordinated network of services to the five counties of Maryland's Mid-Shore region. Kernan Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation became University of Maryland Rehabilitation & Orthopaedic Institute. This change better reflects the specialty nature of the hospital and its regional and national prominence in clinical rehabilitation research in partnership with the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Civista Medical Center became University of Maryland Charles Regional Medical Center. The new name reflects the geographic area the hospital serves \u2014 Charles County \u2014 and the word \"regional\" reflects the expanding effort to serve a growing population in Charles County and neighboring communities.TO MEET ThE NEEdS Of MarylaNdErS UMMS GROWS and CHaNGES UMMS/SOM 12 2013 Annual Report a NEw rESOUrCE fOr MarylaNdErS a new family of consumer health magazines debuted this year, tailored to each of the communities served by an UMMS hospital.

BUIlDING BlOCKS TO adVaNCE MEdiCiNE UMMS/SOM 14 2013 Annual Report Medical breakthroughs are built upon the foundation of basic science research. What is known today about human health and disease stems from discoveries made in research laboratories using animal models and human and animal cell lines or by studying genes and microbes. The innovative research conducted by University of Maryland School of Medicine faculty is dramatically changing the care patients receive. At the University of Maryland Medical Center, genetic testing helps doctors determine which medication a patient should take after a stenting procedure in order to prevent blood clots that could lead to heart attacks and strokes. This advancement is based on research by Alan R. Shuldiner, MD, the John L. Whitehurst Endowed Professor of Medicine, associate dean for personalized and genomic medicine and co-director of the University of Maryland Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. In 2009, he led a study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showing that patients with a CYP2C19 gene variation exhibited reduced clinical benefit from taking clopidogrel. Hundreds of faculty members conduct research \u2014 with funding from the National Institutes of Health and other sources \u2014 to create the building blocks of tomorrow's advances in patient care. For example, Christopher Plowe, MD, MPH, professor of medicine, epidemiology and public health and microbiology and immunology, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and leader of the Malaria Group at the Center for Vaccine Development, is working with a team to prevent the spread of drug-resistant malaria. diSCOVEry TraNSlaTES TO BETTEr CarE Pharmacogenomics \u2014 how genes affect a person's response to drugs \u2014 is a burgeoning area of research, but only a few hospitals in the United States have applied it to clinical practice. research led by Dr. SHulDinEr is already the basis of testing offered by cardiologist MArk vESEly, MD, assistant professor of medicine, who cares for patients at UMMC and the Baltimore Va Medical Center. riCHArD zHAO, phD, professor of pathology, directs the Translational genomics laboratory at the School of Medicine, where the genetic testing for patients is performed.BaTTliNg iNflUENza fighting infectious diseases is a key area for basic science research.

Although it was officially categorized as a disease in the summer of 2013, obesity has long been an area of study and clinical expertise at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the University of Maryland Medical System. Because obesity is a complex disease, the University of Maryland medical community offers services across the whole spectrum of care \u2014 from childhood through adulthood. Some simply need to control their weight; others need to lose more than 100 pounds to avoid serious health consequences such as cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, orthopaedic injuries and other disorders. The University of Maryland Center for Diabetes and Endocrinology provides specialized care to patients with diabetes who also are struggling with weight problems. \"We offer a personalized perspective, specific to people who have diabetes. We can adjust their medications to help promote weight loss and offer help with nutrition and behavior modification. We look at every aspect of their care,\" said Ava Port, MD, assistant professor of medicine, who leads the center's Obesity and Weight Management Program. Patients are referred by primary care providers, endocrinologists and other University of Maryland physicians, including those at the UM Center for Weight Management and Wellness. The program also refers patients to the bariatric surgery team, as appropriate.iNTEr VENiNg Early TO PrOMOTE hEal ThiEr wEighT MAurEEn Bl ACk, phD, the John a.

Their latest research examines tumor cells immediately after their removal during surgery to see how microtentacles respond to different cancer drugs. w ith a special laser microscope, micro-tentacles can be detected within hours after the tumor is removed from the patient. Their goal is to study these rapid responses to better understand which existing drugs will help the patient best over the long term.Experts at the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center are unraveling the mystery of how cancer develops and spreads within the body and investigating new therapies for patients. As faculty members of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, these physicians and scientists are at the forefront of exciting research that is continuously informing advances in patient care at the Greenebaum Cancer Center and around the world. Aaron Rapoport, MD, the Gary Jobson Professor in Medical Oncology, and his col- leagues recently demonstrated a remarkable advance in the treatment of blood cancers. They found that by taking a patient's own immune cells, known as T-cells, genetically modifying them and then returning them to the patient, they were able to bring about complete remission in some patients. \"We are at the cusp of other important discoveries and developments in this field of cellular immunotherapy, which will have wide-ranging impact on the treatment of many forms of cancer,\" Dr. Rapoport said.

One shining example of its impact is the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center (MPRC), where faculty are working on new techniques in the early diagnosis of schizophrenia. Their studies have found that identifying the disease and treating it early \u2014 even in adolescence \u2014 can help patients overcome this condition and lead fuller lives. As the MPRC continued its critical work, 2013 marked a milestone. William T. Carpenter, MD, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology, stepped down as its distinguished longtime director, retaining his full-time professorship to devote himself to research and teaching. Dr. Carpenter's research and patient care integrates biological, psychological and social data as they pertain to diagnosis, treatment and etiology. As one of the world's leading experts on schizophrenia, he has made fundamental contributions in psychopathology, assessment methodology, testing of new treatments, research ethics and translational science. Robert W. Buchanan, MD, professor of psychiatry and director of the MPRC Outpatient Research Program, has been appointed MPRC interim director. Dr. Buchanan is a nationally recognized expert whose research includes the neurobehavioral and neuroanatomical investigation of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. He also examines novel pharmacological treatment of cognitive impairments and treatment- resistant symptoms in people with schizophrenia. The Center for School Mental Health is another national mental health resource, conducting groundbreaking research and training school professionals nationwide on topics such as averting school-related violence and helping children cope with trauma. These issues were of increasing national importance this year after tragedies such as the school shooting at Newtown, Conn., in December 2012. robert Buchanan, Md, and william Carpenter, MdUMMS/SOM 21 2013 Annual Report MarylaNd CENTEr Of ExCEllENCE ON PrOBlEM gaMBliNg with the presence of casinos growing in the state, the Maryland Center of Excellence on Problem gambling educates health profes-sionals and the public on the dangers of problem gambling. The center was created by the Maryland general assembly and funded by the state department of health and Mental hygiene to mitigate the increase in problem gambling that experts predicted would occur with the legalization of gambling in Maryland. its hotline has received hundreds of calls, and its training programs for professionals teach them to identify and treat the condition. UNdErST aNdiNg dEPrESSiON Basic science research by S COTT THOMpSOn, phD, professor and chair of the department of Physiology, has found that depression may result from a disturbance in the ability of brain cells to communicate with each other. his study indicates a major shift in the understanding of what causes depression and how to treat it. instead of focusing on the levels of hormone-like chemicals in the brain, such as serotonin, the scientists found that the transmission of excitatory signals between cells becomes abnormal in depression. The research could lead to groundbreaking new treatments focusing on these cells, rather than on serotonin.

Sitting in Baltimore surrounded by technol- ogy, the intensivist from the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) was able to zero in on the diagnosis using sophisticated equipment that remotely monitored subtle trends in the patient's vital signs. The physician quickly worked with staff in the local hospital to address the woman's worsening condition. University of Maryland eCare launched on April 30 and currently serves six Maryland hospitals. This fall, University of Maryland eCare will expand to include University of Maryland Shore Regional Health, the Eastern Shore hospital network that is a member of UMMS and that was created with the merger of Shore Health and Chester River Health. Also known as the tele-ICU, this type of telemedicine technology allows intensivists and critical care nurses from a central operations room at the University of Maryland Medical Center campus to oversee patient care in ICUs during night and weekend hours, providing a virtual safety net for these smaller facilities. The staff at local hospitals can also get immediate consultation from an expert on a particular ICU patient during the day, if needed.SErViNg MarylaNd Maryland is a geographically diverse state: The Chesapeake Bay, thousands of acres of farmland or mountainous terrain may stand between many state residents and a major medical center. University of Maryland eCare puts increased expertise in their community hospitals in an efficient, cost-effective way. Computers detect patient trends in vital signs to alert onsite and University of Maryland eCare staff to provide further diagnosis and treatment plans. \"when i'm sitting in the central operations room, i can see all the patients' x-rays, i can see all their vital signs \u2014 every bit of information i would have if i were in that hospital,\" MArC zuBrOw, MD, said. \"if there's a 10 percent increase in heart rate, it will send an electrical signal to me to look at this patient. it may be nothing, but it gets a set of human eyes looking at that patient's overall picture right away.

No one understands that better than the staff at the 12 hospitals in the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS). Over the last two years, UMMS hospitals have made it part of their community mission to be very public about the need to increase blood donations, and they are leading by example. In Fiscal 2013, UMMS became the No. 1 hospital system for blood donations in the American Red Cross Greater Chesapeake Region. Almost 26 percent of UMMS employees donate blood. UMMS collected a record 2,747 units of blood during Fiscal 2013, a total that reflects donations at drives held at UMMS hospitals as well as other community drives sponsored by UMMS throughout the year. Each unit donated can save three lives, which means the UMMS blood donations may have helped more than 8,000 patients throughout Maryland. UMMS hospitals have made a concerted effort to make blood drives more convenient to staff and visitor schedules, to sponsor more drives \u2014 often in tandem with com- munity organizations such as the Baltimore Orioles, the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police, area high schools and others \u2014 and to raise awareness about the need for blood. aCCESS TO BlOOd Blood is of critical importance for any major operation. liver transplants require at least 10 units of blood products to be typed and prepped for each patient before the surgery begins. without access to blood, cardiac, transplant and trauma surgeries would be impossible. Patients who arrive at the r adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center have often lost a great deal of blood from an injury. \"a severely injured patient sometimes requires massive amounts of blood products to save their life,\" said DEBOrAH M.

Davidge Hall was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1997 . It is the oldest medical school building in continuous use in the Western Hemisphere. From these historic roots, the University of Maryland School of Medicine \u2014 the nation's first public medical school \u2014 has grown to achieve top-tier status as a national leader in clinical and academic medicine and biomedical research.

His research team conducted the first direct compari- son of the regenerative abilities of neonatal and adult-derived human cardiac stem cells. Their findings were published in the September 11, 2012, issue of Circulation. Evolution of GenomicsThe study of genes and microbes that normally live in the human body continues to evolve. At the forefront are Scott Devine, PhD, associate professor of medicine, and Claire Fraser, PhD, professor in the depart- ments of Medicine and Microbiology and Immunology and director of the Institute for Genome Sciences. Dr. Devine is contributing to the international \"1,000 Genomes Project.\" Dr. Fraser was part of a team that identi- fied 26 species of naturally-occurring bacteria in the gut associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome.RESEARCH Investigators Find Cell-Replacement/Tissue-Repair Potential in Adult Bone Marrow Stem Cells David Trisler, PhD, assistant professor of neurology, led a team that had promising results in an animal model when they tried using adult stem cells from bone marrow in mice to help create tissue cells of other organs, such as the heart, brain and pancreas. By identifying the potential of these adult CD34+ bone marrow cells to be \"multipotent\" (capable of transforming and functioning as the normal cells in several different organs do), Dr. Trisler and his team hope eventually to discover new ways of replacing cells lost through diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. Ricardo Feldman, PhD, associ-ate professor, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, and his collaborators repro- grammed adult stem cells to devel- op into cells that are genetically similar to and react to drugs in a similar way as cells from patients with Gaucher disease. The stem cells will allow the scientists to test potential new therapies in a dish, accelerating the process toward drug discovery.

Radiation Following Surgery Improves Survival for Elderly Breast Cancer PatientsA study done by Randi Cohen, MD, MS, assistant profes- sor, Department of Radiation Oncology, and her colleagues found that elderly women (ages 70-84) with early-stage breast cancer live longer with radiation therapy and surgery compared with surgery alone. Single-Port Kidney Removal Through Navel Boosts Living- Donor Satisfaction Rolf Barth, MD, associate profes- sor, Department of Surgery, con- ducted the largest study of its kind on living donors who had a kidney removed through a single port in the navel rather than through traditional multiple-port laparoscopic removal. These patients reported higher satisfaction in several key categories com- pared to traditional donors. Additionally, the new technique was associated with fewer limitations in bending, kneeling or stooping following surgery, and slightly less pain after surgery, compared to the multi-port approach. At the same time, the study found the two procedures equally safe. The results were published in Annals of Surgery. TEOdOr T. POSTOlaChE, Md raNdi COhEN, Md, MSA Fishy Way of Inhibiting Cancer Growth Hafiz Ahmed, PhD, assis- tant professor, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and his colleagues at the Institute for Marine and Environmental Technology (IMET), identified a peptide derived from Pacific cod that may inhibit prostate cancer from spreading. The TFD (Thomsen-Friedenreich disaccharide) antigen in the fish protein is hidden in normal human cells but is exposed on the surface of cancer cells and might play a key role in how cancer spreads. The research team developed a special form of TFD, called TFD100. Using animal models, they found that TFD100 binds to galectin-3, a protein that is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells, and blocks its interaction with the TFD antigen found on the surface of the cells. hafiz ahMEd, P hdSCHool of MediCine HiGHliGHtSUMMS/SOM 29 2013 Annual Report The University of Maryland School of Medicine will break ground in the fall of 2013 on the much-anticipated Health Sciences Facility III Research Building. rOlf BarTh, MdUMMS/SOM 30 2013 Annual Report Faculty Practice Expands with UMMS University of Maryland Faculty Physicians, Inc.

In conjunction with the growth of UMMS to 12 member hospitals across the state, FPI has expanded medical practices to a variety of similar locations, to better serve patients in areas that previously might not have had such expertise available locally.CLINICAL CARE EDUCATION Foundation of Research and Critical Thinking A new course has been implemented to prepare medical students for the challenges of clinical practice or research. The course \u2014 Foundations of Research and Critical Thinking \u2014 strengthens the curriculum by requiring each medical student (starting with the Class of 2017) to create and execute a scholarly scientific research project. Each student will select a mentor for his/her project, prepare a proposal and complete either a clinical, translational or basic science research project or a grant application. Students may pursue a dual degree (PhD, MPH, MS) to fulfill this research requirement. Collaborative School of Public Health The University of Maryland, College Park, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore, announced in September 2012 that they are establishing a collabora- tive school of public health to give graduate students at both institutions expanded opportunities in public health education, research, service and training. The Council on Education for Public Health uses the term \"collaborative school of public health\" to describe a school that offers degree programs across more than one institution, but is accredited as a single unit. Currently, there are only three collaborative schools of public health in the country.

UMMC serves as a regional and national referral center for tertiary and quaternary care, with inter-nationally recognized programs in trauma, cancer care, cardiac care, neurocare, women's and children's health, and organ and tissue transplantation. UMMC has grown significantly in national prominence over the last several years. To note: In 2012, a team of plastic and reconstructive surgeons made history by performing the most extensive full-face transplant in the world at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center. In May of 2013, transplant surgeons within the multidisciplinary University of Maryland Liver Center performed a liver transplant on a 49-year-old patient with hilar cholangiocarcinoma \u2014 a rare, often-lethal bile duct cancer \u2014 a first in Maryland. Patients with coronary artery disease who undergo treatment at UMMC now can receive long-term therapy based on information found in their genes. UMMC offers genetic testing to help doctors determine which medication a patient should take after a stenting procedure in order to prevent blood clots that could lead to potentially fatal heart attacks and strokes. Accepting Transfers from Across the Region UMMC is a regional referral center for critical care, with 10 specialized intensive/critical care units and a total of 168 ICU beds and 40 neonatal intensive care bassinets. Each unit is staffed by intensivists, nurses and other professionals with specialized training. Last year, hospitals across the region transferred more than 11,000 patients to UMMC so they could receive specialized care. The new Shock Trauma Critical Care Tower \u2014 nearing completion at the end of 2013 \u2014 began operating its new surgical suites and some units this year. One innovative new unit is the Critical Care Resuscitation Unit, where newly transferred patients are evaluated. A Leader in Patient Safety and Quality of Care UMMC is one of only two hospitals in the US \u2014 and the only one on the East Coast \u2014 to be named a \"Top Hospital\" by the prestigious Leapfrog Group every year since 2006. UMMC made the U.S. News & World Report \"Best Hospitals\" list in five specialty areas during 2013, rated among the top 50 in the categories of Cancer; Ear, Nose and Throat; Gynecology; Nephrology; and Urology. Only 3 percent of more than 5,000 hospitals reviewed for the rankings have even one specialty area ranked in the Top 50. The Cardiac Care Unit has received the presti- gious Beacon Award for Excellence three times in a row since 2009, and is currently recognized at the \"Silver\" level of this honor from the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses. A leader in environmental stewardship in the health care industry, UMMC received the 2013 Partner for Change with Distinction award from Practice Greenhealth, a national organization focused on integrating sustainable practices to enhance patient safety and the quality of care.

Since joining the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) in 2000, the 319-bed medical center in Glen Burnie, Md., has continually grown to meet the needs of the community. Complex surgeries now are performed in high-tech surgical suites, cancer is fought with cutting-edge linear accelerators to deliver radiation with pinpoint accuracy, and heart disease is treated by an award-winning inpatient team. During the past year, the medical center participated in new and innovative endeavors and marked a major milestone. In August 2012, UM BWMC went live with its new electronic medical records system, Portfolio, digitally integrating all of its inpatient and outpatient offices. Whether a patient is admitted to UM BWMC or receives care as an outpatient, his or her physician will have access to important information, such as medical history, allergies, current medications and lab results. This information is secure and protected, making Portfolio efficient and safe. In the future, patients will be able to view their own test results, request prescription refills and ask questions of their provider by using this technology. The sophisticated system eventually will be available at all UMMS hospitals, allowing patients to experience a seamless continuum of care. The Tate Cancer Center marked its 10th anniversary in March of 2013. Since its opening, the team of medical professionals has treated more than 7,200 patients. The center is affiliated with the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center (UMGCC), and employs a team of 20 physicians and 70 medical professionals. The center uses state-of-the-art technology including a PET/CT scanner, the Calypso \u00ae 4D Localization System and the new Trilogy\u00ae linear accelerator, which administers radiation therapy to many types of cancer. Every patient at the center receives an indi- vidualized treatment plan.

As the next step in the partnership with University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS), University of Maryland Charles Regional Medical Center (UM CRMC) has taken a name that conveys the longstanding history of the hospital in the Charles County community. The name also reflects the access UM CRMC can provide to patients as part of an extensive network of advanced health services and research through its affiliation with the University of Maryland Medical Center. The hospital was originally founded by dedicated Charles County physicians who saw the need for a local hospital after the devastating tornado of 1926 that killed 16 people. Nearly 90 years later, the Charles County and Southern Maryland region is experiencing significant growth. Growing Medical Community Over the last year, UM CRMC has continued to expand to meet the needs of the community it serves. University of Maryland Charles Regional Surgical Care and University of Maryland Charles Regional ENT opened in the fall of 2012. Working with UMMS Physician Recruitment Services, UM CRMC successfully recruited seven new physicians to these practices and to other community physician practices in the area the hospital serves. Increased Emergency Department Capacity The Emergency Department (ED) has seen rapid growth in both volume and capacity in FY 2013. Volumes have increased 5 percent during FY 2013 with more than 55,000 visits. To improve the patient experience and accommodate the increased volumes, the ED added a new rapid medical-exam process during peak hours. Expanded capacity was addressed through renovations to add four additional treatment rooms for a total of 38. The expansion reduces patient waiting time and provides quicker access to lab and imaging services. Laboratory Renovations Major renovations expanded UM Charles Regional's laboratory to improve efficiency and meet the growth in patient volumes. Years of planning the multi-phase project came to fruition as the hospital's numerous labs were renovated into a modern, open \"core lab\" configuration, allowing space for the technicians to function more efficiently and more effectively. Additionally, the newly expanded microbiology area and the redesigned histopathology area improve work flow and overall safety. Community Commitment to Blood Drives In successful partnership with three local organizations, UM CRMC increased the outreach for blood drives by 4 percent this year. Drives located at two local churches and the American Legion provide county residents with broad access to the donation sites, increasing participation and availability of blood products for the community. On June 6, 2013, Maryland General Hospital (MGH) changed its name to University of Maryland Medical Center Midtown Campus to reflect its expanded partnership with the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) university campus, located just one mile away. Greater integration with UMMC gives UMMC Midtown Campus the opportunity to focus on inno-vative ways to deliver primary and secondary care to residents of Baltimore, while partnering with UMMC for more complex care. Moving forward, UMMC Midtown Campus will also become the home of the University of Maryland Center for Diabetes and Endocrinology. Award-Winning Patient Care UMMC Midtown Campus staff earned recognition this year for patient safety and quality of care. For the second year in a row, the hospital received the Delmarva Foundation Excellence Award for Quality Improvement from the Delmarva Foundation for Medical Care (DFMC), which is the Medicare Quality Improvement Organization for Maryland. The award honors individual hospitals that excel in patient safety and quality improvement. To qualify, a hospital must meet specific performance improvement criteria on 18 measures in four inpatient clinical areas: acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), heart fail- ure, surgical care improvement and pneumonia. UMMC Midtown Campus also received the Press Ganey Top Improver Award for continuous improvement of clinical measures performance. In March 2013, the UMMC Midtown Campus stroke program received the Gold level Performance Achievement Award from the American Heart Association / American Stroke Association Get with the Guidelines program for the second year in a row. In May 2013, the Intensive Care Unit was recognized for the second time this fiscal year by the Maryland Hospital Association for having zero central line- associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and zero catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) for a one-year period. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CENTER MIDTOWN CAMPUS (FORMERLY MARYLAND GENERAL HOSPITAL)UMMS highlights New Post-Acute Specialty Programs UMMC Midtown Campus was part of the reloca- tion plan for inpatient services from the now-closed University Specialty Hospital. UMMC Midtown Campus expanded to provide 60 Post-Acute Specialty Program beds \u2014 a 40-bed chronic medi- cal-surgical unit and a 20-bed pulmonary care unit. New Outpatient Practices UMMC Midtown Campus was expanded to include four new outpatient programs: Pediatrics at Midtown provides comprehensive primary care to children from birth to age 21.

After months of study and community input, the boards of Shore Health and Chester River Health decided to merge on July 1, 2013, to form University of Maryland Shore Regional Health. The consolidation created a regionalized, coordinated network providing comprehensive health care services to the Mid-Shore residents of Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties, as well as continued affiliation with the University of Maryland Medical Center for patients who need more complex care. The Regionalization Study Committee included board members and administrative leaders from both organizations. The committee's recommendation cited advantages of consolidation that included great- er efficiency and shared resources, expanded access to care and the ability to increase community health education and disease prevention. Coordinated Health Care Network UM Shore Regional Health now operates hospitals in Cambridge, Chestertown and Easton; a freestand- ing emergency center and adjacent medical pavilion in Queenstown; a skilled nursing and rehabilitation center in Chestertown; and outpatient care and diag-nostic centers in Cambridge, Centreville, Denton and Easton. Home care and hospice services will be continued throughout the region. The 132-bed University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton (formerly Memorial Hospital), the 41-bed University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Dorchester (formerly Dorchester General Hospital) and the 41-bed University of Maryland Medical Center at Chestertown (formerly Chester River Hospital) provide high-quality inpatient and outpatient services, including specialty care, emer- gency services, diagnostic and imaging services and comprehensive medical rehabilitation. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND SHORE REGIONAL HEALTH (FORMERLY SHORE HEALTH AND CHESTER RIVER HEALTH)UMMS highlights The University of Maryland Shore Emergency Center at Queenstown (formerly Queen Anne's Emergency Center) provides 24-hour-a-day access to treatment by board-certified emergency medi- cine physicians, experienced nurses, radiology technicians and medical technologists.

WASHINGTON PEDIATRIC HOSPITALUMMS highlights 1708 W. Rogers Avenue Baltimore, MD 21209MWPH.orgMt. Washington Pediatric Hospital in Baltimore is a 102-bed specialty hospital dedicated to offering sophisticated medical care to children in a family- friendly environment so they can heal, go home stronger and lead more independent lives. The hospital is jointly owned and operated by the University of Maryland Medical System and the Johns Hopkins Health System. Fiscal 2013 was a big year for Mt. Washington, which opened its expanded Center for Neonatal Transitional Care (CNTC) \u2014 the only facility of its kind in the Mid-Atlantic region. As newborn patients become stable enough, they transition from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the University of Maryland Medical Center and other acute care facilities to the nursery at the CNTC. For the next several weeks or months, neonatologists, pediatricians and other specialists help the babies and their families focus on feeding and growing, and then on training and planning for life after they are discharged. The upgrade to this unit answered the region's grow- ing demand for neonatal transitional care. It enables clinicians and related staff to serve an additional 100 premature infants and low-birth-weight babies a year. Some of the new features include larger state-of-the- art patient rooms to accommodate more medically complex patients who require large equipment such as ventilators, as well as family lounges, lactation rooms and overnight caregiver suites. With the upgrade, the CNTC is projected to meet the needs of 600 babies a year. The CNTC upgrade was part of a $9.2 million capital campaign that included a complete rede- sign and renovation of Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital's main entrance and lobby. The new entrance includes a covered walkway to protect patients, families and medical transport person- nel from bad weather as they come and go from the hospital. Once inside, they are welcomed by a modern, playful and colorful new lobby, filled with eye-catching bubble tubes with ever-changing hues and an interactive game wall that kids of all ages are finding immensely entertaining. Other highlights of the past year include the hospital making the annual Becker's Hospital Review list of \"100 Great Places to Work in Healthcare,\" and achieving coveted Stage 6 status for the adoption of electronic medical records by HIMSS Analytics. The new Center for Nutritional Rehabilitation gained more attention for its services to children from infancy through adolescence who have medi- cal conditions and nutritional concerns. Children referred to the program for evaluation and treat- ment include those with conditions such as diabe-tes types 1 and 2, failure to thrive or poor growth, childhood obesity, high cholesterol, metabolic syn- drome, celiac disease, food allergies or intolerances and more. After an initial evaluation, patients may be referred to one of a number of programs such as the Feeding Day Program, Endocrinology, Weigh Smart \u00ae or Weigh Smart\u00ae Jr., Nutrition and the Diabetes Clinic.
