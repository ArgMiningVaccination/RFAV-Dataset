NASA missions produce scientific andtechnical challenges that result in many technologicaldevelopments. Since 1976, more than 1,300 documentedNASA technologies have benefited U.S. industry, improvedour quality of life and created jobs for Americans. They arecalled \"spinoffs\" as industry has taken the concept andapplied it to commercial products. The Space Shuttleprogram alone has generated more than 100 technologyspinoffs, utilized by medical, environmental, automotive,sports, computer and refrigeration markets. With its engineering focus on Shuttle processing, Kennedy Space Center has developed materials toimprove various aspects of Shuttle launching and mainte-nance, including safety. Since 1998, there have been 40success stories at KSC. Among the more recent are thedevelopment of Molyseal, the Medevac Oxygen System(MOS) and a converter for fertilizer in 2000; a DNAnalyzerin 1999 and aerogel in 1998. Molyseal, a Non-toxic Coating forAluminum NASA KSC sought to replace chromate-based coatings used on many of its spacecraft with safercoatings. Chromate-based conversion coatings are toxicand carcinogenic in nature. Chromates have been foundto cause irritation of the respiratory tract, dermatitis,asthma and more. The KSC Materials Science Division, under a Small Business Innovation Research contract with Lynntech, ofCollege Station, Tex., developed a molybdate-based con-version coating for aluminum and aluminum alloys.Referred to as Molyseal, the coating does not containchemicals or materials that are hazardous or toxic nordoes it raise health and safety concerns. The coating canbe applied by dipping, painting or spraying in shorttreatment times at low temperatures. KSC envisions future NASA use of Molyseal on Space Shuttle ground support equipment at the launchpad, the Space Shuttle orbiter, solid rocket boosters andother NASA spacecraft and aircraft. Industrial applicationsinclude aerospace, boilers, air conditioners and aluminumconstruction materials.A Transportable Oxygen System forAir-rescue Also in 2000, the KSC Biomedical Office, which had developed the Medevac Oxygen System (MOS), trans-ferred the technology to the U.S. Air Force. MOS providesa therapeutic oxygen supply to patients being flownaboard aircraft during a long-haul medevac scenario. The system was developed to enable a C-130 astronaut medevac team to treat a Space Shuttle crew inthe event of an emergency. Previously, medevac teamsaboard U.S. military aircraft at the Space Shuttle Transat-lantic Abort Landing sites were equipped to handle onlythree patients. Shuttle crews are normally larger. The newly designed MOS can supply up to four patients, and systems can be \"daisy chained.\" The C-130provides a source of gaseous oxygen at about 400 poundsper square inch (psi) from its onboard liquid oxygensupply. The pressure of the gaseous oxygen is reducedby a regulator to 50 psi for distribution to each patientstation. A flow controller and humidifier are provided ateach station. The assembly can be attached to the litter orother patient-carrying device. The output from thehumidifier connects to a no-rebreathing mask. The entire system is packed and stored in a durable, plastic, waterproof case divided and padded to preventdamage during storage and transport.September 2000 FS-2000-09-11-KSC NASASpinoffs National Aeronautics and Space Administration John F. Kennedy Space Center Barry Slack (left), the biomedical electronics technician who created the Medevac Oxygen System kit, and Greg Lowdermilk (right), a program analyst for the DOD Manned Space Flight Support Office, check out a MOS kit. Slack consulted with Lowdermilk in designing the system.The MOS can meet needs for patient oxygen delivery on a variety of airborne and surface platforms. Applica-tions are envisioned on Hercules C-130 aircraft, C-141and C-5 military aircraft, and helicopters. Super Insulation for Space Brought toHomes, Cars Imagine your current refrigerator with expanded storage space but still the same size. This could bepossible through the development of a superinsulationblanket based on a space-age material called aerogel. Through a Small Business Innovation Research contract, Aspen Systems Inc. of Marlborough, Mass.,responded to NASA's need for an aerogel-based cryo-genic insulation system with extremely low thermalconductivity that is flexible, durable and easy to use. Thebasic form of the insulation system is a blanket composedof aerogel-based composites and radiation shield layers.The final product can be a blanket, sheet or clam shellunit. The current primary market for the system is thecryogenic insulation market. Potential space applicationsinclude the Reusable Launch Vehicle, Space Shuttleupgrades, interplanetary propulsion and life supportequipment. For the refrigeration market, the product will allow thinner refrigerator walls, which will increase the refriger-ated volume of the system. For the translucent panel andskylight market, the product will allow significant lighttransmissions with a fraction of the heat loss associatedwith the competing technologies. Other potential markets include household freezers and ovens; offshore oil well underwater pipelines; shippingcontainers; refractory insulation for automotive firewalls,floorboards, exhaust systems, automotive air intake, headliners and race cars; noise suppression panels for aircraftand acoustic damping insulation for buildings; headphones; and much more. DNAnalyzer - Cancer Detection Device Another medical-related spinoff, the DNAnalyzer, resulted from a NASA/American Cancer Society partner-ship, the Space Station In-Flight Cytometry Project. Tohelp decipher the medical mystery of why and howmicrogravity affects the immune system, NASA soughtdevelopment of a machine that could separate andexamine cells rapidly. The existing device was too large - the size of a pool table - to place in an orbiting Space Station, so thepartnership was formed to develop a far more compactflow cytometer. The resulting hardware could supportbiomedical experiments aboard the Space Station whileadvancing medical knowledge in cancer detection andtreatment on Earth. A Miami, Fla., business, RATCOM, Inc., pioneered the new triangular flow cell technology that improves resolu-tion in flow cytometer technology. The cancer-fightingbenefits of flow cytometry include the ability to evaluatecancer cells very early and to determine several importantfeatures, such as the sensitivity of the cancer cells todifferent chemotherapy drugs, the ability of the cells to grow, and their capacity for spreading. The DNAnalyzer allows better understanding of the nature of a patient's tumor, thereby enabling bettertreatment. Dr. Awtar Krishan at the University of Miami,who was instrumental in defining requirements for theinstrument, is carrying out studies on the application of thetechnology in cancer diagnosis and therapy. Other potential uses of the new technology involve early detection of leukemia, chemo-sensitivity studies priorto chemotherapy, antibody analysis, and detection ofpathogenic organisms. Toxic Emissions Converted to Fertilizer The newly issued U. S. patent has an environmental twist. The concept was devised by Clyde Parrish ofDynacs, Inc., the Engineering Development Contractor(EDC) at KSC, in response to a request from NASA toeliminate the hazardous waste stream that is captured in ascrubber when the toxic oxidizer is transferred fromstorage tanks into rockets and vice versa. This newscrubber captures nitrogen tetroxide in water wherehydrogen peroxide oxidizes the resulting nitrous acid intonitric acid. The nitric acid is neutralized with potassiumhydroxide to form the product potassium nitrate - aprimary fertilizer material, with fewer impurities thancommercially available fertilizers. The process can be upto 99 percent efficient. The Nitrogen Tetroxide Scrubber has been installed in the Oxidizer Farm at Launch Pad 39A. Plans at KSC call for the resulting fertilizer to be used on the orange groves that KSC leases to outside compa-nies. The fertilizer will replace 10 percent of the amountannually purchased by KSC. KSC plans to install the system at all scrubbers, and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station plans to install thecontrol system at the Titan Launch Complex 40. Thecontrol system could also be used at Vandenberg AirForce Base in California and the White Sands Test Facility,New Mexico. The system reduces emissions to less than 10 percent of previous levels, a plus on which PhoenixSystems International, Inc. (McDonald, Ohio), the newlicensee, wanted to capitalize. The company anticipatesusing the NASA technology to apply to at least 40 percentof the country's coal-, oil-, and gas-fired boilers, and also wants to establish a joint technology with a sulfuric dioxide (SO2) scrubber manufacturer. Other Recent KSC Spinoffs Advanced Lubricants: Sun Coast Chemicals of Daytona, Inc. (SCCD) is commercializing multiple productsbased on a biodegradable, non-toxic lubricant it originallydeveloped to replace the Space Shuttle Crawler's stan-dard lubricant. The X-1R Crawler Track Lubricant (CTL)led to an industrial product line of 19 separate specialtylubricants. The first three industrial products were: Train Track Lube , used to solve wear problems for the Florida Power Corporation's railroad system; Penetrating Spray Lube (PSL), used in applications where spray lubrication was needed for rustprevention; Biodegradable Hydraulic Fluid (BHF) , which has an oxidation life of 10,000 hours. BHF is being soldthrough Motion Industries, the largest industrialmaintenance and equipment supplier in the U.S., toDuPont Corporation, Kitchens of the Oceanprocessing plant, as well as the sugar, agricultural,pulp and paper, forestry and sawmill, marine,mining, and heavy construction industries. SCCD's newer retail product line has targeted the sports market, providing lubricants for gun cleaning,skates, air tools, fishing reels, bicycles, and an air condi-tioning retrofit kit. These spinoff products have been soldin retail stores nationwide. SCCD is also negotiating with the television home shopping network QVC to market their products. Inaddition, the company is expanding into a marine line ofproducts for boats, new products for racing cars, motor-cycles, and go-carts, along with a multi-use handy pack. Founded in 1989, SCCD established its reputation with its first product, X-1R Concentrate Friction Eliminator,developed for the NASCAR racing circuit, to protectengines and transmissions from heat and wear damage. Automotive Insulation: BSR Products created special thermal protection system materials from theSpace Shuttle Thermal Protection System and used it forNASCAR autos to protect drivers from extreme heatcoming through engine areas. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR): An image process technology used to sharpen the view of Jupiterand Saturn from Voyager and Mars from the Viking Probewas used by Michael Vannier, M.D., a former NASAengineer. He recognized the similarity of NASA's comput-erized image processing technology and nuclear magneticresonance. With KSC's help he developed a computerprogram enabling NMR to scan body tissue for earlierdiagnoses. Dr. Vannier feels that \"satellite imaging\" hasopened a new window into the human body. Parking Garage Automation System: Merritt Systems developed an obstacle detection system toensure that robots avoid collisions in their workplace. Thecommercial potential ranges from use in robotic manufac-turing systems to remote hazardous waste cleanup. Thetechnology was also developed for a parking garageautomation system that uses sensors to direct customers to garages and to control parking conditions. Built-In Plant Nutrient: ZeoponiX, Inc. is manufac- turing zeolite materials as a spinoff of NASA's advancedlife support technology. The result is a growth medium-specialty fertilizer that improves plant performance. NASA Medical-Related Spinoffs America's space program has helped revolutionize the practice of medicine through improvements in bloodpressure monitors, self-adjusting pacemakers, EKGs,exercise equipment and ultrasound images, as well as theitems listed below. Laser Angioplasty: From laser technology for remote sensing of the ozone layer, Advanced Inter-dentinal Systems, Irvine, Calif., developed a cool laser thatuses ultraviolet light energy to operate on human tissue. Digital Cardiac Imaging (DCI) System: Designed by Phillips Medical Systems International, DCI uses imageprocessing technology on a monitor of the heart's regions,following a catheter as it moves. The technology wasdeveloped for NASA Earth remote-sensing satellites. Digital Imaging Breast Biopsy System: Goddard Space Flight Center contracted with Scientific ImagingTechnologies, Inc. (SITe) to develop a new advancedcharge coupled device that could be manufactured atlower cost. SITe applied the NASA-driven enhancementsto develop a technique called the LORAD Stereo GuideBreast Biopsy System, which incorporates SITe's chargecoupled device as part of a digital camera system that\"sees\" a breast structure with x-ray vision. Artificial Heart: The technology used in Space Shuttle fuel pumps led to the development of a miniatur-ized ventricular assist pump by NASA and renowned heartsurgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey. The tiny pump - twoinches long, one inch in diameter and weighing less thanfour ounces - has been successfully implanted into morethan 20 people. Diagnostic Instrument: NASA technology was used to create a compact laboratory instrument for hospitalsand doctors' offices that more quickly analyzes blood,doing it in 30 seconds instead of 20 minutes. Bioreactor: Developed for Space Shuttle medical research, this rotating cell culture apparatus simulatessome aspects of the space environment, or microgravity,on the ground. Tissue samples grown in the bioreactorare being used to design therapeutic drugs and antibod-ies. Some scientists believe the bioreactor will routinelyproduce human tissue for research and transplantation. Infrared Thermometer: Infrared sensors developed to remotely measure the temperature of distant stars andplanets led to the development of the hand-held opticalsensor thermometer. Placed inside the ear canal, thethermometer provides an accurate reading in two secondsor less. Lifesaving Light: Special lighting technology developed for plant growth experiments on Space Shuttlemissions is now used to treat brain tumors in children.Doctors at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukeeuse light-emitting diodes in a treatment called photody-namic therapy, a form of chemotherapy, to kill canceroustumors.Prosthesis Material: Responding to a request from the orthopedic appliance industry, NASA recommendedthat the foam insulation used to protect the Shuttle'sexternal tank replace the heavy, fragile plaster used toproduce master molds for prosthetics. The new material islight, virtually indestructible and easy to ship and store. Insulation Pumps: Implantable and external insulin pumps, which are based on technology used on the MarsViking spacecraft, have aided insulin-dependent diabetics.These computerized pumps can infuse insulin at a pre-programmed rate, allowing more precise control of bloodsugar level and eliminating the need for daily injections. Other Spinoffs Infrared Camera: A sensitive infrared hand-held camera that observes the blazing plumes from the Shuttlealso is capable of scanning for fires. Designed by the JetPropulsion Laboratory Center for Space Microelectronicsin partnership with Amber, a Raytheon company, thecamera can also be used for night vision and navigation.During the brush fires that ravaged Malibu, Calif., in 1996,the camera was used to point out hot spots for firefighters. Rescue Tool: Rescue squads have an extrication tool to help remove accident victims from wreckedvehicles. The hand-held device requires no auxiliarypower systems or cumbersome hoses and is 70 percentcheaper than previous rescue equipment. The cutter usesa miniature version of the explosive charges that separatedevices on the Shuttle. Jewelry Design Equipment: Jewelers no longer have to worry about inhaling dangerous asbestos fibersfrom the blocks they use as soldering bases. SpaceShuttle heat shield tiles offer jewelers a safer solderingbase with temperature resistance far beyond the 1,400degrees F. generated by the jeweler's torch.It Began with the Apollo Program The quality of American life took a giant leap forward with the technologies emerging from the Apollo program,especially in health care. Here are some of the contribu-tions: Kidney Dialysis: Dialysis machines were developed as a result of a NASA-developed chemical process toremove toxic waste from used dialysis fluid. Physical Rehabilitation: A cardiovascular condi- tioner developed for astronauts in space led to thedevelopment of a physical therapy and athletic develop-ment machine used by football teams, sports clinics andmedical rehabilitation centers. Water Purification: The technology for purifying water, used on the Apollo spacecraft, now is used to killbacteria, viruses and algae in community water supplysystems and cooling towers. Also, filters mounted onfaucets can reduce lead in water supplies. Vacuum Metallizing Techniques: These led to an extensive line of commercial products, from insulatedouter garments and packaging for foods, to wall coverings,window shades, life rafts, candy wrappings, reflectiveblankets and photographic reflectors. Cordless Power Tools: A NASA requirement during the Apollo program, re-chargeable tools were developed topermit astronauts to do repairs in space.
