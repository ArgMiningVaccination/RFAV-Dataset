The 2007 estimated population was 6,345,289. On the 2000 ce nsus form, 98.8% of the population reported only one race, with 8.4% reporting being A frican-American; 3.5% are Hispanic (of any race). The average household size is 2.53 p ersons compared to an average family size of 3.05 persons . According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Indiana ranks number one in the nation in percentage of workers (19.8%) who wor k in manufacturing, followed by Wisconsin (19.4%). Jobs in management, business or financial occupations are not as prevalent and Indiana ranks 42 nd in the nation. Service jobs make up 15.7% of the workers in Indiana and Indiana ranks 35 th in the nation. The average woman makes $31,158 per year and the average man makes $43,410. Both figures are below the national average of $34,278 and $44,255 respectivel y. In 55.8% of Indiana households, both parents work outside the home; nationwide it i s 53.4%. Indiana ranks 24 th in the nation for the percentage of households earning bel ow the poverty level (12.3%). The median household income in Indiana is $47,448 (31 st in the nation). Indiana has 129 acute care hospitals with emer gency departments, as of August, 2007; this includes two Veterans' Administration Hospital s operated by the federal government, one in Indianapolis and one in Fort Wayne. The cou nt excludes 20 long-term care and/or rehabilitation hospitals, as well as psychiatric ho spitals. Sixteen of the 92 counties in Indiana do not have a hospital: Newton, Benton, Car roll, Fountain, Parke, Owen, Brown, Union, Franklin, Ohio, Switzerland, Martin, Pike, C rawford, Spencer, and Posey. Currently, 46 of the 129 acute care hospitals in th e state are considered rural (located in Non-Metropolitan Counties). Thirty-five Indiana Ho spitals are designated as Critical Access Hospitals. Trauma significantly impacts the lives of Hoosiers. Consider that injury \u2014 not cancer or any disease \u2014 is the leading cause of death for sta te citizens 1 to 34 years of age. More than 95,000 Hoosiers are hospitalized and more than 5,000 die from injuries each year. The monetary cost to Hoosiers each year is astronom ical. Just the subset of alcohol- related motor vehicle crashes (only 24% of Indiana' s crash costs) cost the public an estimated $2.4 billion in 1998, including $1.1 bill ion in monetary costs and almost $1.3 billion in quality of life losses. Add the remaind er of the motor vehicle crashes along with all of the other causes of injuries, and the c ost to Hoosiers is estimated to be in the $10's of billions. The costs of these traumatic in juries can be significantly reduced through timely and effective treatment of the injur ies as well as through effective injury prevention programs ($1 spent on a child safety sea t saves $32 in direct medical costs; $1 spent on bicycle helmets saves $30 in direct medica l costs; $1 spent on a smoke alarm saves $69 in fire related costs & $21 in direct med ical costs). Trauma refers to people who have sustained moderate to severe injuries, requiring rapid evaluation and transport to hospitals with trauma c enters that are best equipped to provide the comprehensive care needed. All hospital emergen cy departments are not trauma centers. A trauma system is an organized, coordina ted effort in a geographic area that 5 delivers the full range of care to all injured pati ents. Until March 2006, Indiana was among a handful of states with no laws or regulatio ns granting oversight authority for trauma care. Proper oversight is a necessary eleme nt of any trauma system. Public Law 155, enacted in 2006 with support from resolutions by the Indiana State Medical Association and the Indiana Emergency Nurses Associ ation, changed that situation . This legislation designated the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) as the lead agency for a state trauma care system with goals of preven ting injuries and coordinating care for injured patients in order to reduce death and disab ility. However, even prior to enactment of Public Law 155, there were efforts in Indiana to develop a trauma system. In the 1990's, there was an Indiana trauma planning effort called the Indiana Trauma Assessment Group (ITAG) t hat ran into obstacles because of the inability to obtain a universal patient identif ier to be able to track patients through the entire system of care for the examination of patien t outcomes. In 2001, a group of stakeholders completed a trauma/disaster preparedne ss assessment that was published by HRSA in 2002 as part of a national state by state a ssessment of trauma system and disaster preparedness. There was a stakeholders me eting in 2002 and a SWOT analysis was performed. 2004 was the year that the current e ffort began with the ISDH working together with a multidisciplinary, multi-hospital, multi-organization group of 50 members interested developing a state trauma system. The Indiana State Department of Health Trauma Syste m Advisory Task Force, organized in May, 2004 as a stakeholder group, crit ically needed to work on all aspects of trauma system development and maintenance. The Task Force has broad representation from numerous organizations and individuals interes ted in developing a statewide trauma care system, with more than 100 people currently in volved. Issues being considered by the Task Force include: leadership and authority fo r a statewide trauma system, policies, legislation and financing needed for such a system, system design (based on data and needs assessments), education of policy-makers, hea lth professionals and the public, information management and quality of care indicato rs, collaboration, and resources to support a statewide system. Task Force conclusions so far: The goal of a statewide trauma system is preventing injuries and coordinating care of injured patients to accomplish decreased death and disabilities due to trauma. It is desirable for all Indiana hospitals to eventu ally be part of a statewide trauma system, based on the level of care each hospital is able to provide. System participation by hospitals would be voluntar y. Collaboration between emergency medical services, h ospitals, rehabilitation facilities and public health is need ed. A statewide trauma registry is necessary because it provides a proven mechanism to examine trauma patient care data on a confidential basis. 6 All hospitals participating in the system must prov ide data to the state trauma registry. There should be a legislatively identifiable and su stainable source of financing. Widespread education is needed to inform numer ous constituencies (legislators, hospitals, and the public) about a statewide trauma system and that trauma is an important public health and health care delivery is sue because of its major impact on the lives and health of Hoosiers. The trauma registry ( www.indianatrauma.org ) is the foundation component of the trauma system, providing the ability to monitor the system for efficiency and effectiveness, inclusive of local level use for imp roved patient care and outcomes. The Indiana Trauma Registry was implemented in 2007, wi th initial participation by the seven hospitals in Indiana that are verified as Level I o r Level II trauma centers by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (A CS-COT): Deaconess and St. Mary's hospitals in Evansville, both Level II; Park view Hospital in Fort Wayne, Level II; Clarian Methodist Hospital, Riley Hospital for Chil dren, and Wishard Memorial Hospital in Indianapolis, all Level I; and Memorial Hospital in South Bend, Level II. Several other Indiana hospitals have volunteered to participate in the initial phase of the registry. In 2008, fifteen critical access hospital s participated in a pilot project with the state trauma registry. They entered data on their injured patients that were transferred to a higher level of care for the two-month period of June and July, 2008. They are continuing to provide feedback regarding the use of the registry. So far, the feedback has been positive and good suggestions have been made f or improvements to the transfer record form that they use. The vendor that was cho sen for the registry is ImageTrend from Minneapolis. ImageTrend has conducted tests t o ensure the compatibility of the program with the data from the Firehouse reporting software that is being used by EMS and paramedics; linkage with the Firehouse system w ill occur when Indiana's Firehouse upgrades are completed in 2009. Some states with trauma systems have a review process to designate hospitals according to the level of care that can be provided to injured patients - ranging from emergency department evaluation and stabilization i n smaller hospitals to the most comprehensive levels of care provided in hospitals verified by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT). Indiana h as the seven hospitals listed above with Level I or Level II trauma centers as ve rified through a strenuous review process by the ACS-COT. After two years of study, the task force recom mends pursuing a consultation agreement with the Committee on Trauma of the Ameri can College of Surgeons, a non- biased, nationally-recognized organization. They wo uld be charged to evaluate the resources, legislation, trauma care delivery, traum a registries/data analysis, performance improvement, interagency cooperation/communication, professional/community education, and injury prevention and control curren tly in Indiana. The trauma system 7 consultation team will provide knowledge and experi ence from other states which will help Indiana as trauma system development proceeds. This consultation requires intensive advance preparation, a four-day visit fro m the College and the consultation team includes professionals from surgery, emergency medicine, trauma nursing and emergency medical services.

Of these, 9,219 were unintentional, 4,400 were intentional, a nd 696 were undetermined (Figure 3). The majority of unintentional injuries were due to motor vehicle crashes followed by poisoning (Figure 4). Thirty-five percent of the m otor vehicle traffic incidents were occupant fatalities, 9.4 percent involved motorcycl ists, 7.6 percent were pedestrian fatalities, and 0.3 percent involved pedal cyclists . Of the intentional deaths, 1,432 were from homicide, 40 (1%) were from legal intervention , and 2,928 were from suicide (Figure 5). Over half (56.9%) of the suicide death s occurred by firearms and 67.7% of homicides occurred by firearms. When comparing genders, male injury rates were high er than female rates. Figure 6 shows injury rates for males and compares the Unite d States, the Midwest, and Indiana. Indiana's suicide death rate for males was higher t han both the United States and the Midwest rates. Figure 7 shows injury rates for fem ales and the comparison between the United States, Midwest, and Indiana. Indiana femal es had the highest rate for all injuries and homicide as compared to both the US and Midwest rates. Based on national data, males are at increased risk for motor vehicle crashes, falls, drowning, and homicides. Men over the age of 65 ye ars have the highest suicide rate. They may be less likely to ask for help putting the m at an increased risk for depression, a risk factor in suicide. Women are often physically or sexually assaulted by an intimate partner and are also often hospitalized for suicide attempts. Among older women (aged 65 years and older), there is an increased risk of falling and sustaining a hip fracture, with osteoporosis being a major contributor to this type of injury. The census population of Indiana is almost equally distributed by gender, with females accounting for 50.7 percent (based on Indiana 2006 census population at www.census.gov ). Males though have higher injury death rates tha n females for all age groups (Figure 8). During 2002-2005, males account ed for 68 percent of all injury deaths and were 2.4 times as likely as females to be fatal ly injured. The leading cause of unintentional injury death for both genders during 2002-2005 was motor vehicle traffic crashes. The motor vehicle t raffic crashes accounted for 44.7 % of the deaths in males and 35.1% of the deaths in fema les. Other leading causes of unintentional injury deaths in males included poiso ning (13.3%) and falls (10%). As for females, who accounted for 32% of all injury deaths , other leading causes of unintentional injury deaths include falls (14.9%), poisoning (12.2%) and suffocation (8.7%). Suicide was the 7 th leading cause of death for males during 2002-2005. Firearms accounted for 61.6% of all suicides followed by suf focation (22.2%) and poisoning 15 (11.8%). Homicide was the 13 th leading cause of death for males and firearms were used in 74.2% of the intentional injury deaths. Suicide was the 19 th leading cause of death for females during 2002-2005. Poisoning accounted for 41.2% of all intentional injury deaths followed by firearms (25.8%) and suffocation (16.8%). The distribution of the leading causes of injury-re lated deaths varied by age groups. Injury rates of death were highest among the 75-yea r and older age groups (125.8 per 100,000 among persons 75 to 84 years and 330.42 per 100,000 among persons 85 years and older. See Figure 8. Following these age grou ps, rates were high among persons aged 20 to 24 years (75.1 per 100,000). The lowest rates of injury death were among persons aged 5 to 9 (7.0 per 100,000). Males, aged 85+, had the highest rate of injury death (451.4 per 100,000) and females, aged 85+, ha d the second highest rate of injury (281.1 per 100,000).

Describe the epidemiology of injury in your region and unique features of: a. Children - Elementary school age children (aged 5 to 9 years): From 2002 to 2005, the leading cause of death for elementary sch ool age children was unintentional injuries with 102 deaths. Elementary school age children received more fatal injuries from motor vehicle traffic-rela ted incidents (48%) than from any other cause. Fall-related injuries within this age group accounted for approximately a third (29%) of hospitalizations but this injury mechanism is not among the top five leading causes of death. Drowni ng and fire-related injuries accounted for 27 percent of all unintentional injur y deaths in this age group. Homicide was the forth leading cause of death with 14 deaths during this time frame. Firearms accounted for approximately 25% of the homicides. b. Adolescents - (aged 10 to 19 years): The \"pre-teen \"and adolescent age groups demonstrate an expanded list of injury prevention c oncerns to consider. From 2002 to 2005, the leading cause of death for adoles cents was unintentional injuries with 739 deaths. In Indiana, motor vehicl e traffic incidents were by far the leading cause of injury and death among childre n and teens (aged 10 to 19 years). Among them, 76 percent of unintentional in jury deaths and 42 percent of all hospital admissions resulted from traffic crash es. While driving a car becomes a common \"rite of passage\" for 16-year-olds in Indi ana, their driving skills only improve with experience in operating a motor vehicl e. Impulsive, risk-taking behavior continues with this age group which may in clude experimentation with or involvement in alcohol and substance abuse. Whi le falls are the second leading cause for unintentional injury hospital admission i n this age group, poisoning (5.5%) and drowning (3.5%) are the next leading cau ses of unintentional injury deaths. Suicide and suicide attempts are also impo rtant causes of injuries. The 20 second leading cause of death for adolescents was s uicide with 159 deaths, and the third leading cause of death was homicide with 151 deaths. The youth risk behavior survey is also a tool to de termine information about injuries relating to violence and suicide for stude nts in grades 9-12. According to the youth risk behavior survey from 2007, the perce ntage of students in grades 9- 12 who carried a gun during the past thirty days wa s 9.1% compared to 5.8% during 2005 (statistically significant). Over 9.5% of students indicated they had been threatened or injured with a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on school property one or more times during the past 12 month s which is higher and statistically significant than 8.8% in 2005. Suici de attempts and planning attempts went down during 2007 compared to 2005 and were statistically significant. Over eleven percent (11.7%) of studen ts (compared to 14.8% in 2005) made a plan about how they would attempt suic ide. Over 7% of students actually attempted suicide one or more times compar ed to 9.6% of students in 2005. There were 2.9% of the students who indicate d that they had made a suicide attempt that resulted in an injury, poisoni ng or overdose and had to be treated by a doctor or nurse (compared to 3.5% duri ng 2005). c. Elderly people - (aged 65 years and older): Both physical and cognitive changes play a role in older Americans' susceptibility to motor vehicle-related injuries, falls, and suicide. As Americans age, their bones become more fragile, they experience problems with vision, their reflexes bec ome slower and some are cognitively impaired by mental illness and/or depre ssion. Although Americans are living healthier and longer lives, facing the r eality of poor vision, limited mobility, the loss of loved ones, and/or the develo pment of chronic illnesses can be devastating. Feelings of isolation and adjustin g to a less active lifestyle increase the risk of suicide. The rates of death d ue to injury for the elderly population are between two and four times higher th an all other age groups. The elderly aged 75-84 has almost a two-fold higher rat e of death compared to the next highest aged group of 20 to 24 year olds (75.1 per 100,000 versus 125.8 per 100,000) and the 85+ year olds have over a four fol d higher death rate (330.42 per 100,000) compared to the 20-24 year olds. In India na, falls, motor vehicle traffic incidents, and poisoning continue to be the leading causes of unintentional injury hospitalizations for elderly citizens. Among this age group, falls accounted for an overwhelmingly 85 percent of all unintentional inju ry hospitalizations. From 2002 to 2005, unintentional injuries were the 9 th leading cause of death in the elderly with 3,124 deaths. Almost 30% of the death s were due to falls, and 20.3% were due to motor vehicle crashes. Suicide was the 19 th leading cause of injury death in elderly people and approximately 80% of th e deaths occurred with a firearm. d. Other special populations: Infants (less than one year of age) - From 2002 to 2005, 161 infants died due to unintentional injuries, the sixth leading cause of death for this age group. The majority (84.5%) were due to suffocation. Of the s uffocation deaths, 48.5% of 21 the deaths were due to accidental suffocation and s trangulation in bed. The rate of injury death for black infants during 2002-2005 was 165.7 per 100,000 which is over three times higher compared to white infant s (53.17 per 100,000). The primary cause of hospital admissions for infants wa s falls and accounted for 36 % of all hospitalizations. Adults (20-64 years of age) - Unintentional injuries were the third leading cause of death among adults from 2002 to 2005. Of the 4, 923 deaths, over half (51%) were due to motor vehicle crashes and nearly one-fo urth (22%) were the result of poisoning. Falls are also of concern, emerging as the sixth leading cause of unintentional death beginning at aged 35 years, the n becoming the 3 rd leading cause at aged 45 years. Unintentional falls are al so the 2 nd leading cause of hospital admissions for persons aged 20 to 44 years . Beginning at age 45, falls are the primary reason for hospitalization, ranging from 41% of unintentional injury related hospitalizations for persons aged 45 to 54 years to 85% for persons aged 55 to 64 years. Suicide was the fourth leadin g cause of death with 2,367 deaths, and homicide was the ninth leading cause of death with 1,096 for the four- year time period. Suicide by firearm and homicide by firearm, among the leading contributors for intentional injuries for persons a ged 20 to 64 years, accounted for 54 percent of all intentional injury suicide deaths and 74% of all intentional injury homicide deaths in this age group. Homicide as a c ause of death predominated in the 20 to 34 year-old age groups. Suicide by suffo cation and poisoning are also of concern in the 20 to 64 year age groupings, compris ing 42 percent of intentional injury deaths among them, and suicide by poisoning is the primary reason for hospital admission (93%). Although most adults are experienced motor vehicle drivers, the role of unsafe driving practices, fail ure to wear a seat belt, or driving while intoxicated continue to be contributing facto rs to the toll of death and injuries related to motor vehicle crashes. Since falls are the primary cause of hospital admis sion for unintentional injuries for 45 to 64 year olds, the behavioral risk factor surveillance survey (BRFSS, 2006 survey) asks questions about recent falls and if the fall caused an injury. Among 45-54 year olds, 14.9% indicated that they ha d fallen 1-4 times within the past three months and of those who had fallen, 38.8 % said the fall caused an injury. Among 55-64 year olds, 15.6% answered they had fallen 1-4 times within the past three months and of those who had fallen, 31.1% indicated that the fall caused an injury. Note: At the trauma center level, there are differ ences in the way that the age groups are defined and data is collected. For exam ple, Deaconess Hospital in Evansville (ACS Level II) defines children <15 year s of age as pediatric patients. Those > 15 years of age are considered adults. They curren tly do not break down ages for Adolescents or Elders. Because they are an Illinois verified trauma center they do include falls from a standing position requ iring hospitalization. They do, however, have the capability to filter data for any age group needed. 22 2. Describe the databases that are used to formulat e the injury epidemiology profile (for example, population-based and clinical). Three primary data sources were utilized to compile fatal and nonfatal injury data for Indiana: Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS), Fatality Analysis Repor ting System (FARS), and Indiana Hospital Discharge Data. Other resources such as th e Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillan ce System (BRFSS), and the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute have also been u sed to collect data. At the hospital level, there are three different re gistry software types in use by the seven trauma centers in Indiana: Riley Hospital, Wishard Hospital and Clarian Methodist Hospital (all ACS Level I) use Digital Innovation's Collector database. Deaconess Hospital and Memorial Hospital in South Bend (both ACS Level II) use Digital Innovation's NTRACS database. St. Mary's Medical C enter in Evansville and Parkview Hospital (both ACS Level II) in Fort Wayne use Clin ical Data Management's Trauma Base. 3. Have system epidemiology profile results (for ex ample, mortality rates, distribution of mechanism, or intent) been compared with benchmark values? If so, please provide comparisons and origins of the benchmarks. Yes. Indiana's death rate for all injuries was 57.1 per 100,000 from 2002 to 2005 which was hi gher than the United States' rate of 56.34 per 100,000 (Figure 1). Indiana's suicide an d legal intervention rates were also higher than the United States rates. Indiana's inj ury death rate in comparison to other states ranks 28 th for all intents, 33rd for unintentional injuries, and 26 th for intentional injuries. Indiana's death rate for all injuries wa s also higher than the Midwest rate (53.9 per 100,000) (Figure 2) and had the 4 th highest age-adjusted rate for all injuries. Indiana's unintentional, homicide, legal interventi on, and suicide death rates were also higher than the Midwest rates. When comparing betw een other Midwest states, Indiana had the 7 th highest unintentional death rate and 2 nd highest rate for violence-related injury deaths. At the hospital level, the trauma centers submit da ta annually to the National Trauma Data Bank, which allows for benchmarking against co mparable hospitals (size and trauma level) nationally. The NTDB makes these rep orts available on a yearly basis, and the trauma centers can review these results to ensu re that they address areas for improvement and recognize areas of excellence. An example of 2007 NTDB data for one trauma center (Memorial Hospital, South Bend) is be low: Patient Characteristics: /head2right Age distribution of patients injured in MVCs and by firearm/piercing instruments peaks from 36-55 years (73.3% male) and a second pe ak from 17-25 years (72.7% male). /head2right Age distribution for fall-related incidents peaks i n the > 65 year age group (68.6% female). A second peak occurs from 36 -55 years (63.5% male). /head2right In comparison, the age distribution of patients in NTDB peaks from 16-24 years, representing patients injured in motor vehicle traf fic related incidents and by firearm. There is a second peak between ages 35-44, including motor vehicle traffic related injuries. A third smaller peak occu rs between ages 72-85, consisting 23 of motor vehicle traffic related injuries and falls . Up to age 70, males predominate, but after age 70, most patients are fe male. Mechanism: /head2right Falls account for 47.3% of cases entered into the t rauma registry and 39.7% of the deaths; falls were associated with the second large st number of both hospital days and ICU days; average hospital LOS is 5 days and IC U LOS 3.4 days. In the comparative NTDB data, falls account for 27.2% of c ases, 22% mortality and are associated with the second largest number of hospit al and ICU days. /head2right MVC related injuries account for 32% of trauma regi entries; these injuries account for 34.5% of mortality; MVCs were responsib le for the largest number of hospital days (average 7) and ICU days (average 6.4 ). In comparison, MVCs account for 41.3% of cases in the 2006 NTDB, 44.5% mortality and are associated with the largest number of hospital and ICU days. /head2right Penetrating injuries (firearm or piercing instrumen ts) account for 8.2% registry cases and 12% mortality. Average hospital days of 3 .0 and ICU days 3.4. In the NTDB data, firearm injuries represent 5.6%, peak ar ound 19 years and account for 22% mortality. Other mechanisms such as struck, machinery, bike, a ssault or abuse represent the final 12.5% of registry cases and 13.8% mortality. In the NTDB data, injuries resulting from being struck by/against represent 6.4% of injuries. 4. Describe how emerging injury control patterns (f or example, from trend or surveillance data) were identified and acted on. Suicide is one of the main injuries that have been identified and acted on in Indiana. In 2001, in re sponse to the national call to action and the magnitude of the problem in Indiana, the Indian a Suicide Prevention Coalition (ISPC) was formed. ISPC is actively working to have all r egions of the state as well as a variety of stakeholders including health, mental health, ed ucation, policy makers, coroner's office, the faith community, survivors of suicide, youth, elderly, people of diverse racial, ethnic, and gender backgrounds, and others represen ted on the Coalition. The mission of ISPC is to coordinate, facilitate, a dvise, and provide resources to Indiana communities for activities that reduce deaths due t o suicide, the occurrence of suicidal behaviors, and the effects of suicide on Indiana ci tizens. ISPC's on-going activities include coordinating information sharing via bi-mon thly Coalition meetings, a listserv, and a statewide email list; facilitating the growth of local suicide prevention councils in counties and regions across Indiana; raising awaren ess of the prevalence of suicide, the devastating impact it has on families, and it's pre ventability; helping communities and organizations find and implement suicide prevention and intervention training; providing resources to organizations and community members re garding suicide facts, trends, events, and evidence-based programs. The Coalition also aids schools in responding to suicidal students by both distributing a Youth Suic ide Prevention School-Based Guide to help schools plan prevention, intervention, and pos t intervention efforts, and updating and distributing the Indiana Department of Education's Student Suicide manual used by Guidance Counselors and Social Workers. Past activi ties include conducting telephone surveys to determine Hoosiers' knowledge and awaren ess of suicide and suicide prevention to help refine Indiana's suicide prevent ion programs and surveying Indiana 24 schools and youth-serving organizations' efforts re garding suicide prevention, intervention, and post intervention programs and se rvices. In addition to the statewide coalition, Indiana has eleven local suicide prevention councils working in communities across the state to prevent suicide. The local/regional councils and coalitions around Indiana have developed in res ponse to local needs (Allen County St. Joseph County, Dubois County, and Elkhart Count y) or via efforts by ISPC to bring together interested stakeholders to discuss suicide prevention efforts in their community (Vigo County, Southwestern Indiana, and Northwester n Indiana). The local/regional councils are engaged in different activities such a s working with funeral directors to distributing awareness materials (Vigo County), bui lding survivor resources (St. Joseph County), researching barriers to screening with phy sicians (Allen County), and training school staff in QPR (Question, Persuade, and Refer) , a suicide prevention program, (Dubois County). ISPC has a state suicide prevention plan that local /regional councils can use as a blue- print to shape their community plan. ISPC is availa ble in an advisory capacity for the regional and county-level suicide prevention counci ls to offer resources and technical assistance in developing, implementing and evaluati ng their own suicide prevention strategies and plans. The Coalition also helps coor dinate statewide efforts and resources, establish suicide prevention and intervention strat egies, and document and monitor the implementation of the statewide plan for suicide pr evention. Efforts by the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute i n cooperation with the Indiana State Police, the state CODES Board of Directors, the Tra ffic Records Coordinating Committee and others have led to changes in Indiana 's child restraint and adult seatbelt laws. Prior to these efforts, occupants of passeng er trucks were not required by law to wear a seatbelt. IC 9-19-10-2 (effective July 1, 2007) states that each front seat occupant of a passenger motor vehicle equipped with safety b elts must be properly fastened when the vehicle is in forward motion. Indiana state la w (2005) now also requires children less than 8 years old to ride in a federally approved ca r seat or booster seat that is appropriate for the child's height and weight; it also requires that the car seat or booster seat be installed and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Children ages 8 to 16 must ride in a seat belt. Below is a press release describing the results of the change in the seatbelt law: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE July 28, 2008 Indiana Seat Belt Usage Rate Climbs to Over 90 Perc ent Surveys show that Hoosiers are buckling up in recor d numbers Indianapolis, IN. -Indiana Criminal Justice Institu te (ICJI) Executive Director, Neil Moore today announced that Indiana's overall observ ed seat belt usage rate has reached a record high of 91.2 percent. This surpasses the 200 7 record of 88.4 percent by more than two points, according to surveys conducted during t he 2008 \"Click It or Ticket\" statewide enforcement mobilization. 25 \"These numbers are extremely impressive and speak t o the level of importance Hoosiers are putting on their safety,\" said Executive Direct or, Moore. \"This data is a strong indicator of the remarkable strides that we are all making to save lives on Indiana's roadways,\" Moore continued. The highest rate of observed seat belt usage, more than 95 percent, was among female drivers and passengers. In slightly fewer numbers, male drivers and passengers were buckled up at a rate of about 88 percent. There was also an increase in seat belt usage rates among pickup trucks with numbers jumping 14 p oints since 2007 to more than 79 percent in 2008. \"The single most effective way a person can prevent death or injury in a vehicle collision is the use of a seat belt,\" said Ryan Klitzsch, ICJ I Traffic Safety division director. \"Our goal is to sustain awareness of this message while supporting state and local law enforcement agencies in their year-round efforts to enforce Indiana's seat belt law.\" Indiana traffic fatalities are also down approximat ely 25 percent (121) in comparison to this time last year. Data derived from the 2007 Ind iana Occupant Protection Fact sheet, published by ICJI indicates that 54 percent of the individuals killed in car crashes in 2006 (where restraint usage was known) were unrestrained . Nearly 80 percent of individuals killed in pickup t rucks, also in 2006 (where restraint usage was known) were unrestrained. The Traffic Saf ety division of ICJI estimates that 269 lives could have potentially been saved if thos e killed would have worn seat belts. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has determined that seat belts are more than 50 percent effective in prevent ing a fatality when a crash occurs. \"Motorists should remember that wearing a seat belt is not only their best defense against death or injury in a crash - it's the law,\" said In diana State Police Superintendent, Paul Whitesell. \"We are striving for 100 percent compli ance, and until that goal is met, there is still work to be done,\" Whitesell added. In 2007, Governor Mitch Daniels closed the loophole in Indiana's previous seat belt law by enacting legislation that requires all occupants of every passenger motor vehicle, including pickup trucks, and those vehicles plated as such, to buckle up regardless of where they are seated in the vehicle. During the 20 08 \"Click It or Ticket\" mobilization, law enforcement officers cited more than 23,000 mot orists for failure to comply with Indiana's current seat belt law. The Indiana Criminal Justice Institute (ICJI) serve s as the state's planning agency for criminal justice, juvenile justice, traffic safety, and victim services. ICJI develops long- range strategies for the effective administration o f Indiana's criminal and juvenile justice systems and administers federal and state funds to carry out these strategies. **************** 26 At the trauma center level at Riley Hospital in Ind ianapolis (Central Indiana), based on injury data from the Riley hospital system (that in cludes all patients less than 18 years of age treated in ED or as an in-patient), zip codes w ith the highest injury rates per mechanism were benchmarked against national estimat es (FARS, WISQARS, NEISS). Two zip codes which have much higher age-adjusted i njury rates than the national average for children less than 18 were targeted for intense interventions at the community level. The data was taken to the neighborhoods and strategic plan was initiated that focused on environmental, behavioral, and policy ch anges. Community partnerships were formed with the City agencies, School system, United Way, and other agencies that worked in the area. The focus is on home-based inj uries and pedestrian/bicycle injuries, as well as improving the daycares/preschools in the neighborhood . In the fall of 2006, an analysis of the fatal injury data at the state and national level (WISQARS to Healthy Families; Indiana Child Fatality Review Team; the I ndiana Injury Prevention Advisory Council) was completed. Each year, Indiana is one of the top five states for fatal injury deaths due to unintentional suffocation for infants . A workgroup has been convened to examine this issue. A proposal to examine death c ertificate data (with IRB approval) is currently waiting approval from ISDH. Also at the trauma center level, Deaconess Hospital in Evansville (Southwestern Indiana) measures trends as well, and when trends show an in crease in injuries as a result of certain MOIs (e.g., bicycle, ATV, MVC, etc.), the T rauma Registrar notifies the Injury Prevention Coordinator and injury prevention course s or seminars are initiated. Their Outreach and Injury Prevention Coordinator has taug ht community courses in ATV and bicycle safety. Two of their community awareness/ed ucation programs include Alive and Think First. These are nationally recognized progra ms. The Alive program is for teens discussing the dangers of driving under the influen ce of drugs and alcohol. Think First is a head and spinal cord injury prevention program en couraging youth to \"think first\" about safety. Memorial Hospital in South Bend (Northern Indiana) also uses trends in registry data and shares them with internal groups such as the Trauma Committee. Memorial also participates in the Indiana Partnership to Prevent Violent Injury and Death (IPPVID), a statewide firearm injury and death surveillance sys tem, by submitting abstracted data on firearm injuries from their center. Wishard Hospital in Indianapolis initiated a seat b elt safety campaign based on statistics that showed that 60% of people in Indiana who died in 2005 following a motor vehicle crash were not restrained (DOT). Wishard Trauma Se rvices provided a target audience with seat belt safety education through a variety o f sources to ensure broad-spectrum awareness. These methods included e-mail bulletins , posters and presentations at staff meetings. The researchers also passed out key chai ns to serve as a long-term reminder of the need to wear safety belts. Finally, they creat ed a display to illustrate, using life-size silhouettes, the number of unrestrained people who die in car crashes. Parkview Hospital in Fort Wayne used their trauma r egistry data to identify key injury patterns with teen drivers and have presented this data to the child death review team and 27 the local coroner to assist with implementation of a teen \"Drive Alive\" program to reduce teen driving automobile crashes. 5. Describe how ongoing and routine injury surveill ance is completed and how results are shared with constituent groups . An actual injury prevention program does not cur rently exist at the Indiana State Department of Health. A s a result, there is only a partial injury surveillance system that utilizes data from a varie ty of databases (see page 21, #2). One part-time epidemiologist helps to collect, identify and disperse data when requested by media, constituents in Indiana, etc. Examples of r eports that have been written include: annual reports on firework injuries, periodic repor ts on suicide in Indiana, a report on the medical impact of motor vehicle crashes for the Ind iana Department of Transportation, and a major report on injuries in Indiana. The fir eworks injury surveillance system is mandated by law and physicians are required to comp lete a fireworks injury report and send it to the department of health. An annual rep ort is completed and disseminated to the public through the ISDH website and press relea ses. Other data reports are placed on the ISDH website so that they can be shared with co nstituent groups. At the institutional level, each trauma center prepares annual reports f rom their trauma registry data that are disseminated to the public. Indicators As a Tool for System Assessment 1. Has a multidisciplinary stakeholder group partic ipated in the scoring and consensus process associated with the BIS tool? Yes, this was completed in 2006 by a workgroup of Task Force members representing the ISDH, the In diana Hospital Association, Wishard and Riley Hospitals in Indianapolis, Deacon ess Hospital in Evansville and Memorial Hospital in South Bend.

If the process has been completed, how were the findings used? They were used to guide the first draft of administrative rules for t he designation of hospitals as trauma centers (See Appendix 3). It is also our intent to use the BIS tool to help d evelop a system plan after recommendations are received from the ACS System Consultation. 3. Is there a date (year/month) set for a reassessm ent using the BIS tool to mark progress toward agreed-on goals or benchmarks? No specific date has been specified for re- assessment with the BIS tool. 31 Section 2: Policy Development Statutory Authority and Administrative Rules 1. Describe how the current statutes and regulation s allow the state or region to: a. develop, plan, and implement the trauma system, - Public Law 155, 2006 (Wyss, Broden) provides for the \"development, implementati on, and oversight for a statewide comprehensive trauma care system to preve nt injuries, save lives, and improve the care and outcome of individuals injures in Indiana.\" b. monitor and enforce rules, - \"The state department may adopt rules under IC 4- 22-2 concerning the development and implementation\" of a state trauma registry and \"standards and procedures for trauma care level designation of hospitals.\" (No rules are in place at this time.) c. designate the lead agency, - The Indiana State Department of Health is designate d as the lead agency by Public Law 155, 2006. d. collect and protect confidential data, and - The legislation below provides for the creation of the state trauma registry and the adopt ion of rules, but no rules are in place yet. e. protect confidentiality of the quality improvement process. There is no legislation regarding the quality improvement process. P.L.155-2006 [S.284. Approved March 24, 2006.] AN ACT to amend the Indiana Code concerning health. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana: SECTION 1. IC 16-18-2-354.5 IS ADDED TO THE INDIANA CODE AS A NEW SECTION TO READ AS FOLLOWS [EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2006]: Sec. 354.5. \"Trauma care\", for purposes of IC 16-19-3-28, means the assessment, di agnosis, transportation, treatment, or rehabilitation by a h ealth care provider of an acute bodily injury that requires im mediate intervention to prevent the loss of life or a serio us impairment of a body function or part. SECTION 2. IC 16-19-3-28 IS ADDED TO THE INDIANA CO DE AS A NEW SECTION TO READ AS FOLLOWS [EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2006]: Sec. 28. (a) The state department is the lead agenc y for the development, implementation, and oversight of a sta tewide comprehensive trauma care system to prevent injurie s, save lives, and improve the care and outcome of individuals inj ured in Indiana. (b) The state department may adopt rules under IC 4 -22-2 concerning the development and implementation of th e following: (1) A state trauma registry. (2) Standards and procedures for trauma care level designation of hospitals. 32 2. Describe the process by which trauma system poli cies and procedures are developed or updated to manage the system including: There are not yet any trauma system policies and procedures in place. The Trauma Task Force Sys tem Development Subcommittee has been charged with the development of the items below. a. the adoption of standards of care, b. designation or verification of trauma centers, c. direct patient flow on the basis of designation, d. data collection, and e. system evaluation. 3. Within the context of statutes and regulation, d escribe how injury prevention, EMS, public health, the needs of special populations, an d emergency management are integrated or coordinated within the trauma system. There is no statute or regulation that integrates injury prevention, EMS, public health, t he needs of special populations, or emergency management into the trauma system. Howev er, the ISDH Trauma System Advisory Task Force includes representation from al l of these groups and continually makes the effort to see that all groups are conside red in trauma system planning. Also, the contractual trauma system manager and trauma re gistry manager are housed within the Office of Primary Care/State Office of Rural He alth at ISDH and are very involved with rural trauma system issues. System Leadership 1. How does the lead agency bring constituency grou ps together to review and monitor the trauma system throughout each phase of care? At present the Indiana code has not been developed to address the reviewing and monitor ing of the trauma system through each phase of care, but there are the ISDH Trauma S ystem Advisory Task Force subcommittees that will be able to address these is sues in the future when appropriate legislation/code are in place. 2. Describe the composition, responsibilities, and activities of the multidisciplinary trauma system advisory committee(s) and the working relationship(s) with the trauma lead agency and the EMS lead agency, if they are di fferent. The ISDH Trauma System Advisory Task Force is made up of a wide spectrum o f trauma stakeholders from around Indiana (see Task Force membership list, pages 6 th rough 11 of this document). The Trauma Task Force also has several subcommittees to address specific issues: Legislation and Funding, Systems Development and Ma intenance, Information Management, Education, Injury Prevention (added 10/ 08), Protocol Development for Care. The Trauma Program and EMS Division are hous ed in different state agencies, with trauma at the Department of Health and EMS wit hin the Department of Homeland Security. The EMS Division historically did not ha ve an interest in being the lead agency for trauma system development but was very supporti ve of the legislation designating the ISDH as the lead agency. They have continued that support through membership on the Trauma Task Force and by including Task Force membe rs in the EMS trauma protocol development workgroup, which will be described in a later section of this document. 33 a. Identify pediatric representatives on the multidisc iplinary trauma system advisory committee and any pediatric advisory groups that pr ovide input into trauma system development. Aaland, Mary, MD, FACS Trauma Medical Director Parkview Hospital Level II Adult and Pediatric Trauma Center Bensard, Denis, MD - Chief of Surgery Peyton Manning Children's Hospital at St. Vincent, Indianapolis, IN Braun, Cheri, RN, Trauma Program Nurse Parkview Hospital Level II Adult and Pediatric Trauma Center Daniels, Dawn, DNS, RN, PHCNS-BC, Clinical Nurse Specialist Riley Trauma Services Injury Free Coalition for Kids of Indianapolis Graves, Charlene, MD (retired) Founding member, ped iatrician Indianapolis, IN Gray, Lisa, RN Pediatric Trauma Coordinator St. Mary's Medical Center Level II Trauma Center, Evansville, IN Gutwein, Tom, MD FACEM, Emergency Medical Director Parkview Hospital Level II Adult and Pediatric Trauma Center Hollister, Lisa, RN, Trauma Program Manager Parkview Hospital Level II Adult and Pediatric Trauma Center Howard, Matthew S., RN, MSN Emergency Dept. Mgr Riley Hospital for Children, Level I Trauma Center, Indianapolis, IN McNichols, Autumn, M.A. Safe Kids Indiana State Coordinator IUSOM, Automotive Safety Program Indianapolis, IN 46202 Reiss, Gene Trauma Registrar Riley Hospital for Children, Level I Trauma Center, Indianapolis, IN Scherer, L.R. \"Tres\", MD Trauma Medical Director Riley Hospital for Children, Level I Trauma Center, Chair - IN ACS-COT & EMS-C Shufflebarger, Charles, MD Emergency Medicine Director Clarian Methodist Level I Trauma Center, Indianapolis, IN b. Describe the process of involving experts in, and a dvocates for, special populations and how they help drive regional trauma system policy. There is no regional (or state) trauma system policy to date an d no processes have been developed at this time. Membership of the Trauma Task Force includes pediatric, rural (hospital and EMS level) and pre-h ospital representation. When we reach the point of policy development, we will r ely on the knowledge and expertise of the representatives from each special population to guide with system changes and improvements. The Indiana Child Fatalit y Review Panel has the ability to review deaths of all children (under 18 years of age) which occur in the state, but has only been able to concentrate on chi ld abuse and neglect deaths due to a lack of resources. By sharing information and reviewing data, panel members 34 review the circumstances surrounding the deaths and look for patterns or trends to identify possible prevention strategies. c. Describe how the multidisciplinary advisory committ ee is involved in trauma system performance evaluation (for example, review of system performance reports). The state trauma registry was launched in May of 20 07, and is currently in the implementation phase. As registry developme nt progresses, trauma system performance measures will be developed. This proce ss is being developed by the Trauma Task Force, the Indiana Trauma Network, the state trauma manager, and the newly-hired state trauma registry manager. In p reparation for a trauma system development retreat that was conducted in 2007 with representation from 17 Task Force members, the state trauma system manager revi ewed other state's performance improvement measures and prepared some preliminary working documents that will be used to further refine perfo rmance improvement measures (see Appendix 4). 3. Provide examples of how the lead agency and trau ma system leadership (for example, trauma centers, trauma medical director, nurse coor dinator, trauma administrator, and other stakeholders) inform and educate policy maker s, elected officials, community groups, and others about the trauma system, its str engths, and its improvement opportunities. There is active state legislative representation on the Task Force, and Task Force members have been invited to participate in h earings and health care professional days during legislative sessions. One example of this is the summer study commission of Rep. Charlie Brown (2008) which had 6 trauma hos pitals and IHA testify on the importance of trauma hospitals and systems. Also i n 2008, the Education subcommittee of the Task Force launched the Trauma Times newslet ter (see Appendix 7) to inform health professionals and legislators around the sta te about trauma system development, injury prevention and EMS efforts. This newsletter is sent out electronically to many listserves statewide. St. Mary's Medical Center in Evansville produced a video on CD entitled \"When Minutes Matter: Region 10 Level II Trauma\" that has been distributed around the state. Each of the trauma centers have r egional outreach programs that build relationships with local policy makers, elected off icials, and community groups. Deaconess Hospital in Evansville, through their out reach efforts to local policy makers was able to play an integral role in the repeal of the Uniform Accident and Sickness Policy Provision Law (UPPL) law in Indiana. The Alc ohol Exclusion Law was embedded in the model (UPPL) in 1947. This law allows insur ers to deny coverage to individuals injured as a result of being under the influence of alcohol or narcotics and was adopted by most states in the 1950's. Since approximately 40 percent of trauma center patients have positive blood alcohol levels, this can result in h uge debt for patients and huge losses for hospitals for uncompensated care. Deaconess Hospital trauma staff also conduct the Rural Trauma Team Development Course throughout Sou thern Indiana. The state trauma manager and the retired trauma medical director hav e given presentations of the trauma system and trauma registry to multiple groups throu ghout the state. Trauma leaders from Indiana trauma centers have reached out to their co mmunities, giving presentations throughout their districts on the Trauma System and how it benefits the entire state. Members of the Trauma Task Force take trauma inform ation to the groups they represent, and trauma system information is also distributed t hroughout the state in electronic 35 newsletter form. The state medical association has distributed information about the trauma system via their electronic newsletter and s upported the initial trauma system legislation along with the state ENA. State ENA me mbers also promote trauma system efforts around the state by conducting TNCC and ENP C courses throughout the state, devoting time to trauma system development efforts at each of their state council meetings, lobbying for trauma system/injury prevent ion legislation (graduated driver's license, others), ENCARE injury prevention efforts around the state, etc. 4. Describe the process to build or expand effectiv e trauma leadership within the trauma system (for example, succession planning, leadershi p courses, and workshops), including the lead agency and trauma centers. Although there is no formal process of trauma leadership at the state level, the Trauma Task Forc e and the efforts at the state level are maintained largely by the leadership and input of e ach of the trauma centers in the state and coordinated by the state trauma manager. Throu gh the communication facilitated by the Trauma Task Force, trauma centers are now coord inating their trauma conferences so that there are no conflicting dates. Each of the t rauma centers have active regional system development efforts in place. The Indiana T rauma Network, comprised of trauma coordinators and registrars from around the state, meets regularly to discuss their local/regional issues, consider solutions that woul d apply to both their regions and throughout the state, and also devote time at each meeting to discuss trauma system development issues to assist the state trauma manag er in her efforts. 5. Describe the process by which lead agency staff would identify changes in system performance. No process in place yet. 6. Describe how the multidisciplinary advisory comm ittee is involved in trauma system performance evaluation. No process in place yet. Coalition Building and Community Support 1. What is the status of the trauma system's coalit ion (for example, What is the status of recruiting members and building a coalition? Is the coalition a strong and active coalition? Does the coalition need new energy? Who is not currently involved but should be a part of your coalition?)? The Trauma Task Force has been growing over the pas t two years, and meeting attendance has grown from an average of 30 - 35 members per meeting to an average of 45 in attendance this year . The email distribution list continues to grow as well, with more people around the state expressing an interest in trauma system development. The energy level of the group is high. Although the group has rural membership, there are pockets of the state th at are not well represented on the Task Force, and there needs to be representation from th e agricultural community. Representation from a minority group or coalition, state Medicaid and the mental health community would be beneficial as the state moves fo rward with trauma system development. Active participation from more insurer s (health and auto) would be beneficial as well. The membership of the Task For ce includes ED nurses from both rural and urban hospitals, trauma and other surgeon s, ED physicians, pre-hospital providers (ground and air medical), non trauma cent er hospital representatives (physician, nurse, paramedic/EMT, administrators, etc.) from bo th urban and rural hospitals, state 36 legislators, the state hospital association, the st ate medical association, the EMS commission, the IU School of Nursing, IN Farm Burea u Insurance, Hoosier AAA Motor Club, the state ENA, the state ACEP, the state COT, the state Rural Health Association, the Indiana Trauma Network, trauma medical director s and trauma program managers from each of the seven trauma centers - this list o f participants is continuing to grow. The efforts of the seven trauma centers individuall y and collaboratively cannot be overstated. Through outreach to their communities and districts, they have helped to encourage other hospitals to become interested in t his process and have provided their knowledge and experience to the Task Force. In add ition, the Indiana Trauma Network has made trauma system development efforts a priori ty and have collaborated with the state trauma manager on many projects, including th e development of the trauma registry data dictionary, providing information for reports as requested and in contributing input into this document. The state ENA has made trauma training for all ED nurses and rural nurses in particular one of their top priorities. They assist the state trauma manager on many levels, particularly by spreading the word to their colleagues about the development of the trauma system in Indiana. The c ontributions of each member of the Trauma Task Force have kept this initiative alive d espite extremely limited resources available at the state lead agency level. a. What is the role of the coalition members (constit uents and stakeholders) in promoting trauma system development? Each member of the Task Force is taking a leadership role in promoting trauma system develo pment efforts in their respective communities and around the state; withou t this tremendous volunteer grassroots effort in Indiana, there would be no Tra uma Task Force or lead agency legislation. Examples of a just few of these effor ts include the following: St. Mary's developed a DVD entitled \"When Minutes M atter: Region 10 Trauma\", utilizing the story of a pediatric patient and her unidirectional flow through St. Mary's Trauma Center, exemplifying the need for sate trauma systems. This DVD was sent to all hospitals in Indiana as well as hospitals throughout the Evansville tri-state area. It has also been shown to various organizations and communities such as th e Indiana Rural Health Association Conference, PALS courses, and the Princ iples of Trauma classes. It is also available to view on St. Mary' s website. Merry Addison, an ED nurse and ENA member from Hill sdale, IN, has reached out to contact more people and organization s than could be recounted here and has been a true champion to the process. She initiated the rural TNCC training effort by the Indiana ENA w ith a grant from the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation in 2005 (now continuing through a partnership with the State Office of Rural Health and an additional grant from the Foundation). Merry's efforts were feature d in a 2005 episode of \"Communities Helping Communities\" on PBS, hosted by Judy O'Bannon. She continually champions trauma education and outr each and has contacted many individuals and organizations that h ave ultimately become involved in trauma system development efforts 37 Non trauma center hospitals, such as Terre Haute Re gional Hospital and The Methodist Hospitals in Gary/Merrillville have b egun conducting annual trauma and emergency conferences In 2008, The Methodist Hospitals created a trauma v ideo designed to educate policy makers and others around the state a bout the violence occurring in their area and the need for a trauma c enter there Each of the trauma centers (surgeons, trauma coordi nators, registrars and others) have conducted many outreach efforts in the ir communities and around the state and have also reached out to organ izations and hospitals not involved in the trauma system efforts to inform them and recruit their support. As a result of their efforts, the Trauma Task Force has grown progressively over the past two years with active i nterest and support from the membership State Senator Tom Wyss has been the central legisla tive champion for the Trauma Task Force (co-author of Public Law 155-2006 , SEA 249-2008) and co-chairs the legislative subcommittee of the T ask Force. Deaconess Hospital staff have been conducting Rural Trauma Team Development Courses throughout Southern Indiana sin ce 2007. b. What is the method and frequency for communicating with coalition members? There are regular email communications to Task Forc e members, and the group meets quarterly. 2. Describe how the trauma system leadership mobili zes community partners to improve the trauma system through effective communication a nd collaboration. Through the efforts of the Task Force, trauma system and Task Force leaders continually em phasize the importance of outreach and collaborating with p artners and stakeholders, through the quarterly meetings, providing information to the me mbership and to their respective regions, professional organizations, etc. It is ac cepted by Task Force members that development of a trauma system is a collaborative e ffort. Trauma verified hospitals provide education on injury prevention throughout t heir communities. They make use of local newspapers, churches, schools, health fairs, and other opportunities within their community to be a resource and to provide education . a. How has the community been approached to identify i njury control concerns? At the state level, this hasn't been addressed, but at the institutional level, each trauma center uses their registry data to identify needs and present this data to relevant community leaders or groups. As an exampl e, Parkview Hospital (Level II) in Fort Wayne uses the trauma registry to ident ify key injury patterns with teen drivers and presents this data to the child death r eview team and the local coroner to assist with implementation of a teen \"Drive Aliv e\" program to reduce teen driving automobile crashes. They have also have ap proached local news channels to create awareness of several injury patterns that have been identified. Another example from Wishard Hospital (Level I) in Indianap olis: After review of their trauma registry data, which revealed a 38% penetrat ing trauma rate in 2007, they implemented the Educating Kids about Gun Violence a nd Gun Safety/Trigger 38 Lock distribution programs in Indianapolis area sch ools, health fairs, and gun auctions. b. What key problems has the community identified? At the state level, this hasn't been addressed. Ea ch of the trauma centers identifies key problems as described in the example s above in question \"a\". c. How do stakeholders bring system challenges or defi ciencies to the attention of the lead agency? Through the Indiana Trauma Task Force and local leg islators. Lead Agency and Human Resources Within the Lead Age ncy 1. Describe the number, position titles, and percen tage of full-time equivalency of all personnel within the lead agency or contract person nel who have roles or responsibilities to the trauma program. There is one full-time contractual trauma system ma nager, and as of September, 2008, one full-time contractual traum a registry manager. A full-time state position for a trauma registry manager was created but was not able to be filled due to current state hiring freezes. 2. Identify other personnel resources that support the trauma program activities of the lead agency (for example, epidemiology support from other units within the health department, public health interns). There is one part-time contractual injury-preventio n epidemiologist (total of 0.3 FTE) who also assists with trauma data requests, and one public health intern from August, 2008 through Janu ary, 2009. 3. Describe the adequacy of personnel resources ava ilable to the lead agency to sustain trauma program assessment, policy development, and assurance activities. a. Identify impediments or barriers that hinder system development. Lack of funding, state freeze on hiring, lack of state trau ma program positions, no trauma or EMS medical director, lack of e-coding in hospit al discharge data, incomplete outpatient data in the hospital discharge database all are impediments to the process. Trauma System Plan 1. Describe the process for the development or revi sion of the trauma system plan. There is no trauma system plan in place yet. a. Include the role of advisory and stakeholder groups in the process. 2. Is there ongoing assessment of trauma resources and asset allocation within the system? There is no formal assessment process, but we are b eginning to identify the trauma resources through Task Force member feedback and injury prevention resources through an injury prevention survey (October, 2008) that has been sent by electronic link to all emergency departments in the state; it has a lso been sent to the Injury Prevention 39 Advisory Council members, Trauma Task Force members , state ENA, and Indiana Trauma Network members, all of whom are distributin g to their contact lists. 3. Describe the process used to determine trauma sy stem standards and trauma system policies. There are no trauma system standards and policies i n place at this time, but we are reviewing other state systems for comparison wi th Indiana needs for future standard and policy development efforts. a. How are they reviewed and evaluated? b. What standards and policies exist for special popul ations, including rural and frontier regions? c. How are specialized needs addressed, including burn s, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and reimplantation? System Integration 1. What is the trauma system's collaboration and in tegration with EMS, public health, and emergency management and programs such as: a. prevention programs - There is an ISDH Injury Prevention Advisory Council that has been sporadically meeting over the last few yea rs. This group is going to be linked with the Trauma Task Force, through the addi tion of an Injury Prevention Subcommittee to the Task Force. The hope is that t he injury prevention group will benefit from the energy and momentum that the Task Force is experiencing.

The TRCC is headed by the I ndiana Criminal Justice Institute and has representation from the Indiana S tate Police, EMS, Coroners' Association, and many other agencies, institutions and organizations. e. child protective services - The Indiana Child Fatality Review Team(CFRT) has a broad organizational base, including several member s from the state child protective services agency. The former medical dire ctor for injury prevention/trauma system at the ISDH (Dr . Charlene Graves) served as the ISDH representative on the Indiana CFRT since its incept ion in 2004. Dr. Joan Duwve is the current ISDH representative on CFRT. f. public safety (such as, fire, lifeguard, mountain r escue, and ski patrol)? EMS and Fire are both within the same division at the India na Department of Homeland Security, so there is collaboration there that will be expanded as the process moves forward. There is no mountain rescue or ski patrol in Indiana. g. The Indiana Spinal Cord and Brain Injury Research F und was created by the 2007 Indiana General Assembly. At this time a Board for the Fund was created and appointed by the Governor, Indiana University, Purd ue University, Brain Injury Association, National Spinal Cord Injury Associatio n and Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana. The Fund is to be used for the followi ng purposes: (1) Establish and maintain a state medical surveillance registry for traumatic spinal cord and brain injuries, (2) Fulfilling the duties of the board, (3) Funding research related to treatment and cure of s pinal cord and brain injuries, including acute management, medical compl ications, rehabilitative techniques, and neuronal recovery. Research must be conducted in compliance with all state and federal laws. Financing 1. How does the lead agency track and analyze inter nal trauma system finances? The ISDH utilizes external financing to support the tra uma program as no dedicated/line item financing is provided for the trauma and trauma reg istry programs. External funding is received from the Rural Hospital Flexibility Progra m grant through HRSA and the Indiana Traffic Records Strategic Plan, which is sp onsored by the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration 408 grant program. 42 a. How does the advisory committee participate in the financial review process? N/A b. How frequently are trauma system financial reports published? N/A c. Which financial data are reported (lead agency data , health facility data, or both)? N/A 2. What is the lead agency's budget for the trauma system? N/A 3. What is the source of funding available to suppo rt the development, operations, and management of the trauma system (for example, gener al funds, dedicated funds)? There are no general or dedicated funds to support the tr auma system. The trauma system manager is paid through Rural Health Flex funds (pr eviously paid through hospital preparedness funds), and the trauma registry manage r is paid through the NHTSA 408 grant (as part of the Indiana Traffic Records Strat egic Plan). The Rural Health Flex grant is also the funding source for the contractual port ion of this ACS consultation. The remainder of the expenses for the consultation are being funded by the generous donations from each of the seven trauma centers, as well as a donation from Indiana Farm Bureau Insurance. 4. What financial incentives and disincentives exis t to encourage trauma center participation in the trauma system? None. a. Specifically include arrangements for uncompensated and under-compensated care. There are no arrangements for uncompensated and und er-compensated trauma care in Indiana currently. Based on amounts derived from other states and not knowing the actual numbers for Indiana, it is e stimated that somewhere in the range of $20-$30 million per year would be needed t o help cover uncompensated trauma care in Indiana. 43 Section 3: Assurance Prevention and Outreach 1. List organizations dedicated to injury preventio n within the region and the issues they address (for example, MADD, SADD, SafeKids Worldwid e, Injury Free Coalition for Kids, American Trauma Society, university-based inj ury control programs). There are numerous organizations active in Indiana, many of w hom work together through collaboration with the state's seven trauma centers and also through collaboration with organizations/programs such as Safe Kids, local hea lth departments, local fire departments, local law enforcement, schools, local non-trauma center hospitals, etc. There are also legislative initiatives targeted at injury prevention that are currently being pursued: The AAA Hoosier Motor Club and the Indian a Graduated Drivers' License Coalition are pursuing GDL legislation with the ult imate goal of reducing teen driver motor vehicle crashes. The Indiana Coalition to Re duce Underage drinking is also pursuing legislation that they hope would help to r educe underage drinking. There has not been state-level networking/coordinat ion of these groups in the past, but the Injury Prevention Advisory Council is begin ning work on creation of a statewide injury prevention network. An online survey of sta tewide injury prevention efforts was conducted in October, 2008, and will be combined wi th other known activities and organizations to serve as the baseline for creation of this statewide network. A summary of the survey results is in Appendix 13. The injur y prevention efforts that are known to be occurring in Indiana include the following: Indiana Poison Control Center - Multiple poisoning prevention activities Think First - The ThinkFirst For Kids program represents a col laborative effort of educators, the ThinkFirst National Injury Preven tion Foundation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Peace Education Foundation and prof essionals from the fields of psychology and psychiatry. The goal of the program is to increase knowledge and awareness among children in grades 1-3 of the cause s and risk factors of brain and spinal cord injury, injury prevention measures, and the use of safety habits. Project Outreach Prevent (POP) Program (The Methodist Hospitals - Gary, Merrillville) - Three pilot programs on teenage hea lth awareness and violence prevention were presented to junior high and high s chool students over the course of 3 months. Presentations included pertinent teen age health issues with an emphasis upon school violence, gang violence, sexua l assault, and violence prevention, with an emphasis on conflict resolution . These interactive presentations included discussion by a local homici de detective and linking of students interested in medicine, nursing, and law e nforcement with mentors. In the future, there are plans to create questionnaire s in order to obtain objective feedback about the project. Discussions are underw ay with Gary High School ROTC about doing a joint venture and creating a Vio lence Prevention Day at a host school for each Gary High School. 44 Emergency Nurses Association - ENCARE (Emergency Nu rses Cancel Alcohol Related Events- Choices for Living Program) - The Choices for Living program is a dynamic presentation designed t o empower teenagers with skills to make informed decisions and engage in hea lthy behaviors related to safer driving. The program discusses such topics as unde rage drinking, binge drinking, drinking and driving, and safety belt use through p resentation of national facts and other teenagers' personal stories. This progra m is presented to local middle school and high school students. Educating Kids about Gun Violence (EKG) - EKG is a youth gun-violence education and prevention program. EKG works to pre vent youth gun violence by educating students about the legal, medical, and em otional consequences of youth gun possession and related gun violence, as well as encouraging young people to consider options and choices available to them in s ituations involving guns. ASK Day - ASK is a national public health initiative that provides something real parents can do to keep their children safe. Based o n the astonishing fact that over 40% of homes with children have a gun, many of whic h are kept unlocked or loaded, the ASK campaign encourages parents to ASK if there are guns in the homes where their children play. Safe Kids - Car Seat Clinics - Safe Kids Worldwide is the first and only international nonprofit organization dedicated sole ly to preventing unintentional childhood injury. Multiple hospitals around the st ate participate in this program. Nurses in the Classroom is a project that targets 3 rd grade classrooms in high injury areas. Nurses adopt classrooms for 6 weeks and provide injury prevention education and skills training on the injuries most prevalent in their neighborhoods. Each nurse receives a two hour training session tha t includes training on the curriculum as well as teaching techniques. Indiana Partnership to Prevent Violent Injury and D eath - The mission of the Partnership is to prevent and reduce the frequency of violent injuries and deaths throughout the state of Indiana. The Partnership is a statewide multi-disciplinary effort to address violent injury and death in all p opulations and from a public health perspective. The aim of the Partnership is t o facilitate development of a coordinated, unified strategy, and to decrease viol ent injuries and deaths through the use of data collection, research, education and law reform. The Partnership facilitates collaboration and information sharing a mong various groups including health care, law enforcement, legal, human services , policymaking, and secular and faith based community organizations. Injury Free Coalition for Kids - The Injury Free Coalition for Kids of Indianapolis is a partnership of institutions, gove rnment agencies, organizations, and community members who are dedicated to preventi ng childhood injury in Indiana communities. Center of Hope - The Center of Hope provides crisis intervention, medical treatment, and forensic evidence collection to acut e victims of sexual assault and domestic violence to patients at several Indianapo lis area hospitals (Wishard was the founding hospital). The Center of Hope also re aches out to members of the community and professionals within the health care, law enforcement, academic, and legal community to present information and reso urces about sexual assault 45 and domestic violence through health fairs and lect ures. Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner programs for ED nurses around the state ha ve also been launched as a result of this Center's activities.

Describe how the trauma lead agency has funded a nd coordinated system-wide injury prevention or outreach activities. From 2002-2005, ISDH had grant funding to develop injury prevention infrastructure through the CDC Co re Injury Surveillance program; unfortunately the application submitted for continu ed funding was approved but not funded. Although there is no dedicated funding at this time, in 2007 some short-term internal funding became available and was used to f und 20 injury prevention and trauma education projects around the state. Each of the s even trauma centers received a grant award, as well as the Indiana ENA, five non trauma center hospitals (including two CAHs), and an EMS education organization. Particip ants who benefited from these programs included nurses, pre-hospital personnel, c hildren, teenagers and the elderly. a. Which injuries (including pediatric injuries) have been identified and prioritized for intervention strategies? The draft of the Injury Prevention state plan requi red for the CDC grant application in 2005 focused on fi ve types of injuries: motor vehicle crashes, falls, poisoning, residential fire s and suicide (see Appendix 15). At the institutional level, each of the trauma cent ers analyze their trauma registry data to target areas of need for injury prevention activities and each have customized their injury prevention programs to meet the needs of their communities. b. Identify any dedicated lead agency or other agency staff member (full- or part- time) responsible for injury prevention outreach an d coordination for the trauma system. There is no dedicated lead agency person responsibl e for injury prevention outreach and coordination for the trauma system. Most of this responsibility falls on the state trauma manager, w ith assistance from the part- time injury prevention epidemiologist. c. What is the source of funding? There is no state funding for injury prevention. 3. Explain the evaluation process for injury preven tion projects that are conducted by the lead agency, trauma facilities, or other community- based organizations. There are not any injury prevention projects conducted by the lea d agency, since there is no funding for an injury prevention program. Methods used by the trauma centers include pre and post tests, program evaluations, community surveys, foll ow-up phone calls, observation of participant behavior, review of registry for change s in trends, interactive programming, to name a few. The lack of statewide injury morbidity data and the lack of e-code use by 50 many hospitals within the state hampers efforts to determine long-term outcomes of injury prevention efforts within the state. a. Identify any gaps in injury prevention efforts for population groups in the state. Because there is no statewide surveillance system a nd no state health department injury prevention system, it is difficult to quanti fy gaps. Anecdotally, there appear to be significant gaps within the rural and Hispanic c ommunities. The elderly population has been identified by more than one of the trauma centers as a group that needs more focus on prevention efforts (falls, etc. ). Emergency Medical Services EMS Summary The provision of emergency medical services is a ma tter of vital concern affecting the public health, safety, and welfare of the people of Indiana. The EMS Branch of the Indiana Department of Homeland Security regulates, inspects and certifies services and facilities engaged in providing emergency medical s ervices in Indiana. The standards and requirements for furnishing emergency medical servi ces to the citizens of Indiana are set by the Indiana Emergency Medical Services Commissio n under 836 IAC with authority from IC 16-31. This eleven-member commission is ap pointed by the Governor, which includes two physicians, a registered nurse, and re presentation from hospitals, EMTs, paramedics, and provider agencies, as well as the p ublic . Indiana EMS Commission: Member From City Chair - Gary Miller Private Ambulance Services Ind ianapolis Open Public Representative Melanie \"Jane\" Cragin Hospital Ambulance Service Williamsport Charles Valentine Municipal Fire Services Indianapo lis G. Lee Turpen Paramedics Evansville Myron Mackey Emergency Medical Technicians Bicknell Dr. Michael Olinger Trauma Physicians Indianapolis Ed Gordon Volunteer Fire Departments Lawrenceburg Sue Dunham Emergency Nurses Indianapolis Terri Hamilton Volunteer EMS Knightstown Dr. William Rutherford Emergency Physicians Carmel The EMS Operations Director supervises five EMS Dis trict Managers who are assigned a specific geographic service area for providing EMS coordination within the ten Department of Homeland Security Districts. The EMS District Manager's review applications for initial and renewal certification, conduct inspections, perform audits and 51 offer technical assistance for Basic Life Support, Advanced Life Support and Air Ambulance Providers, EMS Training Institutions and Supervising Hospitals, local and state officials and the general public. The EMS Br anch is involved in emergency preparedness at the District level and responds to emergency events statewide to assist the local EMS providers. As part of emergency resp onse, the EMS Operations staff will coordinate and assist the Medical Response Trailers /Teams, located in each of the ten Districts on mass casualty events. Indiana has a Di saster Portable Mortuary Unit that is now under the responsibility of the EMS Branch. The EMS Operations Director also investigates any E MS related complaints and assists in the preparation of any sanctions issued against EMS certified persons. Unfortunately, the requirements for EMS provider tr aining varies greatly from state to state. The requirements for state of Indiana are ma ndated by the Indiana Department of Homeland Security. Areas that are rural, such as much of Indiana, have special considerations in terms of EMS care. A wide disparity in the delivery of E MS care between rural and urban areas does exist. One major contributing factor is the high number of volunteers that are 52 used to operate and maintain these systems of care. In fact, in many rural communities, the emergency care role is a second job for the maj ority of EMS providers. Due to the large volume of volunteers that provide EMS care in the state of Indiana, it is vital that researchers examine the difference, if any, in the level of care provided between volunteers and paid EMS personnel. SEA 249 was passed in 2008 (effective July, 2008), giving the EMS commission the authority and mandate to adopt rules concerning triage and transportation protocols for the transportation of trauma patients consisten t with the field triage decision scheme of the American College of Surgeons Committee on Tr auma (Table 2). 53 Table 2: FIELD TRIAGE DECISION SCHEME Step Three Glasgow Coma Scale <14 or Systolic blood pressure <90 or Respiratory rate <10 or >29 (<20 in infant < one year) Yes No Take to a trauma center. Steps 1 and 2 attempt to identify the most seriously injured patients. These patients would be transported preferentially to the highest level of care within the trauma system. Measure vital signs and level of consciousness Assess anatomy of injury All penetrating injuries to head, neck, torso, and extremities proximal to elbow and knee Flail chest Two or more proximal long-bone fractures Crush, degloved or mangled extremity Amputation proximal to wrist and ankle Pelvic fractures Open or depressed skull fracture Paralysis No Take to a trauma center. Steps 1 and 2 attempt to identify the most seriously injured patients. These patients would be transported preferentially to the highest level of care within the trauma system. Assess mechanism of injury and evidence of high-energy impact Yes Falls o Adults: > 20 ft. (one story is equal to 10 ft.) o Children: > 10 ft. or 2-3 times the height of the c hild High-risk auto crash o Intrusion: > 12 in. occupant site; > 18 in. any si te o Ejection (partial or complete) from automobile o Death in same passenger compartment o Vehicle telemetry data consistent with high risk of injury Auto v. pedestrian/ bicyclist thrown, run over, or with significant (>20 mph) impact Motorcycle crash > 20 mph No Transport to closest appropriate trauma center whic h, depending on the trauma system, need not be the highest level trauma center . Yes Age o Older Adults: Risk of injury death increases after age 55 o Children: Should be triaged preferentially to pedi atric-capable trauma centers Anticoagulation and bleeding disorders Burns o Without other trauma mechanism: Triage to burn fac ility o With trauma mechanism: Triage to trauma center Time sensitive extremity injury End-stage renal disease requiring dialysis Pregnancy > 20 weeks EMS provider judgment No Yes Contact medical control and consider transport to t rauma center or a specific resource hospital. Transport according to protocol Step One Step Two Step Four Assess special patient or system considerations WHEN IN DOUBT, TRANSPORT TO A TRAUMA CENTER. This field triage decision scheme, originally devel oped by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma, was revised by an expert panel representing emergency m edical services, emergency medicine, trauma surgery , and public health. The panel was convened by the Centers for Disease C ontrol and Prevention (CDC) with support from Natio nal Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Its content s are those of the expert panel and do not necessar ily represent the official views of CDC and NHTSA. 54 A workgroup was created by the EMS commission and the Indiana Department of Homeland Security to review the issues surrounding EMS trauma protocol development, particularly the issues relevant to Indiana, and to develop the protocols and rules for their use that would then go through the State's rule pro mulgation process before becoming effective. The workgroup's first meeting was held on July 22nd at St. Vincent's in Indianapolis. Immediately from the beginning, it b ecame clear that the consensus of the group was that we needed to create a system for the good of the state...a system that is best for the patient and works for 92 counties. Mi ke Garvey, DHS, spoke of a very optimistic timeline for the process, noting that it would take at least 18 months (and probably longer) for the workgroup to come up with their recommendations for the commission, for the commission to decide upon their rules, and for the rules to go through the promulgation process. There will also need to be a fiscal impact study done as part of this process that shows how it can or wi ll affect hospitals, providers, and the rest of the state financially. Discussion was made about the American College of S urgeons Field Decision Scheme and how the statute has been worded to inclu de it. It was the general consensus of the group that using the ACS scheme might create a slight degree of over triage, but that it would be a good starting point and point of reference as the group develops and creates what's effective for Indiana. Several pieces of information (maps, etc.) were dis played for the attendees of the meeting. It was decided that more data needed to b e gathered prior to the next meeting, such as the injuries and runs per county, etc. It was also decided that some (EMS) providers may have, either through protocol or poli cy/procedure, rules that dictate an inability to transport out of their county or out o f their area, and the district managers are polling their providers to determine what, if any o f those exist. In an update to the workgroup discussions, the EMS Commission asked for a definition from State legal counsel, as to whether a paramedic or EMT can legally define a transport destination against the wishes of the p atient. The answer from state legal counsel was that an EMS caregiver does not have tha t authority under statute or regulation. This could potentially be an obstacle to the development of the protocols and insight from other states that have dealt with this issue would be beneficial to the workgroup as it moves forward. In 2007, the Purdue University Department of Health and Kinesiology and (George Avery, Ph.D., MPA Assistant Professor of Public Hea lth Department of Health and Kinesiology) conducted an Indiana Emergency Medical Services Needs Assessment Conducted in cooperation with the Indiana State Off ice of Rural Health by mail survey of 2360 EMS personnel and 716 EMS organizations in Ind iana. Responses were received from 1054 individuals and 324 organizations, reflec ting 44.7% and 45.3% response rates, respectively. Major findings of the survey were: Evidence exists of a shortage of EMS personnel in I ndiana due to high vacancy rates. This is particularly acute in volunt eer organizations, which report the greatest difficulty in recruiting EMS personnel. 55 Paid EMS personnel work on average significantly mo re than a standard 40 hour week, and high percentages of EMS personnel add a second job. Because excessive working hours have been linked to low quality healthcare, this may indicate potential problems wi th the quality of EMS care. Differences in training needs and training received in areas related to cardiac care indicate potential disparities in the quality of care for heart attacks between rural and urban areas. Contrary to the Indiana requirements for recertific ation, it appears that a significant proportion of Indiana EMS personnel and organizations are not using audits as a tool for ensuring quality and developing skills. A wide variety of training needs have been identifi ed. While some clinical skill areas (basic and advanced life support) are n eeded, many of these areas are in important non-clinical areas, such as automobile extrication, foreign languages, safety, and incident management. The training environment, both in terms of initial and continuing training, is so varied that it cannot realistically be consid ered a \"system.\" In the abstract, EMS personnel prefer \"hands-on\" ty pe training, but when presented with specific scenarios they indicate a g reater affinity for locally-delivered mechanisms such as classroom cour ses at a local school or computer-based training. This probably reflects the tradeoff between time and utility, and is consistent with fi ndings that time is the largest barrier to continuing education and the hig h percentage EMS personnel who hold second jobs. Self-assessment of preparedness levels by EMS perso nnel reveals that the EMS system in rural areas is likely to be less prep ared and capable than in urban areas. Volunteer organizations rate thems elves as less capable than paid organizations, although this is largely n ot reflected in self- assessments by volunteer EMS personnel. Results of the Purdue 2007 needs assessment, the EM S trauma protocol workgroup, this trauma system consultation, along with much additio nal information are being used to develop a Rural Trauma-EMS Plan for the State of In diana. 1. Provide information on the last assessment of EM S, including assessor and date. Unknown. a. Describe the EMS system, including the number and c ompetencies (that is, ALS or BLS) of ground transporting agencies, non-transp orting agencies, and air medical resources. 56 b. How are these resources allocated throughout the re gion to serve the population? The provision or authorization of emergency medical services is a requirement of the governing body of a city, town, township, or co unty according to Indiana statute (IC 16-31). Each political subdivision deci des what level of care they choose to fund and to provide. c. Describe the availability of enhanced 911 and wirel ess E-911 access in your region. Enhanced 911 is available throughout the state. Wir eless E-911, including Phase II, is available throughout a majority of the state, largely dependent upon the wireless carrier and areas of coverage (See map Appendix 6). d. Identify any specialty pediatric transporting agenc ies and aeromedical resources. Several specialty transport units exist (Riley & St . Francis in Indianapolis); however they are born from the need of a specific p rogram/facility, and the respective program bears that cost. e. Describe the availability of pediatric equipment on all ground transporting units. Indiana Administrative Code 836 IAC 1-3-5 denotes t he required emergency care basic life support equipment for ground ambulances in the State of Indiana, including pediatric equipment. 836 IAC 2-2-3 denote s additional required emergency care equipment for advanced life support. (See Appendix 12 for EMS code and legislation.) 2. Describe the procedures for online and off -line medical direction, including procedures for the pediatric population. Currently no statewide protocols exist. Protocols may function on a \"regional\" basis if several provi ders in the same region have the same medical director and utilize the same protocols. P re-hospital emergency care (EMS) is highly protocol driven and specific protocols may b e online or off-line, dependent upon the decision of the organization's medical director . a. Describe how EMS and trauma medical direction and o versight are coordinated and integrated. There is no statewide or regional medical direction or oversight. 3. Describe the pre-hospital workforce competencies in trauma: 57 a. Initial training and certification/licensure requir ements Indiana utilizes National Standard Curriculums for First Responder, EMT-Basic, EMT-Intermediate, and EMT-Paramedic. All National S tandard Curricula are available for download at the NHTSA EMS National St andard Curricula website: http://tinyurl.com/US-DOT-NSC . b.

(H) Obstetrics and gynecological scenarios. (I) Communication and documentation. c. Pediatric trauma training requirements for recertif ication There are no pediatric specific requirements. Definitive Care Facilities 1. Describe the extent to which all acute care faci lities participate in the trauma system. The participation of the trauma centers in the Trau ma Task Force and other groups is one of the driving forces of Indiana's trauma system de velopment. The seven trauma centers have been active in the process of trauma system de velopment from the beginning. Currently, there are 28 different hospitals represe nted on the Trauma Task Force, with an additional 13 hospitals that are participating by s ubmitting data to the trauma registry. 60 This represents 32 percent of the acute care hospit als (with emergency departments) in the state participating in some way (41/129). a. Describe the availability and roles of specialty ce nters within the system (pediatric, burn, TBI, SCI) - There are two pediatric hospitals in the state of Indiana, Riley Hospital for Children and Peyton Man ning Children's Hospital at St. Vincent, both in Indianapolis. Riley Hospital is also an ACS verified, Level I pediatric trauma center and pediatric burn center ( American Burn Association). There are two other burn centers in the state, Wish ard Hospital (also a Level I trauma center) in Indianapolis, and St. Joseph Hosp ital in Fort Wayne. The Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana in Indianapolis is the largest rehabilitation facility in the state for TBI and SCI patients. Ri ley Hospital at Methodist (Level I), St. Vincent Pediatric Rehabilitation hospital a nd St. Mary's Medical Center (verified Level II trauma center) all have pediatri c rehabilitation beds. Other hospitals with rehabilitation beds for TBI and/or S CI are Ball Memorial Hospital in Muncie, Columbus Regional Hospital in Columbus, Daviess Community Hospital in Washington, Deaconess Hospital in Evans ville (also a Level II trauma center), Fayette Memorial Hospital in Connersville, Gibson General Hospital in Princeton (CAH), HealthSouth Deaconess Rehabilitati on Hospital in Evansville, Hook Rehabilitation Center in Indianapolis, Howard Regional Health System in Kokomo, Indiana University Acute Rehabilitation Cen ter at Wishard in Indianapolis, Jasper County Hospital in Rensselaer, Memorial Hospital in South Bend (also a Level II trauma center), Methodist Hos pitals Rehabilitation Center in Merrillville, Parkview Hospital in Fort Wayne (also a Level II adult and pediatric trauma center), Rehabilitation Center at St. Cather ine Hospital in East Chicago, Rehabilitation Hospital of Fort Wayne, Reid Hospita l and Health Care Services in Richmond, Roudebush VA Medical Center in Indianapol is, Southern Indiana Rehabilitation Hospital in New Albany, St. Joseph R egional Medical Center - IRF in South Bend, St. Mary Medical Center in Hobar t, Union Hospital Medical Rehabilitation in Terre Haute, Wabash Valley Hospit al in West Lafayette and Whitewater Valley Rehabilitation in Connersville. 2. Describe the roles of the non-designated acute c are facilities in the trauma system. There are several non-designated hospitals which ar e a part of the Trauma Task Force, and they are assisting with trauma system developme nt efforts. In addition, there are several other hospitals that have voluntarily begun to use the state trauma registry. It is the intent of the Task Force to include all hospita ls in the trauma system, and the Task Force will encourage non-designated hospitals to co nsider participation as a designated center when the designation process is in place. a. Address their representation on the regional trauma committee. We have representation from several non-trauma hospitals (b oth large and small facilities) on the Trauma Task Force. b. Do they submit registry and/or financial data? Some are starting to submit registry data: 15 CAHs participated in a trauma re gistry pilot project entering severely injured patients transferred to a higher l evel of care into the registry, and 61 most are continuing to use the registry. One addit ional non trauma center hospital (Elkhart General) is currently entering data into t he registry. The hospitals that participated are listed below: West Central Community Hospital in Clinton (Vermill ion County) St. Mary's Warrick Hospital in Boonville (Warrick ounty) Blackford Community Hospital in Hartford City (Blac kford County) Dunn Memorial Hospital in Bedford (Lawrence County) St. Vincent Mercy Hospital in Elwood (Madison Count y) White County Memorial Hospital in Monticello Tipton Hospital in Tipton (Tipton County) Woodlawn Hospital in Rochester (Fulton County) Gibson General Hospital in Princeton (Gibson County ) Washington County Memorial Hospital in Salem (Washi ngton County) Community Hospital of Bremen (Marshall County) Bedford Regional Medical Center (Lawrence County) Rush Memorial Hospital in Rushville (Rush County) Bloomington Hospital of Orange County in Paoli Jay County Hospital in Portland c. What is their degree of engagement in the system-wi de performance improvement process? There is no system-wide PI process yet. 3. Describe the process for verification and design ation. Briefly outline the extent of authority granted to the lead agency to receive app lications and to verify, designate, and de-designate regional trauma centers. This process is not in place yet. Current Trauma Task Force plans are that Level I and Level II trau ma centers would be verified by the American College of Surgeons' (ACS) Committee on Tr auma (COT) with subsequent designation from the State of Indiana. Level III a nd Level IV trauma centers would be designated by the State of Indiana (see Appendix 3) . 4. Describe your standards for trauma center verifi cation (including pediatric standards) and the extent to which they are aligned with natio nal standards. This process is not in place yet. Current Trauma Task Force plans are tha t Level I and Level II trauma centers would be verified by the American College of Surgeo ns' (ACS) Committee on Trauma (COT) with subsequent designation from the State of Indiana. Level III and Level IV trauma centers would be designated by the State of Indiana (see Appendix 1). In June of 2007, 17 members of the Trauma Task Force came toge ther for a full-day retreat to discuss the designation process for Level III and I V hospitals, which resulted in the draft rules seen in Appendix 3, which have not yet gone t hrough the promulgation process. Notes from that meeting follow: Notes From June 23, 2007 Trauma System Planning Ret reat I. Trauma Task Force Members in Attendance: Charlene Graves, MD - ISDH (Trauma Medical Director ); Susan Perkins, RN - ISDH (Trauma System Manager); Joan Marciniak - Epi); John 62 Braeckel - ISDH (Hospital Preparedness); Spencer Gr over - IHHA; Tom Madden, MD - Indiana ACEP, Bloomington Hospital; Chris Hartman, MD Indiana ACEP, St. Francis Hospital; Tres Scherer, MD - Indiana ACS-COT and EM S-C, Riley Hospital; Matt Howard, RN Hospital; Sharon Hubrich - Daviess Tim Hayward, Hospital; Brian Mullis, M D - Wishard Hospital; Gerardo Hospital; Rick Lowry, RN - Meth odist Hospital; Merry Addison, MSN - Terre Haute Regional Hospital, IN ENA; Larry Addison, RN - West Central Community Hospital (CAH), IN ENA; Andrew Bowman, MS N, EMT-P - Witham Hospital II. Tom Madden reviewed the goals of a trauma syst em related to designation of hospital levels of care. In previous discussions, the Trauma System Advisory Task Force agreed that the system should be voluntary - once the crit eria have been developed, hospitals can select what level of care fits best and apply accordingly for that status. The goals of a trauma system facility designation process include: A) to facilitate the rapid identification, evaluati on and treatment of the trauma victim, B) to promote cooperation among treating facilities and efficient transportation of the trauma victim to the appropriate treating facility, C) to collect data concerning trauma victims and an alyze it to improve performance, D) to use this data to save lives and improve the h ealth of the population of Indiana. Hospital designation should be inclusive and all de signated hospitals will be required to submit data to the state trauma registry. The hosp ital designation process should be kept as simple and flexible as possible and needs to be elucidated in Administrative Rules which are now beginning to be developed in draft fo rm (a brief discussion was held later in the retreat). Because it has already been agreed to utilize the A CS-COT verification process for Level I and II hospitals, the retreat was designed to foc us on what is needed for Level III and IV hospitals to be designated, as in other states, through a state government agency, in this case ISDH. Comments included the need to create incentives for hospitals to become Level III care facilities, because extra costs to the hospital wil l be involved. Tom Madden and Tres Scherer then led the group thr ough a comprehensive review and discussion of the Level III and Level IV hospital d esignation criteria, with the final consensus being the criteria listed in Table 1 belo w. Table 1: TRAUMA CENTER DESIGNATION CRITERIA COMPAR ISON: ACS & Indiana Criteria. ( X = Required ; D = Desirable ). Comments are highlighted in yellow; items highlighted in red are from after the retreat. ACS Indiana: Proposed Criteria INSTITUTIONAL ORGANIZATION LEVEL III LEVEL IV LEVEL III LEVEL IV Trauma Program -Definition needed. Core is surgeon, EM doc, ED nurse. EM doc and surgeon can be co-directors - facility X X 63 decides. Level IV does not require a surgeon. Trauma Service - Have to have the correct type of p hysicians to care for the pt in the hospital (i.e. ortho trauma admission must have ortho surgeon available, etc.). Create policie s if needed.

X X Note: Requirement for ED medical director at a Lev el III center would \"grandfather in\" those ED medic al directors not currently board certified. The rules will need to be written to reflect this and have a deadline date (i.e. \"Emergency department medical directors must be board certified for hospitals applying for Level III designation after {date}.\"). 1. Regional organization of the trauma system - RACs ( Regional Advisory Councils) should be considered at some point. 2. Redesignation process for hospitals will need a sit e survey team for Level III, but Level IV initial designation and redesignation may be possible to accomplish through processes already in place for ISDH hospital survey s for licensure. 3. Ideally, Level I and II hospitals would sponsor/rea ch out to proposed Level III or IV hospitals to assist them with accomplishing state d esignation. 4. Transport, transfer and care protocols are needed w ithin the trauma system but are not included in the current Indiana legislation (SE A 284 of 2006). 5. Discussion was held as to the site survey process a nd who should be involved, but no final consensus was achieved. 6. The recent development of free-standing emergency d epartments (geographically separate from hospitals) creates issues that will n eed to be identified and discussed. 7. ?: Does there need to be a requirement for Level I II centers for minimum number of ED visits per year? III. Administrative Rules Discussion: 1. A first rough draft of administrative rules for tra uma center designation was compiled by Charlene Graves from information gathered from o ther states. This document was reviewed and briefly discussed. Spencer Grover and John Braeckel will work on revisions to the language/content of this 2. Under Levels of Care, the need for transfer languag e for I's & II's for receiving patients from III's & IV's was discussed. Resource s need to be in place to facilitate communication from physician to physician for ease of transfer to higher level of care. It was noted that Level I & II facilities sh ould always agree to receive trauma patients from Level III & IV facilities. Reference was made to the language in Chapter 4, p. 27 of the ACS green book. 3. There should be a transfer plan in place to facilit ate the process - tells when a patient needs to be transferred. 4. There was discussion regarding the terminology in t he Levels of Care, III & IV sections: transfer agreements should be changed to transfer plans , and treatment protocols should be changed to treatment guidelines . 65 5. Throughout the day, the term \"system hospital\" was mentioned several times. This was in reference to hospitals that do not choose an y of the other designations or that do not qualify for any of the other designations. Susan Perkins is going to research the terminology that other states use for these hos pitals. IV. Trauma Registry Update Susan Perkins provided an update on the status of t he Indiana Trauma Registry. She also handed out a copy of Ohio's Trauma Registry Rules a s an example that Indiana can use to start developing rules for the trauma registry. V. Performance Improvement (PI) Indicators Susan Perkins handed out copies of: PI information from the ACS-COT Trauma Performance Improvement Reference Manual, Chapter 16 of the ACS green book (Performance Impro vement and Patient Safety), Quality improvement filters from Washington State, and Performance Indicators and Outcome Measures from Au stralia. Tres Scherer handed out Indiana EMSC Performance Im provement Measures for 2006. The group was asked to review these documents after the retreat and provide feedback to Susan either by email or by participating in the PI discussion at the upcoming August 3 rd Task Force meeting. Susan will compile a brief document on proposed PI indicators for Indiana to present at the next Task Force meeting. VI. Strategic Planning Many strategic planning issues were covered in earl ier discussion during the retreat. Issues and comments from the discussion of 12 issue s are provided below. Strategic Planning for Indiana Trauma System Develo pment - From June 23, 2007 Retreat (Comments from discussion at the Retreat ar e bulleted and in italics ) The following is a list of some issues that seem pe rtinent to our strategic planning efforts: 1. Should there be a State Trauma Care Commission c reated and appointed by the Governor? Currently the ISDH Trauma System Advisory Task Forc e is a voluntary group of interested parties that has been meeting s ince 2004. With more than 50 members and broad representation, it provides a str ong forum for dialogue. About 35 members attend each quarterly meeting. The group ha s worked well to provide the input needed to ISDH and continues to examine a number of important issues. There are pros and cons to consider when comparing the current adv isory group to a state commission, which would be a more official entity. Commission is needed eventually, although the Task Force currently accomplishes 66 the functions needed for the initial development of the trauma system. A summer Study Commission (in 2008) might be useful in creating further legislation that may be needed. A status report and data relat ed to the trauma system would need to be provided. Should this commission be a governmental entity or a not-for-profit type of non- governmental entity? 2. Should there be more efforts at regionalization in the development of the state trauma system? Some states utilize a regional basis for their trau ma system (Texas, Michigan, others). Are there good reasons to consi der regionalization for Indiana, assuming the regions would be aligned with the ten EMS/Public Health Preparedness Districts already in existence? Are there drawbacks to regionalization? Further efforts at regionalization are desirable to enhance communication between all stakeholders and to deal with local issues. RA Cs (Regional Advisory Councils) provide this function in some states. 3. How can the critically needed financing for tra uma system infrastructure and for compensation to hospitals for non-reimbursed ca re to trauma patients be accomplished? Spencer Grover of IHHA surveyed a number of states to determine the sources for funding their trauma systems. While th ere are a number of possibilities to be considered, it is likely that something similar to a fee on motor vehicle registrations, automobile purchases, or alcoholic beverages should be considered since motor vehicle crashes and violence related to alcohol are large c ontributors to the burden of trauma. How can advocacy for such funding be accomplished? At a previous Task Force meeting, Dr. Hanni suggest ed we should begin working on this issue, and indicated his willingness to begin addressing it with local legislators. 4. Selecting performance improvement indicators an d processes is important in the early stages of the state trauma registry and the t rauma system hospital designation process. What are the optimal methods to incorpora te performance and outcome measures into the system? What should be the role of sentinel events? Susan Perkins is researching and collecting perform ance improvement indicators, which will be disseminated and presented for discus sion at future Task Force meetings. A Committee or Workgroup may be needed to provide ini tial feedback. 5. What are the special issues affecting trauma car e providers, including orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, anesthesiology and rehabilit ation medicine? On-call a growing issue for the surgica l subspecialties. 6. How do we incorporate trauma care consideration s for special populations, e.g., pediatrics, patients with burns, geriatrics, etc. i nto the trauma system? 67 These issues will need further exploration as the t rauma system is developed . 7. Delivery of trauma care in the rural areas of t he state is problematic for a number of reasons. How can we improve that situati on? Improved EMS capabilities and funding need to be ex amined. The use of telemedicine as well as thinking in regional terms rather than counties are also important factors. Expanded education related to t rauma issues has begun and needs to continue. 8. How can coordination best be maintained between the governing agencies and organizations for pre-hospital care, hospitals with varying levels of ability to provide trauma care, rehabilitation services, and i njury prevention? The Task Force provides a valuable forum for inform ation sharing and coordination. ENA representation on the Indiana EMS Commission wo uld be helpful. More work needs to be done on standards and guidelines for tr iage, transfer and care of trauma patients. 9. How can coordination and collaboration be maint ained between governing agencies and organizations involved in preparedness and disaster planning? What is the role of the trauma system and trauma centers in this collaboration? Much coordination and collaboration is already bein g achieved through federal funding to support preparedness/bioterrorism. More attention to the function and role of state trauma systems and trauma centers is becoming evident in the federal hospital preparedness objectives. 10. What is the role of new technologies, such as telemedicine, in the trauma care system? Improving care through telemedicine is of particula r importance for small rural hospitals, many of which are critical access hospit als that receive federal funding through FLEX grants administered by the Indiana Off ice of Rural Health at ISDH. 11. Should trauma registry data for smaller hospit als (Level IV) be somewhat different than that for larger hospitals? Issue not discussed due to lack of time. 12. Statewide protocols for transport and care of trauma patients are a necessary element of a state trauma system, but were not incl uded as a responsibility in PL 155 of 2006. How can protocol development and ado ption be achieved? It appears that the initial legislation may need to be amended at some point in the future, but much preparatory work on disseminating information and educating EMS 68 and hospital providers can be done in the interim. a. Describe any waivers or program flexibility granted for centers not meeting verification requirements. N/A at the state level. b. Describe the process and frequency of use for de-de signation of trauma centers. N/A at the state level. 5. Outline how the geographic distribution and numb er of designated acute care facilities is aligned with patient care needs. There are no designated facilities in Indiana yet. With the locations of the seven ACS-verified level I and II trauma centers in Northeastern, Central and Southwestern Indiana, there are two are as of the state that could potentially benefit from the addition of trauma centers: North western and Southeastern Indiana. a. Describe the process by which additional trauma cen ters are brought into the system. Additional trauma facilities can be brought into th e system through verification and designation when Indiana has rules in place to do that. Generation of interest in the trauma system is bein g accomplished by the efforts of the Trauma Task Force membership. Examples of how the trauma centers are promoting tr auma system involvement follow: - St. Mary's trauma staff have visited seven of the D istrict 10 hospitals to encourage their involvement in the state trauma sys tem and have offered support in the verification process if the hospital s in their district wish to pursue verification. They provided each hospital w ith a copy of Resources for Optimal Care of the Injured Patient, Indiana Tr auma Network minutes, Trauma Task Force minutes, and the Indiana Sate Tra uma System DVD. Three facilities have expressed interest in becomin g a Level III or IV center. St. Mary's staff maintain contact with the m via e-mails and letters offering support and opportunities for them to send nursing representatives to St. Mary's to observe their processes. The Injur y Prevention/Outreach Coordinator travels to speak to various groups, suc h as pre-hospital providers and critical access hospital staff, about the trauma system through invitation and various conferences. They h ave several trauma lectures for anyone to view through the St. Mary's website. They have a 1- 800 trauma transfer line in their Emergency Departm ent. - Parkview Trauma Center's trauma outreach coordinato r has taken on s leadership role serving the regional twenty county referral area in Northeastern Indiana and Northwestern Ohio to provi de education on trauma system and trauma system development. Dr. A aland has done many outreach presentations as well. Parkview also has a Trauma Prevention Coordinator and Trauma Strategist. The y have a \"one call does it all\" 1-800-727-6911 flight response number. - The other trauma centers reach out to the hospitals and providers in their districts as well and have had staff from surroundi ng hospitals attend a 69 variety of courses such as Principles of Trauma, PA LS, ACLS, TNCC, ENPC, ATLS, and PHTLS. Deaconess Hospital continue s to conduct RTTD courses throughout District 10. b. Describe the system response to the voluntary withd rawal of designation by acute care facilities. N/A at the state level. c. Describe the mechanism for tracking and monitoring patient volume and flow between centers and how this influences the overall configuration of designated facilities. N/A at the state level. 6. Describe your system for assessing the adequacy of the workforce resources available within participating centers. N/A at the state level. a. Address nursing and subspecialty needs (trauma or g eneral surgery, intensivists, neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, anesthetists, p ediatric surgeons, and others, as required). N/A at the state level. b. What human resource deficiencies have been identifi ed, and what corrective actions have been taken? N/A at the state level. 7. Describe the educational standards and credentia ling for emergency physicians and nursing staff, general surgeons, specialty surgeons , and critical care nurses caring for trauma patients in designated facilities. N/A at the state level. a. What regional educational multidisciplinary confere nces are provided to care providers? Who is responsible for organizing these events? N/A at the state level. Hospitals hosting annual trauma conferences: Clarian Health (Methodist and Riley -Level I) Wishard - Level I Parkview - Level II Memorial (South Bend) - Level II Deaconess - Level II St. Mary's (Level II) is planning a Pediatric Trau ma Symposium in 2009. The Methodist Hospitals (Gary) Terre Haute Regional Hospital System Coordination and Patient Flow 1. Describe the source of pre-hospital trauma triag e protocols, and specify whether they are consistent with national guidelines. N/A at the state level yet - there is now legislation for the creation of these (based on the ACS triage scheme - see EMS section), and a workgroup has been established. 70 An example of local pre-hospital trauma triage prot ocols follows: For response in the city of Fort Wayne, the provisi ons are established by the city ordinance. Allen County has been divided between t wo hospitals, one a verified trauma center (Parkview) and one that is currently pursuing Level II verification (Lutheran). For ambulance transports, the protocol is for the patient to be taken to the closest hospital between Parkview and Lutheran hosp itals. For flight response, all flights are to be transported to the verified traum a center per the protocol agreed upon by the medical directors of the providers. The authority for the Fort Wayne EMS program is thr ough a city ordinance that establishes an EMS public utility model with an EMS board and a medical control process that is tied to all five of the Fort Wayne hospitals. Through an agreement with Allen County, the city EMS program also has ju risdiction in the county to provide Advanced Life Support to residents living i n the county outside the city limits of Fort Wayne. All Allen County providers are a mi xture of volunteer and paid staff and provide BLS to the townships they serve. Each EMS service has a Medical Director and EMS Chief that provide leadership, aud it and review, QA, and medical control of the service. The local unit of governme nt, township trustee, county government and hospital administration, depending o n the specific organization, governs counties adjacent to Allen County. a. Describe how children and patients with severe T BI and SCI are triaged from the field to appropriate facilities. There are no pediatric triage protocols. 2. Within the system, what criteria are used to gui de the decision to transfer patients to an appropriate resource facility and are these criteri a uniform across all centers? There are no uniform criteria in place at the state level. 3.

Describe the system-wide policies addressing the mode of transport and the type and qualifications of transport personnel used for inte r-facility transfers. This does not exist at the system level. 5. Specify whether there is a central communication s system to coordinate inter-facility transfers. Describe how this system has access to i nformation regarding resource availability within the region. This does not exist at the system level. Rehabilitation 1. Provide data about the number of rehabilitation beds and specialty rehabilitation services (SCI, TBI, and pediatric) available within the trauma system's geographic region. On average, how long do patients need to wa it for these rehabilitation beds? Does the average wait vary by type of rehabilitation nee ded? There are 21 CARF accredited rehab providers in Indiana, five with specialty acc reditation for BI and one (Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana) with SCI speci alty accreditation. The total number of inpatient acute care hospital rehabilitation bed s is 904 (see table below). Onset days for SCI from eRehabData for last 180 days (as of Se ptember, 2008) lists regional (including Indiana) at 25.14 and Nation as 23.91 an d BI at 22.93 Regional and 23.19 for the Nation.

Riley Hospital for Children at Methodist Hospital has a 14 bed pediatric rehabilit ation unit as well as a day treatment program and outpatient services. St. Vincent Pedia tric Rehabilitation Hospital also provides pediatric rehabilitation services. 2. Describe how existing trauma system policies and procedures appropriately address treatment guidelines for rehabilitation in acute an d rehabilitation facilities. Indiana has no existing trauma system policies and procedures. 3. Identify the minimum requirements and qualificat ions that rehabilitation centers have established for the physician leaders (for example, medical director of SCI program, medical director of TBI program, and medical direct or of rehabilitation program). Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility basic requirement s for the Medical Director are set by Medicare, requiring a licensed MD/DO with at least a one year internship and two years of experience treating patients in need of rehabili tation. At the institutional level, Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana requires that pr ogram medical directors (BI and SCI) maintain specialty certification as provided by Ame rican Academy of Physical Medicine &Rehabilitation. 4. Describe how rehabilitation specialists are inte grated into trauma system planning and advisory groups. At the trauma system level, Marc Duerden, a physiat rist at Hook Rehab is a member and active participant of the Trauma Ta sk Force; the Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana is showing an interest in participating now as well. The ISDH also maintains relationships with the rehabilitation community thr ough it's assistance with the Indiana Spinal Cord and Brain Injury Research Board and the state trauma system manager's participation in the TBI Grant Advisory Council/Wo rk Group. Rehabilitation representatives in addition to Dr. Duerden have als o been invited to participate in this trauma system consultation. Disaster Preparedness 1. When was the last assessment of trauma system pr eparedness resources conducted, and what were the significant findings of the assessmen t as they relate to emergency preparedness? Trauma system preparedness is not currently specifi cally assessed. ED readiness is assessed and the Incident Command Syst em is instituted where applicable. 74 A group of stakeholders met in 2001 and completed a trauma/disaster preparedness assessment that was published by HRSA in 2002 as a national state by state assessment of trauma system and disaster preparedness. This s ame group of stakeholders had a meeting in 2002 and performed a SWOT analysis of th e assessment, and a summary of that assessment is below (full documentation can be found in Appendix 5): INDIANA TRAUMA ASSESSMENT CONFERENCE SWOT ANALYSIS (2002) NOTE: At the Indiana trauma assessment conference, discu ssion topics reflected various components of a trauma system (injury prevention, e mergency medical services, hospital care, special needs [burns, pediatrics, and geriatr ics], rehabilitation, trauma registry, etc.). Participants completed a SWOT analysis sheet (attac hed) after each topic. Responses are listed and summarized below. Fewer than five respon ses are omitted due to illegibility or duplication of another response in the same section from the same participant. Editorial interpolation is indicated by brackets ([.....]). Participants were not asked to priorit ize responses from most to least important. In addition, the number, diversity, and brevity of responses makes it impractical to weight a particular response based on whether a participan t listed it first or last. Therefore, \"Top Choices\" indicates the frequency of each response i n a particular section. Substantially equivalent responses in a section are grouped toget her for purposes of this summary.

Concern about which state agency would administ er trauma registry (2) Another trauma system/injury prevention SWOT analys is (Appendix 14) was written in January of 2008 by the trauma system manager, who w as unaware at the time that a previous SWOT analysis had been completed. This do cument is not as comprehensive as the 2002 assessment, but can provide some useful in formation for system assessment. 2. What actions were taken to remediate or mitigate the gaps identified through tabletop or simulated responses in disaster drills among the acute care facilities participating in the system? Since the SWOT analysis in 2002, there have been se veral changes in Indiana to help resolve some of the issues identified. Indian a now has a primary seatbelt law that includes passenger trucks, as well as new booster s eat laws (both described in the injury epidemiology section of this document). All counti es in Indiana now have 911 access. 79 Public Law 155, 2006 gives legislative authority to the ISDH for development of a trauma system in Indiana, and through the diverse g roup of individuals represented on the Trauma Task Force, there is now a commitment to ens uring that a comprehensive trauma system is developed. We now have a statewide traum a registry that will assist with the development of the system and with performance impr ovement activities, and the creation of the Spinal Cord and Brain Injury Resear ch Board and Fund, as well as the Indiana TBI Grant Advisory Board are generating muc h needed interest in the rehabilitation needs around the state. The trauma system has not been addressed in tableto p, simulated responses, or disaster drills. Monthly communications checks were inaugurated and interoperable communication systems are being established. The st ate is looking at the IPICS system for communication utilization. A statewide Triage tag system is being established and utilized by EMS and hospitals for continuity of care. Regular evaluatio n of preparedness is done on a district level with drills and exercises involving ED functi ons and hospital capacity. 3. What is the trauma system plan to accommodate a need for a surge in personnel, equipment, and supplies? At present, each of the 10 Preparedness Districts i s developing district plans for surge in beds, supplies and pers onnel. The state has established a Bed Tracking system to comply with the HAvBED national system. Most of the 147 hospitals will be on line with this system reporting utilizat ion of beds on at least a daily basis indicating the vacant beds, the surge beds, and the ED capacity. Each of the districts is developing a cache of needed supplies and equipment . A state wide hospital materials management tracking system will be inaugurated in 2 009/2010. All of the hospitals in the state will have access to the information on bo th systems. The state's Emergency System for Advance Registrati on of Volunteer Health Personnel (ESAR-VHP) has approximately 3500 names listed, and the registry became operational at the end of September, 2008. This has allowed ad ditional volunteers to be added, and the information is kept current. Of note, through the efforts of Senators Wyss and Miller (members of the Trauma Task Force) volunteer health care workers in Indiana who are deployed in a disaster now have liability p rotection (P.L.138-2006, SEC.13). 4. How is the trauma system integrated into the sta te's incident command system and the communications center? During all of the preparedness drills and actual in cidents, the hospitals activate their Incident Command Systems w hen applicable. Regular communication checks and drills are held in each of the districts. 5. What strategies and mechanisms are in place to e nsure adequate inter-hospital communication during an MCI? It is suggested that each hospital have redundant interoperable communication capabilities internally and externally, as well as with other hospitals, EMA's, and community entities that are u tilized during a Mass Casualty Incident. The state is instituting a communications program called IPICS, which is an interoperable system that coordinates all forms of communication, (i.e. radio, land lines phones, cell phones, computers, and more). The stat e is also setting up District talk 80 groups for each of the 10 preparedness districts th at will allow hospital communications free of other confusing communications traffic. System-wide Evaluation and Quality Assurance 1. What is the membership of the committee charged with ongoing monitoring and evaluating of the trauma system? There is no mandate in place for any ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the trauma system. Th e Trauma Task Force is comprised of members from each of the state's seven trauma cente rs, the ISDH, the IDHS, Indiana ENA, Indiana ACEP, Indiana ACS-COT, EMS-C, ISMA, In diana legislature, rural and urban EMS, rural and urban non trauma center hospit als, insurance, medicine, nursing, pediatrics and others. a. To whom does it report its findings? The Indiana State Department Health. b. How does it decide what parameters to monitor? We are in the process of looking at what other states are doing to help dete rmine what parameters we should be monitoring in Indiana. c. What action is it empowered to take to improve trau ma care? So far, legislation only covers the establishment of ISDH as the lead a gency, creation of a state trauma registry, creation of rules for the designat ion of hospitals as trauma centers, and for the EMS Commission to establish EM S trauma transport protocols. 2. Describe the trauma system performance improveme nt efforts as they pertain to the system for the following groups of providers in the context of system integration: a. Dispatch centers - There is no formal PI process in place. b. Pre-hospital provider agencies - More and more pre-hospital providers and agencies are becoming interested in trauma system d evelopment through the EMS trauma protocol workgroup and/or the Trauma Task Fo rce. Their input is critical as Indiana moves forward in this process. c. Trauma centers - All of the state's seven trauma centers have repres entation on the Trauma Task Force and are some of it's most act ive members; several are participating in the EMS workgroup as well. d. Other acute care and specialty facilities - There are now many non-trauma center hospitals represented on the Trauma Task Force, inc luding several critical access hospitals, and the interest and participation conti nues to grow(see Trauma Task Force Membership list in the introductory section o f this document). e. Rehabilitation centers - To date, only one rehabilitation facility has provi ded representation to the Trauma Task Force, but more i nterest is being generated, in part because of the recently created Indiana Spinal Cord and Brain Injury 81 Research Fund and Board (2007). More involvement of rehabilitation centers does need to occur in the future and is being encou raged. 3. List the process and patient outcome measures th at are tracked at the trauma system level, including measures for special populations. There are none to date. The state trauma registry is still in the implementation phas e, and there is not enough data to analyze yet. 4. As part of your system-wide performance improvem ent, specify whether each of the following is assessed on a regular basis: a. Time from arrival to a center and ultimate discharg e to a facility capable of providing definitive care. If yes, specify the mean time to transfer. Not at the system level yet. b. Proportion of patients with injury more severe than a predefined injury severity threshold (for example, ISS >15, or other criteria) who receive definitive care at a facility other than a Level I or II trauma center ( under-triage). Not at the system level yet. c. Proportion of patients with injury less severe than a predefined injury severity threshold (for example, ISS <9) who are transferred from any facility to a Level I or II trauma center (over-triage). Not at the system level yet. 5. Describe how your system addresses problems rela ted to significant over-triage or under-triage, both primary and secondary. This is an issue that has not been assessed. Trauma Management Information Systems 1. Which agency has oversight of the trauma MIS? The ISDH. a. Describe the role and responsibilities of the lead agency in collecting and maintaining the data. The ISDH is responsible for collecting trauma data for the State of Indiana. Indiana selected ImageTrend's Tr auma Bridge as the software for the state registry. The seven trauma centers h ave existing trauma registries at their facilities, and they are in the process of im porting their data to the state registry electronically. The registry is still in the implementation phase, but 16 critical access hospitals have participated in a pi lot project with the registry, and one other non trauma center hospital is currently e ntering trauma data into the registry as well. The newly-hired trauma registry manager will be responsible for encouraging additional hospitals to participate in the registry and for monitoring the quality of data in the registry. b. How are the completeness, timeliness, and quality o f the data monitored? The state trauma registry is still in the implementatio n phase, and this has not been monitored yet, other than the validity checks that are done when data is uploaded, etc. 82 2. Specify which of the following data sources are linked to the information system. Describe the method of linkage (for example, probab ilistic or deterministic). a. Motor-vehicle crash or incident data - Not yet. That is planned for the future, after the implementation issues are resolved. (COD ES Network Program Grant via P.U. CRS) b. Law enforcement records - Not yet. That is planned for the future, after the implementation issues are resolved. c. EMS or other transporting agency records - Scheduled for early 2009, when the EMS reporting system is upgraded to compliance with NEMSIS standards. d. ED records - See \" f \" below. e. Hospital records (hospital trauma registries) - Trauma centers export data from their registries and import into the state system. Their registry vendors are currently completing their state export process and /or working out the issues detected, along with the state vendor. Four trauma centers have successfully imported data and two more are expected soon. One Level I trauma center has experienced a data corruption problem with their tr auma registry, so their import will be delayed for an as yet undetermined amount o f time. f. Hospital administrative discharge data - This includes inpatient and outpatient (ED) data. Linkage to hospital discharge data is n ot currently feasible due to the incompleteness of records that limits the usefulnes s of data (lack of mandatory e- coding resulting in only about 44 to 55 percent of records e-coded, lack of outpatient reporting by one Level I trauma center). g. Rehabilitation data - This is planned for the future. h. Coroner and medical examiner records - This is also planned for the future. (CODES Network Program Grant via P.U. CRS) i. Financial or payer data - This is included in hospital discharge data. j. Dispatch - Much of this will be included in the EMS data. 3. What are the regional trauma registry inclusion criteria? Indiana Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria : Definition: To ensure consistent data collection across the Sta te and with the National Trauma Data Standard, a trauma patient is defined a s a patient sustaining a traumatic injury and meeting the following criteria : 83 At least one of the following injury diagnostic codes defined i n the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinica l Modification (ICD-9-CM): 800-959.9, 994.8 (electrocution & nonfatal effects of electric current) And including one or more of the following: - hospital admission (24 hours or greater) and/or: - pt transfers via EMS/law enforcement (including Air Ambulance) from one hospital to another (even if later discharged from the ED) and/or: - death resulting from the traumatic injury (independ ent of hospital admission or transfer status) Excluding: ICD-9-CM 905-909.9 (late effects of - ingested, \"o n\" eye, etc.) Injuries greater than 14 days old 4. Which stakeholders had a role in selecting the d ata elements for inclusion into the regional registry? The ISDH, the Indiana Trauma Network and a workgrou p of several of the hospital trauma registrars and the trauma sy stem manager. a. From what source(s) were the data field definitions derived? It is based on the National Trauma Data Standard, with a few extra dat a points added from other states data dictionaries, as well as the NEMSIS dat aset. b. What pediatric data elements are captured? Patient weight, Pediatric Trauma Score, Child Specific Restraint. 5. What local or system-wide reports are routinely generated and at what frequency? There has not been enough data in the registry yet to determine routine reports. 6. Are data contributed to the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) or other outside agencies? If so, please specify which agencies. The state trauma registry is too new and doesn't yet have sufficient data to report to the N TDB or other agencies. Reporting is planned in the future. EMS is working on contract between INDHS EMS and Univ of Utah / NEMSIS. Research 1. Describe the current procedures and processes in vestigators must follow to request access to the trauma system registry. N/A at this time at the state level. At the hospit al level, each trauma center has established policies and procedures for requesting data from their registries. 2. What are the mechanisms used to ensure patient c onfidentiality when regional trauma registry data are used by investigators? N/A at this time at the state level. 84 3. Provide examples of where research was conducted for the purpose of providing evidence that the processes of care and outcome of injured patients in the system's region are within acceptable standards. N/A at this time at the state level. 4. How has research been used to modify policy or p ractice within the system? N/A at this time at the state level. 5. What resources (for example, personnel and fisca l) are available to the lead agency to assist in conducting system research? N/A at this time at the state level. However, dat a from the individual trauma center trauma registries will be transmitted to the State to enable them to conduct research. 85 Section 4: Postconsultation Measures Indicators of Trauma System Development Status: ASSESSMENT 101.2 There is a description of injuries within the traum a system jurisdiction including the distribution by geographic area, high-risk popu lations (pediatric, elder, distinct cultural/ethnic, rural, and others), incidence, pre valence, mechanism, manner, intent, mortality, contributing factors, determinants, morb idity, injury severity (including death), and patient distribution using any or all the follo wing: vital statistics, emergency department (ED) data, EMS data, hospital discharge data, State police data (those from law enforcement agencies), medical examiner data, t rauma registry, and other data sources. The description is updated at regular inte rvals. *Note: Injury severity should be determined through the consistent and system-wide application of one of the existing injury scoring m ethods, for example, Injury Severity Score (ISS). 0 Not known 1 There is no written description of injuries withi n the trauma system jurisdiction. 2 One or more population-based data sources (e.g., vital statistics and medical examiner data) describe injury within the jurisdict ion, but clinical data sources are not used. 3 One or more population-based data sources and one or more clinical data sources are used to describe injury within the j urisdiction. 4 Multiple population-based and clinical data sourc es are used to describe injury within the jurisdiction, and the description is sys tematically updated at regular intervals. 5 Multiple population-based and clinical data sourc es (e.g., trauma registry, ED data, and others) are electronically linked and use d to describe injury within the jurisdiction. 102.2 Injury surveillance is coordinated with statewide a nd local community health surveillance. 0 Not known 1 Injury surveillance, as described in 102.1, does not occur within the system. 2 Injury surveillance occurs in isolation from othe r health risk surveillance and is reported separately. 3 Injury surveillance occurs in isolation but is co mbined and reported with other health risk surveillance processes. 4 Injury surveillance occurs as part of broader hea lth risk assessments. 5 Processes of sharing and linkage of data exist be tween EMS systems, public health systems, and trauma systems, and the data are used to monitor, investigate, and diagnose community health risks . 102.3 Trauma data are electronically linked from a variet y of sources. 86 *Note: Deterministically means with such patient id entifiers as name and date of birth. Probabilistically means computer software is used t o match likely records through such less certain identifiers as date of incident, patie nt age, gender, and others. 0 Not known 1 Trauma registry data exist but are not determinis tically or probabilistically linked to other databases. 2 Trauma registry data exist and can be determinist ically linked through hand- sorting processes. 3 Trauma registry data exist and can be determinist ically linked through computer-matching processes. 4 Trauma registry data exist and can be determinist ically and probabilistically linked to at least one other injury database includ ing: EMS data systems (i.e., patient care records, dispatch data, and others), E D data systems, hospital discharge data, and others. 5 All data stakeholders (insurance carriers, FARS, and rehabilitation, in addition to typical trauma system resources) have been ident ified, data access agreements executed, hardware and software resource s secured, and the \"manpower\" designated to deterministically and prob abilistically link, analyze, and report a variety of data sources in a timely ma nner. POLICY DEVELOPMENT 201.4 The lead agency has adopted clearly defined trauma system standards (e.g., facility standards, triage and transfer guidelines, and data collection standards) and has sufficient legal authority to ensure and enforce compliance. 0 Not known 1 The lead agency does not have sufficient legal au thority and has not adopted or defined trauma system performance and op erating standards, nor is there sufficient legal authority to do so. 2 Sufficient authority exists to define and adopt s tandards for trauma system performance and operations, but the lead agency has not yet completed this process. 3 There is sufficient legal authority to adopt and implement operation and performance standards including enforcement. Draft process procedures have been developed. 4 The authority exists to fully develop all operati onal guidelines and standards; the stakeholders are reviewing draft policies and p rocedures; and adoption by the lead agency, including implementation and enfor cement, is pending. 5 The authority exists; operational policies and pr ocedures and trauma system performance standards are in place; and comp liance is being actively monitored. 203.1 The lead agency, in concert with a trauma-specific multidisciplinary, multi-agency advisory committee, has adopted a trauma system pla n. 87 0 Not known 1 There is no trauma system plan, and one is not in progress. 2 There is no trauma system plan, although some gro ups have begun meeting to discuss the development of a trauma system p lan. 3 A trauma system plan was developed and adopted by the lead agency. The plan, however, has not been endorsed by trauma stakeho lders. 4 A trauma system plan has been adopted, developed with multi-agency groups, and endorsed by those agencies. 5 A comprehensive trauma system plan has been devel oped, adopted in conjunction with trauma stakeholders, and includes the integration of other systems (e.g., EMS, public health, and emergency pr eparedness). 203.4 The trauma system plan clearly describes the system design (including the components necessary to have an integrated and incl usive trauma system) and is used to guide system implementation and management. For exa mple, the plan includes references to regulatory standards and documents, and includes methods of data collection and analysis. 0 Not known 1 There is no trauma system plan. 2 The trauma system plan does not address or incorp orate the trauma system components (prehospital, communication, transportat ion, acute care, rehabilitation, and others), nor is it inclusive of all-hazards preparedness, EMS, or public health integration. 3 The trauma system plan provides general informati on about all the components including all-hazards preparedness, EMS , and publi c health integration; however, it is difficult to determine who is respon sible and accountable for system performance and implementation. 4 The trauma system plan addresses every component of a well-organized and functioning trauma system including all-hazards pre paredness and public health integration. Specific information on each component is provided, and trauma system design is inclusive of providing for specifi c goals and objectives for system performance. 5 The trauma system plan is used to guide system im plementation and management. Stakeholders and policy leaders are fam iliar with the plan and its components and use the plan to monitor system progr ess and to measure results. 204.2 Financial resources exist that support the planning , implementation, and ongoing management of the administrative and clinical care components of the trauma system. 0 Not known 1 There is no funding to support the trauma system planning, implementation, or ongoing management and operation s for either trauma system administration or trauma clinical care. 2 Some funding for trauma care within the third-par ty reimbursement structure 88 has been identified, but ongoing support for admini stration and clinical care outside the third-party reimbursement structure is not available. 3 There is current funding for the development of t he trauma system within the lead agency organization consistent with the trauma system plan, but costs to support clinical care support services have not been identi fied (transportation, communication, uncompensated care, standby fees, an d others). No ongoing commitment of funding has been secured. 4 There is funding available for both administrativ e and clinical components of the trauma system plan. A mechanism to assess ne eds among various providers has begun. Implementation costs and ongoi ng support costs of the lead agency have been addressed within the plan. 5 A stable (consistent) source of reliable funding for the development, operations, and management of the trauma program (clinical care and lead agency administration) has been identified and i s being used to support trauma planning, implementation, maintenance, and ongoi ng program enhancements. 204.3 Designated funding for trauma system infrastructure support (lead agency) is legislatively appropriated. *Note: Although nomenclature concerning designated, appropriated, and general funds varies between juri sdictions, the intent of this indicator is to demonstrate long-term, stable funding for tra uma system development, management, evaluation, and improvement. 0 Not known 1 There is no designated funding to support the tra uma system infrastructure. 2 One-time funding has been designated for trauma s ystem infrastructure support, and appropriations have been made to the lead ag ency budget. 3 Limited funds for trauma system development have been identified, but the funds have not been appropriated for trauma syst em infrastructure support. 4 Consistent, though limited, infrastructure fundin g has been designated and appropriated to the lead agency budget. 5 The legislature has identified, designated, and a ppropriated sufficient infrastructure funding for the lead agency consiste nt with the trauma system plan and priorities for funding administration and operations. 208.1 The trauma system and the public health system have established linkages including programs with an emphasis on population-b ased public health surveillance, and evaluation, for acute and chronic traumatic injury and injury prevention. 0 Not known 1 There is no evidence that demonstrates program li nkages, a working relationship, or the sharing of data between public health and the trauma system. Population-based public health surveillance, and ev aluation, for acute or chronic traumatic injury and injury prevention has not been integrated with the trauma system. 2 There is little population-based public health su rveillance shared with the 89 trauma system, and program linkages are rare. Routi ne public health status reports are available for review by the trau ma system lead agency and constituents. 3 The trauma system and the public health system ha ve begun sharing public health surveillance data for acute and chronic trau matic injury. Program linkages are in the discussion stage. 4 The trauma system has begun to link with the publ ic health system, and the process of sharing public health surveillance data is evolving. Routine dialogue is occurring between programs. 5 The trauma system and the public health system ar e integrated. Routine reporting, program participation, and system plans are fully vested. Operational integration is routine, and measurable progress can be demonstrated. (Demonstrated integration and linkage could include such activities as rapid response to and notification of incidents, integrat ed data systems, communication cross-operability, and regular epidem iology report generation.) ASSURANCE 301.1 The lead trauma authority ensures that each member hospital of the trauma system collects and uses patient data as well as provider data to assess system performance and to improve quality of care. Assessment data are rou tinely submitted to the lead trauma authority. 0 Not known 1 There is no system-wide management information da ta collection system that the trauma centers and other community hospita ls regularly contribute to or use to evaluate the system. The Indiana Trauma Registry is still in it's implementation phase. When fully fun ctional, the registry will be used to assess system performance. 2 There is a trauma registry system in place in the trauma centers, but it is used by neither all facilities within the system no r the lead trauma authority to assess system performance. 3 The trauma management information system contains information from all facilities within a geographic area. 4 The trauma management information system is used by the trauma centers to assess provider and system performance issues. 5 Hospital trauma registry data are routinely submi tted to the lead trauma authority, are aggregated, and are used to evalu ate overall system performance. 302.1 There is well-defined trauma system medical oversig ht integrating the specialty needs of the trauma system with the medical oversig ht for the overall EMS system. *Note: The EMS System medical director and the trau ma medical director may, in fact, be the same person. 0 Not known 1 There is no medical oversight for EMS providers w ithin trauma system. 90 2 EMS medical oversight for all levels of prehospit al providers caring for the trauma patient is provided, but such oversight is p rovided outside of the purview of the trauma system. There is no state-wide oversight (oversight is at the local level only). Also, there is no traum a or state EMS medical director in Indiana at this time. 3 The EMS and trauma medical directors have integra ted pre-hospital medical oversight for pre-hospital personnel caring for trauma patients. 4 Medical oversight is routinely given to EMS provi ders caring for trauma patients. The trauma system has integrated medical oversight for pre-hospital providers and routinely evaluates the effectiveness of both on-line and off-line medical oversight. 5 The EMS and trauma system fully integrate the mos t up-to-date medical oversight and regularly evaluate program effectiven ess. System providers are included in the development of medical oversight po licies. 302.6 There are mandatory system-wide pre-hospital triage criteria to ensure that trauma patients are transported to an appropriate facility based on their injuries. These triage criteria are regularly evaluated and updated to ens ure acceptable and system-defined rates of sensitivity and specificity for appropriately id entifying the major trauma patient. 0 Not known 1 There are no mandatory universal triage criteria to ensure trauma patients are transported to the most appropriate hospital. Legislation was passed in 2008 directing the EMS Commission to develop pre-ho spital trauma triage protocols for Indiana. A workgroup has been establ ished and is working to develop these protocols. 2 There are differing triage criteria guidelines us ed by different providers. Appropriateness of triage criteria and subsequent t ransportation are not evaluated for sensitivity or specificity. 3 Universal triage criteria are in the process of b eing linked to the management information system for future evaluation. 4 The triage criteria are used by all pre-hospital providers. There is system-wide evaluation of the effectiveness of the triage tools in identifying trauma patients and in ensuring that they are transported to the ap propriate facility. 5 System participants routinely evaluate the triage criteria for effectiveness. There is linkage with the trauma system, and sensitivity and specificity (over- and under-triage rates) of the tools used are regularly reported through the trauma lead authority. Updates to the triage criteria are made as necessary to improve system performance. 303.1 The trauma system plan has clearly defined the role s and responsibilities of all acute care facilities treating trauma and of facili ties that provide care to specialty populations (e.g., burn, pediatric, spinal cord inj ury, and others). 0 Not known 1 There is no trauma system plan that outlines role s and responsibilities of all 91 acute care facilities treating trauma and of facili ties that provide care to special populations. 2 There is a trauma system plan, but it does not ad dress the roles and responsibilities of licensed acute care and spec ialty care facilities. 3 The trauma system plan addresses the roles and re sponsibilities of licensed acute care facilities or specialty care faciliti es, but not both. 4 The trauma system plan addresses the roles and re sponsibilities of licensed acute care facilities and specialty care facilit ies. 5 The trauma system plan clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of all acute care facilities treating trauma within the system j urisdiction. Specialty care services are addressed within the plan, and appropr iate policies and procedures are implemented and tracked. 307.1 The trauma system engages in regular evaluation of all licensed acute care facilities that provide trauma care to trauma patients and des ignated trauma hospitals. Such evaluation involves independent external reviews. 0 Not known 1 There is no ongoing mechanism for the trauma syst em to assess or evaluate the quality of trauma care delivered by all license d acute care facilities that provide trauma care to trauma patients and designat ed trauma hospitals. 2 There is a mechanism for the trauma system to eva luate trauma care services in designated trauma hospitals through internal perfor mance improvement processes. 3 There is a mechanism to evaluate trauma care serv ices across the entire trauma care system through performance improvement proc esses. 4 Review of trauma care quality is both internal (t hrough routine monitoring and evaluation) and external (through independent revie w during re-designation or re-verification of trauma centers). 5 Quality of trauma care is ensured through both in ternal and external methods. Internal review is regular, and participation is ro utine for trauma stakeholders. External independent review teams provide further a ssurance of quality trauma care within all licensed acute care and trauma faci lities treating trauma patients. 308.1 The lead agency has incorporated, within the trauma system plan and the trauma center standards, requirements for rehabilitation s ervices including interfacility transfer of trauma patients to rehabilitation centers. 0 Not known 1 There are no written standards or plans for the i ntegration of rehabilitation services with the trauma system o r with trauma centers. 2 The trauma system plan has incorporated the use o f rehabilitation services, but the use of those facilities for trauma patients has not been fully realized. 3 The trauma system plan has incorporated requireme nts for rehabilitation services. The trauma centers routinely use the reha bilitation expertise although written agreements do not exist. 92 4 The trauma system plan incorporates rehabilitatio n services throughout the continuum of care. Trauma centers have actively inc luded rehabilitation services and their programs in trauma patient care plans. 5 There is evidence to show a well-integrated progr am of rehabilitation is available for all trauma patients. Rehabilitation p rograms are included in the trauma system plan, and the trauma centers work clo sely with rehabilitation centers and services to ensure quality outcomes for trauma patients. 311.4 Laws, rules, and regulations are routinely reviewed and revised to continually strengthen and improve the trauma system. 0 Not known 1 There is no process for examining laws, rules, or regulations. 2 Laws, rules, and regulations are reviewed and rev ised only in response to a \"crisis\" (e.g., malpractice insurance costs). 3 Laws, rules, and regulations are reviewed and rev ised on a periodic schedule (e.g., every 5 years). 4 Laws, rules, and regulations are reviewed by agen cy personnel on a continuous basis and are revised as needed. 5 Laws, rules, and regulations are reviewed as part of the performance improvement process involving representatives of al l system components and are revised as they negatively impact system perfor mance. 93 Appendix 1: State Agency Organizational Charts 94 95 Executive Staff (as of 10/08) Executive Director - Joe Wainscott Chief of Staff - Mike Garvey Director of Emergency Response & Recovery - Arvin C opeland Director of Fire & Building Safety - Jim Greeson - State Fire Marshal Director of the Indiana Intelligence Fusion Center - Monte McKee Director of Planning & Assessment - Jason Hutchens Director of Preparedness & Training - Brad Thatcher Director of Support and Services - George Thompson 96 97 98 Appendix 2: Indiana Draft Trauma Registry Rules 99 INDIANA STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Emergency Rule LSA Document #07- (E) DIGEST Temporarily adds rules to establish a state trauma registry for the collection of information regarding the delivery of emergency medical services in the state and the frequency at which the services a re provided for purposes of IC 16-19-3-28.

(a) The levels of care adopted by the depar tment are the American College of Surgeons Trauma Center Levels I, II, III, and IV. (1) Level I Trauma Center: The Level I facility is a resource trauma center that is a tertiary care facility central to the trauma car e system. Ultimately, all patients who require the resources of the Level I center sh ould have access to it. This facility must have the capability of providing lea dership and total care for every aspect of injury, from prevention through rehabili tation. In its central role, the Level I center must have adequate depth of resourc es and personnel. In addition to acute care responsibilities, Level I trauma cen ter have the major responsibility of providing leadership in education, research, an d system planning. This responsibility extends to all hospitals caring for injured patients in their districts. Research and prevention programs are essential for Level I trauma centers. (2) Level II Trauma Center : The Level II trauma center is a hospital that also is expected to provide initial definitive trauma care , regardless of the severity of injury. Depending on geographic location, patient volume, personnel, and 110 resources, however, the Level II trauma center may not be able to provide the same comprehensive care as a Level I trauma center . Therefore, patients with more complex injuries may have to be transferred t o a Level I center. Level II trauma centers may be the most prevalent facility in a community, managing the majority of trauma patients. In some areas where a Level I center does not exist, the Level II center should take on the responsibil ity for education and system leadership. (3) Level III Trauma Center : The Level III trauma center serves communities that do not have immediate access to a Level I or II institution. Level III trauma centers can provide prompt assessment, resuscitati on, emergency operations, and stabilization and also arrange for possible transf er to a facility that can provide definitive trauma care. General surgeons are requ ired in a Level III facility. Planning for care of injured patients in these hos pitals requires transfer agreements and standardized treatment guidelines. (4) Level IV Trauma Facility : Level IV trauma facilities provide advance trauma life support before patient transfer in remote are as where no higher level of care is available. Because of geographic isolation, ho wever, the Level IV trauma facility is the de facto primary care provider. A s at Level III trauma centers, treatment guidelines for resuscitation, transfer g uidelines, data reporting, and participation in system performance improvement ar e essential. (b) Each trauma center shall: (1), submit trauma care patient data electronicall y to the state trauma registry on all (closed?) patient files at least quarterly for the purpose of allowing ISDH to analyze causes and medical consequences of serious trauma while promoting the continuum of care that provides timely and app ropriate delivery of emergency medical treatment for people with acute traumatic injury. (2) submit trauma care patient data that includes the payor source for patient care on discharge with financial data classified as : (A) self pay, (B) commercial insurance, (C) Medicare, (D) Medicaid, or (E)workers compensation. (3) submit trauma care patient data no later than 30 days after each quarter. (4) maintain documentation to show that timely tra nsmission of data has been submitted to the state trauma registry on a quarte rly basis. (c) Failure to timely submit trauma care patient da ta to the state trauma registry for three consecutive quarters shall result in disciplinary a ction deemed appropriate, including, but 111 not limited to, citation of civil monetary penaltie s and/or loss of trauma designation status. 10 IAC ___________________TRAUMA HOSPITAL DESIGNATI ON Sec.2.

Indiana Trauma System Performance Improvement (from Utah) The goals of Indiana's Trauma System are to: - promote optimal care of trauma patients by match ing the injured patient's needs to existing resources so that appropriate, cost effect ive trauma care is achieved; - alleviate unnecessary death and disability from trauma and emergency illness; - inform health care providers about trauma system capabilities; - encourage the efficient and effective continuum of patient care, including prevention, pre-hospital care, hospital care, and rehabilitati ve care; - and minimize the overall cost of trauma care. The goals of the Department of Health, the Trauma S ystem Advisory Task Force and the Trauma Performance Improvement Team (not developed yet) are to develop, implement, and conduct trauma care system evaluation, quality assessment, and performance improvement. The trauma committees will assist the ISDH in establishing standards for the collection of data, evaluation of the results a nd to recommend refinements in the established standards. 118 As trauma care systems have developed over the year s, it has become evident that ongoing assessment, evaluation, and re-evaluation o f the care of trauma patients and of a trauma system is essential to the nurturing and bui lding of improvement initiatives focused on optimal patient care. The on-going asses sment, evaluation, and reevaluation of trauma care and of the trauma system must be don e within a well-defined performance improvement process. A trauma system performance improvement (PI) proces s consists of two major components: The internal component within each hospital or EMS provider agen cy, and the external (system) component. Trauma centers, resource hospit als and EMS providers are responsible to conduct internal PI. With the a ssistance of this guide and the TPIT, ISDH will conduct statewide external PI. Quality of care can be evaluated on the basis of st ructure, process, and outcomes. Resources are characteristic of structure; componen ts of the encounter between practitioner and patient are characteristics of pro cess; and the patient's health status is characteristic of outcome. Hospital and agency (internal) PI evaluates structure by monitoring availability of resources, equipment, co mmunication, policies, procedures, and organization. Hospital and agency PI evaluates process by monitoring personnel availability, timeliness of treatment, procedures, adherence to protocols, appropriateness of care, and practitioner performance compared to a n established norm. Hospital PI evaluates outcome by monitoring patient response to treatment, compli cations, morbidity, mortality, disability and effects of rehabilitation . Trauma care facility PI programs are of paramount importance and cannot be under recognized . As Indiana's trauma system continues to evolve, trauma care facilities across the state are developing and/or evaluating their respective internal PI programs fo r trauma care. The focus of internal PI is on individual practitioners and individual pa tients. The focus of external PI is on system components and overall system effec tiveness. Both programs look at structure (resources), process (care delive red), and results (outcome), but differ in how this is accomplished. The key to success in any PI program is to base improvement initiatives on information that comes from valid an d reliable data. Indiana's trauma system has set the stage for trauma care facilities , ambulance service programs, and the Department of Health to do just that. It is essent ial that system performance improvement be pursued to facilitate evolution of I ndiana's trauma system and to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the system. S ystem (external) PI evaluates structure by monitoring hospital availability, ambulance serv ice program availability, and overall resource availability. System PI evaluates process by monitoring patient triage and transfer, trauma system standards (local protocols or state guidelines), transport times, appropriateness of the receiving facility, appropri ateness of inter-facility transfer, over- triage and under-triage, and how the components of the trauma system interact with each other. System PI evaluates outcome by monitoring morbidity, mortality, disability, and by monitoring the overall effectiveness of the system. The purpose of the Trauma Performance Improvement T eam is to assist the Department of Health in developing, implementing, and conducti ng trauma care system evaluation, performance assessment, and performance improvement . 119 Components of the trauma system: Prevention a. Public Information & Education/Prevention - to heig hten public awareness of injury as a preventable public health problem, of how to access the EMS system, and emphasize prevention as the key to reduce traum atic injuries. Acute Care b. Access/Communication Centers - the process by which the public places a call for help and how emergency medical services are mobiliz ed. This also includes communication between facilities (e.g., consultatio n between physicians by means of phone, ICN, telemedicine.) c. Pre-hospital Care - the evaluation, treatment, and appropriate field management of the injured patient at the scene by pre-hospital ca re providers. d. Triage, Transport, and Transfer - the process by wh ich patients are assessed for time critical injuries; the determination of the mo st appropriate transportation resources; and the determination of the most approp riate facility capable of meeting the needs of the injured patient. e. Definitive Care - a network of trauma care faciliti es that provide a full spectrum of care for injured patients. Rehabilitation f. Rehabilitative Care - a network of facilities that provide care and reconditioning necessary to bring the patient back to maximal func tional capacity in society. Hospitals will report information (data) to the Tra uma Registry at the Indiana State Department of Health. The trauma registry data repr esents information regarding the most critically injured patients. Pre-hospital, hos pital discharge and eventually rehabilitation data will be linked to the trauma re gistry. ISDH will develop a state report generated from the Trauma Registry. Specialized rep orts will be created based on the audit filters and performance indicators created by the TPIT. The Team will analyze the reports to identify strengths or areas needing impr ovement regarding the treatment, triage, transport and transfer of the most critical ly injured patients. Areas needing improvement will undergo further analysis, which ma y require additional information from the Trauma Registry or other available sources of data. Problem solving methods will be initiated and recommendations for improveme nt may be provided to ISDH by the TPIT. A process to follow-up (re-evaluate) will be established for the recommendations made to ISDH by the TPIT. Recommended Hospital System Indicators 1.

Indiana Trauma System Audit Filters 122 Trauma patients who die in-hospital between 4 and 2 4 hours after the time of injury, stratified by hospital level. (Time from injury to hospital discharge used since time of death is not collected.) List hospital, elapsed time, ED admission time, age , cause code, transport mode, and ISS for each patient meeting criterion. Trauma patients with more than one inter-hospital t ransfer prior to definitive care. (Definitive care is defined as the final discharge hospital.) List hospitals sending and accepting the transfer f or each patient meeting criterion. Ground transport trauma patients with an ED RTS les s than or equal to 5.5 and scene transport times (scene departure to ED arriva l) greater than 20 minutes. List (and sort by) hospital, transport mode, EMS ag ency, scene to hospital transport time, injury county, cause code, ISS, and outcome for eac h patient meeting these criteria. Values for the RTS are in the range 0 to 7.8408. Th e RTS is heavily weighted towards the Glasgow Coma Scale to compensate for major head injury without multi-system injury or major physiological changes. A threshold of RTS < 4 has been proposed to identify those patients who should be treated in a trauma center, although this value may be somewhat low. Trauma patients with EMS scene times (EMS scene arr ival to EMS scene departure) greater than 20 minutes. List EMS agency, transport mode, scene time, scene procedures (air, CPR, fluids), trauma type, injury zip code (injury county), ISS, and outcome for patients meeting criterion. Transferred trauma patients with an ISS greater tha n 15 and transfer time (ED admit to definitive hospital admit) greater than 6 hours for rural place of injury or 4 hours for urban place of injury. List ED hospital, definitive hospital, urban or rur al place of injury, transfer time, cause code, ISS, and outcome for patients meeting criteri a. 123 Trauma patients with an ISS greater than 15 and ED time (ED admit to ED discharge) greater than 2 hours. List hospital, patient transfer? (yes or no), cause code, and ED time for patients meeting criteria. Trauma patients who die with a probability of survi val (TRISS) > 50%. TRISS score for trauma patients using physiologic measure s collected at the first presenting hospital.) List hospital, age, cause code, transport mode, ISS , outcome, LOS, and TRISS for patients meeting criteria. Trauma patients who live with a probability of surv ival (TRISS) < 50%. (TRISS score for trauma patients using physiologic measure s collected at the first presenting hospital.) List hospital, age, cause code, transport mode, ISS , outcome, LOS, and TRISS for patients meeting criteria. The coefficients b0 - b3 are derived from multiple regression analysis of the Major Trauma Outcome Study (MTOS) database. Age Index is 0 if the patient is below 54 years of age or 1 if 55 years and over. b0 to b3 are coef ficients which are different for blunt and penetrating trauma. If the patient is less than 15, the blunt coefficients are used regardless of mechanism. The TRISS calculator determines the probability of survival from the ISS, RTS and patient's age. ISS and RTS scores can be inputted i ndependently or calculated from their base parameters. 124 Trauma patients with an ISS greater than 15 who are discharged from non-trauma centers. List hospital, age, cause code, transport mode, ISS , outcome, discharge disposition, and time to discharge for each patient meeting criteria . Trauma patients transported by EMS without an assoc iated ambulance report in the medical record. List percentage of missing run reports by transport mode and EMS agency. Trauma patients less than 13 years old (children) w ho either had an ED GCS less than or equal to 8, intubation, or ISS greater than 15 and not transferred to a regional pediatric trauma center. List hospital, age, ED GCS, ISS, cause code, LOS, a nd transport mode for each patient meeting criteria. 125 Appendix 5: 2002 SWOT Analysis and Survey 126 INDIANA TRAUMA ASSESSMENT CONFERENCE SWOT ANALYSIS (2002) NOTE: At the Indiana trauma assessment conference, discu ssion topics reflected various components of a trauma system (injury prevention, e mergency medical services, hospital care, special needs [burns, pediatrics, and geriatr ics], rehabilitation, trauma registry, etc.). Participants completed a SWOT analysis sheet (attac hed) after each topic. Responses are listed and summarized below. Fewer than five respon ses are omitted due to illegibility or duplication of another response in the same section from the same participant. Editorial interpolation is indicated by brackets ([.....]). Participants were not asked to priorit ize responses from most to least important. In addition, the number, diversity, and brevity of responses makes it impractical to weight a particular response based on whether a participan t listed it first or last. Therefore, \"Top Choices\" indicates the frequency of each response i n a particular section. Substantially equivalent responses in a section are grouped toget her for purposes of this summary.

ISDH provides ASPR funds to all willing hospitals f or emergency preparedness efforts. To better assist individual hospitals in becoming b etter prepared and more coordinated, a guide was developed to assist in achieving this goa l. This is to act as a guide in developing hospital emergency preparedness efforts. Individual hospitals will need to evaluate and modify this model based on resources a nd capabilities. However, all participating hospitals must have written procedure s for each highlighted component. Highlighted components are ASPR Grant Level-One, Tw o and Overarching Sub- Capabilities. All other components are encouraged, but not required. The ISDH Area Hospital Coordinators can provide ass istance in emergency preparedness efforts. A model emergency prepared hospital, when fully develop, will have the following components, but not limited to: Basic Hospital Emergency Preparedness Components 1. Safety/Emergency Preparedness Committee o The hospital has a committee to oversee the develop ment and implementation of a hospital emergency operations p lan (EOP). o The committee will be composed of numerous hospital employees of various management levels and from various departme nts, but should have at least the chief medical officer, an executive ad ministrator, infection control and a safety officer. o The committee should be chaired by an executive adm inistrator to ensure upper management has knowledge and supports emergen cy preparedness efforts. o The committee will ensure emergency preparedness po licies are addressed and implemented in the hospital's EOP. o The committee will also ensure the hospital meets a ll 17 National Incident Management System (NIMS) elements. o The hospital's Chief Executive Officer will identif y one official Bioterrorism (BT) Coordinator, preferably a safety officer or risk manager, to organize and mange the emergency prepar edness efforts as well as represent the facility at the district leve l. 2. Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) /head2right The hospital will designate the BT Coordinator to b e responsible for developing, maintaining and implementing the hospit al's EOP. /head2right The hospital has an EOP, which addresses \"all hazar ds\" and coordinates efforts with the local community and district EOP. 185 /head2right The hospital has a multi-disciplinary Emergency/Saf ety Committee, which meets regularly to ensure the EOP is being maintain ed. a. Surge Bed the hospital will develop evaluation, discharge and transfer procedures in the event of an emergency. /head2right The hospital has a procedure to rapidly discharge, transfer and create additional surge beds in the event of an emergency, natural or unnatural. /head2right All hospitals will determine surge beds based on th e following calculation: 1) Number of current staffed beds + other beds you could staff in a disaster - average daily census + beds made available from discharged/transfer = potentially available staffed surge bed capacity. /head2right The hospital will meet the minimum surge bed level for the community by using the following calculation: 1) County population \u00f7 2,000 = minimum surge bed level 2) 3) If a county has multiple hospitals, the followin g calculation is to be used: 3) County population \u00f7 2,000 =?? \u00f7 Number of hospitals = surge bed level per hospital. /head2right The hospital will participate in the State provided bed and inventory tracking system (EWA Phoenix). b. Hospital Incident Command System (HICS): the hospital will maintain a list of hospital incident commanders and copies of IS - 100, 200, 700 and 800 certificates. /head2right The hospital has a process to implement the Hospita l Incident Command System (see HICS Guidebook) and to coordinate their HICS with that of other emergency response organizations (local and district - wide). /head2right The hospital has provided appropriate staff (i.e. C hief Executive Officer, Chief Fiscal Officer, and Chief Operations Officer) with training (IS-100, IS-200, IS-700, IS-800) regarding the individual's role and the hos pitals role in the county and district EOP. /head2right The hospital has adopted the top 8 positions of the HICS and has Job Action Sheets for these 8 positions. /head2right The hospital has identified a Hospital Incident Com mander (HIC) and a Hospital Command Center (HCC). /head2right The hospital incident command team will be educated and trained in all NIMS classes and in the district and state hospital EOP.

The survey link was sent to colleagues on the Indiana T rauma Taskforce listserv, members of the Indiana Trauma Network, the Injury Prevention Advis ory Council and a listserv of all emergency departments in the state. The survey directions al so indicated to forward the survey to others in the injury prevention field who could provide infor mation and might not have received the survey from the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH). The survey was distributed via survey monkey and th e ISDH received 55 unduplicated responses. Of the 55 respondents, 70.9% (39/55) in dicated that their organization had an injury prevention (IP) program. The majority (71.8%, 28/3 9) of the injury prevention programs are hospital based. Of the respondents who indicated t hat they did not have an actual IP program, three indicated that some type of injury prevention was being done at their facility, ie, car seat checks, attendance at health fairs, fire department programs. After indicating whether or not an injury preventio n program existed at the organization, the next question asked about focus area topics for each pro gram. Out of the 55 respondents, 42 groups (39 with specific IP programs and 3 without specifi c IP programs) checked or wrote in the focus areas that applied to their organizations. The top focus areas were motor vehicle crashes followed by bike/pedestrian safety and falls. Almo st three-quarters of the respondents indicated that motor vehicle crashes were a focus area in the ir organization (30/42, 71.4%) and almost the same number of people indicated that bike/pedestria n safety was a focus area (28/42, 66.7%) (See Table 1). The next question on the survey asked about the emp hasis or goals of each injury prevention program. Again, 42 groups (38 with IP programs and 3 without IP programs) responded to the question. Education was a goal of almost 100% of t he respondents (41/42, 97.6%) followed by awareness (39/42, 92.9%) (See Table 2). A list of different populations was provided in the next question that asked about the types of populations that the IP groups work with. There we re 42 respondents to the question (39 with IP programs and 3 without programs). The largest popu lation that the respondents work with around Indiana is children (37/42, 88.1%) followed by adolescents (36/42, 85.7%). Only 54.8% of respondents indicated that they work with the el derly population (23/42). Males and females are represented about equal, but less than half of the respondents indicated that they work with the gay/lesbian/transgender population in their inj ury prevention efforts (16/42, 38.1%). Different racial groups are represented about equal ly (See Table 3). The next question asked: \"What geographic location does your program cover?\" Respondents answered the question differently and some indicate d the counties that they serve, others indicated a region of Indiana, while others indicat ed specific cities. However, the answers can provide an indication of where injury prevention pr ograms are being conducted. Of the 42 respondents (39 with IP programs and 3 without prog rams, but whom conduct IP activities), 2 respondents indicated that their IP programs are sp ecific to their hospital employees, 9 respondents indicated large geographic regions such as Northeast Indiana, Northwest Indiana, Central Indiana (6 respondents), and Southwest Indi ana. Six respondents indicated that their programs covered the entire state and that they can provide education and programming to any 350 groups or organizations. Other respondents indicat ed the specific county that is covered in their IP program and 19.6% (18/92) of Indiana counties we re represented in this survey. One respondent said that they cover 50 counties while a nother said they cover the tri-state area of Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky. One respondent ind icated that their program is national and international while another respondent indicated th at their group has chapters throughout Indiana. The survey does have limitations. One limitation i s that not all Injury Prevention groups throughout the state submitted data. More follow-u p is needed in order to obtain the most complete data. However, the current data provides information on the types of programs that exist and does provide a good baseline of the types of injury prevention being done throughout Indiana. Another limitation is that even if a resp ondent has an injury prevention program, there is no way to identify if the injury prevention prog ram is being evaluated and if the program is working. A follow-up survey should be sent to expa nd on the questions already asked. Different age and gender structures, ethnicity and attitudes, resources, social structure and environments lead to different types and severity of injuries an d different injury rates. To ensure access to adequate resources required for studying these diff erences, outcomes and evaluation must be conducted. Table 1.

Access to data from motor vehicle crash reports and related databases is needed as part of a comprehens ive injury surveillance system. The development of injury surveillance at ISDH bega n in 2002, with funding from a CDC Core Injury surveillance and program development coopera tive agreement. However, that funding, which primarily supported an injury epidemiologist, ended in 2005. Some limited funding is being provided by the ISDH Maternal and Child Healt h block grant to support an epidemiologist (0.6 FTE) to work on injury data on a part-time bas is. Through a change in state law, access to Indiana's hospital discharge database (property of the Indiana Hospital & Health Association) began in 2002. A comprehensive data analysis of In juries in Indiana was published in September of 2005 and can be accessed through the ISDH websit e. This report analyzed Indiana injury mortality data from 1999-2001 and hospital discharg e data from 2002. Data analysis is limited by the fact that ICD-9-CM E-codes for defining exte rnal cause of injury are optional in Indiana, and only 55% of injury-related hospital discharges contain E-codes. An Injury Prevention Advisory Council meets quarterly to assist the prog ram but sufficient resources do not exist at this time to maintain an active injury surveillance system or to expand to implement programs and education campaigns to reduce the toll of the d eaths and injuries in the state. Work on development of an Indiana trauma system beg an in May of 2004, with the formation of an ISDH Advisory Task Force on Trauma System Develo pment/Emergency Preparedness (now known as the ISDH Trauma System Advisory Task Force ). Through broad representation from all seven hospitals with American College of Surgeo ns Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT)- verified Level I or II trauma centers, all 10 Publi c Health Preparedness/Emergency Response districts, and numerous other constituencies, much progress has been made in discussing the many issues pertinent to a statewide trauma system. In 2006, the Indiana legislature passed Senate Enro lled Act 284 (now P.L. 155 2006), which provides ISDH with the authority to develop a state trauma system, including a state trauma registry and a designation process for hospitals as trauma centers. This recent accomplishment is fully supported by the Indiana EMS Program (located within the Indiana Department of Homeland Security) and provides the framework for I ndiana to move ahead with trauma system development. While some funding was provided for th is effort through the HRSA Trauma-EMS Program during 2004-06, no future HRSA funding is a vailable as that particular HRSA program was eliminated. However HRSA hospital bioterrorism preparedness funding did support the position of the contractual state Trauma System Man ager (who began work at ISDH in April 2006) through the end of 2006. The Trauma System M anager is currently being funded through the Office of Rural Health. Strengths 356 - A newly developed focus on trauma system developme nt and injury prevention within ISDH - An initial injury surveillance system developed, wi th a data report on injuries in Indiana completed in 2005, accessible through the ISDH webs ite - An injury and violence prevention resource director y published in 2005, available through the ISDH website - Numerous active partnerships throughout the state: - Indiana Rural Health Association - Indiana Injury Prevention Advisory Council - Indiana Trauma System Advisory Task Force - Indiana Farm Bureau Insurance - Indiana Emergency Nurses' Association - Indiana Chapter of American College of Emergency Ph ysicians - Indiana Chapter of American College of Surgeons - C ommittee on Trauma and Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMS-C) - Indiana Hospital and Health Association - Indiana Department of Homeland Security, Fire and E mergency Medical Services - Indiana Criminal Justice Institute, Traffic Records Division - Indiana Trauma Network - National Association of State EMS Officials, Trauma Managers Council - Indiana Suicide Prevention Coalition - Indiana TBI Advisory Council - Indiana Adolescent Health Coalition - Sexual Violence Primary Prevention Council - ISDH Office of Rural Health - Indiana Spinal Cord Brain Injury Research Board - Brain Injury Association of Indiana - The Trauma System Task Force is a vigorous and comm itted group, with broad representation from numerous agencies and organizat ions - The seven hospitals with ACS-COT Level I or II trau ma centers geographically cover the state fairly well except for northwestern Indiana, which relates to Chicago and Southeastern Indiana, which relates to Cincinnati a nd Louisville.

AN INJURY PREVENTION AND CONTROL PLAN FOR INDIANA DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT The Indiana State Department of Health - Injury Prevention Program, - Injury Prevention Advisory Council, and the - Trauma System Advisory Task Force January 2005 Page 2 - Acknowledgements and Contributions Page 3 - Table of Contents 361 INTRODUCTION Injuries pose a public health issue with a major im pact on the lives of Indiana citizens. The Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) proposes this Injury Prevention and Control Plan for Indiana that describes some major injury problems a ffecting Hoosiers. The Plan provides a \"blueprint\" for individuals, organizations, and age ncies to use in facing this challenge to the health and lives of Indiana residents. Five goals were selected that address the injury is sues of falls, motor vehicle crashes, residential fires, poisonings, and suicide . Related objectives, action steps, and prevention strategies are described in the Plan (pages XX to XX). In Indiana, the unintentional inj uries of falls, motor vehicle crashes and poisonings account ed for more than 3 out of 4 injury-related hospitalizations in 2002, and for 60% of unintentio nal injury deaths from 1999 - 2001. Suicide accounted for 10% of hospitalizations and 20% of in jury deaths during the same time periods. While there are certainly many injury issues that r equire consideration, the injury issues selected for this Plan were based on an analysis of relevant data, of which some is extracted in this Plan report. The companion report - \"Injuries in Indiana \" - provides detailed information on a variety of injuries affecting Hoosiers. Copies of both this State Plan and \"Injuries in Indiana\" can be accessed through the ISDH website: www.statehealth.in.gov/programs/injury or by contacting the ISDH Injury Prevention Program. The work of the ISDH Injury Prevention Program is supported by a cooperative agreement #U17/CCU522371 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BACKGROUND Injury refers to damage to the body caused by excha nges with environmental energy that are beyond the body's resilience. i Injury may either be unintentional (accidental) or intentional (violence-related including assault, homicide and suicide). For exam ple, a teenager who sustains a head injury while participating in athletics is considered to have an unintentional injury, while a teenager who takes an overdose of acetaminophen as a suicide attempt woul d be categorized as an intentional injury. Injuries can lead to lifelong physical and emotional scars. Nationally, injuries (unintentional and intentional ) are the 4 th leading cause of death for all ages. ii, iii Unintentional injury accounts for the vast majority of injury deaths and can be defined as deaths invo lving injury or poisoning by unpremeditated measures. In Indiana and the United States, unintentional injur y is the leading cause of death among persons 1 to 34 ye ars and the 5 th leading cause of death overall. 4 Although injury deaths are significant, non-fatal i njuries happen more frequently and pose a serious public health problem. Hospitalization and other m edical care provided to the injured person produce a financial and economic burden on society. In terms of medical treatment, loss of productivity and wag es, and rehabilitation for those severely injured, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that th e financial cost of injuries exceeds $224 billion ann ually. Results from a CDC analysis in 2000 showed t hat injury-attributable medical expenditures accounted for 10 percent of total medical expenditures, a fig ure similar to percentages of other leading public heal th concerns, such as obesity and smoking. 2 362 The injury pyramid below provides a visualization of the reality that injury -related deaths are far outnumbered by nonfatal injuries. There are a variety of strategies that can be effec tive for preventing injuries and controlling the effects of injuries. These generally fall within t hree categories: legal or policy changes, product and environmental safety developments, and educatio n. The data in this report was compiled by the ISDH In jury Prevention Program staff. It should be noted that the mortality data is based on a 3-year period: 1999 - 2001. The hospital discharge data is from 2002, the first year that this databas e was made available to the ISDH. Unintentional Injuries Through the Age Span Children ages <1 (less than age 1 year) to 14 years accounted for 8 percent (1405) of all unintentiona l injury hospitalizations in Indiana during 2002. Si xty-five percent of these were males. Infants and young children are at increased risk for sustaining injur ies from motor vehicle crashes, falls, drowning, fi res, and poisoning. Young children are exploratory in nature and curious about their environment. With limited cognitive ability and physical coordination, childr en are less capable of identifying and avoiding uns afe environments. Children and adolescents are more susceptible to mo tor vehicle crashes, bicycle crashes, pedestrian injuries, dog bites, and suicide. This age group is often unable to judge if an environment is safe an d are also more likely to demonstrate risky behaviors sti mulated by impulse. (1) The leading causes of death among teens and young a dults are motor vehicle injuries, drowning, suicide and homicide. Consequently, teens are involved in v iolence more than any other age group. (1) Safe driving skills only improve with experience in oper ating a motor vehicle. Experimentation with or involvement in illegal drugs or alcohol are also im portant risk factors for injuries. The leading causes of unintentional injury death am ong adults (ages 20 to 64 years) are overwhelmingly motor vehicle crashes (54.6%), followed by poisonings (12.4% , largely related to suicide attempts . Falls 363 are also of concern, emerging as one of the five leading causes of death beginnin g at age 35 years as the 4th leading cause of death, then becoming the 2 nd leading cause at age 55 years and the leading caus e at age 75 years. The role of unsafe driving practices, failure to we ar a seat belt, or driving while intoxicated contin ue to be contributing factors to the toll of deaths and inju ries related to motor vehicle crashes. Suicide cont inues to be among the top five leading causes of death (for injury and non-injury causes) for age groups 20 to 54 years. Homicide as a cause of death predominates in the 15 to 34 year-old age groups. Both physical and cognitive changes play a role in older Americans' (65 years and older) susceptibilit y to motor vehicle-related injuries, falls, and suicide. As Americans age, their bones become more fragile , they experience problems with vision, their reflexe s become slower and some are cognitively impaired b y depression or other mental illness. Although Americ ans are living healthier, longer lives, facing the reality of poor vision, limited mobility, the loss of loved ones, and the development of chronic illne ss can be devastating. Feelings of isolation and adjustin g to a less active lifestyle increase the risk of s uicide. (1) INDIANA INJURY MORTALITY DATA From 1999-2001, there were 10,143 injury-related de aths in Indiana, an age-adjusted fatality rate of 5 5.66 per 100,000 people compared to the U.S. rate of 53. 7 . Among these deaths, 63 percent (6,633) were unintentional, making mortality by an unintentional intent the 5 th leading cause of death in Indiana. As is typical for all injuries, males die from inju ries more often than females (Figure 2). Injury fa tality rates vary through the age spectrum, being lowest b etween 5 and 14 years of age, increasing from age 1 5 to 24 years, then decreasing somewhat until 65 year s of age, when a large increase begins (Figure 3). Injury fatality rates are highest in African-Americ ans and less in Caucasians and Asians (Figure 4). T able 1 lists Indiana unintentional injury deaths in rank order by mechanism of injury (Page 7).

HOSPITALIZATIONS RELATED TO INJURY While deaths are the most devastating outcome relat ed to injuries, the analysis of hospitalizations related to injury provides additional useful inform ation. Although injury deaths are significant, non-fatal injuries occur more frequently. Hospitali zation and other medical care provided to the injured places a financial and economic burden on s ociety. In terms of medical treatment, lost productivity and wages, and rehabilitation for thos e severely injured, injury costs the United States more than $224 billion annually. 367 The source agency for the collection of hospital di scharge data is the Indiana Hospital & Health Association (IHHA). IHHA supported a recent change in state law allowing the ISDH Epidemiology Resource Center to receive this data f or year 2002 and forward. In 2002, there were a total of 779,332 Indiana inpa tient hospitalizations. Among these, 12.5 percent (97,504) had an injury-related diagnosis co de (ICD-9-CM 800-999) in any of 15 diagnosis fields. However, only forty-four percent (43,106) had at least one supplemental External Cause of Injury Code (E code). (EXPLAIN E Codes here). This E coded portion of the hospital discharge data was standardized for analys is based on recommendations from the Injury Surveillance Workgroup of the State and Territorial Injury Prevention Directors Association (STIPDA) leaving a total of 20,598 records that wer e analyzed for this report. For the purposes of this report, injury-related hos pitalizations is defined as records among Indiana residents in which the principal reason for admission to a non-federal, acute care, inpatient facility was an injury, including late ef fects, but excluding adverse effects of therapeutic drugs and adverse effects of medical/su rgical care and the late effects of those adverse effects. Note: this definition includes re admissions, transfers, and deaths occurring in the hospital. Highlights from an analysis of the Indiana hospital discharge database are listed below: Unintentional (\"accidental\") injuries comprised 84 percent of all injury-related admissions. Ten per cent related to self-inflicted injuries, 4% wer e assault-related, and 2% were of undetermined intent. Hospitalizations for unintentional injuries were 6 times more frequent than hospitalizations for intentional injuries. Of the five leading causes of injury resulting in h ospitalization, 46 percent (9,516) were due to falls, 17 percent (3,283) were due to motor vehicle traffic-related incidents, 16 percent (3,285) resulted from poisoning, 4 percent (746) were struc k by or against injuries, and 3 percent (568) were due to other transport injuries. Burns related to fires accounted for 1% of hospitalizations (221). Falls were the leading cause of unintentional injur y hospitalizations, composing 55% of unintentional injury-related hospitalizations. Se venteen percent of all unintentional injury hospital discharges were due to falls from slipping , tripping or stumbling. The great majority of motor vehicle traffic-related hospitalizations involved motor vehicle occupants (2,403 of 3,276 =73%). the cate gories (568), motorcyclists (398), bicyclists (248), and pedestri ans (273) are also of concern. Poisoning was the leading cause of self-inflicted i njury hospitalizations, accounting for 93% of this category of hospital admission. Suicide attemp ts by medication overdoses involved 1,997 persons. Among these, 38 percent resulted from the use of tranquilizers and other psychotropic agents. Another 26 percent were due to the use of analgesics, antipyretics, and anti-rheumatics. 368 Struck by or against is the leading cause of assaul t injury hospitalizations, comprising 32 percent of all assault-related hospital discharges. Twenty percent of assault hospitalizations result from unarmed fights or brawls. Another 17 percent resul ted from assault involving a cutting and piercing instrument. For Indiana, the leading mechanisms for unintention al injury hospitalizations were motor vehicle traffic-related incidents (3,276), falls (9,501 and poisoning (965), injury problems that have been selected for incorporation into the State Plan. Res idential fire burns are also included in the State Plan because the Indiana death rate is higher than the national rate.

These injury problems are: FALLS MOTOR VEHICLE CRASHES RESIDENTIAL FIRES POISONING SUICIDE To impact the morbidity and mortality associated wi th falls, motor vehicle crashes, residential fire burns, poisonings, and suicide will require co llaboration by many agencies and organizations; continued education of the public, h ealth care providers, partner agencies and organizations; and consideration of environmental s afety measures that can be implemented. FALLS Falls are the third leading cause of unintentional injury deaths in Indiana, resulting in 768 deaths from 1999-2001; 75% of these deaths were among pers ons 65 years and older. Falls are a problem that largely impact children, being the mos t common cause of unintentional injury, and the elderly, where they are the leading cause of in jury death. Children are more susceptible to death when they fa ll from high elevations and when they sustain head injury from contact with hard objects such as concrete surfaces. The majority of falls among children happen in the home, affecting many children age 4 years and under, and children ages 5 to 14 years to a lesser extent. Ch ildren fall from windows, down stairs, off furniture, and from bicycles and outdoor play equip ment. Falls in older adults are a result of both personal and environmental factors. Personal factors include gait and balance, muscle weakness, limitati ons of daily living activities, visual problems, lack of physical activity, and the effects of presc ription drugs. Environmental factors include potential hazards in the home such as loose rugs, t he absence of railings on stairs or grab bars in the bathroom, and poor lighting. The most common fall-related injuries in the elderl y are fractures involving the hip, spine, or forearms, with hip fractures being the most serious in terms of disability and sometimes death.

Goal A. Reduce fall-related injuries and deaths in young children and older adults. Objective #1.

Promote community adoption of playground safety and equipment standards. Promote the use of safety equipment in the home as well as awareness of injury hazards. Safety Messages Focused on Young Children: Use safety gates (both at the top and bottom of sta irways) if young children are in the house. Do not place chairs and furniture near windows. Place window guards on all windows beginning at the second story of a residence. Do not use baby walkers. Constant supervision of young children is needed, e specially when they are climbing on furniture or playing in areas of the house or yard where fall s are possible. Infants should be secure (strapped) when on a chang ing table. 374 Playgrounds should have surfaces that can absorb th e shock of falls. This includes materials such as wood chips, shredded rubber and sand). Elderly: (To be added).

This is the leading cau se of injury death for persons 1 to 64 years. Males generally have a higher fatal ity rate related to motor vehicle traffic incidents than females. Failure to use safety rest raints, especially among children, and alcohol- impaired driving contribute significantly to motor vehicle injury and death. Among all Hoosiers fatally injured as a result of a motor vehicle inci dents, 58% were unrestrained. Among Hoosiers less than 16 years old and fatally injured, 45% wer e not properly restrained. According to the Indiana 2003 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 11% of tee ns rarely or never wore safety belts and 28% rode with a drinking driver in the past twelve months. Mandatory seat belt laws apply to all front seat oc cupants and all rear seat passengers under age 12 years. Indiana practices primary enforcement, w hich allows police officers to stop a vehicle for the sole purpose of not using a seat belt. Prop er use of lap and shoulder belts could prevent approximately 60% of motor vehicle-related deaths. Figure 11. Motor Vehicle Traffic Deaths by Sex and Age, Indiana 1999-2001 (Total Motor Vehicle Traffic Fatalities for Indiana =2,750) 375 Source: CDC, WISQARS Motorcycles as a Special Concern In 2001, more than 3 thousand deaths occurred natio nally among motorcyclists, accounting for 8 percent of all fatalities, 9 percent of motor vehic le occupant fatalities, and 2 percent of all occupants injured. Recent analysis shows that the n umber of motorcyclists killed on United States highways is on the rise, a trend that began in 1997. Since that time, fatalities have increased more than 50 percent. Although this incr ease in evident in all age groups, the largest percentage increases are among persons under the ag e of 40 years. iv Motorcyclists in Indiana were involved in XX crashe s, resulting in XX injuries and 332 fatalities from 1997-2001. Among the fatalities, there was a 56 percent increase, and 59 percent were motorcyclists under age 40 years. The use of helmets plays a major role in reducing m otorcycle-related fatalities and injuries. However, based on the National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS), there has been a significant increase of nonuse among motorcyclist. NOPUS is an observational survey of motorcycle helmet, safety belt, and child safety se at use implemented by the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA). Helmet use among operators fell from 71 percent in 2000 to approximately 58 percent in 2002. NHTSA estimates that helmets used in 2001 saved the lives of 674 motorcyclists, are 29 percent effe ctive in preventing fatal injuries, and are 67 percent effective in preventing brain injuries, whi ch is common injury sustained when involved in a motorcycle incident. Among all fatalities in Indiana during the five-year period (1999- 2001), only 18 percent were wearing a helmet. Goal B. Reduce the toll of motor vehicle crashes i n teen-age drivers.

It is the second leading cause of unintentional injury death among Hoosiers ages1 to 4 and 55 to 64 (based on 2001 data). From 1999-2001, 283 persons in Indiana sustained an unintentional fatal fire-related injury at an age-adjusted rate of 1.56 per 100,000 population. This figure is higher than the national fatality rate of 1.23 per 100,000 population. Since 1999, In diana fatality rates have been consistently higher than those of the United States. (Figure 21. ) Figure 21: Unintentional Fire-Burn Fatality Rates, United States 1999-2001. Source: CDC, WISQARS Figure 23: U.S. Fire-Related Fatality Rates by Regi on For Indiana, the number of fire-related deaths stra tified by age and sex are too small to make meaningful rate comparisons. However, fires remain a leading cause of unintentional injury 378 death among children 0 to 14 years nationally. The youngest children are at the greatest risk. Children age 5 years and younger are more than twic e as likely to die in a fire compared to all other age groups. More than half of those who die in this age group are asleep at the time of the fire, and another one-third are too young to react appropriately. Since 1999, there have been thirty-three unintentional fire fatalities (12 perc ent of all unintentional fire-related injury deaths ) among children 5 years and younger in Indiana. Rates are consistently higher for males than for fe males. From 1999-2001, males in Indiana accounted for 63 percent (2.34 males per 100,000 po pulation) of unintentional fire fatalities compared to 37 percent (1.24 females per 100,000 po pulation) of females. Residential Fires Residential fires are more common and cause more de aths than any other type, accounting for approximately 85 percent of all fires in the United States. v For 2001, the most recent mortality data available, 3,796 persons died in the United St ates from residential fire-related injuries, accounting for seventy-four percent (2,813) of fire -related deaths. In Indiana, considering both unintentional and inte ntional fire-related deaths from 1999-2001, 65 percent (209 out of 321) were residential, resultin g in an age-adjusted fatality rate of 1.15 per 100,000 population. This figure is slightly higher than the national age-adjusted rate of 1.03 per 100,000 population. In nearly 40 percent of residential fires in the Un ited States, alcohol is involved (source) and victims die primarily of smoke inhalation or toxic gases instead of burns. Residential fires peak during the winter months of December through Februa ry, a time when heating equipment such as fireplaces, space heaters and wood stoves are used most frequently in the home. (Prevention Strategies and websites to be added) POISONING Poisoning is defined as the ingestion of or contact with a substance that produces toxic effects and results in bodily harm. A substantial number o f poisoning deaths result from intentional behaviors, primarily suicide attempts. From 1999-2 001, nearly one-fourth of all poison-related deaths in the U.S. were intentional, compared to 36 % in Indiana. Children under 6 years represent more than 50% of p oison exposures, and account for 55% of the poisonings managed by the Indiana Poison Center during 2001 and 2002. Two-year-olds make up 20% of these exposures, followed by one-yea r-olds at 17%. The most common poison exposures for children are the ingestion of househo ld products such as cleaning substances, pain relievers and personal care products. 379 Figure 9: Poisoning Fatalities by Sex and Age, Indi ana 1999-2001.

Keep all household products and medicines in their original containers with original labels. Always read labels before using household products and medicine and follow directions exactly. Purchase and use household products and medications in child resistant containers whenever possible. Promote public awareness of services provided by po ison centers. Call the national poison toll- free hotline (800-222-1222) if someone has been in contact with a possibly poisonous product. Educate children and families in their communities about poison safety. Avoid involvement with illegal drugs such as metamp hetamine. Support the use of carbon monoxide detectors in all homes.

More than 264,000 Am ericans were treated in U.S. hospital emergency departments after attempting to take thei r own lives, and many suicides or suicide attempts go unreported. Each day two people in Indi ana, and eighty-four people in the United States, commit suicide. Suicide ranks 11th as a cau se of death, while homicide ranks 14th; it is not widely known that more people die from suicide than homicide. 381 Suicide rates are higher with increased age and are highest among Americans 65 years and older, especially affecting men. Suicide also disproportio nately affects our youth, ranking as the third leading cause of death in 10 to 24 year-olds. Males are four times more likely to commit suicide, whereas females attempt suicide more often by inges tion of poisons. There is a shift in the methods used to commit suicide in that hanging lead ing to suffocation has surpassed firearms in 10 to 14 year-olds, although suicide by firearms an d suffocation combined accounts for about 90% of suicide deaths in 10 to 19 year-olds. Risk factors associated with suicide include depres sion, alcoholism, a recent move, an upsetting end to a relationship, exposure to a non-suicide de ath or recent loss, and a history of previous suicide attempts. Adolescents may show signs and sy mptoms of depression, which are often overlooked by family members, school personnel and health care providers. Figure 10. Suicide Deaths by Sex and Age, Indiana 1 999-2001 (Total Suicide Fatalities=2,026) Source: CDC, WISQARS In 1999, the Surgeon General's Call to Action to Pr event Suicide outlined suicide prevention strategies grouped under the \"umbrella\" term AIM (A wareness, Intervention and Methodology). Awareness seeks to appropriately broaden the public 's awareness of suicide and its risk factors. Intervention refers to the enhancement of necessary services and programs. Methodology refers to advancing the science of suic ide prevention. Suicide has been identified as a major public health issue and the Surgeon Gene ral has called for a public health approach to address it. The Indiana Suicide Prevention Coalition has develo ped a comprehensive Suicide Prevention Plan for Indiana, which is available at: www.indianasuicidepreventioncoalition.org . This website provides links to other websites involved in suicide prevention. 382 Information on suicide prevention within Indiana sc hools is available through the publication \"Suicide: Students at Risk-A Suicide Prevention Res ource Guide for Schools\" developed by the Indiana State Dept of Health and the Indiana Depart ment of Education. There are a number of tools that can be used to ass ess depression and the potential for suicide. The availability of crisis intervention services, h otlines, and easy access to mental health providers can impact the problem of suicide in Indi ana. All communities should become aware of what can be accomplished to prevent suicide in t heir locale. Goal E. Through collaboration with the Indiana Sui cide Prevention Coalition (ISPC), reduce suicide deaths in Indiana. Objective # 6: By 2010, reduce the number of teen suicide deaths by XX%. Baseline: 743 deaths in 2002, rate of 12.1 HP 2010 goal: __________ #Action Step #6.A: Support the ISPC state plan to p revent suicide. Action Step #6.B: Support community training for r ecognition of at-risk behavior and intervention for persons with such behavior. Action Step #6.C: Promote screening for depression and risk of suicide in a variety of health care settings. Suicide Prevention Strategies Work with community or regional suicide prevention coalitions to address the issues relating to youth suicide. Educate all young people, family members and school personnel about suicide risk and how to respond. Know the warning signs of suicide. Talk to teens about depression and suicide. Encour age teens to let an adult know when their friends may be depressed or suicidal. Remove firearms from the household. Ensure access to clinical services for evaluation a nd management of teen depression and suicide ideation. 383 Use a variety of media outlets to promote suicide p revention messages. Support initiatives that prevent bullying. Train gatekeepers in screening teens for depression and suicide. Publicize crisis intervention services and suicide hotline availability.
