[Science & Tech](/Science-Tech) - Related Topics: - [medicine](/science/medicine) Unani medicine, also called Unani tibb, Arabian medicine, or Islamic medicine, a traditional system of healing and health maintenance observed in [South Asia](https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Asia). The origins of Unani medicine are found in the [doctrines](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/doctrines) of the ancient Greek physicians [Hippocrates](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hippocrates) and [Galen](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Galen). As a field, it was later developed and refined through systematic experiment by the Arabs, most prominently by Muslim scholar-physician [Avicenna](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Avicenna). During the [Caliphate](https://www.britannica.com/place/Caliphate) (the political-religious Muslim state that began in 632 ce), the bulk of Greek knowledge was translated into Arabic, part of that knowledge being the principles of [medicine](https://www.britannica.com/science/medicine). With additional contributions of medical wisdom from other parts of the [Middle East](https://www.britannica.com/place/Middle-East) and South Asia, Unani medicine came to be known also as Arabian, or Islamic, medicine. Principles of Unani medicine The history of Unani medicine can be characterized by the work of its practitioners, or hakims, who relied on natural healing based on principles of harmony and balance, uniting the physical, mental, and spiritual realms. Al-Umoor al-tabiyah: basic physiological principles According to [practitioners](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/practitioners) of Unani medicine, the health of the [human body](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-body) is maintained by the harmonious arrangement of al-umoor al-tabiyah, the seven basic physiological principles of the Unani doctrine. These principles include (1) arkan, or elements, (2) mizaj, or temperament, (3) akhlat, or bodily humours, (4) aaza, or organs and systems, (5) arwah, or vital spirit, (6) quwa, or faculties or powers, and (7) afaal, or functions. Interacting with each other, these seven natural components maintain the balance in the natural constitution of the human body. Each individual's constitution has a self-regulating capacity or power, called tabiyat (or mudabbira-e-badan; vis medicatrix naturae in Latin), or to keep the seven components in [equilibrium](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/equilibrium). Arkan and mizaj: [elements](https://www.britannica.com/topic/element-philosophy) and temperament As four simple, entities\u2014arz (earth), maa (water), nar (fire), and hawa (air)\u2014arkan not only [constitutes](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitutes) the primary components of the human body but also makes up all other creations in the universe. There are predictable consequences to the actions and interactions (imtizaj) of the four arkan. As these elements act upon and react with each other, they continually undergo change into various states of \"genesis and lysis\" (generation and deterioration), due to ulfat-e-keemiyah (acceptance of a medicine by the body) and nafarat-e-keemiyah (rejection of a medicine). Skilled hakims claim that they can perceive, recognize, and observe such states. The four essential mizaj (temperaments) are hot, cold, moist, and dry. Four more are [compounded](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compounded) of those single temperaments\u2014namely, hot and dry, hot and moist, cold and dry, and cold and moist. Possessed in different proportion, mizaj is balanced by all entities in the cosmos, including all plants, minerals, and animals. The equilibrium of the individual's elemental combination and resulting mizaj, as determined by tabiyat, provides a stable constitution to that individual\u2014in other words, health. Just as elemental balance keeps an individual in a healthy state, changes in natural temperament cause the health of an individual to suffer. Therefore, mizaj plays a pivotal role in Unani in characterizing a person's normal state (physical, mental, and social), as well as the nature of a disease. Doctrine of akhlat Hippocrates propounded the doctrine of fluids, or [humours](https://www.britannica.com/science/humor-ancient-physiology), of the body, and he categorized the humours into four groups based on their colour. These groups were refined by Galen and later by Avicenna. They appear in Unani practice as dam (blood), balgham (phlegm), safra (yellow bile), and sauda (black bile). The human [dispositions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dispositions) corresponding humours are, respectively, [sanguine](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sanguine), phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic. Each person is considered to have a specific humoral makeup, determined by the predominance of a given [humour](https://www.britannica.com/science/humor-ancient-physiology) in his or her constitution. The quality and quantity of the humours in an individual\u2014a person's unique, proper, and proportionate humoral makeup\u2014is said to guarantee health. Conditions other than this balance signal ailment or disease. The theory of humours (nazaria-e-akhlat), which is the essence of the practice of Unani medicine, holds that the four humours are [derived](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/derived) from and utilized in the [digestive process](https://www.britannica.com/science/digestion-biology). Their continuous action and reaction results in the breakdown of complex macromolecules into simpler molecules, which are then incorporated throughout the body in the form of fluid. These humours, the akhlat, suffuse the body's cells, interstitial spaces, and vascular channels, affecting physical and behavioral well-being, and are most stable in a healthy individual. Relationship between tabiyat and asbab-e-sittah-zarooriah In the Unani system of medicine, tabiyat is an individual's internal power or capacity to withstand or combat disease and to perform normal physiological functions. Believing that it is only tabiyat that is engaged in actually curing a disease, Unani hakims hold that they only assist from \"outside\" by prescribing therapeutic relief. If not adversely affected, tabiyat can [eradicate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eradicate) most infections without medical [treatment](https://www.britannica.com/science/therapeutics), using what may be thought of as the natural defense system of the mind and body. Unani medicine recognizes six physical, or external, factors, called asbab-e-sittah-zarooriah, which are essential in establishing a synchronized [biological rhythm](https://www.britannica.com/science/biological-rhythm) and thus living a balanced existence. The six asbab-e-sittah-zarooriah are: Hawa (air), in which the quality of the air a person breathes is thought to have a direct effect on his or her temperament and, thus, health. Makool-wo-mashroob (food and drink), in which the nutritional value and the quality and quantity of one's food and drink are believed to ensure physical fitness by strengthening tabiyat. Harkat-wo-sakoon-e-jismiah (bodily exercise and repose), which emphasizes the positive effects of balanced physical exercise on an individual's internal resistance and tabiyat. Harkat-o-sakoon nafsaniah (mental work and rest), which emphasizes the simultaneous engagement of the human mind in numerous emotional and [intellectual](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectual)activities. Just as the body needs systematic and planned exercise and rest, Unani medicine holds that the human mind and brain need adequate stimulation and proper relaxation as well. Naum-o-yaqzah ( [sleep](https://www.britannica.com/science/sleep)and wakefulness), in which an individual's health and alertness are understood as being dependent on a specific amount of sound sleep in the course of a 24-hour (circadian) cycle. Ihtebas and istifragh (retention and excretion), which considers the [metabolism](https://www.britannica.com/science/metabolism)of food and liquid as both affecting and being regulated by tabiyat. According to Unani medicine, the assimilation of food and liquid [facilitates](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facilitates)the elimination from the body of excessive and noxious substances. Therefore, to maintain a harmonic and synchronized tabiyat, certain [beneficial](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/beneficial)end-products of kaun-o-fasad (genesis and lysis) are retained in the body while harmful ones are expelled. These six factors are believed by Unani practitioners to directly affect the harmony of the human mind and body. Socioeconomic, geographic, and environmental factors are considered secondary factors (asbab-e-ghair-zarooriah) in the Unani system and therefore indirectly influence tabiyat. However, both the primary and the secondary factors must be closely considered in the Unani process of treatment. "}
