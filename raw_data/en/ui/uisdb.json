Acupuncture Benefits Acupuncture isn't a new-age woo-woo trend. Far from it. Acupuncture has been used for millennia to align the body, mind, and spirit so people can heal. Both the World Health Organization and the National Institutes of Health recognize acupuncture as a helpful treatment option for many conditions like anxiety, chronic pain, immune support, reproductive issues, infertility, women's health conditions, fibromyalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and migraines. Acupuncture and Chinese medicine can also be used as part of a wellness or maintenance regimen after an initial treatment program. Does acupuncture work? [Our founder](/about-us/)has seen it to believe it\u2014within her own body and hundreds of others. If you have questions, please [reach out to set up a consultation](/contact/)or read the following FAQs. Does acupuncture hurt? How does acupuncture work? Acupuncture aligns your body's yin and yang by manipulating your energy, or qi (pronounced chee). We use acupuncture points to unblock your flow of energy so your entire body operates in harmony. Medically speaking, what does acupuncture do? Is acupuncture safe? ElectroAcupuncture We make the most of acupuncture therapy by utilizing every tool available. ElectroAcupuncture is one of them. During these sessions, we send gentle electric currents between acupuncture needles. We find this treatment to be particularly impactful for people with chronic pain like osteoarthritis, knee pain, sciatica, and peripheral neuropathy. We also love using ElectroAcupuncture in our fertility treatments, and again near the end of a pregnancy, to prepare both baby and mama for labor and delivery. Dry Needling You have probably experienced a tight knot in a muscle. This may have been a trigger point. These can be painful to the touch and cause pain in other parts of your body, otherwise known as referral pain. Dry needling is a technique used to treat trigger point and myofascial pain. This procedure involves pushing thin, solid acupuncture needles into the trigger points to stimulate the tissue and encourage the musculature to release. Doing so can help increase range of motion from muscle tightness or scar tissue. It's particularly useful for acute or chronic pain, and the following conditions respond really well to this treatment. Back & Neck Pain Degenerated Discs, Stenosis, SI Joint Pain, Sciatica, Shoulder Pain, Tennis Elbow, Migraines, and Tension Headaches Hip & Gluteal Pain Knee Pain, Achilles Tendonitis/Tendonosis, Repetitive Motion Disorders (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, De Quervain's Tenosynovitis), Plantar Fasciitis, Muscular Strains, and Ligament Sprains Chronic Body Pain Temporomandibular Joint Disorders (Jaw Pain), Osteoarthritis, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Fibromyalgia Moxibustion We regularly use Moxibustion as a part of our Chinese medicine strategy to nourish and invigorate the system. Moxa, for short, involves burning the herb mugwort close to an acupuncture point. We use moxa in our fertility treatments and to encourage a breech baby to turn. It's also great for fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, menstrual disorders, and for digestion issues and some painful conditions. Don't worry, moxa doesn't hurt! In fact, our patients find it soothing yet energizing and very effective. Gua sha Gua sha is a traditional Chinese healing method used to treat stubborn, chronic pain. We start by applying CBD or fractionated coconut oil to the affected area, then we gently scrape the skin with a smooth-edged tool until redness appears. This process raises small, red dots called petechiae to improve circulation and flush the fascia of toxins. Fun fact: the term \"Gua\" refers to the scraping technique, while \"Sha\" refers to the red marks left on the skin. Don't worry. The redness lasts for only a day or two, and the relief is well worth the minor inconvenience! Testimonials \"Angie & Cierra are the best part of my week. My husband and I were looking to start our family for about 6 months but having some trouble. I wasn't ready for IVF or medication, and thought about trying a more holistic approach. After seeing Angie for 3 months, incorporating Chinese herbs, and her other recommendations around diet, we are expecting our first baby. C. M. \"I have been working with Angie and Ciera for some time now and find them to be friendly, compassionate and knowledgeable. The office is always neat and clean. I highly recommend them.\" C. K. \"Quiet, tranquil and welcoming is the best way I can describe the atmosphere while you are here. Treatment is great and the staff is wonderful! I highly recommend them!\" D. P. \"I can't speak anymore highly of Charm City Healing and Angie. I was having serious back issues for over six months that I thought would require surgery. Somehow, she fixed me in two sessions. Haven't had back pain in over 5 years. I still go once per quarter for maintenance and always feel great when I leave. I don't know if it's the acupuncture, Angie acting as my quasi therapist, or a combination of the two, but it works. A++\" T. K. J. B. Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine Herbs are the OG medicine\u2014artfully combined into powerful formulas that heal the body from the inside out. We use herbal medicine in tandem with your acupuncture treatments to prolong the positive effects. Taking your herbal formula is like giving yourself a treatment daily. We regularly use herbs for infertility, hormonal imbalances, pain relief, insomnia, anxiety, autoimmune disorders, digestive issues, and more. We Treat Your Symptoms We design Chinese herbal formulas to target specific symptoms that manifest from underlying imbalances in your body. This powerful medicine is the real deal, especially when artfully combined with acupuncture. We typically see symptoms begin to shift anywhere from one week to one month of treatment with acupuncture and herbs. We Treat the Roots Once your symptoms are under control, we modify your acupuncture and herbal medicine prescription to target the underlying roots of your problem. Treating the root causes of your condition takes time. You may need acupuncture and herbal supplements for several months for lasting results.
