My son had his 2nd pfizer 2 weeks ago, and ever since hes been having puffy eyes dizzy spells, blurred vision, tunnel vision, seeing all sorts of lights and headaches. We have been to emergency 3 times, and seen an optometrist and opthamologist and all of them say nothing is wrong and to monitor it.. its extremley frustrating how every single one of them are saying its not related to the vaccine.. im feeling so hopeless but still looking for answers or ways for him to cope! Hi everybody, someone has got an extreme fatigue after the vaccine ? And muscular pain ? It's horrible and I can't work since 5 months... My daughter, 13 years old, is suffering from dizziness for 3 weeks more after taken the 2nd dose Pfizer Biontech on September 1. The blood test and MRI brain reports are clear, consulted 5 doctors and taken different kinds of drugs, such as merizlon and Permazil, without any improvement. The specialist said it is Vestibular neuronitis and suggested to drink water do some eye and movement exercises. She cannot go to school at this moment and hopefully she can recover soon. [@sajlent](https://vestibular.org/participant/sajlent/) thanks. i just got them. i'll come back to tell how it went. probably needs a few days at least? 2 months after my Pfizer, i feel light nights sweats, sometimes hot flashes during the day, neck pain ... this symptoms apeared one month after second dose on 23-01-2021. maybe someone feels the same way? Thanks for sharing. I had my Pfizer first dose on 30-07-2021 and I noticed intense night sweats on my neck, back and chest every night around one month after the first dose. This started in the end of August and it's still ongoing. In the last 7 days, I noticed I'm not waking up soaking wet in the middle of the night so frequently, but I wouldn't say it's ended. I had my second dose on 25-09-2021 and in the last 5 days I've been feeling really sleepy in the mornings. It's been really hard to wake up at 7 am and staying awake. How long did anyone's relapse last? I'm one week and a half into my relapse [@benpeck](https://vestibular.org/participant/benpeck/) yes.. try just for couple of days. And try to find some anti inflammatory supplement like one I talk about.. [@pfizervictim](https://vestibular.org/participant/pfizervictim/) thanks for getting back to me. I'm so glad that your dizziness is slowly improving! I have faith that time will ease a lot of these symptoms. It is just a matter of how much time!!?? So did you get the dry eyes? Also did you notice up and down cycles of symptoms like a lot of people seem to get? I notice I might have a good day or two and then I get blasted with something acting up?! I especially will feel my symptoms increase in the evening. Probably from a long day of navigating!!! I hope you feel you are getting close to recovery? That would be good news to hear!!! [PfizerVictim](https://vestibular.org/participant/pfizervictim/)and [PfizerVictim](https://vestibular.org/participant/pfizervictim/)reacted [@deedee](https://vestibular.org/participant/deedee/) yes I also get dry eyes, worst during the morning and at night when I wake up. I went to see my doctor about it some months ago but she said they looked fine. My symptoms also cycle between bad days and better days, sometimes even change within the hour. I would say I'm doing better than 2 months ago, but I still can't do much without getting a flare up. I'm still hoping and praying this will end, but starting to lose hope after so long, sorry don't mean to sound negative but you probably know what I mean. Luckily I have my wife and the positive stories here, so hopefully not all is lost and we just have to wait reaaaally long. Personal story/advice and feedback needed. I wanted to share my personal story in hopes that others can share their experiences with me and provide any advice or feedback. May 28th k received my Pfizer jab. I had chest tightness for several weeks but tests showed no issues or inflammation. I decided to get my 2nd jab on June 28. Four weeks post jab the week of July 27th I developed panic attacks, vertigo/dizziness, a tight calf muscle, pins and needles and muscle twitches in my legs that were painless. Two weeks later the twitches spread to my arms and in the month of august I developed migraines, a feeling of doom and gloom, a feeling of electricity in my body, weird bruising, tinitus, a sense of gravity pushing me from behind in my back, facial numbness, tremors, internal vibrations right side of body, twitches, numbness and hot/cold feelings through my torso and an elevated heart rate. Most of these initial symptoms went away and what remained was the heart rate spikes and internal vibrations. This month I developed a whole new set of symptoms which include some brain fog, lighter headaches, brain zaps, dehydration (now gone) dry mouth (now gone) chest tightness (gone) eye twitches, muscle weakness (gone) dry eyes. The most confusing symptoms are a feeling of a lump in my throat, difficulty breathing at night, tight diaphragm, pressure at the top of my head feels like a rush of fluid is running through it and this tingling through my torso and face which feels like the spike proteins or whatever this is is trying to settle. It feels like something is crawling under my skin and sometimes my body pulses very strongly when these spikes or whatever they are is moving around. I also have pain periodically through my body like my back and neck. I suspect having two doses may be why I've been hit so hard. My doctor thinks it's a bad reaction to the jab and says give it time. Bloodwork and all results are normal and inflammatory markers are great no concerns. Any advice or stories from those with 2 jabs who may be on the mend? [@opheas](https://vestibular.org/participant/opheas/) thank you for replying! I'm awaiting a Neuro. Appt. Regarding the blindness and retinal migraines, I'll mention that medication to him as well. In the mean time my GP prescribed high dose alprazolam (I believe she's written me off as crazy) for anxiety, which I was trying to avoid as I don't like benzodiazepines. I was also doing some reading on beta blockers and they seem to be the go-to for the retinal migraines, so good call. I'm in a similar boat. I'm only suspicious that a SE to the vaccine may be a causative factor in my case, as reading through this, my story seems a bit different. I had no SEs the first month or two after receiving the second Pfizer vaccine, but the second month I had a serious case of dizziness, and then intermittently, a feeling of lightheadedness and almost lethargy in the legs. I have always had headaches here and there, but they seemed more clustered to the base of my skull. Fast forward a few months, and now I've been dealing with feelings of sluggishness, dizziness/lightheadedness, and occasional nausea (with accompanying anxiety from this whole thing!) for the past 6-8 weeks. In my case, things are getting worse, whereas for most others, things have improved. Looking around here for other ideas, and experiences. I am seeing a IM doctor who checked blood a while back and is re-running next week. Blood pressure is okay (does not dip too low or spike very high) during episodes or any other time. I even have a portable EKG which I recommend for people too. No arrhythmia there. My sodium levels tend to be a touch low, but that's been the case for years, as I was diagnosed with hypertension and probably am too fastidious about avoiding salt. That said, eating more salt doesn't seem to change anything for me. I have a cardiologist appointment next week, but wonder if a neurologist is more in order or at least the next step. Very frustrating, and sorry to ramble on, but great to hear that so many people have found some areas for improvement. I'm also trying a Migranex OTC supplement, in case it's related to headaches. I have had my vision checked and am seeing a chiropractor for neck pain, but no relief from the waves of light-headedness that might strike one day, then nothing, one more, then another afternoon, etc. etc. So random!! I have never had something such as this in my life, and have greatly curtailed my physical activity for fear of falling. [SirGrotius](https://vestibular.org/participant/sirgrotius/) [@twitch](https://vestibular.org/participant/twitch/) hey.. so I have full body muscle twitching. Dizziness/vertigo. Fatigue. Stomach/acid reflux issues. Pain in temple area. Still ongoing now but has eased. Some days are good but then it gets bad again. What I find odd is how we are all suffering yet we have all had a mixture of the jabs. So it can't be that it's an MRNA jab or that it's not.. it's either there's an ingredient the same in all jabs that the issue.. Or... The issue is actually us! And that QNY vaccine of this dosage would have caused us issues.. I really can't work it out. So many people think I'm talking crazy as they have had it and are fine. I'm so jealous of them tbh. Just as I think I'm improving I go downhill again. My bloods said my IGA levels are high. Which is chronic inflammation. When I Google it is says could be autoimmune disease or cancer! Google is the enemy and I'm not sure I'm even googling the correct thing but I'm getting anxious again. 2 days ago I was fine mentally. Its exhausting. I spoke to my counsellor today and said I almost feel like I'm in mourning for the person I used to be. I will never not regret this jab. has anyone got back to their old self? In need of good news stories!
