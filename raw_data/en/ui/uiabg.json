It is caused by bacterial infection and can manifest in either gingivitis or periodontitis. Gingivitis is the swelling or inflammation of the gingivae, while [periodontitis](https://www.edgedentalhouston.com/preventive-dentistry/periodontal-health/) is the infection or inflammation of the bones and connective tissues or ligaments. Gum disease normally starts as gingivitis but degenerates into periodontitis without immediate gum disease treatment. The problem spreads from the gums into the support structures of your teeth. It weakens, loosens, and eventually causes the teeth to fall out. Gum disease is preventable and reversible in the early stage (gingivitis) but the advanced stage (periodontitis) requires more serious treatments with impending damage done to the mouth. Signs and Symptoms of Gum Disease The signs and symptoms of periodontal disease include: - Serious pain when eating, chewing or brushing - Bad breath - Pus in the gums or in-between the teeth - Loose teeth or teeth that fall out - Teeth sensitivity - Changes in how partial [dentures](https://www.edgedentalhouston.com/how-many-implants-do-you-need-for-dentures/)fit - New gaps in-between the teeth - Changes in the way the teeth fit together when biting - Painful or tender gums - Swollen, puffy or receding gums - Teeth that appear long - Bleeding in the gums when eating or brushing - Redness, purplish or shiny gums Stages of Gum Disease There are 4 main stages of gum disease, which range from pre-diagnosis to advanced periodontal disease. These stages include: Gingivitis: Swelling or inflammation of the gum. This is the very early stage of the infection and hasn't gotten to the bones or ligament. Tender gums that bleed easily is the common [symptoms of gingivitis](https://laserdentistrynearme.com/gum-disease/). Early Periodontitis: The escalated form without immediate gum disease treatment for gingivitis. This early-stage [periodontitis](https://www.edgedentalhouston.com/preventive-dentistry/periodontal-health/) causes receding gums, creating little pockets that fill with bacteria. This stage comes with pain and bleeding in the gum as well as some bone loss in some cases. Moderate Periodontitis: The next phase when early-stage periodontitis is left untreated. Moderate periodontitis results in painful, bleeding, and receding gums, as well as, loosening of the teeth. Advanced Periodontitis: The severest form of periodontal disease. It breaks down the gums, bones, ligaments, and all the support structures of the teeth. Advanced periodontitis causes a bad taste in your mouth, severe pain when eating or chewing, bad breath, and tooth loss. Conventional treatment for gum disease includes proper mouth and teeth cleaning as long as the gingivitis has not worsened into periodontitis. Gingivitis can be easily reversed without medication by regular dental visits (at least twice a year) for dental cleanings and at-home brushing, flossing, and mouth rinses. Early-stage periodontitis requires deep cleaning and scaling while advanced periodontitis requires scaling, root planning, and maybe a corrective surgery.

Early-stage gum disease may be treated by natural options, which include: Observing A Proper Oral Hygiene Routine Whether you're making regular visits to your [emergency dentist near me](https://www.edgedentalhouston.com/emergency-dentistry/) for professional dental cleaning or not, it's very important to observe good and proper oral hygiene practices and keep your mouth clean as much as possible.
