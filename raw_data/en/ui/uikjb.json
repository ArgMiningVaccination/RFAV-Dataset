Two approaches of interventions can be distinguished: Focusing on the person by changing appraisal, reaction, coping, or health behavior (optimizing stress appraisals and reactions) , and focusing on work -conditions by changing work tasks, conditions or social relationships at work (optimizing exposure to adverse conditions and resources) (Semmer, 2006; Semmer & Zapf, 2004) . While there it is not clear if these ef fects are similar in small and large organizations. Method: The review included 77 studies , published between January 2012 and July 2015 that reported effects of person- and work -oriented interventions . Effect sizes derived of post intervention- and follo w up -assessments were analyzed. The studies used Randomized Controlled Trials as well as quasi -experimental designs. By grouping effect sizes within similar outcomes and intervention categories , the effectiveness of different types of interventions in smal l and large organizations were compared. Results: Mindfulness and relaxation interventions as well as skills at work -interventions were the most common interventions and both showed effectiveness regarding a variety of employee outcomes . Also, mindfulness and relaxation, skills at work -, and work -oriented interventions showed good effects at post -intervention follow up measurements, therewith showing some durability. Skills at work - interventions , Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and work -oriented interventions seemed to be more effective in small - and medium -sized organizations than in large organizations . Based on current state of research, no conclusive results were found for health- related and informational interventions. Conclusion: As previous research showed, person- oriented interventions showed consistent positive effects. The size of organizations matters with respect to work interventions. Lastly, the differentiating results also showed that with careful implementation, work -oriented intervention may have large effects. 7 1 Introduction Reducing stress at work can be a promising approach to foster health and well -being. To reduce stress and enhance health and well -being we can distinguish between two approaches of interventions (Semmer, 2006; Semmer & Zapf, 2004): 1. Focusing on the person by changing appraisal, reaction, coping, or health behavior (optimizing stress appraisals and reactions). 2. Focusing on work -conditions by changing work tasks, conditions or social relationships at work (optimizing exposure to adverse conditions and resources) . While there is evidence for both approaches Montano, Hoven, & Siegrist, 2014) it is not clear if these effects are similar in small and large organizations. It seems that there is a cautiously positive conclusion (Semmer, 2006) for work -related interventions having potential for positive effects, but still there are some null-findings and some negative findings in the field. A recent review on organizational -level interventions concluded that it might be beneficial to target more than one organi zational -level modification at the time (Montano, Hoven, & Siegrist, 201 4). Research on person- versus work -oriented interventions revealed that person- related interventions seemed to show more positive evidence (e.g., van der Klink, Blonk, Schene, & van Dijk, 2001; Bamberg & Busch, 1996). To date, many prevention approaches are directed to a person' s resources, stress management , and health behavior (Murphy & Sauter, 2004; Semmer, 2003). In sum, there is more evidence for person- oriented approaches but work -oriented interventions seem more complex (target complex social systems, different preferences and interests of people, trade- offs, side-effects, etc.) and both approaches revealed effects on well -being and health. Another possible criterion on the effectiveness of interventions could be the organization size. Small- and medium -sized organizations are organizations with 1) less than 250 employees and 2) an annual sale to maximum 50 Million Euro or annual balance sheet with maximum 43 Million Euro (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Statistik, 2015). Corresponding to this large- sized organizations hire more than 250 employees and do have more annual sale or balance. There are several reasons why organization size may affect effectiveness of interventions: high participation and awareness may be less difficult to obtain in small- sized organizations and interventions can be designed for specific needs of a small group of employees. We expect fewer studies on small -sized organizations than large- sized organizations because small - sized organizations may not have the presumed financial resources or the urgent need for an intervention (i.e. survival of the company is more important). Also small -size organizations pose several important difficulties for research, among them power problems and difficulties to gather a control group . Referring to a research assignment by the Staatssekretariat f\u00fcr Wirtschaft (SECO) we conducted a systematic review including person- and work -oriented interventions at the workplace to image the 8 current state of research. Furthermore we took the organization size into account in order to investigate possible differences between small - and medium -sized organizations and large- sized organi zations. Because there already is a lot of evidence in forms of reviews we updated the review conducted by Montano and colleagues (2014) with the exception of the organization size, which we added to their coding scheme. Besides replicating the Montano review (which only included work - oriented interventions) , we also extended it by including person- directed interventions. 9 2 Methods Since we aimed at updating the systematic review by Montano and colleagues (2014 ) who reported results of 39 intervention studies published between 1993 and 2012 we adopted their approach with minor modifications concerning coding categories and search strategy. 2.1 Search S trategy We adapted the search strategy by Montano and colleagues (2014) using their search strings with only minor modifications. First we added some terms concerning lack of mental health (illness, fear, anxiety) and psychosomatic consequences (somatoform, psychosomatic, sleep, headache, dizziness, pain). Also we included more synonyms for organization (firm, company, enterprise, busines s). The intervention part we expanded for wellness, mindfulness, prevention, hardening and resistance in order to achieve more interventions. Further we added some NOT -terms in order to prevent irrelevant search results (e.g., surgery, poisoning) . The foll owing databases were searched for suitable studies: Business Source Premier (EBSCO), the Cochrane Library, Econlit (EBSCO), PubMed Central, PsycInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science. Search criteria have been (1) publication date between January 2012 and July 2015 in peer -reviewed journals, (2) written in English or German, and (3) reporting on effects of psychosocial i nterventions on health outcomes . The interventions had to be supported by the company in ways of initiation through company, implementation durin g working hours, or compensation of participants' potential expenses. Neither conference papers nor anthologies, dissertations, unpublished papers or book chapters were included in t he review. The complete search queries are reported in Appendix 1. Additio nally, references from existing systematic reviews and meta- analyses on this topic were scanned and researchers in the field were approached to include any supplementary articles not found by the search. Two researchers independently screened each article regarding title and abstract. The initial search led to 5425 articles. Another 38 studies were added through reference lists and consulted researchers in the field. After screening of title and abstracts, only 216 studies fitted with the search criteria outlined above. An additional and more detailed screening was carried out looking for suitable information in terms of effect sizes or information from which we could derive effect sizes. Furthermore we checked each eligible study for study design, because we only included control -group designs with passive control -group, care- as-usual, waitlist -control -group or quasi -experimental designs. Studies were excluded, if participants had diagnoses of ill physical or mental health (related to DSM or ICD). Also two studies were excluded because they used the same sample repeatedly examining identical outcomes. The procedure of inclusion and exclusion of studies is imaged in Table 1. 10 Table 1 Flow of Search History 2.2 Coding After the screening described above, a total of 77 studies met inclusion criteria and provided adequate statistical information on effect sizes. These articles were independently coded by two researchers using similar methods as used by Montano and colleagues (2014 ), including: number of participants, time lag to follow -up, occupation, country, study design (whether it is randomized controlled trial or quasi -experimental), level of evidence (three categories: low, medium, high; based on quality and study design), exi stence of intervention effect, and whether the targeted working conditions or the health outcomes have changed. Further, we coded calculation of effect sizes (within groups between pre and post intervention, or between groups post intervention and/or at follow up), intervention type, and size of organization. A post intervention- assessment means that participants were questioned 11 right after the intervention was completed. A follow up -assessment contains a time- lagged assessment and so includes longer -termed effects. Studies which applied follow up measurements ( 56%) usually measured 0.5 to 30 months after the intervention (mean time lag of 7.2 months ). Due to the lack of small - and medium -sized organizations fulfilling all criteria of the definition ( Bundesamt f\u00fcr Statistik, 2015) we decided to focus on the size criterion, taking less than 250 employees as a criterion for small - and medium -sized organizations. The majority of studied samples consisted of teachers and supportive staff. Studies not conta ining any information about the company size were separated. Authors of these studies were contacted in order to obtain the missing data. If we received no answer , we estimated the organization size comparing to those information we had with other studies. Organization size was coded as follows: 0 = more than 249 employees, 1= less than 2 50 employees, 2=estimated less than 250 employees. For detailed information on all studies consult the tables in Appendix 2. Cohen`s Kappa was calculated in order to show agreement between the raters (=0.89). Again, after the independent coding disagreements between researches were resolved by reachi ng consensus after discussion. 2.3 Grouping of Interventions Considering the diversity of the interventions implemented at the workplace and around, we divided our studies in 2 broad categories: person- oriented and work -oriented. For the work -oriented interventions we used the same classification as used by Montano and colleagues (201 4): 1. Material conditions. All sorts of physical and chemical agents implied in the execution of work tasks are included (e.g. vibrations, noise, chemical substances, ergonomics). 2. Work time -related conditions. These conditions relate to the amount of working tim e and intensity of work, the latter being measured as number of activities per time unit (e.g. work speed, shifts, deadlines, pace of work, breaks). 3. Work organization conditions. These include a variety of psychological and social factors (job demands, job control, efforts and rewards, responsibility, etc.), and processes and procedures required to accomplish work tasks (e.g. methods of work, order of tasks, team organization, structure of hierarchy, security guidelines training). Due to the small number of intervention studies focusing on work conditions we merged them into one table. For the person- oriented interventions we created a classification based on the respective intervention approach. The following categories were identified: 1. Mindfulness and rel axation interventions. This contains all interventions including Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), learning of relaxation techniques, Yoga, Quigong, and others which focused on reducing stress -related outcomes in the context of work. 12 2. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) . All programs based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy were included. 3. Informational interventions. This category included all interventions focusing on the transfer of knowledge. Besides psychoeducational approaches interventions using feedback were obtained. 4. Skills at work -interventions. All studies focusing on change of personal skills at the workplace were involved. This group includes coping skills as well as communication trainings. 5. Health- related behavior -interventions. Physical and dietary approaches focusing mainly on enhancing health and decreasing health- related problems were included. 6. Others. This category especially encases all the mixed study designs, which include more than one intervention target. Commonly they combined per son-oriented and work -oriented approaches. Furthermore we added such designs that didn't belong to any other category. 2.4 Analysis In order to evaluate which intervention types are more effective for which outcome and for which organization size, we transformed statistical information into effect sizes, grouping them into tables depending on intervention category and outcome. Consequently, we constructed four different kinds of tables. The first group contains studies investigating small -to-medium sized organizations subdivided for intervention category and outcome. The second group included studies concerning large- sized organizations subdivided for the same patterns. The third group included studies investigating estimated small -and-medium sized organizations or separated departments of organizations meeting the size criterion. The fourth group consisted of all studies summarized and s ubdivided for the same patterns. 13 3 Results We reviewed 77 intervention studies which consisted of person- oriented (n=67) and work -oriented (n=10) interventions. An overall amount of 22680 participants w ere included in the review. In Table 2 the main characteristics of the studies are reported.

Effects of different interventions at work were analyzed separat ely for different organization sizes. We grouped our analyses in four parts. First we explored the effect of different interventions on health- and work -related outcomes in small - and medium -sized organizations (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Statistik, 2015) . Second, we examined the same relations in large organizations with more than 249 employees. In a third analysis we included all studies referring to samples of indistinct and so estimated size. In a fourth analysis we included all of the above studies irrespective of size. Referring to our coding strategy , we divided each table in two kinds of columns: a white column presenting the post intervention- effect size, and a grey column presenting the effect size assessed at follow up. In order to summarize the results and provide an overview of the evidence extractable from the intervention studies we formed groups integrating similar health- and work -related outcomes. We built these groups following the World Health Organizations definition (1992) of health as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well -being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Because we were not able to merge our outcome variables in three categories we figured out additional groups by br ainstorming. These groups are: 1. General health. This group included only general measures of health, which combined both mental or psychological and physical components (e.g., General Healt h Questionnaire by Banks et al. 1980; Goldberg 1980) . 2. Perceived stress. As an integrating concept perceived stress, similar to general health, includes both physical and mental consequences (e.g., Perceived Stress Questionnaire by Levenstein et al., 1993). 15 3. Physical outcomes. Psychosomatic symptoms as well as change in hormones like cortisol are involved. Furthermore we included cardiovascular outcomes and musculoskeletal functioning. 4. Mental and cognitive outcomes. Mindfulness and resilience as much as worrying, irritability and detachment fit into that category. Further we included self -efficacy and goal setting as possible outcomes. 5. Emotional and motivational outcomes. All affective diseases like anxiety and depression were integrated. Further motivati onal processes like satisfaction, quality of life and rewards are included. 6. Burnout. Concerning all facets of Burnout measured predominantly with the Maslach Burnout Inventory MBI ( Maslach, Jackson, & Leiter, 1996) and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory OLBI (Demerouti, Bakker, Vardakou, & Kantas, 2003). 7. Interpersonal outcomes. Regarding to all interactional processes like social support, fairness perceptions, perceived leadership and teamwork. 8. Work -related behavior. All behavioral outcomes as performance, sic kness absence and intention to retire. 9. Work conditions. This category reflects the possibilities that employees have to affect their job like influence, decision latitude, and participatory management as well as environmental variables. A completed list of variables included in the categories mentioned before is attached in Appendix 3. Since we replicated the review by Montano and colleagues (2014) we adapted their search strategy. Thereby it should be mentioned that pain and pain- related interventions wer e not included as a main focused topic. We only included pain in the context of back pain combined with health. In the following we summarize our findings for all sizes of organizations. For more detailed results consult the tables in Appendix 4. We differentiated between large- sized effects (Cohen's effects (Cohen's d<0.2, r<0.1). No effects means, that there was a study investigating the relationship, but the results showed no significant eff ect. 3.1 Small- and M edium-Sized Organizations 3.1.1 Mindfulness and Relaxation Interventions We only had six effect sizes derived from mindfulness and relaxation interventions but w e found consistent effects on perceived stress (medium to large), on emotional and motivational outcomes (medium to large), and on Burnout (small). All effects are derived from post intervention- assessments (see Table 6). 16 3.1.2 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Regarding CBT, we detected nine effects on physical outcomes (small to large) and six effects on mental and cognitive outcomes (medium to large) for both time points (post intervention and at follow up). For physical outcomes no effects could be found in two cases. For work -related behavior there was no effect at follow up but a small e ffect in th e inverse direction (see Table 7) . 3.1.3 Skills at W ork-Interventions We found three small effects on perceived stress and three small to medium effects on physical outcomes. Also no effect was detected in five cases, and one small effect in the inverse direction. Small to medium sized effects were found for mental and cognitive outcomes (12) as well as burnout (eight; in one follow up case there was no effect). For emotional and motivational outcomes we found six small - to medium -sized effects, but in the majority no effect could be detected (eight cases) . One effect pointed in the inverse direction. For work -related behavior we detected two small effects (no effect in one case). All effects included post intervention- as well as follow up- assessments (see Table 8) . 3.1.4 Work -Oriented Interventions Three large effects were found on emotional and motivational outcomes, from which one pointed in the inverse direction. Nine medium to large effects were detected for interpersonal outcomes. Also three small and large effects were found for the inverse direction. Work conditions showed eight medium to large effects and four large effects for the inverse direction. All effects were based on post intervention- assessments (see Table 9) . 3.2 Large-Sized Organizations 3.2.1 Mindfulness and Relaxation Interventions We detected effects on all categories of outcomes. For general health we detected two medium to large effects and a small effect pointing in the inverse direction. We found 12 small to large effects (no effect found in one case) on perceived stress and a mixed pattern for physical outcomes: two studies reported a large effect, 1 3 reported s mall to medium effects, and 1 3 reported no significant effect. For mental and cognitive (11 effects ) as well as emotional and motivational outcomes (23 effects ) we found small to large effect sizes (no effect found in six cases per group). Further mental and cognitive outcomes showed one small effect for the inverse direction. For burnout (nine effects ), interpersonal outcomes (three effects ) and work conditions (three effects ) we found small to large effects. Work - related behavior only showed one medium -sized effect. We also found one small inverse effect for work conditions. 17 Effects included post intervention- measurements as well as follow up- assessments (see Table 10) . 3.2.2 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) In two studies, CBT showed no effects on general health and perceived stress revealed small effects in two studies (no effect found in one case). Physical outcomes showed two small and medium effects but the majority (four) showed no effect and one large effect was in the inverse direction. Mental and cognitive outcomes included four small to large effects of which one small effect was inverse directed. Emotional and motivational outcomes showed three small to medium effects but the majority showed no effec t (five cases) or pointed in the inverse direction (three cases ). For b urnout no effects were found in two cases . Work -related behavior only showed one medium and one large effect , whereas the majority (nine studies) showed no effect. All effects included post intervention- as well as follow up- assessments (see Table 11) . 3.2.3 Skills at W ork-Interventions General health showed both one medium and one large effect. Similar, perceived stress showed three small and large effects. For physical outcomes two small effects could be found of which one pointed in the inverse direction. Mental and cognitive outcomes only showed one small effect. In three cases no effect could be found, one small and one large effe ct were in the inverse direction. Emotional and motivational outcomes showed six small to large effects, but the majority reached no effect (seven of 14), and one medium effect pointed in the inverse direction. For Burnout three small effects could be identified. In four cases no effect was found. Interpersonal outcomes revealed four large effects, whereas in five cases no effect was found. For work -related behavior two small effects (no effect in four cases) and for work conditions one small and one large effect (no effect in one case) were found. The effects consisted bo th of post intervent ion- and follow up- assessments (see Table 12) . 3.2.4 Informational Interventions For physical outcomes a small effect was found (no effect in two cases). Mental and cog nitive outcomes revealed small - to large- sized effects (no effect in five of 12 cases), whereas emotional and motivational outcomes only showed small - to medium -sized effects (no effect in two of 7 cases). Two large effects pointed in the inverse direction. Interpersonal outcomes only showed two medium effects for the inverse direction. Work -related behavior showed only one small effect, whereas two medium - sized effects were in the inverse direction (no effect in four cases). All effects included post intervention- as well as follow up- assessments (see Table 13) . 3.2.5 Others ( Mixed Designs) Mixed interventions with both work - and person- oriented approaches showed a medium effect for general health and no effects for physical health in ten cases. For mental and cognitive outcomes only small effects were found (no effect in 18 of 26 cases), whereas 3 small effects were inverse directed. Emotional and motivational outcomes showed both medium to large effects and a small inverse 18 directed effect (no effect in 12 of 18 cases). Burnout revealed small to large effects (no effect in two of 8 cases), interpersonal outcomes only included small to medium effects, whereas one small effect was inverse directed (no effect in three of seven cases). Finally work -related behavior showed small to large effects and also small to medium inverse directed effects (no effect in 34 of 54 cases). The effects consisted both of post intervent ion- and follow up assessments (see Table 14) . 3.2.6 Health -Related Behavior -Interventions This category includes almost no effects. Only for emotional and motivational outcomes one s mall effect was found. No effects were found in cases of general health, physical outcomes, also emotional and motivational outcomes, and work -related behavior (overall six of seven cases). The effects consisted only of post-intervention assessments (see Table 15) . 3.2.7 Work -Oriented Interventions For physical outcomes small - and large- sized effects were found (no effect in 8 out of 14 cases). Mental and cognitive outcomes revealed small - to large- sized effects (no effect in 1 of 7 cases), whereas emotional and motivational outcomes only showed one medium -sized effect (no effect in 5 cases). For Burnout no effect could be found. Interpersonal outcomes showed few small and large effects, whereas in 16 out of 19 cases no effect could be found. Work -related behavior showed only small effects, of which one was in the inverse direction (no effects in 10 of 14 cases). Work conditions revealed small - to medium -sized effects, of which one small effect was inverse directed (no effects in 14 of 22 cases). All effects included post intervention- as well as follow up- assessments (see Table 16) . 3.3 Organizations of Unclear Size that Are Supposed to be Small- and Medium-Sized Organizations 3.3.1 Mindfulness and Relaxation -Interventions Compared to small - and medium - and large- sized organizations the pattern for mindfulness and relaxation- interventions is similar to the one for large- sized organizations. This is mainly based on the fact that there were only few studies for small - and medium -sized organizations. Effects were derived from post intervention- and follow up- assessments (see Table 17) . For detailed information we added the tables in Appendix 4. 3.3.2 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Compared to small - and medium -sized and large- sized organizations the results for this group showed a different pattern. While we had good evidence for both of the other groups only few studies were included for the estimated small - and medium -sized organizations. The studies showed a medium 19 effect on perceived stress, a small effect on interpersonal outcomes, and a small inverse directed effect on general health for post intervention- assessments (see Table 18) . 3.3.3 Skills at W ork-Interventions Compared to both of the other groups skills at work -interventions in this group showed the lowest amount of effects (six small - to large- sized out of 12). There were only studies examining mental and cognitive, emotional and motivational, interpersonal outcomes and burnout. Effect sizes were only based on post intervention- assessments (see Table 19) . 3.3.4 Others ( Mixed Designs) Compared to large- sized organization this group showed a more spread pattern of effect sizes. Most effects were found on burnout but were in the hypothesized as well as in the inverse direction. Overall, also some studies revealed no effects (18 of 30 cases). Effects were based on post intervention- and follow up -assessment s (see Table 20) . 3.3.5 Health -Related Behavior -Interventions Compared to large- sized organizations estimated small - and medium -sized organizations showed a similar pattern concerning effect sizes. Overall eight out of ten showed no effect. Only two small effects were found on mental and cognitive outcomes. Effects were based on post intervention- and follow up -assessments. It is important to mention that for both organization sized we only had few studies examining this type of intervention (see Table 21) . For overall patterns of effect sizes we added tables summarizing all sizes of organizations (small - and medium -, large- , and estimated small - and medium -sizes) in Appendix 4 (see Tables 22- 28). 3.4 Integration of Results To compare across interventions types, organization size, and direction of effects , we conducted Chi - square- tests. We aggregated different information about the studies. First we aggregated Mindfulness and relaxation interventions, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and skills at work -interventions all belonging to the category of person- oriented interventions. All work -oriented interventions were already merged. Second all small - and medium -sized just as the large- sized organizations were grouped together. Third we aggregated sm all-, medium -, and large- sized effects for the hypothesized direction as well as for the inverse direction. Afterwards we compared person- and work -oriented interventions, interventions in small - and medium - sized versus large- sized organizations, and hypot hesized, none, and inverse directed effects. Chi-square- tests showed that for both small - and medium -, and large- sized organizations there were significant differences between person- and -oriented interventions (small: 2=10.837, p=.004; 20 p=.000). The results were in favor of person- oriented interventions showing relatively more hypothesized effects and less inverse effects than work -oriented interventions. Chi-square- tests also showed that for person- oriented interventions there i s no difference in whether small - and medium -sized organizations or large- sized organizations found more hypothesized and less inverse effects. ( 2=2.819, p=.244). In contrast, for work -oriented interventions Chi -square- tests showed less inverse and more hypothesized effects in relation in favor of the small - and medium -sized organiza tions (2=40.779, p=.000). This shows that person- oriented seem to be similar in effectiveness for both small - and medium -sized as well as large- sized organizations, while work -oriented interventions seem to be more effective for small - and medium -sized organizations. Figure 1 summarizes the finding of all Chi - square- tests conducted. Figure 1 Intervention Results Separated for Effect, Intervention Type, and Organization Size 21 4 Discussion The main research question addressed small - and medium -sized organizations: The number of intervention studies conducted in small- and medium -sized organizations fulfilling all criteria of the definition of the Bundesamt f\u00fcr Statistik (2015) was limited . Facing this obstacle we decided to include all organizations as small - and medium -sized if they fulfill ed the size criterion of less than 2 50 employees. Also we included departments of organizations with less than 250 employees in cases where it was clear that the unit was separated from other departments. Thereby we reached a small amount of studies that we were able to include in this category . Interestingly, most studies in small - sized organi zations consisted of teachers. This points to the need of more research on s mall- sized organizations, however, we acknowledge the challenges for research as well as these organizations. Among small -sized organizations, we found a clear picture for mindfulness and relaxation, showing small to large effects but no null or inverse effects. Among CBT interventions we also found small to large effects with some null and inverse direction effects. For work -interventions, the effects were small to medium, again with some null and a few small inverse effects. For work -oriented interventi ons the picture was diverse: there were medium to large effects in the hypothesized and in the inverse direction with majority being in the hypothesized direction. However, it is important to note that f or mindfulness and relaxation, CBT , and work -oriented interventions we on ly found few studies which makes well-grounded and elaborate comparisons difficult. For large- sized organizations mindfulness and relaxation interventions seem to show the largest effects and most consistent results. In general, more st udies are needed for health- related and informational interventions t o evaluate their effectiveness. Over the time span of 2.5 years (January 2012 to June 2015) , we found 77 studies which includ ed work - and person- directed interventions at the workplace and evaluated their effects on employees ' health and well -being. We tried to counteract the large heterogeneity of the studies by categorizing interventions (mindfulness and relaxation interventions, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, skills at work - interventions, informational interventions, health- related interventions, others, and work -oriented interventions) and outcomes (general health, perceived stress, physical outcomes, musculoskeletal complaints, mental and cognitive outcomes, emotional and motivational outcomes, burnout, interpersonal outcomes, work -related behavior, and work conditions). By analyzing the intervention studies we found that 72 out of 77 studies reported at least one significant effect of the intervention on a health- or work behavior -related outcome. Only five studies found no effect at all, which represents a very good rate compared to former reviews (La Montagne, O utcomes showing many hypothesized effects were especially mental and cognitive, and emotional and motivational outcomes. Overall , we included 671 effect sizes in the review of which 339 showed an effect in the hypothesized direction. 273 investigated relations revealed no significant effect size, wher eas 59 effects pointed in the inverse direction (8.8%). 22 In particular, mindfulness and relaxation interventions were one of the two most commonly used intervention types and also seemed to be effective showing 78% effects in the hypothesized direction. They also reported an overall of 81% hypothesized small - to large- sized follow up -effects. The second type of intervention, which was also investigated in many studies were skills at work - interventions (70% significant follow up- effects) . Revealing an overa ll of 56% significant effects, this intervention type showed different patterns for small - and medium -sized than for large- sized organizations. In relation to the amount of effects there were more significant effects in small - and medium -sized organization s (67%) than for large- sized organizations ( 46%). For estimated small - and medium -sized organizations there were only few studies (12 effects). Cognitive Behavioral Therapy showed an overall of 48% significant effects (and 48% significant follow up-effects) . In relation of total amount of effects there were more significant effects in small - and medium -sized ( 79%) than in large- sized organizations ( 32%). The similar pattern is shown for work -oriented interventions. In this category we found 111 ef fects of which 41% showed significance (50% significant follow up- effects) . When separating for organization size, more effects were found for small - and medium -sized ( 70%) than for large- sized organizations (32%). The mixed designs consisting of both pers on- and work -oriented approaches showed an overall of 154 effects of which only 29% showed significance (18% significant follow up- effects) . No studies were conducted with small - and medium -sized organizations. Health- related ( 18% significant effects overa ll, 33% significant follow up- effects ) and informational interventions ( 39% significant effects overall , 33% significant follow up- effects ) showed the smallest numbers of significant effects as well as overall effects . According to long- term-effects the findings are similar to the ones for post intervention- assessments with mindfulness and relaxation and skills at work -interventions showing the most hypothesized significant effects for follow ups. Also work -oriented interventions showed a follow up- quote of 50%. 4.1 Practical Implications Our findings showed that more person- directed than work -oriented interventions were conducted in the latest research period. A possible reason for this circumstance could be that work -oriented interventions are harder to implement than person- oriented interventions due to regulated work structure and working conditions and recent general economic circumstances . The fact that studies showed large effects in the hypothesized direction but as well in the inverse directi on may be associated with individual preferences, pay -offs, and side effects. Not every intervention is suitable for all employees. If, for example, an intervention for the reduction of work -family -conflict is implemented, a single employee will not benefi t in the way as an employee with a family will - and some may even become offended as attention goes away from their issues . Besides this, participating can induce increased workload, time pressure, and complexity for employees. Therefore, at least in the beginning, job stress may even increase. Also, interventions may be effective regarding one outcome but not another one, for example employees may not be more satisfied but health indicators show improvement. 23 Nevertheless , work -oriented interventions cont ribute to improved well -being and health and also work - related behavior in forms of large effects in the hypothesized direction. These types of interventions seemed to be more successful in small - and medium -sized organizations. This may reflect a bias in the sense that research with small - and medium -sized organizations is particularly difficult because they may be less likely to engage in an intervention, because of power issues often several comparable organizations are needed, and it may be difficult to find a suitable research design in a small - or medium -sized organization (e.g., problem to find a control group). On the other hand, this result may also show, that implementation of work -oriented interventions is to some extend easier in smaller organiza tions. This may be associated with better support from management, higher participation of employees, and higher awareness of intervention among management and employees. In addition, smaller organizations usually do not engage in several interventions or change projects at the same time. Therefore, employees may less likely be affected by previous intervention failures and are motivated to participate. 4.2 Limitations Due to our search queries we are limited to those results found and the added articles of researchers in the field. Because we focused on psychosocial interventions the area of physical and health-management -intervention could maybe not be fully covered by our review. Further we did not include interventions focusing mainly on pain due to our search queries. Also some studies didn't provide full information on implementation, measur ement and statistical information to derive effect sizes. We needed to exclude these studies due to the lack of information. Another challenge was the breadth and heterogeneity of the interventions as well as the health- and behavior -related outcomes. By building categories we tried to simplify and summarize the findings of the studies. Thus results of this review should be interpreted and generalized only with caut ion because of that heterogeneity. There are more underlying factors influencing results of the interventions (e.g., acceptance by employees). Since this was a replication of the review by Montano and colleagues (2014) we also adapted their inclusion criteria. Thus we only included articles published in peer -reviewed journals, and no thesis, dissertations, or unpublished material. This could lead to a publication bias. On the other side we included a broad range of interventions and variables reducing a sel ection bias. Another fact to be mentioned is that the effect of interventions is researched more for some outcomes, and less for others. The majority of effects were investigated for mental and cognitive, and emotional and motivational outcomes providing good evidence. Opposite, more research on psychosocial interventions is needed for physical and musculoskeletal outcomes. Especially musculoskeletal complaints are of increasing importance (e.g., Melloh, Elfering, Chapple, K\u00e4ser, Salath\u00e9, et al., 2013) . A great amount of interventions was implemented among medical staff. This makes it more difficult to generalize our findings. 24 On the other side there are a many positive aspects concerning our review. First, we included a broad range of interventions. Also we collected a relatively large number of studies at all. Moreover it gives an overview over the studies in the field, showing areas which need to be further researched. We also weighted the included studies for their methodological approach and study quality, and we coded for organization size which offers the possibility to compare the effectiveness of interventions in organizations of different size. Beyond we included international studies from all over the world to enable for international comparison. Another import ant fact is that we took follow up- assessments into account which enables to investigate long- term-effects. 4.3 Conclusion In face of the large number of different interventions included in this review we were able to give an overview of the current situation. M indfulness and relaxation as well as skills at work -intervention show ed consistent effects on well -being and health outcomes . Further , we were able to highlight that skills at work -, cognitive, and work -oriented interventions seemed to show more consistent effects in small - and medium -sized organizations than in large- sized organizations. Also , mindfulness and relaxation, skills at work -, and work -oriented interventions showed good effects at follow up, therewith showing some durabil ity. Lastly, the differentiating results also showed that with careful implementation, work -oriented intervention may have large effects. 25 Literature *Aikens, K. A., Astin, J., Pelletier, K.
