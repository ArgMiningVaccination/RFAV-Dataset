FURTHER INFORMATION: Duncan Keppie 902-542-5320, keppie[at]eastlink.ca With this hands-on, participatory workshop we are bringing together Canadian and US presenters who have long been involved with Goethean methodologies, science, anthroposophy and the arts. Through field trips, lectures, demonstrations, artistic activities and conversation we will use a Goethean approach to develop an earth consciousness by exploring in a living way, the Nova Scotian landscape, the geology, the intrinsic nature of water and water flow, and current scientific and social questions around the care of the earth, it's well-being and that of human beings. Instead of observing nature from outside, we will strive to awaken our consciousness and inner awareness of our own experience when we actively observe nature by becoming one with nature. Such an awakening is revealed in a puppet play of Goethe's Fairy Tale, \"The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily\" at the start of the workshop. Goethe regarded the Fairy Tale as his way of presenting his profoundest secrets of his observations of nature in the transformation of the soul. The Fairy Tale is set in a landscape divided by a river that depicts the boundary between two lands: the land of our normal 'daytime' consciousness and the land of the super-sensible, which is not accessible to our normal sense perception. By the end of the Fairy Tale, there is a permanent bridge spanning this river, joining these two Lands together. In this context, we will \"read the rocks\" along the margin of the Bay of Fundy that record it's opening, prior history and explore the deeper, hidden significance. We will also be exploring some intrinsic qualities of water that support it as an \"element for life\", drawing from the consciousness changing work of Theodor and Wolfram Schwenk and their understanding of water. There will be field trips, experiments and work on perception of Nature's subtle forces based upon Goethe's methodologies, where we will \"read the natural water currents\" in Bear River and at the entrance to the Annapolis Basin on the southern margin of the Bay of Fundy, which has the highest tides in the world, and experiment with such things as water vortexes and their significance for the earth's interior. Using our raised consciousness, we will examine the delicate balance provided by Gaia to life and humans, whose present materialism has the potential to upset this balance leading to important consequences for the living earth, living water, and human life. Participation in singing, artistic activities, aboriginal blessing of the water, and Celtic dance and music will help in transforming us into being one with the movement of water and the inner earth. Two optional extra days (11th and 12th, August) following the workshop will provide a public talk and field trips to: (i) Carboniferous rocks that are the target of potential fracking & glacial geology ($10), and (ii) the fossil trees at Joggins, a UNESCO world heritage site (Entrance fee ?$5).Jennifer Greene, founder of the Water Research Institute of Blue Hill, is an advocate for the nature of water and is an internationally recognized educator and contributor to the understanding and scientific explication of water as a purveyor of life. The Institute operates as an incubator for ideas and new directions of the knowledge of water acquired through empirical research, through the study of water phenomena themselves and what this reveals of water's intrinsic nature. It contributes to a new understanding of the conditions that water needs to do its work as a servant of life. Since 1980, Greene has worked as an educator, compelling us to become better observers of the context of natural processes pertaining to water's nature and how this contributes to answering the question \"what sustains sustainability?\" The holistic approach that Greene brings is contributing to building a new understanding of water as a link between water policy advocates and indigenous peoples. This has been brought in several World Water Forum's and internationally. The understanding of water is inspired by and arises out of the seminal work of Theodor Schwenk, author of Sensitive Chaos and the research of Wolfram Schwenk. Duncan Keppie. Since graduating with a Doctorate from Glasgow University (Scotland), Duncan has been working in universities and geological surveys for almost 50 years using methods that he eventually recognized as Goethean methods when he joined the Anthroposophical Society. Major topics of interest include palaeographic reconstruction, terrane analysis, recycling continental crust through subduction erosion and extrusion, geochronology, analysis of tectonic setting using geochemistry, folding. His publication record may be found at: http://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=- PGd9ZYAAAAJ&hl=en . Duncan has acted in a leadership role in six projects funded by UNESCO, organized 20 international field conferences and six symposia, and besides teaching courses, has supervised eight doctoral theses. Maggie Keppie co-pilots the anthroposophical early childhood training course in NS, following 45 years in education. After designing Grade 5 Curriculum in Zambia in the early 70s, she created a music program in NS for 3 - 7 year olds, while completing public school certification, followed by 10 years' teaching music in public schools. Through subsequent work at the Waldorf-inspired Starbright Morning Nursery School and Kindergarten in Wolfville in the early 90s, Maggie met anthroposophy. She studied at the Rudolf Steiner Institute (1993-7), earned a doctoral degree at Dalhousie University (writing her thesis on the role of art in education from both Waldorf and mainstream perspectives), and taught at Waldorf High Schools in NY and PA (1997 - 2001). For the next decade Maggie co- facilitated Waldorf-inspired multi-media art programs for children with special needs, and now offers Waldorf-based workshops. Maggie also dances, teaches, and choreographs Scottish country dancing. Jonathan Swan is a research fellow at the \"Water Research Institute of Blue Hill\" in Maine, and has had a longstanding and deep interest in the phenomenology of water and stone, and the dialogue between them in nature. Swan has been actively bringing to his research and studies understanding borne out of of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's and Rudolf Steiner's indications about the development of the Earth and Man. He works and travels as a field geographer and has directly experienced the landscape and waterways of many areas of Europe and North America. Monika Wildemann is a Kindergarten Waldorf teacher at the South Shore Waldorf School, Artistic Director of Wee Giants that specializes in puppets that energize spaces. She trained in theatre, dance, clowning, and visual arts at the Alberta College of Arts and Design, and has performed in children's and musical festivals, county fairs and school tours across Canada. Monika creates puppets, props and costumes from recycled materials to help people celebrate living in peace, beauty and harmony.
