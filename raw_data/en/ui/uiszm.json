This attack gradually destroys the thyroid's tissue and its ability to produce critical hormones. According to the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association, Inc., approximately 20% of the U.S. population suffers from autoimmine diseases and Hashimoto's is the most common. Even more shocking, thyroid diseases occur roughly five times more frequently in women than men. With such prevalence, it's very important to understand its causes and effects as well as how you can effectively prevent or treat this common condition. Causes and Risk Factors As an autoimmune condition, Hashimoto's arises from a dysfunctional immune system, not a dysfunctional thyroid. This means the condition is actually a symptom of a much deeper issue. Stress on the thyroid and/or immune system are at the root of Hashimoto's and there are many stressors to be aware of. Below is a list of causes for Hashimoto's. Exposure to radiation, through work or medical treatments. Excess exposure to environmental toxins, fluoride and perchlorate in water, mercury and other heavy metals, lithium, and estrogens from pesticides and hormone creams or pills. Overconsumption, or deficiency, of dietary iodine. Overconsumption of soy products and uncooked \"goitrogenic\" foods such as kale, kohlrabi, millet, radishes, rutabaga and turnip. Leaky gut syndrome, food allergies, gut dysbiosis and poor digestive health. Chronic blood sugar imbalance, insulin resistance and diabetes. Chronic inflammation. Hormonal imbalances. Infections, both chronic and acute. Adrenal dysfunction and adrenal fatigue. Liver, pituitary and/or hypothalamus dysfunction. Inappropriate use of thyroid medications. Presence of other autoimmune conditions. Chronic stress. The major risk factors are chronic stress, gluten intolerance or celiac disease, insulin resistance, vitamin D deficiency, leaky gut and compromised detoxification. All of these risk factors create a vicious cycle of continually increasing stress on the body. Chronic and prolonged stress then increases damage to the adrenals, gut, liver and pituitary as well as compromises blood sugar, nutrient absorption and immunity. The cycle continues until the immune system spirals out of control creating chronic inflammation and an overactive immune system - the perfect storm leading to Hashimoto's. An underlying gluten intolerance may be the most damaging risk factor. Thyroid tissue and the gluten molecule have a similar structure. If the body mounts an attack on gluten, it will also inadvertently attack thyroid tissue. In fact, Hashimoto's is always associated with gluten sensitivity. If you suspect Hashimoto's, already have an autoimmune condition, or suffer from a compromised immune system you should completely avoid gluten to protect your thyroid. Varied Symptoms Many things can increase your risk of Hashimoto's. It is also common to have many symptoms, including: Fatigue Excessive sleep Depression Poor concentration and memory Weight gain Dry and brittle hair and nails Thinning eyebrows Muscle and joint pain Morning headaches Tendonitis Puffy eyes and face Cold hands and feet Full sensation in neck Raspy, hoarse voice Heart palpitations Insomnia Shortness of breath Low sex drive Infertility, heavy periods and PMS High cholesterol High blood pressure Insulin resistance Worsening allergies Chronic infections, including yeast and sinus infections Slow wound healing Heartburn and difficulty swallowing Indigestion, nausea, gas and bloating Constipation and other digestive issues Diagnosing Hashimoto's The most common diagnostic test for thyroid dysfunction is testing levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). However, to confirm Hashimoto's it is important to test for thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO Ab) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TGB Ab). A Full Thyroid Panel - which includes Total T4, Free T4 Index, Free T4, Free T3, T3 Uptake, Reverse T3 and Thyroid Antibodies - will also be beneficial to determine the source of dysfunction and the degree of damage. If you are diagnosed with Hashimoto's, you have both conventional and alternative treatments to consider. Treatment Options Conventional treatment for Hashimoto's is to monitor thyroid hormone levels, adjust medications accordingly, and prescribe more medications to suppress any symptoms. This could include Prozac for depression, or medications to slow heart rate or adrenal function. Treatment may even lead to partial or complete removal of the thyroid and a lifetime of hormone replacement therapy. The concern with conventional treatment, however, is that it does not address the underlying issue - an overactive immune system and the root causes of its hyperactivity. Alternative and holistic minded treatments address the root cause of an overactive immune system. Alternative medicine practitioners will determine the health of your gastrointestinal tract, liver and adrenal glands; your level of exposure to toxins and excess estrogen; as well as the quality of your current diet and how it may contribute to nutrient deficiencies, toxin exposure, blood sugar imbalance and stress on the body. Also, through blood tests they can determine not only current thyroid function, but what may be at the root cause. Through this, they can determine the course of treatment. In any scenario, regulating the immune response with targeted nutrition and supplementation will be critical. Lifestyle Changes for Hashimoto's If you have been diagnosed with Hashimoto's, hypo- or hyperthyroidism, or any other autoimmune disease, the most important dietary change is to completely remove gluten from your diet. Consuming gluten when the immune system is already overactive will actually increase damage and destruction of the thyroid. Here are some other lifestyle changes that can reduce your risk, or improve your symptoms, of Hashimoto's. Test for other food allergies. Consume a diet high in healthy fats, fiber, clean protein and organic produce, and low in carbohydrates to help balance blood sugar, increase immunity and support the thyroid. Eat every 2-4 hours. Avoid soy products. If you consume \"goitrogenic\" foods, cook them to deactivate the goitrogens. Consider a safe liver detox protocol. Practice stress management techniques daily. Incorporate a mix of short cardio sessions and strength training for exercise. Avoid iodine supplementation if you are diagnosed with Hashimoto's, it can further damage the thyroid. Supplements for Hashimoto's Certain supplements may also help support the thyroid. Selenium may reduce inflammation and protect thyroid function. Magnesium may help balance blood sugar and support the pituitary-thyroid connection. Vitamin C may enhance immunity, repair the gut lining and reduce inflammation. B Vitamins may support proper digestion, immunity and thyroid function. Zinc may promote thyroid hormone production and enhance immunity. Maca Root may enhance thyroid function. Milk Thistle may support detoxification and reduce inflammation. Resources: Prescription for Nutritional Healing, Phyllis A. Balch, CNC Disease Prevention and Treatment, 5th ed.
