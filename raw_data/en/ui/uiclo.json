The study of variations components and therapeutic response to preparations from different regions, seasonal changes, and strains are all areas of interest as researchers try to understand the mechanism of action and how to improve upon these interesting therapeutics. We provide advanced sample preparation capabilities, analytical instruments and software solutions for the complete natural products analysis workflow. There is considerable interest in botanical supplements due to their purported health benefits. Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L) is a tropical fruit that is indigenous to Southeast Asia, where it has been historically used to treat abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysentery, inflammation, wound infection, suppuration, and chronic ulcer. The term natural products is a broad classification of plant compounds that includes functional foods, nutraceuticals, herbal health care, and traditional Chinese medicine. Botanicals contain a great diversity of compounds that can show extreme variation in their physicochemical properties. Analysis of potentially active components can be challenging as not all contain a chromophore or can be ionized, thereby limiting the use of UV absorbance and mass spectrometry, respectively. Traditional Chinese Medicines is a group of treatments that have been regularly employed over many hundreds of years and are still in use today. These medicines have been shown to alleviate illness, improve physical appearances as well as increase overall individual health.
