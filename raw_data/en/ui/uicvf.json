For the fall season, COVID vaccine makers are gearing up with updated shots that target the Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5. Both Moderna [(MRNA.O)](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MRNA.O) and Pfizer [(PFE.N)](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/PFE.N) have said their shots show promise against Eris too.

EG.5 accounted for about more than 17% of COVID-19 cases in the United States, according to the latest government data. The World Health Organization has classified Eris as a \"variant of interest\", indicating that it should be more closely watched than others because of mutations that might make it more contagious or severe.
