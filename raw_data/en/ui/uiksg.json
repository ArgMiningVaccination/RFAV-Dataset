I strive to bring greater awareness to the ways in which acupuncture and integrative medicine not only benefit the individual, but our healthcare system as a whole. Dr. Fugelsang first became interested in acupuncture and integrative medicine while working for a community clinic that successfully incorporated patient care using allopathic, naturopathic, and East Asian medicine. There she observed the benefits of treating the whole person and determining the rootcause of a person's health conditions, while using a multi-pronged approach of treatment including acute care, prevention, and support of lifestyle modifications. She is dedicated to treating the patient both in and outside thetreatment room, connecting patients with appropriate resources to facilitate their optimal health. Dr. Fugelsang completed her undergraduate degree at Cornell University and graduated from Pacific College of Oriental Medicine. She has completed her Doctorate of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, and is certified in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM).
