Try this simple test: Sit or stand wherever you are and take a deep breath. Then let it out. What expanded more as you inhaled, your chest or your belly? If the answer is your chest, you're a \"chest breather,\" and like most people you're doing it all wrong. You're also putting your health in jeopardy. The technique is so powerful that physician James Gordon teaches it to nearly every patient he sees, from people with advanced cancer to those crippled by arthritis to school children struggling with attention-deficit disorder. He's taught it to refugees in war-torn Kosovo, and anxiety-plagued medical students at Georgetown University. \"Slow, deep breathing is probably the single best anti-stress medicine we have,\" says Gordon, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Georgetown University School of Medicine and director of the Center for Mind-Body Medicine in the District of Columbia. \"When you bring air down into the lower portion of the lungs, where oxygen exchange is most efficient, everything changes. Heart rate slows, blood pressure decreases, muscles relax, anxiety eases and the mind calms.\" Obviously, everyone alive knows how to breathe. But Gordon and other experts in the emerging field of mind-body medicine, say that few people in Western, industrialized society know how to breathe correctly. Taught to suck in our guts and puff out our chests, we're bombarded with a constant barrage of stress, which causes muscles to tense and respiration rate to increase. As a result, we've become a nation of shallow \"chest breathers,\" who primarily use the middle and upper portions of the lungs. Few people - other than musicians, singers and some athletes - are even aware that the abdomen should expand during inhalation to provide the optimum amount of oxygen needed to nourish all the cells in the body. \"Watch a baby breathe and you'll see the belly go up and down, deep and slow,\" Gordon says. With age, most people shift from this healthy abdominal breathing to shallow chest breathing, he says. This strains the lungs, which must move faster to ensure adequate oxygen flow, and taxes the heart, which is forced to speed up to provide enough blood for oxygen transport. The result is a vicious cycle, where stress prompts shallow breathing, which in turn creates more stress. \"The simplest and most powerful technique for protecting your health is breathing,\" asserts Andrew Weil, director of the Program in Integrative Medicine and clinical professor of internal medicine at the University of Arizona in Tucson. \"I have seen breath control alone achieve remarkable results: lowering blood pressure, ending heart arrhythmias, improving long-standing patterns of poor digestion, increasing blood circulation throughout the body, decreasing anxiety and allowing people to get off addictive anti-anxiety drugs and improving sleep and energy cycles.\" Unlike any other bodily function, he notes, \"breathing is the only one you can do either completely consciously or unconsciously. It's controlled by two different sets of nerves and muscles, voluntary and involuntary. And it's the only function through which the conscious mind can influence the involuntary, or autonomic, nervous system,\" which is responsible for revving-up the body to fight or flee. Techniques that use focused breathing to affect the nervous system, change physiology and connect the body with the mind can be traced back to ancient India. Many systems of meditation and numerous spiritual practices center on conscious breathing, Weil notes in his recently released CD, \"Breathing: The Master Key to Self Healing\" (Sounds True, 1999). There is little scientific research documenting the healing power of breathing, in part because its practice is so new in Western medicine. And unlike drugs or devices, breathing has no manufacturer who must sponsor studies to support its use. Increased interest in studying the effects of nontraditional healing therapies such as relaxation breathing led to the founding in 1991 of the Office of Alternative Medicine, now the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, at the National Institutes of Health. As a result, more medical scientists are beginning to examine the health impact of a variety of mind-body therapies such as meditation, guided imagery and Eastern exercises - yoga, tai chi and qi gong - which typically incorporate focused breathing. Some findings: Reducing hot flashes: One of the few studies to examine a clinical application of yoga \"belly breathing\" found that menopausal women who learned the technique were able to reduce the frequency and intensity of hot flashes by about 50 percent, notes Robert Freedman, professor of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences at Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit. Relieving chronic pain: Various studies have shown mind-body techniques to effectively treat some stress-related disorders. For example, research shows chronic-pain patients reduced clinic visits by 36 percent for more than two years after a 10-week course on mind-body self-care techniques. Slow deep breathing is central to most of the techniques, according to Herbert Benson, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and president of the Mind/Body Medical Institute in Boston. PMS, emotional distress, infertility: The techniques also can significantly reduce symptoms of severe PMS as well as anxiety, depression and other forms of emotional distress, according to research by Alice Domar, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and director of the Mind/Body Center for Women's Health. Her studies also showed that, after a mind-body group program for women with infertility - where 284 participants learned a variety of self-nurturing techniques such as deep breathing - 44 percent conceived within six months. \"Though we're still trying to ferret out the biological mechanisms that explain this high percentage, I am convinced that nurturing mind and body has a powerful effect on hormones and other (physiological) parameters,\" writes Domar in her book \"Self-Nurture\" (Viking, 2000).\" Hospital training: Some hospitals have begun teaching relaxation breathing to patients treated for a wide range of conditions. At the Washington Hospital Center in the District of Columbia, nurse Julie Oliver incorporates breathwork into support groups she leads, including one for people with congestive heart failure and another for parents of babies in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). At Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., nurse Jon Seskevich has taught \"soft belly breathing\" to some 15,000 patients, about half with cancer, the others with a wide variety of ailments including heart disease and cystic fibrosis. One of his most dramatic cases involved a lung-cancer patient. \"I walked into the room to find this very large man literally fighting for breath,\" Seskevich recalls. \"His pulse oxygen was 74, and you want it to be 90 or above. I sat down next to him and started talking in a calm voice. I asked him if it was OK if I touched his belly. He nodded, so I put my hand on his belly and told him to breathe into my hand, to let his belly be soft and to let his abdomen rise into my hand.\" After about six minutes of this, the man's pulse oxygen was 94 and he was breathing comfortably. \"We didn't cure his cancer, but we may have saved him a trip to the intensive-care unit.\" Patients are hungry for self-care information, says Seskevich. \"People are very anxious to learn what they can do for themselves,\" he says. \"They become empowered by these techniques and they do better.\" ---------------------------------------------------------- About the authors Carol Krucoff is co-author, with her husband, Mitchell Krucoff, M.D., of \"Healing Moves: How to Cure, Relieve, and Prevent Common Ailments With Exercise\" (Harmony Books, 2000), which includes dozens of exercises designed to treat a wide variety of disorders, including arthritis, asthma, back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, depression, diabetes, hypertension and osteoporosis.
