Prisoners served as1 test sub jects fo r sub stances ranging from perfu me, soap, and cosm etics, to dio xin, psychological warfare agents, and radioactive isotopes. By 1969, eighty-five2 percen t of new drugs were tested on incarc erated person s in forty -two prisons ,3 and prisoners in the United States were even utilized to te st drugs for researchers in other countries. In the following decade investigations revealed that prisoners4 who were the subjects of c linical rese arch often suffered serious adverse conse quen ces a nd severe ab uses. Allen Hor nblum, wh o, in his book Acres of Skin, wrote a moving expose of medical research that was conducted in one prison, stated in an early chapter: For two decades\u2014from th e early 1950s to th e early 1970 s\u2014Philad elphia's Holm esburg Priso n played host to one of the largest and most varied medical experimentation centers in the country. Only the inmates, and the d octors who experimented on them , know just exactly what to ok place , but whereas the latter choo se not to discuss their earlier medical exploits, the prisoners are not asked. In that respect, Holm esburg is little different from the d ozens of other in stitutions that contained vulnerable populations and [sic] were exploited in the name of scientific advancement.

In addition, the institutional9 review board asses sing the clinical trial must in clude at least one prisone r or prisone r repres entativ e and must ce rtify that a variety of cond itions h ave been10 met and that a number o f precau tions have been taken.

THE ABUSE OF PRISONER S IN CLINICAL TRIALS Throug hout history many differen t culture s use d prisoners for bio medical experimentation. In ancient Persia physicians were permitted to utilize incarcerated indiv iduals as research subjects. The Rom an empire subj ected55 prisone rs to the te sting of poisons. Eighteenth century European physicians56 expo sed prisone rs to venereal disease, cancers, typhoid , and scarlet fev er in order to co nduc t medical research. 57 In the United States the earliest known experimentation involving prisoners dates back to 1914, when white male convicts in Mississip pi were used in pellag ra stud ies. Pellag ra is a dise ase th at cau ses d ermatitis, diarrhea, dementia,58 and, at times, death. The purpose of the experiment was to induce pellagra in59 twelve volunteers and to study the effects of diet on the disease. All twelve60 receiv ed pardon s and survived, but th ey were n ot perm itted to leav e the clinical trial, even after suffering severe symptoms and begging to be released from it.61 In California, betw een 1919 and 1922, hundred s of prisone rs too k part in a testicular transplant experiment, designed to test whether lost male potency could be re invigorated. During World War I I grea t enthusiasm developed for prisone r62 experimentation, and prisoners signed up for research trials in large numbers in order to sh ow their p atriotism . In New York scores of inmates v oluntee red fo r63 daily doses of various drugs to assist the Army in determining whether soldiers could carry full work loads unde r the drugs' influenc e. New Jersey supplied the64 Army with willing participants for research regarding sleeping sickness, sand-fly fever, and deng ue fe ver. In the Statev ille Penitentiary in Illinois, more th an 40065 prisone rs were inclu ded in a two-year-long stud y aimed at findin g a cure for malaria, and at the U.S. Peniten tiary in Atlanta 600 inm ates p articipated in oth er malaria rese arch.

The Nure mberg Trials we re op ened on72 November 20, 1945 at the Palace of Justice in N uremberg, Germany. Twenty73 three N azi phy sicians were found guilty of \"war crim es an d crim es ag ainst humanity ,\" and sev en of them were sen tenced to de ath. At the trials the defense74 argued that the Nazis' research was no worse than \"the wartime experiments in the U nited States such as those carried out at th e Joilet, I llinois, prison in which treatm ents for malaria were sought by physicians who had to first infect the volunte er prisoners with the disease.\" Th ese arguments failed, however,75 becau se the prosecution focused o n the fact that in the co ncentratio n camps inmates h ad no choice re garding the torm ents to whic h the y were su bjected, an d in the United States prisone rs voluntee red to particip ate in clinical trials.76 Japanese researchers also conducted barbarous experiments on prisoners in Manchuria during World War II.

The volunta ry consent of the hum an subject is absolute ly essential. This means that the person involved shoul d have legal capacity to give consent; shoul d be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, de ceit, dure ss, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and c omprehen sion of the elem ents of the subject m atter involved as to enable him to make an under standing a nd enlightened decision. This latter element require s that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpos e of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conduc ted; all inconveniences and ha zards reasonabl y to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person w hich may possibly come from his participation in the experiment. The duty and re spons ibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon e ach indi vidual who initiates, directs or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and respons ibility which may not be delegated to anothe r with impunity. 2. The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for th e good of society, unpr ocurable by othe r methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessa ry in natu re. 3. The experim ent sho uld be so designed and based on th e res ults o f anim al experim entatio n and a knowledge of the natural hi story of the disease or other proble m unde r study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment. 4. The experiment sho uld be so cond ucted as to avoid all unn ecessary phys ical and mental suffering and injury. 5. No experiment should be conduct ed where there is an a prio ri reason to believe that death or disabling injur y will occur; except, perhaps, in thos e experiments where the ex perim ental ph ysicians also se rve as subjects. 6. The degree of risk to be taken shoul d never exceed that det ermin ed by the humanitarian importa nce of the probl em to be solved by the experiment.promulgated.

The experim ent shou ld be cond ucted only by scientifically qualified person s. The highest degree of skill and care shoul d be require d throug h all stages of the experiment of thos e who conduct or engage in the experiment. 9. During the course of the experiment the hum an subj ect should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where contin uatio n of the ex perim ent seem s to him to be impossible. 10. During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has proba ble cause to be lieve, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment require d of him that a continua tion of the ex periment is lik ely to result in inj ury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.

However, the report did not focus specifically on review of protocols involving prisoners, a proce ss that is subject to higher standards.

Nevertheless, while the regulations themselves prov ide ample pro tection for pri soners, som e IRBs may be inconsistent in applying the guidelin es.

After carefu l con sideration167 and lengthy discu ssion, the court ruled against th e plain tiffs. A recitation of the facts is important to understanding the court's analysis and thus, will be provided in so me detail. The Mary land House of Correction (\"MHC \") was opened in 1879 and was designed to ho use appro ximately 1100 inmates. During the early 1970s the inmate populati on ranged from 1498 to168 1617, and many cells designed for only one person housed two occupants at a time. Until 1976, hot water was unavailable to prisoners. During the winter,169 170 inmates suffered from the cold because the pr ison's heating system was sorely inadequate, and in the summer months, the facility was very hot. A la rge171 percen tage of prisone rs had no work, educatio nal, or v ocation al activ ities and spent between sixteen and seventeen hours per day in their cells. Those with172 jobs earned betw een $.63 and $1.46 per day , with the v ast m ajority earn ing under $1.10 a day. 173 A medical research unit w as esta blished at th e MH C by doctors fro m the University of Maryland School of Medicine, and research involving prisoners comm enced in 1958. Pris oners participating in clinical trials wer e pai d two174 dollars per day, including Saturdays and Sundays, and additional payments were made if the prisoner underwent particular medical procedures. Approximately175 one third o f the participan ts liv ed fu ll-time in a desig nated section of the medical resear ch unit that, unlike the rest of the prison, had hot water, color television, and three s eparate bathroo m facilities. The patients could retain their jobs an d176 enjoy the i ncome earn ed fro m the medical research as a supp lement to othe r earnings. Participation in clinical trials, however, had no impact on parole177 decision s.

When a stud y was to be181 commen ced, all applicants wou ld be gathered as a gr oup and addressed by a nurse or a doctor, who explain ed th e reaso n for and natu re of the ex perim entation as well as its po ssible risk s. Inmates w ho again ex pressed interest in pa rticipation underwent a physical examination and were given repetitive oral explanations in layman's te rms, with oppo rtunities fo r questions and ers.182 ultim ately acce pted participan ts in the studies w ere g iven addition al verbal d ata ab out th e resea rch a nd were told that the y could withdraw at any time. Many in fact did withd raw both before and during various stages183 of ex perim entation. Prisoners were also a sked to sign a written conse nt184 form.185 The medical research unit at MHC conducted nontherapeutic studies of various infectio us peutic studies are tho se186 that d o not provide any direct medical benefit to the patient but seek to pro duce general knowledge about a particular disorder or cond ition. All of the d iseases187 investi gated, with the exceptions of the common cold and the flu, had known cures. Approxi mately fourteen perc ent of th e prisoners incarcerated at MHC188 from 1971 to 19 75 participated in the m edical studies.189 The plaintiffs alleged in their lawsuit that the poor prison conditions, their idleness, and the salary , which far exc eeded earn ings from other prison jobs, rendered their participation in the clinical trials coerced and consequently resulted in violations of the ir Eig hth A mendm ent and othe r con stitutional rights. The Eighth A mendm ent cla im revolved around the questio n of whether190 indiv iduals incarcerated in a prison setting can give truly meaning ful co nsent and rationally choose to volunteer for the trial with a full understanding of both its benefits and its risk s.191 The Bailey court found tha t the prisone rs were ad equately inform ed in light of the numerous verbal e xplana tions and the w ritten co nsent form s they receiv ed. The plaintiffs' s trong est alleg ations were thus rooted in the issue of192 voluntariness. Th e plaintiffs argued that the ov ercrowded and extremely uncom fortable conditions of regular institutional life at MH C caused them to over-value th e potential ea rning s and hours away from their ce lls and deprived2000 ] PRISONER PARTICIPATION IN CLINICAL TRI ALS 497 193.

It noted that in fact a very small minority of prisone rs (on ly fourteen p ercent) found the medical research programs appealing and that there was a constant shortage of volunteers. In194 addition, the court noted the following: Prisoners at the MHC were not subject to physical abuse, or confined in segregated c ells, or restricted to meagre [sic] diets, until th ey consented to participate in MR U studies. Prisoners were not pressured to participa te. To the contrary , prisoners had a viable c hoice and, even after ch oosing to participate, had the optio n to withd raw from the medical studies.195 The court decision also em phasiz ed th at the experim ents d id no t create a danger to the subjects' lives or fu ture health and that the risks of temporary discomfort were fully disclo sed to the inmates. Finally , the court focu sed upon the fact196 that p articipation in the clinical s tudies did n ot facilitate the in mates' relea se from MHC , and thus, early paro was not an incen tive for enrollm ent. The197 court found that the plain tiffs' Eig hth A mendm ent cla im failed becau se the defend ant's c ondu ct w as n ot \"in compatible with evolving stand ards o f decen cy\" and did not s ubject them to undu e coercion.198 199 The m edical research in the Bailey case was con ducted bef ore the DHHS issued its reg ulations for priso ner res earch in 19 78. Today priso ners in volved200 in clinic al trials would e njoy far g reater p rotection than that av ailable to the plaintiffs in the Bailey case. Moreover, the experimentation conducted in201 Bailey , which was found not to violate any constitutio nal rig hts, would be prohibited by DHHS regulations because it was nontherapeutic, did not benefit the su bjects, and did not fa ll into any of the categ ories of permissible re search.202 In lig ht porary regulatory safeg uards and the res trictions p laced on investigators conducting research involving prisoners, it is extremely unlikely that prisoner participants would suffer a violation of Eighth Amendment rights in the context o f a clinical trial that co mplies w ith fed eral g uidelines . apies .\u2014In man y instances, experimental treatments through clinical t rials co nstitute last ch ance therapies for de sperately ill pa tients w ho498 INDIANA LAW RE VIEW [Vol. 33 :475 203.

The complaint further asserted that cigarettes were sold229 to inm ates in the prison and that n onsm oking inmates w ere n ot info rmed of the health hazards a ssociated with bre athing smoke pro duced by their cellm ates.230 The Sup reme Court h eld th at the Eighth A mendm ent's p rotection against deliberate indifferenc e to a priso ner's h ealth problem s extends not o nly to current serious health problems, but also to condition s that threaten to cause health problem s in the fu ture. Conseq uently , the priso ner sta ted a cause of action231 under the Eighth Amendment when he alleged that prison officials had, with deliberate indifference, exposed him to levels of environmental tobacco smoke that cre ated a n unreason able risk of serious damage to his health in the fu ture.232 In order to obtain injunctiv e relief, however, the p laintiff w ould be re quired on remand to prove both an objective and a subjective element. First, he would233 have to prove that society considers the risk of which he com plains \"to b e so grave that it violates c ontem porary stand ards o f dec ency to ex pose anyo ne unwilling ly to such a risk .\" Second , the inm ate w ould be re quired to esta blish234 the su bjective factor th at priso n officials had sho wn deliberate indifferenc e to the hazards p osed to his health. To d o so, the plaintiff would need to focus upon235 the officials' current attitudes and conduct.236 If exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can constitute an Eighth Amendm ent v iolation, it stan ds to reason that t he denial of experim ental th erapy to an incarcerated person who is seriously ill could also rise to the le vel of a constitutional violation. If a clinical trial is available for a prisoner who suffers from AIDS or anothe r seriou s illness and priso n officials de ny the inmate acc ess to the trial, the in mate m ight be able to esta blish a valid cau se of action . The prisoner would have to show that failure to allow him access to the available clinical study is so grave th at it violates contempor ary standards of decency.237 If the illness a t issue is a terminal o ne, such as ca ncer or AIDS, for which conventional treatments have failed, this element may not be difficult to establish.

Success in establishin g this elem ent238 will depend upon the prison officials' reasoning and motivations. However,239 under Helling , the prisone r will not b e req uired to pro ve that exclusio n from the clinical trial posed an immediate risk of physical deterioration, but rather, only that h is or her fu ture h ealth may be jeopard ized. This p rinciple im portant240 for priso ners who are HIV positiv e since HIV patients may be asymptom atic or minimally symptomatic for many years. However, their future prognosis will depen d upon the th erapy that they receiv e thro ughout the co urse o f the disease, and therapy for HIV patients often include s experim ental d rug com bination s.241 If a state implements a regulation that prohibits prisoner participation in clinical trials, as many states have done, the Safley test would be used to evaluate any constitutional claim asserted by a prisone r. If the prisone r cou ld esta blish242 that the regulation deny ing acce ss to research studies impinges upon inmates' Eighth Amendm ent rights as discuss ed abov e, the prisone r would have to address the fo llowin g issues: (1) whether a valid, rational conn ection exists b etwee n the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest that purportedly justifies it; (2) w hether alternativ e means of exercising the constitutio nal rig ht remain o pen to the priso ners; (3 ) the impact t hat ac commodating the constitutio nal rig ht will hav e on gu ards, other inmates, and prison resource s; and (4) w hether there a re read y alterna tives to the p rison regulation.243 Prisoners denied access to potentially life-saving experimental treatments becau se of a p rison regulation shou ld be able to esta blish all fou r elem ents. Under the Safley test, it is not e noug h for state officials m erely to articulate a reason for the ir decisio n. Rather, the o fficials' reaso ning is subjected to judicial scrutiny . The Safley test has served as a basis for inv alidating priso n policies244 in several cases. The case of Muham mad v. Pitch er, for exam ple, involved a245 prison policy of treating inmate m ail from the State Attorn ey General's Office as ordinary mail rather than legal mail and opening it while the addresse e was n ot present. The court found that opening the mail in the absence of the prisoners246 burdened the inmates' First Amendment rights and was not reasonably related to legitimate penolog ical interests. Contrary to the d efenda nt's co ntention s, the247 court found that a requirem ent that m ail from the Attorn ey General's Office be open ed only in the presenc e of the address ee would no t waste p rison resource s.248 Moreov er, treatm ent o f mail from the Attorn ey General as ordinary mail left n o502 INDIANA LAW RE VIEW [Vol. 33 :475 249.

See discussion supra Part III. 253.The state m ight also argue that th e reg ulatio n is necessa ry for security and cost reasons. Allowing an inm ate to leave the prison in or der to receive the e xperimental treatment could potentially raise expens es and security conce rns for pr ison authori ties. These arguments are addressed w ith respect to th e third elem ent of the Safley test below. 254. See Kelly, supra note 131. 255. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.7(d)(1 )(1999). \"Charging for an in vestigational d rug in a clinical trial un der an IND is not perm itted w ithout the prior written appro val of FDA .

As disc ussed above , however, DHHS regulations implem ent multiple safeguards to protect prison populations. In light of these regulatory252 requirements and precautions, it will be difficult for prison authorities to justify complete denial of access to clinical trials as a reasonable antidote to prisoner abuse . 253 If promising treatment for a par ticular disease is available to the inmate only through an experimental study, as is often the case for AIDS patients, prisoners254 will have no alternative and no way to exercise their constitutional right to medical treatm ent o utside of the clinical trial. In some cas es, last-chanc e experimental therapies provid ed through clinical trials constitute the only meaning ful healthca re available to a terminally ill patient. Prison ers seek ing participation in such biomedical research w ill therefore be able to prevail with respect to the seco nd elem ent o f the Safley test.

In the past deca de, researche rs in Mary land and Colorado have in fact co nduc ted A IDS-related clinical trials at correctional facilities. At other locations, clinical studies have259 taken place at hospitals that provide routine medical services to prisoners and to whic h prisoners are tran sported for healthca re on a regular b asis.260 In addition, experience has show n tha t prison ers do not vie with on e another for the opportun ity to be re search subjects and that the re is often a dearth o f inmates w illing to participate in clinic al resea rch.

Prison authorities could ensure that an appropriately constituted I RB has approved th e propo sed clinical s tudy and that all othe r reg ulatory requ irements a re be ing followed by those conducting the research.

Altho ugh federal law perm its the in clusion of prisone rs in clinical trials in limited circumstances, state laws and correctional policies continue to prohib it prison ers' acc ess to biom edical studies in m any jurisdictions.274 Prisoners may challenge state laws or regulations barring access to clinical trials by asse rting that the state action violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. They may contend that the state is depriving them of the liberty to enjoy the benefits of clinical research or is endan gering their lives if it is preclud ing access to potentiall y life-saving treatm ent.

The prison ers in the Fante case argued that the proposed FDA regulations would de prive them of the liberty to enjoy the b enefits o f clinical research witho ut du e pro cess o f law and that they were denied the eq ual p rotection of the law becau se of their status as prisone rs.

It must b e noted, however, that it will be difficult t o establish the exis tence of a funda mental rig ht of access to clinic al trials fo r inc arcerated in dividuals. Although prisoners have a constitutional right to receive medical care in prison, no court has deemed this fundamental right to extend to282 nonc are not a mong the identified suspec t classes and thus are not entitled to height ened scrutiny unde r the Equal Pro tection Clause. State law s or correction al po licies283 prohibiting the participation of prisoners in biomedical studies would therefore be analyzed under the rational basis test. In defending a Fourteenth Amendment claim, the state would presumably argue th at its re ason for pre cluding prisoners from involvement in biom edical research is to pro tect them from coerced or uninform ed participation or from the abuse s of irrespon sible research. As discuss ed abov e, however, existing fede ral regulations provide n umerous safeg uards against res earch abuses so long as they are con scientiously implemented by IRBs. The regulations mandate that284 prisone rs can particip ate on ly in studies that will directly benefit the subject or the inmate population in general and prohib it prisoner involvement in nonth erapeu tic clinical trials. Moreover, the reg ulation s implement safeg uards285 relating to IRB review, selectio n of sub jects, inform ed c onsen t, an d the perfor mance of the experimentation. In light of these extensive federal286 regulations, it will be difficult fo r the state to establish that a complete b an on prisone r stud ies, includin g thos e with life- saving potential, bears a rat ional relationsh ip to the g oal o f providing prisoners with m eaning ful pro tection.

This argument, however, is destined to fail. Scho lars ha ve noted th at African A mericans and Hispanics c onstitute a disproportionately large percentage of the prison population, compared to their general popu lation ra tes. African Americans make up appro ximately of288 the U Hisp anics accou nt for fifteen percen t, while o nly twelve percent of the U.S. popu lation is Black, and eleven percen t is H ispanic. AIDS and othe r diseases also affect African Americans289 and Hispa nics disproportionately. As of June 1994, f ifty perc ent of al l AIDS290 patients were Black or Hisp anic. By 1998 Black s acc ounted for forty -nine291 percen t of AIDS deaths, and eighteen percent of AI DS deaths w ere am ong Hisp anics. Black men have a higher risk of cancer and c irrhosis of the liv er292 than non-African American m en, and Hispanics report higher rates of heart disease, cancer, and chron ic liv er dise ase th an do non-Hisp anics.293 No constitutio nal cla im can be based on these statistics. The C onstitution prohibits only purposeful discrimination, and facially neutral governmental actions cannot be constitutionally challenged using a disparate impa ct theory.294 Nevertheless, the fact that minorities are disproportionately affected by both imprisonm ent an d particular d iseases, provides a com pelling reason for the inclusion of inmates in clinical studies, as will be discussed in Part V.A bel ow. 2. The Right to Privacy .\u2014The co nstitutiona l right to privacy is somewhat amorpho us and may be rooted in a variety of provisions. The right to priv acy295 has been described most often as stemming from the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty. It may also be found in the Ninth Amendment's296 reserv ation of rights to the peop le. old v. C onne cticut , the Supreme297 298 Court determined that \"the First Amendment has a penumbra where privacy is protected from governm ental intrusion. \" The right to privacy also include s the299 right to be free from governmental surveillance and intrusion in one's private affairs, which stems from the Fourth Amendment.300508 INDIANA LAW RE VIEW [Vol. 33 :475 301.

See discussion supra Part III.The right to privacy generally encompasses the right to maintain confide ntiality regarding medical inform ation, and som e courts h ave held tha t even prisoners enjoy this right, particularly with respect to HIV status. Other301 courts have found, however, that inmates do not retain a constitutional right to the confidentiality of their medical records. Prisoners do, nonetheless, have302 a restricted constitutional right to bodily privacy.303 The Bailey court only briefly addressed the p rivacy issue . It foun d the304 plaintiffs' p rivacy claim s to be unfoun ded becau se the prison ers voluntee red fo r the experimental procedures at issue and were not subjected to involun tary treatm ent as was the case in the receden ts they cited. Likewise is hig hly unlikely that biom edical research will give rise to violation of constitutio nal p rivacy rights. A related but different claim may arise from the Fourth A mendm ent, whic h establishes \"[t]he right of the peo ple to be secure . . . against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" Invasive medical proced ures, such as blood tests, can306 constitute search es an d seizures that impinge upon the co nstitutiona l rights of the patient, even in the prison contex t. The Bailey court did not addres s any307 potential search and seizure claim s. Ne vertheless, if bodily fluids are ex tracted from prisoners w ho have not prov ided inform ed consen t, Fourth Amendm ent violations may arise. Clinical stu dies th at com ply with D HHS regulations requiring voluntarin ess an d inform ed consen t, howe ver, shou ld no t infring e upon any particip ant's rig ht to be free of unreaso nable searches and seizures. If prisoners provide genuine informed consent to biomedical experim entation, if th e stud y is th oroug hly reviewed by an IRB, and if the research conforms to the guidelines of fede ral reg ulations, then sufficien t safeguards will be implemented to assure that the subjects' rights to bodily integrity and privacy will not be sacrificed. Nevertheless, a significant concern exists th at ade quate confide ntiality regarding medical records may not b e maintained in the p rison setting . The DH HS regulations governing researc h involving inmates d o not ad dress the issu e of confide ntiality . As disc ussed308 below, precautions must be taken to assure confidentiality for inmate participan ts.2000 ] PRISONER PARTICIPATION IN CLINICAL TRI ALS 509 309. See Kelly, supra note 131, a t 60. 310.

V. POLICY ISSUES AND RECOMMENDAT IONS A. Several J urisdiction s Recogn ize the Importan ce of Inclu ding Prisoners in Clinical Trials In July 1995 the New Jersey Community Research Initiative issued a report entitled Prisoners with HIV: Guidelines for Implementing Clinical Trials in Correctiona l Setting s. The report found that \"[m ]any leaders in medical ethics310 have conclude d tha t the coerciv e nature o f correc tional s etting s sho uld n ot prevent prisoners from participating in medically appropriate clinical stu dies.\"311 It cited the fin dings of a 1989 consen sus panel of lead ers in correction s, prison health care, and public health that like wise found that \"althou gh a prison setting preclud es the voluntary and uncoerc ed choice classically envisioned by the federal regulations, prisoners should be permitted to choose to participate in therapeutic trials . . . that hold out the possibility of benefit.\" The report312 further noted that \"public health officials, including the World Health Organization and the fo rmer National Com mission on AIDS, have advocated prisone r acce ss to clinical re search. \"313 Including prisoners in biomedical studies is impo rtant for reasons that go beyond benefits to the sub jects th emselves. Traditionally , African A mericans, Hispanics, intravenous drug users, and women have been underrepresented in clinical trials.

The Challenges of Prisoner Involvement in Clinical Trials The com mentators who advocate the inclusion of prisoners in clinic al stud ies recognize the existence of certain obstacles inherent to the prison setting.335 Nevertheless, the obstac les are not insurm ountab le, as evid enced by the fact tha t research is suc cessfully conducted by som e institu tions, as discuss ed above. 1.

However, it su ggested several alternatives to safeguard338 the privacy of re search participants. Although it is not clear that prisoners retain a right to confidentiality regarding HIV status, every effort should be made to339 prevent d isclosure of inm the p risoners' constitutio nal rig hts to the extent they exist, will e ncou rage inm ates to particip ate in clinical trials, and w ill redu ce prisone r grievances and litigation regarding confidentiality matters.

Inmates should be allowed to communicate directly with investig ators a bout clinical trials without having to request perm ission from prison officials. Investigators could publicize the research through newsletters340 or postings that are seen by all inmates. En rollment could then occur during a routine medica l visit by the institution's staff rather than on a day specifically designated for discussion of the AIDS-related study.341 Moreov er, the F orum on Priso ner A ccess to Clinical Trials reco mmends that medical records that contain information about HIV status be mainta ined in secured areas that can be ac cessed only by medical personnel directly responsible for the inmate's treatm ent. Corre ctional officers and other in mates sh ould not342 have acc ess to sensitiv e medical records ev en if they are assig ned to work in the prison's medical department.343 Finally, the Forum suggests that prisoners also have confidential access to investig ators in the event th at they suffer adv erse sid e effects from investig ational drugs.

Thus,357 prison administrators will avoid potential violation of the inmates' Eighth Amendm ent rig ht to adequ ate medical care and will not jeopardiz e the prisone rs' health by sudden and unmonitored discontinuation of experimental treatment. Similarly , continu ity of care should be assured for priso ners w ho are p aroled or released.

The Office of the I nspec tor General also urg ed re search institutions363 to pro vide ad equate educa tion fo r IRB members c oncern ing ethica l issues and scientific questions and noted that currently IRB training is minimal to nonexistent.364 As discuss ed th roughout this A rticle, I RBs approving clinical trials inv olving prisone rs must m eet string ent req uirem ents th at are inapplica ble to reviews of other studies. The IRB must in clude a priso ner ad vocate, re view the p ropose d study in light of guidelines specific to the prison setting, and provide prisoners with data presented in language that they can understand. IRBs are therefore365 likely to rev iew protoco ls inv olving prisoners m ore m eticulous ly than they might review other research propo sals. Nevertheless, the comments o f the O ffice of Inspec tor General are prude nt admonitions for anyone reviewing research protoco ls des igned to inc lude prisone r particip ants.

CONCL USION Although federal regulations permit the inclusion of pr isoners in therapeutic clinical trials from which they may gain direct treatment benefits, prisoners are able to enroll in clinical trials in on ly a few locations. Although perhaps well-366 intentioned, policies that ban the inclusion of inmates in biomedical studies are detrim ental to priso ners, to scie nce, and to society at large because they prec lude research utilizing a particularly diverse and disadvantaged segment of society. In the words of Justice B randeis: Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Governm ent's p urpose s are benefice nt. M en born to freed om are naturally alert to repel in vasion of the ir liberty by evil-minded rulers. The g reatest dang ers to liberty lurk in insidiou s encroa chment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.367 Clinica l trials th at com ply with fed eral reg ulations will not v iolate an y of the participan ts' con stitutional rights. In Bailey v. Lally, the court found no368 constitutio nal v iolations despite extremely harsh priso n conditions that often motivated p risoner participation in research studies that were nonth erapeu tic and had not been scrutinized by a reviewing entity such as an IRB.
