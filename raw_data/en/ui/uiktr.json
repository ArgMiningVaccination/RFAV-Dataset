Detox diet includes fresh fruits, vegetables, juices, water.", "sitename": "Medindia.net", "date": "2016-04-07", "cleaned_text": "Cleanse Your Body with Detox Diet Detoxification is an alternative medicine approach and aims at eliminating toxins from the body. Toxins are accumulated harmful substances that exert undesirable effects on individuals health. Detoxification can be achieved with the help of saunas, massages, colonic irrigation, bowel enemas and diet. Detox diet is also called as a cleansing diet. Accumulation of toxins has hazardous effects on the body and therefore it is imperative to get rid of them. The idea is to eat pure and natural foods that aid the functioning of the lymph, kidneys and liver, and avoid all foods that hinder the smooth functioning of the body. While on [detox diet](https://www.medindia.net/patients/lifestyleandwellness/essential-foods-for-a-healthy-detox.htm) it is advised to eat more fruits and vegetables, drink plenty of water and cut down on junk food and processed foods. Caffeine and alcohol consumption is cut down. Therefore, detox diet also aids in weight loss. However, there is not enough evidence to prove that detox diets work. Many detox diet plans are nutritionally insufficient. Poor nutrition can lead to muscle loss, fatigue and irritability. Detox diet for a short period of time is harmless, but long-term use of this diet plan can cause health complications. How can Toxins Enter the Body? Toxins can enter the body from the food we eat and the air we breathe. Eating unhealthy foods that are high in fat, sugar, salt, additives and preservatives paves the way for toxins to build up in the body. We ingest pesticides from fruits, vegetables and grains. Smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption, prescription drugs also result in accumulation of toxins in the body. Our body brings in toxins and then processes those toxins through organs like liver and kidneys, and eliminate them in the form of sweat, urine, and feces. [Harmful Effects of the Toxins] Toxins buildup in the body can be indicated by a number of symptoms such as [bloating](https://www.medindia.net/slideshow/top-10-foods-that-cause-bloating-of-abdomen.asp), sinus congestion, indigestion, fatigue, headache, joint pain, weight gain, [insomnia](https://www.medindia.net/patients/patientinfo/insomnia.htm), irritability, dull skin, [constipation](https://www.medindia.net/homeremedies/constipation.asp), lowered immunity, cellulite formation and a general lack of wellbeing. Impaired detoxification can cause a number of diseases such as [fibromyalgia](https://www.medindia.net/medical-quiz/quiz-on-fibromyalgia.asp), Parkinson's disease, [chronic fatigue syndrome](https://www.medindia.net/patients/calculators/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-calculator.asp), arthritis, allergies, [thyroid heart disease. [What is the Detox Diet Plan?] The idea of detox diet plan is to eliminate the accumulated toxins and cleanse the body. It is a general belief that most food items are contaminated by various ingredients deemed unnecessary for human life, such as flavor enhancers, food colorings, and artificial preservatives. The detox diet aims at eliminating these toxins from the body. Although there are different types of detox diets, most of them involve giving up certain types of food for a couple of days and then gradually reintroducing them into your diet. This will cause the body to burn accumulated fats. Also, the limited [calorie intake](https://www.medindia.net/patients/calculators/daily-calorie-requirement-for-age-lifestyle.asp) leads to weight loss. A good detox diet should limit the intake of processed, high-fat and sugary foods and replaces them with more fruits and vegetables. [Food additives](https://www.medindia.net/patients/patientinfo/food-additives.htm) and preservatives in processed foods can cause food cravings, [food allergies](https://www.medindia.net/medical-quiz/test-your-knowledge-on-food-allergy.asp), poor digestive health and weight gain. The foods included and excluded can vary widely amongst different detox diets. But generally, fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds, herbal teas and increased amounts of water are allowed. In contrast, wheat, dairy, meat, fish, eggs, caffeine, alcohol, salt, sugar and processed foods are excluded. People on detox diets are also encouraged to chew their food thoroughly, to drink very little while eating, and to relax prior to each meal. Following are the list of foods to be included and avoided in the detox diet plan. Foods to Include: - Broccoli - Cauliflower - Cabbage - Garlic - Onion - Ginger - Lemon - Green Tea - Kale - Grape Fruit - Asparagus - Artichoke - Watercress - Avocado - Beet - Herbs Foods to Exclude: - Processed foods - Caffeinated beverages - Sweets, candies and chocolates - Red meat The scientific community is not convinced of the efficacy of detox diet. There is simply no scientific evidence to suggest that a healthy human body needs help to get rid of waste products. There is little proof to support the claims that detox diets work efficiently. Quite rightly, most nutritionists, dietitians and doctors believe that our body is completely capable of excreting waste without the aid of [detoxification](https://www.medindia.net/patients/lifestyleandwellness/juices-for-detoxification-and-wellbeing.htm) - that is what our liver, lungs, kidneys and skin are designed to do. Most experts also say that strict detox diets followed in the long-term, can lead to nutrient deficiencies and health problems associated with this. The detox diet will be beneficial only when it limits the intake of [processed foods](https://www.medindia.net/patients/patientinfo/processedfoods.htm) high in fat and sugar. This approach will help those who are living with high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure.
