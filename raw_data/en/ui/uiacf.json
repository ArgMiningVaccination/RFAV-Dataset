For the 7 duration of the update the core members of the Committee are joined by up to 5 additional 8 members who are have specific expertise in the topic being updated, hereafter referred to as 9 'topic expe rt members'. 10 In this document where 'the Committee' is referred to, this means the entire Committee, both 11 the core standing members and topic expert members. 12 Where 'standing committee members' is referred to, this means the core standing members 13 of the C ommittee only. 14 Where ' topic expert members' is referred to this means the recruited group of members with 15 topic expertise. 16 All of the core members and the topic expert members are fully voting members of the 17 Committee. 18 Details of the Committee membership and the NICE team can be found in appendix A. The 19 Committee members' declarat ions of interest can be found via appendix B. 20 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Summary section 8 1 Summary section 1 1.1 Update information 2 The NICE guideline on advanced breast cancer (NICE clinical guideline CG81) was reviewed 3 in November 2015 as part of NICE' s routine surveillance programme to decide whether it 4 required updating. 2 new studies (1 which was a pooled analysis of individual patient data 5 from 2 prospective studies and the other a prospective cohort study) were identified 6 examining discordance betw een primary and recurrent breast cancer in terms of oestrogen 7 receptor ( ER), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER -2) and progesterone receptor 8 (PR) status. The 2 studies found there could be discordance in receptor status between the 9 primary tumour and metastases, which led to altered management in 14.2 -20% of cases. 10 The topic experts agreed with the need to reassess receptor status on disease recurr ence. 11 They noted that the Breast Cancer Quality Standard (QS) already states that people with 12 recurrent disease (if clinically appropriate) have the ER and HER -2 status of the tumour 13 assessed. 14 It appears that the QS statement is supported by the evidence from the current surveillance 15 review . However it was recognised that the QS doesn't align with the current 16 recommendations in the clinical guideline - which state that, if disease recurs, further biopsy 17 just to reassess ER and HER -2 status should not be done. This area should therefore be 18 reviewed to see if the clinical guideline needs to be updated in light of the new evidence. The 19 existing quality standard will be reviewed in light of the guideline update. 20 The review question that the committee considered was: 21 1. In patients (women and men) with advanced breast cancera and ER/PR/ HER -2 status 22 known in primary tumour, does receptor status change on disease recurrence at any site? 23 24 The original guideline can be found here. 25 The full surveillance report can be found here. 26 Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Committee 27 makes a recommendation based on the trade -off between the benefits and harms of an 28 intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some 29 interventions, the Committee is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most 30 people would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this 31 guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the 32 recommendation). 33 For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is disc ussion with the person about the 34 risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion 35 aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision (see also 'Patient -centred care'). 36 Recommendations that must (or must not) be followed 37 We usually use 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. 38 Occasionally we use 'must' (or 'must not') if the consequences of not following the 39 recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threat ening. 40 a Advanced breast cancer defined as invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast of clinical stage 4 (i.e. with known metastatic disease). Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Summary section 9 Recommendations that should (or should not) be followed - a 'strong' 1 recommendation 2 We use 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when we are confident that, for 3 the vast majority of people, following a recommendation will do more go od than harm, and be 4 cost effective. We use similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer...') when we are 5 confident that actions will not be of benefit for most people. 6 Recommendations that could be followed 7 We use 'consider' when we are confident that following a recommendation will do more good 8 than harm for most people, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost 9 effective. The course of action is more likely to depend on the person's values and 10 preferences than for a strong recomm endation, and so the healthcare professional should 11 spend more time considering and discussing the options with the person. 12 1.2 Recommendations 13 1. On recurrence, consider reassessing oestrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER -2) sta tus if a change in receptor status will lead to a change in management. [2017] Replaced recommendation: 1.1.6 Patients with tumours of known oestrogen receptor (ER) status whose disease recurs should not have a further biopsy just to reassess ER status. [2009] 1.1.7 Patients with tumours of known human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER -2) status whose disease recurs should not have a further biopsy just to reassess HER -2 status. [2009] Deleted recommendations: 1.1.8 Assess ER and HER -2 status at th e time of disease recurrence if receptor status was not assessed at the time of initial diagnosis. In the absence of tumour tissue from the primary tumour, and if feasible, obtain a biopsy of a metastasis to assess ER and HER -2 status. [2009] 1.3 Patient -centred care 14 This guideline offers best practice advice on the care of patients (men and women) with 15 advanced breast tumour and ER/PR / HER -2 status known at first diagnosis. 16 People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed deci sions about their 17 care, as described in your care . 18 Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or 19 certainty) of our recommend ations, and has information about prescribing medicines 20 (including off -label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent 21 and ment al capacity), and safeguarding. 22 NICE has also produced guidance on the components of good patient e xperience in adult 23 NHS services. All healthcare professionals should follow the recommendations in Patien t 24 experience in adult NHS services . 25 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Summary section 10 1.4 Methods 1 This update was developed based on the process and methods described in Developing 2 NICE guidelines: the manual . 3 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 11 2 Evid ence review and recommendations 1 2.1 Introduction 2 The NICE guideline on advanced breast cancer (NICE clinical guideline CG81) was reviewed 3 in November 2015 as part of NICE's routine surveillance programme to decide whether it 4 required updating. 2 new studies (1 which was a pooled analysis of individual patient data 5 from 2 prospective studies and the other a prospective cohort study) were identified that 6 examin ed discordance between primary and recurrent breast cancer in terms of oestrogen 7 (ER), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER -2) and progesterone (PR) receptor 8 status. The 2 studies found there could be discordance in receptor status between the 9 primary tumour and metastases, which led to altered management in 14.2 -20% of cases. 10 2.2 Review question 11 In patients (women and men) with advanced breast cancerb and ER/PR/ HER -2 status known 12 in the primary tumour, does receptor status change on disease recurrence at any site? 13 14 It became apparent during the course of this update that the above review question car ried 15 forward from the original guideline should contain more than whether the receptor status can 16 change on recurrence - specifically, it should consider whether it is worth re -biopsying 17 patients with loco -regional or distant recurrence. This depends on th e likelihood of change in 18 receptor status , the direction of change, the cost and benefits of alternative treatments and 19 the cost impact , especially if a patient switches from HER -2 negative to HER -2 positive for 20 which there are tailored management options. Hence, t he review question answered in this 21 update (and to be carried forward in any future updates) was: 22 What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of retesting receptor status on disease recurrence 23 in patients with advanced breast cancer? 24 The evidence search that was run for this update was not re -run after the review question 25 was revised. This was because it was not anticipated that any additional relevant evidence 26 would be identified , because the committee noted that there are unlikely to be randomised 27 controlled trials in this area . The studies identified in the update searches provided sufficient 28 material in terms of the outcomes prioritised by the topic experts. 29 2.3 Clinical evidence review 30 A systematic search was conducted (see appendix D) which identified 7,240 articles. The 31 titles and abstracts were screened and 79 articles were identified as potentially relevant 32 (including 17 studies from the original guideline) . Full -text versions of these articles were 33 obtained and reviewed against the c riteria specified in the review protocol (appendix C). Of 34 these, 20 were excluded as they did not meet the criteria and 59 studies met the criteria and 35 were included. 36 A review flowchart is provided in appendix E, and the excluded studies (with reasons for 37 exclusion) are shown in appendix F. 38 b Advanced breast cancer defined as invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast of clinical stage 4 (i.e. with known metastatic disease). Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 12 2.3.1 Methods 1 For a summary of the review protocol and methods, please refer to Appendix C: 2 The committee agreed at the first committee meeting that studies assessing change in 3 receptor status in locoregional metastases only should not be considered for inclusion for the 4 following reasons. 5 surgery is often the standard of care so this information would not help with 'change 6 in treatment' outcome. 7 locoregional metastases routinely are biopsied in clinical practice at the moment 8 It was , however , decided as a post -hoc analysis that data relating to a change in direction of 9 HER -2 status needed to be extracted to feed into the healt h economic model. For breast 10 cancer, it is known that ER/PR/ HER -2 status may differ between primary and recurrent 11 tumours. Of these markers, a change in HER -2 status has the largest impact on change in 12 management, as HER -2-positive tumours are indicated fo r treatment with trastuzumab , 13 which makes treatment of HER -2-positive cancer substantially more expensive . This data 14 was extracted as a post -hoc analysis for both the locoregional and distant subgroups. For 15 results of this post -hoc analysis, please see Appendix I: Appendix I: 16 Overall summary of evidence 17 The 59 included studies covered r ecurrences in the following regions : 18 Dista nt metastases only: 19 new studies plus 6 studies from original guideline - 25 19 included studies in total . 20 Mixed locoregional and distant metastases: 28 new studies, 2 studies from the 21 original guideline - 30 included studies in total. 22 Both distant metastases and mixed locoregional and distant metastases: 2 new 23 studies, 2 studies from the original guideline - 4 included studies in total. 24 Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low . Typical reasons for d owngrading included 25 baseline demographics being poorly reported (and therefore it not being possible to assess 26 how homogenous the populations were) , not all eligible patients ha ving tissues samples fo r 27 both primary tumour and recurrence , and it not being p ossible for imprecision to be 28 quantitatively assessed. 29 For a summary of included studies please see Table 1 (for the full evidence tables and full 30 GRADE profiles please see Appendix G: and G.2.34 ). 31 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 13 Table 1: Summary of included studies examining distant recurrences 1 Study reference Study population and time between primary diagnosis and recurrence Method used to analyse receptor status Outcomes reported Comments Aurilio 2013 Breast cancer patients with suspected bone metastases .

Guideline recommendations should be based on the expected 5 costs of the different options in relation to their expected health benefits rather than the total 6 implementation cost. 7 Evidence on cost effectiveness related to the key clinical issues being addressed in the 8 guideline update w as sought. The health economist undertook a systematic review of the 9 published economic li terature . 10 Economic literature search 11 A systematic literature search was undertaken to identify health economic evidence within 12 published literature relevant to the review questions. The evidence was identified by 13 conducting a broad search in the NHS Econom ic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and the 14 Health Technology Assessment database (HTA). The search also included Medline and 15 Embase databases using an economic filter. Studies published in languages other than 16 English were not reviewed. The health economic s earch strategie s are detailed in A ppendix 17 J. 18 The health economist also sought out relevant studies identified by the surveillance review or 19 Committee members. 20 Economic literature review 21 The health economist: 22 Identified potentially relevant studies for each review question from the economic search 23 results by reviewing titles and abstracts. Full papers were then obtained. 24 Reviewed full papers against pre -specified inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify 25 relevant studies. 26 Critically appraised relevant stu dies using the economic evaluations checklist as specified 27 in Developing NICE Guidelines: the manual . 28 Generated summaries of the evidenc e in economic evidence profiles. 29 Inclusion and Exclusion criteria 30 Full economic evaluations (studies comparing costs and health consequences of alternative 31 courses of action: cost -utility, cost -effectiveness, cost -benefit and cost -consequence 32 analyses) and comparative costing studies that address the review question in the relevant 33 population were considered potentially inc ludable as economic evidence. 34 Studies that only reported burden of disease or cost of illness were excluded. Literature 35 reviews, abstracts, posters, letters, editorials, comment articles, unpublished studies and 36 studies not in English were excluded. 37 Remain ing studies were prioritised for inclusion based on their relative applicability to the 38 development of this guideline and the study limitations. For example, if a high quality, directly 39 applicable UK analysis was available, then other less relevant studies may not have been 40 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 26 included. Where selective exclusions occurred on this basis, this is noted in the excluded 1 economic studies table (appendix L). 2 For more details about the assessment of applicability and methodological quality see the 3 economic evaluation checklist contained in Appendix H of Developing NICE Guidelines: the 4 manual . 5 Undertaking new health economic analysis 6 As well as reviewing the published economic literature for each review question, new 7 economic analysis was undertaken by the health econo mist. 8 The following general principles were adhered to in developing the cost -effectiveness 9 analysis: 10 Methods were consistent with the NICE reference case as far as possible 11 The Committee was involved in the design of the model, selection of inputs and 12 interpretation of results. 13 Model inputs were based on the systematic review of the clinical literature supplemented 14 with other published data sources where possible. 15 When published data were not available, Committee expert opinion was used to populate 16 the mo del. 17 Model inputs and assumptions were reported fully and transparently. 18 The results were subject to sensitivity analysis and limitations were discussed. 19 The model was quality assured by another health economist within NICE's Centre for 20 Clinical Practice. 21 Full methods for the cost -effectiveness analysis conducted for this guideline are described in 22 the Economic Modelling section . 23 Cost -effectiveness criteria 24 NICE's report Social value judgements: principles for the development of NICE guidance 25 sets out the p rinciples that GDGs should consider when judging whether an intervention 26 offers good value for money. In general, an intervention was considered to be cost effective if 27 either of the following criteria applied (given that the estimate was considered plausi ble): 28 the intervention dominated other relevant strategies (that is, it was both less costly in 29 terms of resource use and more clinically effective compared with all the other relevant 30 alternative strategies), or 31 the intervention cost less than \u00a320,000 per QALY gained compared with the next best 32 strategy. 33 If the Committee recommended an intervention that was estimated to cost more than 34 \u00a320,000 per QALY gained, or did not recommend one that was estimated to cost less than 35 \u00a320,000 per QALY gained, the reasons for this decision are discussed explicitly in the 36 'evidence to recommendations' section of the relevant chapter, with reference to issues 37 regarding the plausibility of the estimate or to the factors set out in Social value judgements: 38 principles for the d evelopment of NICE guidance . As the evaluation in this analysis was a 39 cost consequences analysis rather than a cost utility analysis, outputs were reported in terms 40 of incremental cost per breast cancer case prevented, rather than the incremental cost per 41 QALY. Therefore, results were not directly comparable to a \u00a320,000 per QALY threshold. 42 However, the analysis did present results in terms of the QALY gain required per breast 43 cancer case averted in order for each intervention to be cost effective at a \u00a320, 000 threshold. 44 This allowed committee members to assess the likely cost effectiveness of interventions 45 according to their experience of the disease area. 46 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 27 In the absence of economic evidence 1 When no relevant economic studies were found from the economic l iterature review, and de 2 novo modelling was not feasible or prioritised, the Committee made a qualitative judgement 3 about cost -effectiveness by considering expected differences in resource use between 4 options and relevant UK NHS unit costs, alongside the r esults of the clinical review of 5 effectiveness evidence. The UK NHS costs reported in the guideline were those presented to 6 the Committee and they were correct at the time recommendations were drafted; they may 7 have been revised subsequently by the time of publication. However, we have no reason to 8 believe they have been changed substantially. 9 2.4.2 Results of the economic literature review 10 The search returned 1659 articles, four of which were ordered after screening of based on 11 title and abstract. All four were excluded on screening of full text. The flowchart summarising 12 the number of studies included and excluded at each stage of the review process can be 13 found in appendix L. 14 Appendix M: contains a list of excluded studies and the reason for their exclusion. 15 2.4.3 Economic modelling 16 2.4.3.1 Introduction 17 For breast cancer, the evidence review for this update showed that ER/PR/ HER -2 status 18 may differ between primary and recurrent tumours. Of these markers, a change in HER -2 19 status has the largest impact on change in management, as HER -2-positive tumours are 20 responsive to treatment with trastuzumab , and other therapies such as pertuzu mab and 21 trastuzumab emtansine. The objective of this simple analysis is to estimate the cost 22 effectiveness of testing HER -2 status in recurrent breast cancer for both locoregional and 23 distant metastatic tumours, compared to no testing. Cost effectiveness o f changes in ER and 24 PR status were not assessed explicitly, as differences in treatments (and resulting costs) are 25 primarily determined by HER -2 status. 26 2.4.3.2 Methods 27 2.4.3.2.1 Model structure 28 For each recurrent tumour type (locoregional and distant metastatic), decision trees were 29 constructed for two subpopulations: patients with a HER -2-positive primary tumour and 30 patients with a HER -2-negative primary tumour, shown in Figure 1 and Error! Reference 31 source no t found. . For each tree, in the 'test HER -2 status' arm, all patients diagnosed with 32 a HER -2-positive tumour were treated with trastuzumab, while patients with HER -2-negative 33 tumours did not receive trastuzumab. The assumption was made that HER -2 status testing is 34 100% accurate in the model . In the 'do not test HER -2 status arm' patients were treated 35 according to their primary tumour status - patients with a HER -2-positive primary tumour 36 were all treated with trastuzumab, and vice versa. 37 To calculate cost effectiveness, costs and QALY outcomes comparing treatment of HER -2- 38 positive tumours with and without trastuzumab from the literature and relevant technology 39 appraisals were appended to the terminal nodes of the decision tree. For patients with HER - 40 2-negative tumours it was assumed that treatment costs were equivalent to those of patients 41 with HER -2-positive tumours (dependent on whether patients received trastuzumab or not). 42 Conversely, it was assumed that patients with HER -2-negative tumou rs had the same 43 number of QALYs whether they received trastuzumab or not. 44 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 28 Figure 1: Decision tree for patients with HER -2-positive primary tumour 1 2 Figure 2: Decision tree for patients with HER -2-negative primary tumour 3 4 For each recurrent tumour type, a third decision tree (shown in Figure 3 ) was constructed to 5 calculate the overall cost effectiveness of HER -2 testing for the entire population (both 6 patients with HER -2-positive and HER -2-negative primary tumours) by combining the outputs 7 of the first two decision trees. 8 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 29 Figure 3: Decision tree for all patients ( HER -2-positive and HER -2-negative primary 1 tumour) 2 3 In order to assess the overall cost effectiveness of HER -2 status tes ting across patients with 4 either type of recurrent cancer, results were also combined using an estimate of the relative 5 proportion of patients with locoregional and distant metastatic breast cancer. 6 2.4.3.2.2 Probabilities 7 Probabilities used to inform the model are shown in Table 2 . These values were calculated 8 via meta -analyses of values from studies included in the clinical literature review, using all 9 studies which reported data on HER -2 status for locoregional and distant metastatic 10 populations separately. This was achieved using a Bayesian predictive distribution calculated 11 via WinBUGS software, consistent with the advice in the NICE DS U Technical Support 12 Document 5 (Dias et al, 2011) . A predictive distribution captures uncertainty by producing 13 estimates of unob served future observations and therefore generally produces wider 14 confidence intervals than a posterior distribution. 15 To assess the overall cost effectiveness of HER -2 status testing across patients with either 16 type of recurrent cancer, an estimate of 56% for the proportion of patients with locoregional 17 cancer was derived from studies included in the clinical review which included both 18 locoregional and distant metastatic cancers, and reported the number of patients with each 19 type of cancer. This was again achieved via a meta -analysis using a Bayesian predictive 20 distribution. 21 Table 2: Probabilities used to inform decision trees 22 Locoregional metastases (95% CIs) Distant metastases (95% CIs) Clinical Guideline (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 30 2.4.3.2.3 Costs of biopsy and HER -2 testing 1 Costs of biopsy for distant metastatic cancer and HER -2 tests are displayed in Table 3 . The 2 cost of biopsy was calculated by taking an averag e of costs of biopsy procedures for 3 common distant metastasis locations from the NHS National Schedule of Reference costs 4 2015 -16 (percutaneous biopsy of lesion of pleura, transvascular bio psy of lesion of liver, percutaneous punch 6 biopsy of lesion of liver [19 years and over] , and image guided biopsy of lesion of bone). The 7 cost of biopsy was not included for locoregional breast cancer, as patients are generally 8 biopsied as standard practic e for reasons other than assessing HER -2 status. 9 The assumption was made that (for both locoregional and distant metastatic cancer) HER -2 10 status is tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the first instance, with 25% of patients 11 requiring fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) as a confirmatory test. 12 Table 3: Costs of biopsy and HER -2 status tests 13 Category Cost Source Biopsy of distant metastases \u00a3885 NHS National (FISH) \u00a3120 Price charged for FISH at University College London *Calculated from a simple mean of percutaneous biopsy of lesion of pleura, of lesion of liver, percutaneous punch biopsy of les ion of liver 15 (19 years and over) , and image guided biopsy of lesion of bone 16 2.4.3.2.4 Costs and QALYs of breast cancer treatment 17 For distant metastatic cancer, discount ed lifetime costs and QALYs of treatment with and 18 without trastuzamab combination therapy were taken from the manufacturer's submission for 19 TA34 (guidance on the use of trastuzumab for the treatment of advanced breast cancer). 20 These values are shown in Table 4 , along with life years for each strategy, for reference 21 purposes. 22 Table 4: Costs, QALYs, and life years for treatm ent of advanced HER -2 positive breast 23 cancer with and without trastuzumab combination therapy from 24 manufacturer's submission for TA34 25 Cost QALYs Life years locoregional cancer, costs and QALYs of treatment with and without trastuzumab were 26 taken from an economic evaluation of trastuzumab for early stage breast cancer (Hall et al, 27 2010). These values are shown in Table 5 (again, along with life years for r eference 28 purposes). 29 Table 5: Costs, QALYs, and life years for treatment of early HER -2 positive breast 30 cancer with and without trastuzumab from Hall et al (2010).

In addition, threshold analyses were carried out to quantify the 11 proportion of patients changing status required for testing patients with a HER -2-positive 12 primary tumour to no longer be cost saving. 13 Cost of HER -2 status testing: In order to reflect that some centres use dual-colour dual - 14 hapten brightfield in situ hybridisation ( DDISH ) testing, rather than FISH, as a confirmatory 15 test, an analysis in which a plausible lower bound cost of \u00a3 90 for DDISH was conducted 16 The following sensi tivity analyses were conducted for the distant metastatic population: 17 Cost of biopsy: Since biopsy costs vary greatly according to the location of metastasis, 18 sensitivity analyses were carried out in which the midpoint between the lowest value and 19 the mea n (\u00a3779), and the highest value and the mean (\u00a31,068) were used for the cost of 20 biopsy. 21 No biopsy cost: The cost of biopsy was removed, to represent a scenario in which patients 22 with distant metastatic cancer are biopsied by default. 23 Biopsy cost halved: Th e cost of biopsy was set to a value of \u00a3443, in order to reflect a 24 scenario in which half of patients with distant metastatic cancer are biopsied by default. 25 For the locoregional population a sensitivity analysis was conducted in which cost and QALY 26 outcom es of TA34 (for advanced breast cancer) were used instead of the Hall et al (2010) 27 values for early breast cancer. 28 2.4.3.3 Results 29 2.4.3.3.1 Distant metastatic cancer 30 Cost effectiveness results for patients with distant metastatic breast cancer are shown in 31 Error! Reference source not found. . These results show that, for patients with a HER -2- 32 positive primary tumour, HER -2 testing dominates no testing. This is because the cost of 33 HER -2 testing is more than offset by the cost saving of preventing patients with HER -2- 34 negative tumours from unnecessarily being treated with trastuzamab. However, testing 35 patients with a HER -2-negative primary tumour results in an ICER of \u00a356,116/QALY, as this 36 strategy is associated with both the additional cost of testing for HER -2 status, as well as 37 treating patients with HER -2-positive tumours with trastuzamab. The ICER for testing all 38 patients' HER -2 status is somewhat lower - \u00a334,992/QALY - due to cos ts being partially 39 offset by the savings from patients with HER -2-positive primary tumours. 40 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 32 Table 6: Cost effectiveness results for patients with distant metastatic cancer 1 Patient group Incremental cost (HER -2 testing versus no tes ting) Incremental QALYs (HER -2 testing versus no testing) ICER ( HER -2 testing versus no testing) HER -2-positive primary tumour -\u00a32,669 0 HER -2 testing dominates no testing HER -2-negative primary tumour \u00a32,611 0.04 \u00a356,116 All patients \u00a31,190 0.03 2.4.3.3.2 Locoregional cancer 2 Results for patients with locoregional recurrent breast cancer are shown Error!

Both sets of results show that testing HER -2 status in patients with a HER -2- 5 positive primary tumour dominates no testing, due to cost savings from prevention of treating 6 HER -2-negative tumours with trastuzamab. ICERs for testing HER -2 status in patients with 7 HER -2-negative primary tumours are considerably lower than those of the distant metastatic 8 cancer population (\u00a327,387/QALY). This is primarily due to biopsy costs not being included 9 for locoregional cancer patient s (due to biopsies being carried out routinely in this population 10 for reasons other than assessing HER -2 status ). ICERs of the locoregional cancer population 11 overall (\u00a37,602/QALY) are similarly lower than those of the distant metastatic population, and 12 indicate that testing HER -2 status is likely to be cost effective if the population is considered 13 as a whole. 14 Table 7: Cost effectiveness results for patients with locoregional cancer 15 Patient group Incremental cost (HER -2 testing versus no testing) Incremental QALYs (HER -2 testing versus no testing) ICER ( HER -2 testing versus no testing) HER -2-positive primary tumour -\u00a31,583 0 HER -2 testing dominates no testing HER -2-negative primary tumour \u00a31,140 0.04 \u00a327,387 All patients \u00a3208 0.03 \u00a37,602 2.4.3.3.3 Combined population 16 Table 8 shows the cost effectiveness results for distant metastatic and locoregional 17 populations combined. As in the in dividual subpopulations , testing patients with a HER -2- 18 positive primary tumour dominates no testing. Testing patients with a HER -2-negative 19 primary tumour results in an ICER of \u00a341,501 compared to no testing, while testing for the 20 whole population with rec urrent breast cancer has an ICER of \u00a321,058. 21 Table 8: Cost effectiveness results for distant metastatic and locoregional populations 22 combined 23 Patient group Incremental cost (HER -2 testing versus no testing) Incremental QALYs (HER -2 testing versus no testing) ICER ( HER -2 testing versus no testing) HER -2-positive primary tumour -\u00a31,995 0 HER -2 testing dominates no testing HER -2-negative primary tumour \u00a31,822 0.04 \u00a341,501 All patients \u00a3638 0.03 \u00a321,058 24 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 33 2.4.3.3.4 Sensitivity analysis 1 Sensitivity analysis results for patients with distant metastatic cancer are shown in Table 9, 2 and results for patients with locoregional cancer are shown in Table 10. Sensitivity analysis 3 results for the two populations combined are shown in Table 11. 4 For patients with distant metastatic cancer, results show that retesting receptor status in 5 patients with a HER -2-positive primary tumour remains dominant over no testing in all 6 scenarios. Contrastingly, the ICER of retesting in patients with a HER -2-negative tumour 7 varies quite considerably in a number of scenarios. Specifically, the ICER is considerably 8 reduced when the cost of biopsy is removed or halved , showing that retesting HER -2 status 9 is substantially more cost effective if patients are alr eady receiving a biopsy as a matter of 10 standard procedure. The ICER is also sensitive to variation in the proportion of patients 11 changing HER -2 status. Changing the cost of biopsy to plausible lower and upper bounds 12 also affects the ICER, but to a lesser d egree. Results are relatively insensitive to a change in 13 the cost of FISH. 14 For patients with locoregional cancer, results are most sensitive to using cost and QALY 15 outcomes from TA34 (advanced breast cancer) rather than from Hall et al (2010). This 16 result s in a substantial increase in the ICER of retesting in patient s with a HER -2-negative 17 primary tumour to \u00a337,239/QALY, although retesting in patients with a HER -2-positive 18 primary tumour remains dominant over no testing. Comparatively, results are insensit ive to 19 variations in the proportion of patients changing HER -2 status and the cost of FISH. 20 Table 9: Sensitivity analysis results for patients with distant metastatic cancer 21 Scenario ICER for HER -2- positive primary tumour ICER for HER-2- negative primary tumour ICER for all patients Base case HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a356,116 \u00a334,992 Proportion of patients changing HER -2 status halved HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a376,536 \u00a362,934 Proportion of patients changing HER -2 status doubled HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a345,907 \u00a321,022 Cost of FISH set to \u00a390 HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a355,955 \u00a334,772 Cost of biopsy set to \u00a3779 HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a353,831 \u00a331,864 Cost of biopsy set to \u00a31,068 HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a360,054 \u00a340,380 No cost of biopsy HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a337,094 \u00a38,962 Cost of biopsy halved HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a346,605 \u00a321,977 Table 10: Sensitivity analysis results for patients with locoregional cancer 22 Scenario ICER for HER -2- positive primary tumour ICER for HER -2- negative primary tumour ICER for all patients Base case HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a327,387 \u00a37,602 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 34 Scenario ICER for HER -2- positive primary tumour ICER for HER -2- negative primary tumour ICER for all patients Proportion of patients changing HER -2 status halved HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a328,948 \u00a39,975 Proportion of patients changing HER -2 status doubled HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a326,607 \u00a36,415 Cost of FISH set to \u00a370 HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a327,087 \u00a37,146 Cost and QALY outcomes used from TA34 HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a337,239 \u00a39,572 Table 11: Sensitivity analysis results for distant metastatic and locoregional 1 populations combined 2 Scenario ICER for HER -2- positive primary tumour ICER for HER -2- negative primary tumour ICER for all patients Base case HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a341,501 \u00a321,058 Proportion of patients changing HER -2 status halved HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a352,327 \u00a335,993 Proportion of patients changing HER -2 status doubled HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a336,088 \u00a313,591 Cost of FISH set to \u00a390 HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a341,331 \u00a320,811 Cost of biopsy set to \u00a3779 HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a340,378 \u00a319,522 Cost of biopsy set to \u00a31,068 HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a343,436 \u00a323,705 No cost of biopsy HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a332,156 \u00a38,270 Cost of biopsy halved HER -2 testing dominates no testing \u00a336,829 \u00a314,664 3 Threshold analysis of the proportion of patients changing HER -2 status showed that , for 4 retesting to no longer dominate no testing in patients with a HER -2-positive primary tu mour, 5 the proportion changing from HER -2-positive to HER -2-negative status would have to be 6 below 5. 4% for patients with distant metastases, and below 3.7% for patients with 7 locoregional recurrence. Since these values are very substantially lower than the estimates 8 used in the base case, this reinforces the robustness of the cost effectiveness of retesti ng 9 receptor status in patients with a HER -2-positive primary tumour. 10 2.4.3.4 Discussion 11 In patients with locoregional recurrent breast cancer results indicate that, for the population 12 as a whole and for the subgroup of patients with HER -2-positive primary tumours, testing 13 HER -2 status is likely to be cost effective, as ICERs are well below \u00a320,000/QALY for results 14 using both sets of cost and QALY outputs. For the subgroup of patients with HER -2-negative 15 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 35 primary tumours, the ICER is considerably higher ( \u00a327,387 ), due to additional costs of HER - 1 2 status testing and of treating the identified HER -2-positive patients with trastuzumab. 2 However, it should be noted that this value is not substantially higher than the ICER for 3 treating patients with known HER -2-positiv e status (\u00a325,826/QALY). Therefore, considering 4 that NICE recommends trastuzumab in TA107 and TA34 , and therefore considers it to be a 5 cost effective treatment for early and advanced breast cancer, it is also likely that testing 6 HER -2 status in locoregiona lly recurrent cancer is also cost -effective. 7 In patients with distant metastatic cancer, base case results show that ICERs for both the 8 population as a whole and for the subgroup of patients with HER -2-negative primary tumour 9 are considerably higher than those for locoregionally recurrent cancer ( \u00a334,992 and \u00a356,116 , 10 respectively). This is largely due to the additional cost of biopsy, as patients with distant 11 metastatic cancer are not routinely biopsied, and the higher ICER for trastuzumab in patients 12 with advanced breast cancer (aroun d \u00a335,700 /QALY) . It should be noted, however, that this 13 analysis potentially overestimates ICERs for the distant metastatic population, as the 14 appraisal committee for TA34 noted that the manufacturer's submission likely 15 undere stimates the QALY gain s produced by trastuzumab due to underestimation of the 16 survival benefit provided by trastuzumab (although an alternative ICER was not provided). 17 Sensitivity analysis results show that ICERs for distant metastatic patients with a HER -2- 18 negative primary tumour are particularly sensitive to changes in the proportion of patients 19 changing HER -2 status. However, ICERs are not changed to a degree that is likely to affect 20 decision making. Furthermore, threshold analysis has shown that the pr oportion of patients 21 changing HER -2 status would have to be substantially lower for retesting to no longer 22 dominate no testing in patients with a HER -2-positive primary tumour, demonstrating that the 23 cost effectiveness of retesting in these patients is rob ust. Removing the cost of biopsy for the 24 distant metastatic cancer subgroup results in a substantially lower ICER of \u00a337,094. While 25 this value is still higher than the conventional NICE upper threshold for cost effectiveness, 26 the same consideration applies as with the equivalent locoregional population: since the 27 ICER for trastuzumab in TA34 is around \u00a335,700/QALY, if the treatment is accepted to be 28 cost effective it is highly likely that retesting in this population is also cost effective for 29 patients who would receive a biopsy regardless of intention to test HER -2 status. 30 Sensitivity analyses in patients with locoregional cancer show that ICERs are relatively 31 stable, with the exception of the scenario in which costs and QALY outcomes from TA34 are 32 used in place of the Hall et al (2010) values, which produces an ICER of \u00a337,239 for patients 33 with a HER -2-negative primary tumour. For this result, the previous argument applies that if 34 trastuzumab is considered cost effective at an ICER of \u00a335,700/QALY, it is al so likely that 35 testing HER -2 status is also cost effective, even in this conservative scenario. 36 Finally, the scenario combining results for both locoregional and distant metastatic cancer 37 shows that considering the entire population produces an ICER of \u00a32 1,058 for HER -2 testing, 38 compared to no testing. This indicates that, if this perspective is taken, HER -2 testing is likely 39 to be cost effective, as the ICER is lower than that of treating patients with confirmed HER -2- 40 positive status with trastuzumab comp ared to treatment without trastuzumab. 41 It should be noted that this model simplifies clinical reality in a number of key ways. First, in 42 practice, other treatments besides trastuzumab are provided to patients with HER -2-positive 43 breast cancer, such as per tuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine. Due to these treatments 44 being compared to trastuzumab, rather than to no treatment, in the relevant technology 45 appraisals, including them in the economic analysis was not practical. However, it is 46 reasonable to assume tha t including these treatments in the analysis would increase the 47 mean cost of treatment for HER -2 positive patients due to the extra drug cost, and therefore 48 increase the overall cost of testing patients with a HER -2-negative primary tumour. The effect 49 on ICERs is less clear, but given an ICER of \u00a323,467 for pertuzumab and trastuzumab 50 compared to trastuzumab alone (evidence review group's base case ICER for TA424) and 51 an ICER of \u00a3166,400 for trastuzumab emtansine after treatment with trastuzumab (evidence 52 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 36 review group's base case ICER for TA371), it is likely that including these treatments in the 1 analysis would respectively slightly lower and substantially increase the ICER for testing 2 HER -2-negative patients. 3 Second, it is likely that, in reality, HER -2-negative patients treated as if they were HER -2 4 positive would not have identical QALY outcomes to appropriately treated HER -2-negative 5 patients. This is because of the toxicity associated with trastuzumab, and also due to those 6 patients foregoing other ma nagement options specific to their disease status . Third, a 7 substantial proportion of patients with distant metastatic cancer are biopsied independently of 8 the intention of testing HER -2 status in practice , meaning that the model underestimates the 9 cost effectiveness of retesting receptor status in patients with distant metastatic cancer , 10 although, as noted above, even if all patients receive a biopsy as standard practice the ICER 11 is still only reduced to \u00a337,094/QALY. Fourth, the analysis does not consid er the quality of 12 life decrement or risks associated with biopsy procedures, although, due to the short duration 13 of biopsy, the effect on total QALYs is unlikely to be substantial. 14 In summary, despite the limitations of the analysis, it is likely that tes ting of HER -2 status is 15 cost effective in patients with locoregionally recurrent breast cancer, providing that these 16 patients are biopsied as part of routine practice. For patients with distant metastatic breast 17 cancer, testing HER -2 status in patients wit h HER -2-positive primary tumours is also likely to 18 be cost effective, although the cost effectiveness of testing in patients with HER -2-negative 19 primary tumours, and for the population as a whole is ambiguous. The key driver of this 20 difference is the addit ional cost of biopsy associated with distant metastatic cancer, and the 21 lower cost effectiveness of treating patients with distant metastatic cancer with trastuzumab. 22 2.4.4 Unit costs 23 Basic unit costs related to this review question are detailed in Table 12. 24 Table 12: Unit costs 25 Code Description Unit cost YJ01Z Bilateral Core Needle Biopsy of Lesions of Breasts \u00a3380.13 YJ02Z Unilateral Core Needle Biopsy of Lesion of Breast \u00a3302.92 YJ03Z Core Needle Biopsy of Lesion of Breast and Associated Lymph Nodes \u00a3534.09 YJ04Z Core Needle Biopsy of Axillary Lymph Nodes \u00a31,523.50 YJ05Z Bilateral Fine Needle Aspiration of Lesions of Breasts \u00a3239.07 YJ06Z Unilateral Fine Needle Aspiration of Lesion of Breast \u00a3234.24 YJ07Z Fine Needle Aspiration of Lesion of Breast and Associated Lymph Nodes \u00a3368.76 YJ08Z Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology of Axillary Lymph Nodes \u00a3283.87 YJ09Z Vacuum Assisted Biopsy Lesio of Breast Wire of Breast \u00a3608.02 Colonoscopy with 19 and over \u00a3604.02 FZ55Z Diagnostic Flexible Sigmoidoscopy with Biopsy, 19 years and over \u00a3480.76 FZ61Z Diagnostic Endoscopic Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Procedures with Biopsy, 19 years and over \u00a3469.18 FZ64A Combined Upper and Lower Gastrointestinal Tract Diagnostic Endoscopic Procedures with Biopsy, 19 \u00a3507.97 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 37 Code Description Unit cost MA37Z Transvaginal Ultrasound Lesion of Liver, 19 and over \u00a3716.83 Image Guided Biopsy of Image Guided \u00a31,452.61 YL20A Percutaneous Needle Biopsy of Lesion of Kidney, 19 years and over \u00a3920.70 2.5 Evidence statements 1 2.5.1 Clinical evidence statement 2 59 studies examined changes in receptor expression between primary tumour and recurrent 3 samples. 4 For the studies assessing distant recurrences, the median change in ER ( 19 studies , 5 n=1,496), PR (1 7 studies , n=1,302 ) and HER -2 (23 studies , n=1, 687) receptor expression 6 was 18. 1% 22. 5%) 7 respectively. The evidence was of very low quality. 8 1 study (n=107) reported on change in management in those with ER discordance (59.1%), 2 9 studies (n=144) reported change in management in those with HER -2 discordance (50 to 10 66.7%) , 2 studies (n=284 ) reported change in management in those with ER/PR/ HER -2 11 discordance (12.1% to 25% ) and 1 study (n=58) reported change in management in those 12 with ER and/or PR discordance (40.7%). The evidence was of very low quality. 13 1 study (n=9) reported on complications of biopsy of distant metastases - 1 of 9 subjects 14 developed a haematoma in the left iliac biopsy site. 15 For the studies assessing mixed locoregional and distant recurrences, the median change in 16 ER (26 studies , n=3,890 ), PR ( 19 studies , HER -2 (23 studies , n=1,398 ) 17 receptor expression was 20.1% 53.6); 26.1% (16.3 to 54.2) and 9.9% (0 to 18 22.4) respectively. One additional study (n=35) reported a change in ER or PR receptor 19 expression of 31.4%. The evidence was of ver y low quality. 20 3 studies (n=489 ) reported on change in management in those with ER/PR/ HER -2 21 discordance (17.5% to 20.5%). The evidence was of very low quality. 22 1 study (n=94) reported on complications of biopsy of mixed locoregional/distant metastases 23 - one out of 83 subjects had a case of bleeding from a punch biopsy which led to admission. 24 No evidence was identified for any of the other outcomes. 25 2.5.2 Health economic evidence statements 26 No evidence was identified in the health economic literature. 27 Results of the novel economic analysis showed that, for the entire population with recurrent 28 breast cancer, testing HER -2 status is associated with an ICER of \u00a321,058. For patient 29 subpopulations the analysis showed that, in patients with a HER -2-positive primary t umour, 30 testing HER -2 status dominates no testing, as it results in a cost saving from unnecessarily 31 Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 38 treating HER -2-negative tumours with trastuzumab. For patients with a HER -2-negative 1 primary tumour, testing HER -2 status results in an ICER of \u00a356,116 for patients with distant 2 metastatic cancer and an ICER of \u00a327,387 for patients with locoregional cancer (under 3 conservative assumptions). ICERs for patients with distant metastatic cancer are higher than 4 those for locoregional cancer due to biopsies being car ried out as routine practice for the 5 latter group of patients, and trastuzumab being relatively more cost effective for patients with 6 early stage breast cancer. This evaluation was assessed as being directly applicable to the 7 decision problem, but was cate gorised as having potentially serious limitations, due to relying 8 on costs and QALYs from previously published analyses, the low quality of data used to 9 populate the model, and a large number of assumptions inherent in the analysis. 10 2.6 Evidence to recommenda tions 11 Committee discussion s Relative value of different outcomes The majority of papers were concerned with identifying the proportion of people with a change in receptor status between the two samples, but few studies reported on change in management and only one reported on adverse events related to biopsy rate of status change , but did not address quality of life. No evidence was available for the outcomes of quality of life, change in tumour type or survival/progression to recurrence. The committ ee agreed that change in management was the critical outcome as the clinical context has changed since the original guideline was published. More tailored approaches to pharmaceutical management based on receptor status are now available. The opportunity t o change to a more appropriate strategy , or to stop treatment based on new biopsy results , has considerable implications for both the patient and the NHS. For the patient , appropriately targeted treatment should be associated with gains in patient related outcomes such as s urvival and response rates, and also reduced side effects from drugs that might have previously been given , but which wouldn't have benefitted the patient , as they wouldn't have an anti -tumour action. For the NHS , change to more appropria te management would be expected to result in better use of NHS resources by making more effective use of cost -effective treatment s. The committee noted that some of the included papers also reported on the proportion of people whose re -biopsy indicated th at the tumour was benign. This would have an enormous impact on the quality of life of the patient in terms of reassurance and reduction in anxiety. This would also benefit the NHS in stopping unnecessary treatments that are associated with serious adverse effects. The topic experts noted that test s for PR status are not currently commissioned, and clinical opinion is that change in PR receptor status, if confirmed , would very rarely change management. Trade -off between benefits and harms The committee noted that current practice in most UK healthcare settings is to perform a routine biopsy for locoregional recurrence , as patients may require surgery and further management. For distant metastases, it was noted that practice varies and not a ll patients will receive a routine biopsy . It was agreed that the majority of patients are likely to want to be re -tested if this improves management, but those who had a traumatic experience at previous biopsy may want to avoid further biopsy. The committee noted that knowing receptor status on disease recurrence can be important as it may alter the clinical management of the disease . It agreed that it was important that a caveat be added that receptor status only be re -assessed if there is the potential to change the way the disease is managed. In certain groups of people, where a clinician is confident that a Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recom mendations 39 Committee discussion s different test result would not result in a change of management, neither the costs of the biopsy nor the potential harms of biopsy to th e individual could be justified. Knowing receptor status is important because HER -2 positive breast cancers are often responsive to trastuzumab , as outlined in TA34 guidance . However, it was noted that trastuzumab is often given with chemotherapy and/or other drugs including pertuzumab. Additionally, trastuzumab may n ot be suitable for all patients, especially those with poor cardiac function. Taking this into consideration, the committee agreed that knowing HER -2 status on suspected recurrence can prolong life with further treatment in people found to be HER -2 positive on recurrence, and avoid incorrect treatment s and their associated potentially serious adverse effects in people found to be HER -2 negative on recurrence . They also agreed there has been an i ncrease in treatments targeted based on ER status, and therefore reassessment of this would also have the possibility to positively affect people's treatment. The committee formulated a recommendation to consider reassessment of receptor status on suspecte d disease recurrence in a person with breast cancer, where biopsy will change management. The committee noted the lack of evidence for adverse events of a biopsy and relied on their experience to fill this gap. Potential harms of core biopsy include a ne ed for general anaesthesia (and potential associated surgical complications) with biopsy on some sites. The committee agreed that , provided management would be likely to change, the benefits of an accurate diagnosis outweighed the potential harms of biopsy because it will ensure the patient enters the correct treatment pathway . The committee agreed that there was no evidence presented that progesterone re -testing would lead to improvements in management, nor was there clinical consensus that it would, and therefore it was agreed to be appropriate not to make any recommendations in this area. Additionally, the committee agreed it was appropriate to delete the recommendation from the old guideline to assess ER and HER -2 status in people who were not assessed at the time of first diagnosis. This was because the overwhelming majority of people will now be tested at diagnosis, and in those who aren't it would be standard practice to test on recurrence, and therefore there was no need for specific guidance in this area. Trade -off between net health benefits and resource use The committee discussed the results of the de novo economic analysis conducted for the update. It was noted that results indicate that retesting receptor status in all patients with a HER -2-positive primary tumour is likely to be cost saving, with at least equivalent health outcomes to a strategy of no retesting, due to preventing patients with HER -2-negative recurrent cancer from being unnecessarily treated with trastuzumab. It was also noted that the ICER for retesting receptor status in patients with locoregional cancer and who had a HER -2-negative primary tumour was only marginally higher than the ICER for treating patients with known HER - 2-positive status with trastuzumab. Therefore, given that NICE considers trastuzumab to be a cost effective treatment for both early and advanced HER -2-positive breast cancer (it is recommended in TA107 and TA34) , it is also likely that retesting receptor status in these patients is a cost effective strategy. The committee noted that retesting status in patients with distant metastatic cancer who had a HER -2-negative primary tumour is associated with a relatively high ICER of \u00a356,116/QALY, due to the additional cost of biopsy in these patients, as well as trastuzumab treatment being less cost effective for advanced breast cancer. The committee discussed a number of limitations with the economic analysis and with the underlying clinical evidence. First ly, it was noted that the cost and QALY outcomes for tra stuzumab used to populate the model Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 40 Committee discussion s are relatively dated and, in clinical practice, other treatments are also used to treat HER -2-positive recurrent cancer. Specifically, the majority of patients are treated with pertuzumab as an adjunct to trastuzumab, an d some patients are treated with trastuzumab emtansine following treatment with trastuzumab. The cost effectiveness of these treatments, and the potential effect on model outcomes, was discussed. Treating HER -2- positive patients with pertuzumab is likely to increase the cost effectiveness of retesting receptor status, whereas trastuzumab emtansine is likely to substantially decrease cost effectiveness (although it should be noted that this treatment is not recommended by NICE). This is because the ICERs of these two treatments (in addition to or following trastuzumab treatment) are likely to be, respectively, lower and higher than the ICER of treating HER -2- positive breast cancer with trastuzumab alone. Therefore, including these treatments in the analysis would also shift the ICER of testing patients with a HER -2-negative primary tumour down or up respectively. Second ly, it was noted that the assumption that patients with HER -2- negative cancer accrue the same number of QALYs regardless of treatment with o r without trastuzumab is potentially unrealistic. The committee felt that, in reality, these patients would likely experience a reduction in quality of life due to the toxicity associated with trastuzumab and adjuvant treatment . Furthermore, patients whose HER -2 status changes from positive to negative could potentially miss out on treatments specific to HER -2-negative cancer if they are not retested, and therefore experience a further QALY loss. This indicates that the model is potentially underestimating the cost effectiveness of receptor status testing in patients with a HER -2-positive primary tumour, although this is unlikely to affect decision making, as testing already dominates no testing in the base case. Third ly, the studies identified in the clini cal review display high variability in estimates of the proportion of patients changing HER -2 status between primary and recurrent cancer. However, sensitivity analyses carried out on the model show that, even when the proportion of patients changing HER -2 status is halved or doubled, retesting patients with a HER -2-positive primary tumour still remains a dominant strategy, and there is little effect on the ICER of retesting in patients with locoregional recurrence and a HER -2- negative primary tumour. Contr astingly, the ICER of retesting in patients with distant metastatic cancer and a HER -2-negative primary tumour was sensitive to variation in the proportion of patients changing status. Fourth ly, the committee noted that, in practice, a substantial proport ion of patients with distant metastatic recurrence are biopsied independently of the intention of testing HER -2 status. For these patients, the cost effectiveness of retesting receptor status would be substantially reduced, to an extent that the ICER would likely be only marginally higher than that of trastuzumab for patients with HER -2 status. Therefore, as with the equivalent locoregional population, retesting is likely to be cost effective in these patients if trastuzumab is generally accepted to be a co st effective treatment. Finally, the committee discussed that, on occasion, clinicians may treat patients with a HER -2-positive primary tumour and HER -2-negative metastases with trastuzumab, on the assumption that metastases at other sites were HER -2-positive. Furthermore, some metastases sites may be difficult to validate - for example if only a small sample is available, or if metastases are in the bone. Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and recommendations 41 Committee discussion s The committee acknowledged that, although the model base case results indicate that retesting HER -2 receptor status is likely to be more cost effective in some patient subgroups than others, the level of uncertainty in the modelling results and the complexity of clinical reality indicated that nuancing recommendations according to primary tumour status and stage of recurrent cancer was not appropriate. The committee concluded that the clinical reality is sufficiently complex that clinician's judgement should play a key role in determining whether retesting HER -2 status is appropriate, and therefore opted to make a recommendation that retesting should be considered in all patients with recurrent breast cancer , where the result could change management . Based on an incidence rate of 1,876 cases of recurrent breast cancer per year, and an overall incremental cost of \u00a36 38 for retesting HER -2 status across all patients, implementing the recommendation for the entire population would incur a significant resource impact of around \u00a31, 196,000 per year. However, in practice, this figure is likely to be lower, as a considerable proportion of patients with distant metastatic cancer are currently biopsied as a matter of routine practice. Making the assumption that 50% of patients with distant metastatic cancer are biopsied regardless of the intention to test HER -2 statu s gives an annual resource impact of around \u00a3 833,000 per year. Quality of evidence The committee agreed that the quality of the clinical evidence was very low. Many of the studies were carried out on an opportunistic basis (using autopsy findings, routinely collected data or as part of a wider project) and overall there was very poor rep orting of baseline demographic characteristics beyond age. For the outcome of change in receptor status, there were fairly consistent findings across the studies with median proportions of change in ER and HER -2 consistent with the previous review in CG81. Imprecision was not quantitatively assessed as the committee were not able to define the percentage change in receptor expression that would be considered as clinically significant. The use of medians as the primary summary measure also means it is diff icult to formally evaluate the level of variability in the data. However, with the overall quality of the data consistently assessed as very low, this is unlikely to have made a difference to the recommendations made. The committee raised applicability co ncerns with regard to older trials from 1995 and before. This is because many of these trials did not mandate that a re-biopsy is necessary. Additionally, many of these trials based HER -2 receptor status testing on the immunohistochemistry (IHC) criteria, and receptor status testing has progressed since this with the use of FISH and D-DISH. Other considerations The committee noted that the following exclusion criteria specified in the protocol may not be entirely appropriate for this evidence review question: \"Women and men with invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast of clinical stages 1, 2 and 3 (this will be covered by the NICE guideline on 'Early breast cancer: diagnosis and treatment) unless it is a stage 1/2/3 disease that has recurred and become stage 4 \". This is because stage of cancer may not be defined at primary sample and all adenocarcinoma has the potential to become metastatic. However, the committee were aware that no evidence was excluded on this basis and therefore this will have made no difference to the overall conclusions of the review . The committee made a post -hoc decision to not review the clinical studies looking at locoregional disease recurrence or metastases as surgery i s often the standard of care Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Evidence review and r ecommendations 42 Committee discussion s so this information would not help with 'change in treatment' outcome. Topic experts also noted that locoregional metastases are routinely biopsied in clinical practice at the moment so any recommendation to biopsy these instances will not have any impact of clinical practice. Equalities impact The co mmittee noted that patients who have a first language that is not English may have difficulty in understanding and discussing the potential adverse events of biopsy on recurrence and there may also be implications on obtaining cons ent for biopsy. For these patients, interpreters / family members should be available to assist. Patients with learning disabilities and cognitive impairments may require earlier screening and added guidance. The committee noted the challenges in obtaining consent for biopsy from those with conditions such as dementia. The committee noted that in some religions or cultures, cancer is not openly talked about which prevents family members from seeking further help. The committee noted that although the evide nce related specifically to women, breast cancer can also affect men, yet this is much rarer in this group. The committee noted that there may be social implications relating to fertility, for example, treatment may prevent a young woman from pregnancy. Th ose with comorbidities such as poor cardiac function may not be eligible for treatment with trastuzumab and alternative management options may be considered. 2.7 Recommendations 1 1.

Background/ objectives In November 2015, the NICE surveillance team reviewed the NICE guideline on Advanced breast cancer to see if it needed to be updated. 2 new studies (1 which was a pooled analysis of individual patient data from 2 prospect ive studies and the other a prospective cohort study) were identified examining discordance between primary and recurrent breast cancer in terms of ER, HER -2 and progesterone receptor status. The 2 studies found there could be discordance in receptor statu s between the primary tumour and metastases, which led to altered management in 14.2 -20% of cases. The topic experts agreed that it was important to review whether reassess ment of receptor status on disease recurrence was necessary . They noted that the Br east Cancer Quality Standard already states that people with recurrent disease (if clinically appropriate) have the ER and HER -2 status of the tumour assessed. It appears that the QS statement is supported by the evidence from the current surveillance rev iew. However it was recognised that the QS doesn't align with the current recommendations in the clinical guideline - which state that, if disease recurs, further biopsy just to reassess ER and HER -2 status should not be done. This area should therefore be reviewed to see if the clinical guideline needs to be updated in light of the new evidence. The existing quality standard will need to be reviewed in light of the guideline update. Population Patients (men and women) with advanced breast tumour and ER/PR /HER - 2 status known at first diagnosis. Intervention Reassessment of ER/PR/ HER -2 receptor status on biopsy from recurrence Comparator ER/PR/ HER -2 receptor status at first diagnosis Outcomes Changes in receptor expression between the two samples Quality of life Change in management Change in tumour type eg: breast to lung Adverse events related to biopsy Note: Survival and progression to recurrence will be revisited as a post -hoc analysis if the data is available in the included studies. Deviation from review protocol: data relating to the change in direction of HER -2 status was extracted as a post -hoc analysis to feed into the health economic model for both the locoregional and distant subgroups . For breast cancer, it is known that ER/PR/ HER-2 status may differ between primary and recurrent tumours. Of these markers, a change in HER -2 status has the largest impact on change in management, as HER -2-positive tumours are responsive to treatment with trastuzumab. Type of review question Epidemiolo gical Types of study to be included Cohort studies/case series and any other study designs comparing paired biopsy samples from the first diagnosis versus the recurrent tumour Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Review protocol 53 Note: the comparison biopsy at recurrence versus no biopsy at recurrence is not of interest for this question as we are only interested in paired biopsy samples. Language English language only Status Published papers (full text only) - searches to be ru n from start of database to present. All studies included in the original guideline will also be considered. Any other information or criteria for inclusion/exclusion For inclusion Women and men with invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast of clinical stage 4 (i.e. with known metastatic disease). Settings: p rimary care (excluding population -based and opportunistic screening ), secondary car e, tertiary care by specialist breast cancer team s and p alliative care services. Mixed study populations will be included if the data for the advanced breast group alone can be extracted or if this is not possible but the advanced breast cancer population is 90% or more. For exclusion Women and men with invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast of clinical stages 1, 2 and 3 (t his will be c overed by the NICE guideline on ' Early breast cancer: diagnosis and treatment) unless it is a stage 1/2/3 disease that has recurred and become stage 4. Women and men with metastases to the breast from other primary tumours. Women and men with rare breast tumours (for example, angiosarcoma, lymphoma). Women and men with benign breast tumours (for example, fibroadenoma, benign phyllodes tumours). Analysis of subgroups or subsets Receptor status change in primary disease recurrence Receptor status change in second metastases Data extraction and quality assessment Sifting Relevant studies will be identified through sifting the abstracts and excluding studies clearly not relevant to the review question (measured against protocol). I n the case of relevant or potentially relevant studies, the full paper will be ordered and reviewed, whereupon studies considered being not relevant to the topic will be excluded. i) Selection based on titles and abstracts A full double -sifting of title s and abstracts will not be conducted due to the nature of the review question (narrow question with clearly defined straightforward inclusion and exclusion criteria. The original review included a reasonable evidence base (18 studies) and so the implicati ons of missing one study are minimal). However in cases of uncertainty the following mechanisms will be in place: technical analyst will discuss with a support analyst comparison with included studies of other current (within 5 years) systematic reviews recourse to members of the committee ii) Selection based on full papers Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Review protocol 54 A full double -selecting of full papers for inclusion/exclusion will not be conducted (narrow qu estion with clearly defined straightforward inclusion and exclusion criteria. The original review included a reasonable evidence base (18 studies) and so the implications of missing one study are minimal). However in cases of uncertainty the same mechanism s stated in i) above will be followed. The committee will also be sent the list of included and excluded studies prior to the committee meeting. The committee will be requested to check whether any studies have been excluded inappropriately, and whether there are any relevant studies they know of which haven't been picked up by the searches or have been wrongly sifted out. Data extraction Relevant information from included studies will be extracted into standardised evidence tables adapted to suit this particular question. The following baseline characteristics will be extracted: Age Gender Ethnicity Treatment at baseline Biopsy site Biopsy type Hormone status Disease stage Survival/time to recurrence or progression Critical appraisal The risk of bias of each included study will be assessed using standardised checklists available in the NICE manual appropriate for the design of each included study. Quality assessment An adapted GRADE methodology will be used to assess the quality of evidence on an outcome basis: Risk of bias will be assessed using the Joanna Briggs checklist for case series. Inconsistency will not be assessed as it is not anticipated the data will be pooled due to the heterogeneous populations Indirectness will be assessed after considering the population, intervention and outcomes of included studies, relative to the target population as specified in the review protocol; Imprecision will not be assessed using whether the confidence intervals around point estimates cross th e MIDs for each outcome. COMET and published literature will be checked for appropriate minimal important differences (MID) for each outcome and if none are available, Topic experts will be asked to provide MID's. Quality Assurance A full double -scoring qu ality assessment will not be conducted due to the nature of the review question (narrow question ) and the type of studies included . Other quality assurance mechanisms will be in place as follows: Clinical Guideline 81.2 (Advanced breast cancer) Review protocol 55 Internal QA (10%) by CGUT technical adviser on the risk of bias and quality assessment that is being conducted. Any disagreement will be resolved through discussion. The Committee will be sent the evidence synthesis prior to the committee meeting and will be requested to comment on the quality assessment, which will serve as another QA function. Strategy for data synthesis The original guideline did not perform a meta -analysis of the data. It is not anticipated a meta -analysis will be carried out in this update as it is expected the studies will be heterogeneous in terms of population (eg: varying regions from which second sample obtained). No comparative (controlled) data are anticipated. A narrative evidence summary outlining key issues such as volume, generalisability and quality of evidence and presenting th e key findings from the evidence will be produced.
