Balance is critical to how we function throughout the day. If we can't stay upright, there's not much we can do or accomplish. Proper balance relies on several things. It relies on our senses, such as sight and hearing, proper nervous system function to tell our body what to do, as well as muscle strength and musculoskeletal alignment. If any one of these things is out of whack or not working as it should, our balance and coordination can be drastically affected.

It sends and receives signals from the brain that tell the body how to operate. Any disruption of the central nervous system can disrupt this communication, and that can lead to health concerns such as poor balance. Spinal misalignments can be at the root of this nerve interference that impedes balance and coordination. Likewise, inner ear problems such as vertigo can cause dizzy spells and affect balance. As we get older, our bodies suffer from wear and tear. Improper spinal alignment or poor musculoskeletal health in the elderly can cause improper balance that can in turn lead to an increased risk of falling. But no matter what age you are, your muscles and bones must work together to hold you upright. The slightest bit of spinal alignment, hip alignment, leg length, and muscle strength shifting or changing can affect balance. Correct alignment through gentle chiropractic adjustments can strengthen your body and [improve balance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2786230/).
