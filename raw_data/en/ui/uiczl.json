(g) If students change programmes within UJ, only the modules related to the new programme will be taken into consideration in calculating whether the qualification is obtained with distinction. HS viii EXPOSURE TO INFECTIOUS AGENTS In terms of the UJ policy adopted regarding students who are exposed to infectious agents, students who will interact with live patients in a clinical or related environment within the Faculty of H ealth Sciences are required to be vaccinated against Hepatitis B due to the risk of exposure. During orientation and or at the first contact session every student who will interact with live patients in a clinical or related environment will be issued with a letter which will inform them about the importance of immunization against Hepatitis B as well as the fact that it is mandatory to be vaccinated. Students are to sign for receipt for the letter and a copy will be held on their student file. At the sta rt of the second term students would need to sign a document stating that they have previously been exposed or received/commenced these vaccinations. By virtue of the signature on that document students confirm that they have been previously exposed/vaccin ated/commenced vaccination against Hepatitis B and that they understand that false declaration constitutes fraud and that they may face disciplinary actions and medical consequences that may arise from a false declaration. Potentially exposed students wh o have not started with or been exposed / vaccinated against Hepatitis B when commencing their studies in the Faculty of Health Sciences may have it done at the Primary Health Services situated on the various campuses. Vaccinations need to commence within the first month after registration. Please note that all the costs for these vaccinations are to be paid for by the student. Students may visit the Primary Health Care clinic on campus to establish the cost of the vaccinations and the procedure that needs to be followed. These vaccinations may also be done at any other registered medical provider which offers this service. In some instances, medical aid may cover the cost. Hepatitis B injections commence and are then repeated 1 month and 6 months later. Blood tests would need to be done 1 month after the last injection to establish whether the body had developed sufficient immunity against He patitis B. If not, booster dosages would need to be administered and the blood tests repeated. These blood tests would need to be done by a private laboratory at the cost of the student. Students who were previously exposed or received the vaccinations, wo uld also need to determine with a blood test whether sufficient immunity has been developed against the disease. It is strongly recommended that students who work with patients be examined for Tuberculosis before commencement of their studies and also be vaccinated against Hepatitis A, Tetanus, Meningitis, Varicella, Mumps, Measles, Rubella (if not exposed or vaccinated to these diseases before) and annually for influenza. The University will not be held liable for any consequences resulting from an acci dental exposure to any of the above infectious agents by the student. The University has insurance with Marsh for accidental exposure to HIV due to work integrated learning. The necessary form will be issued to students for signature at the commencement o f each year of study. Everybody on a UJ campus, including students, have to comply with the COVID -19 regulations and safety measures of UJ. 13 Rules and Regulations 2022 Faculty of H ealth Science s HS ix AFRICAN INSIGHTS / ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE 4IR It is compulsory that undergraduate students complete one of the below online modules: 1.
