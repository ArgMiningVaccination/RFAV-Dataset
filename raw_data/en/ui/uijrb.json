She began her journey of alternative therapies and healing energies in 1997. After being introduced to yoga as a guest she decided to go to Rishikesh (India) and became a yoga teacher, she also has studied Integrative Massage in India. Deniz has excellent charisma in Watsu (Water-Shiatsu), Tantsu (Watsu on land) and Water dance (WATA) Therapy training in India. The last six years she has been a Vipassana Meditator. Interview with a Watsu Practitioner What inspired you to study alternative therapies and remedies? I started my journey of alternative therapies and healing energies with Reiki, and I discovered that everyone of us has a healing power. Being in a position to provide healing for clients and also myself has filled me with tremendous happiness. Reiki has enhanced my interest in the workings of the human body, and the energies which surround us and are also within us. What is Watsu and how is it similar to Tantsu? Watsu is a fusion of water and shiatsu is a form of body massage performed while floating in warm water. It combines the therapeutic benefits of warm water and Zen Shiatsu, Yoga, Alexander Technique and Meditation. Tantsu is Watsu on land. There's no set pattern to the movements and there is stretching, wavelike movement of the water, the breath and heart connection, stillness and cradling throughout the session like on Watsu. As a waterdance therapist, do you feel water is an important element when it comes to healing? Water is a miraculous element which transforms and heals the person physicaly, physiologicaly and psychologically. Waterdance is combined with underwater movements reminiscent of the womb and creates a tremendously healing experience. The water itself carries teachings that can actually support and nurture extraordinary relaxation by encouraging effortless insight into ourselves. WATA (waterdance) is a unique form of bodywork, can you describe how it works? Waterdance is a form of aquatic bodywork like Watsu, it begins on the surface. Then the receiver is given a nose clip and step by step is gently guided under the water. The session incorporates elements of massage, dolphin and snake movements, rolls, somersaults, inversions and dance. The effects are physical release such as joint mobilisation and can encourage deep states of relaxation. The Watsu pool at Kempinski Barbaros Bay As an EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques) practitioner can you describe this technique and how it is beneficial? EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques) combines Acupressure and Affirmation Techniques which works by neutralizing disruptions in the body's electrical system, then stops the chemical chain reaction and frees the person from emotional and physical discomforts. New or old emotional upsets, life long phobias, compulsive behaviors and unhealthy patterns can often be released easily. These techniques are so gentle, rapid and startlingly effective. Why is integrative massage so beneficial and how is it different to other massage therapies? Integrative Massage is done by applying oil which cleanses and relaxes the body. This massage contains 3 parts: in the first part, we awaken the body by pressing the important points which we call \"marma\". After that, by applying oil we stimulate the lymphatic system and detoxify and strenghten the muscles, joints and ligaments. In the last part, we increase the flexibility and the energy level of the body with some passive static stretching exercises. Can you describe Klang massage and what makes it distinctive? Nepal's traditional sound massage (Klang Massage) is applied with special bowls produced from an alloy of 16 different materials. Before the session we determine the chakras we are going to work on and we work on every chakra with their colour one by one. The person can explore the self-regeneration and self-treatment power of the body with sound vibrations. What is Vipassana Meditation and how is it beneficial? Vipassana, which means to see things as they really are is one of India's most ancient techniques of meditation. It was taught in India more than 2,500 years ago as a universal remedy for universal ills, i.e., an Art of Living. In Vipassana Meditation one experiences that everything is passing away. In our life, pain or pleasure is also impermanent, so no need to generate attachment or craving for something which gives pleasure and no need to generate anger or hatred for something which makes pain. When we see things as they are, we can live life in peace and harmony. Meditation at Kempinski Barbaros Bay What inspired you to become a yoga teacher? When I encountered Yoga in 2000, I was living in a small town (Kas) in Turkey. We were gathering with some friends and doing yoga asanas and some pranayama techniques. I was working as a diving instructor at that moment which is why I was very familiar about explaining the postures and some details like in the diving courses. My friends were encouraging me to become a yoga teacher and I tried some of the yoga styles like Kundalini, Ashtanga, Iyengar, Vinyasa during these years. Afterwards I visited Rishikesh (where yoga was born) and ended up learning with traditional Hatha yoga which I like a lot because each pose is like deep meditation. Kempinski Barbaros Bay offers a wide range of treatments, with your training in yoga, massage and waterdance therapies, how well do guests respond to these?
