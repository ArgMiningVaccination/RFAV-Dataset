First: Dr. Paul Pearsall, American author of sixteen best selling self-help books says, \"We're a brain culture asdistinct from a heart culture. We want to quantify everything. Ifwe can't weigh it and measure it objectively, it simply doesn'texist for us. The Hawaiians have always believed that it isthrough the heart that we know the truth. For them, the heart is as sentient as the brain. We find this same belief with the Hopi Indians in New Mexico, and with the [ancient] Chinese;within many cultures the heart chakra is the key to healing.\"(Hal Bennett, The Thinking Heart: An Interview with Paul Pearsall , www.mightywords.com) Second: When in 1925, the well-known Swiss psychoana- lyst Carl Jung went to Taos Pueblo in New Mexico, he met the Native American, Chief Ochwiay Biano. Biano told Jung thataccording to his people, the Whites were uneasy, restless, and\"mad\" people, always wanting things. Jung asked him why hethought this was, and the chief replied that it was because theythought with their heads, a sign of mental illness among the pueblo peoples. Jung asked Biano how he thought and the chief pointed to his heart. The response plunged Jung into adeep introspection that enabled him to see himself and hisculture from a new perspective (Suma Varughese, Moving from Head to Heart , 9/2005. www.lifepositive.com). Third: In the early twentieth century, Rudolf Steiner spoke of the important step needed in human development as a transition from our present brain-bound, intellectual thinkingto a future, heart-felt thinking. This forming of heart thinkinghe connected directly with the aesthetic or artistic transforma-tion of our spiritual capacity for thought. In 1919, threedecades after the publication of his book The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity , Steiner said of this work: \"I wanted to showthat the realm otherwise dealt with only by the artist in imagination must now become the serious concern of thehuman race, for the reason that it represents the stage mankindmust reach to lay hold upon the supersensible that the brain isincapable of grasping.\" (Rudolf Steiner, Some Characteristics of Today , June 12, 1919). The art of weighing and measuring qualities\u2014colors, tones, forms, words, and gestures\u2014is a process in which theartist is constantly engaged. In fact, we are all doing this all thetime. This weighing up of qualities is what Aristotle consid- Figure 2: The Archangel Micha-el weighing souls in a detail from The Last Judgement by Hans Memlinc.The Aesthetic Logic of the Heart: Forming Heart Thinking Van James, Honolulu, Hawai'i2ered to be a virtuous, moral-building faculty: \"Virtue is the human capacity, aided by skill and reason, to determine between the too little and the too much.\" In Rudolf Steiner's termsthis faculty for virtue is referred to as moral imagination and ethical individualism (The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity ). Just as the words \"art\" and \"heart\" literally overlap, so too the artistic process and the development of cognitive feeling or heart thinking areinterrelated and even synonymous. In former times and in many cultures, heart wisdom was acknowledged in variousways. The primeval Egyptian god, Ptah, is said to have created the world first in his heart before he spoke it into existence. To theancient Egyptians the heart was the seat ofemotions, thoughts, soul and life itself. Oneof the most important \"spells\" in the Egyptian Book of the Dead was the Weighing of the Heart (fig. 1). In this threshold trial, the deceased, led by the jackal-headed god of deathAnubis, observed his heart being weighedupon the scales of Maat, goddess of truth. Ifthe heart was lighter than Maat's feather oftruth and not weighted down with sins and transgressions from the life just lived, then the deceased was able to pass on to join the highergods. Spells asking the heart not to bearwitness against the deceased refer to the heartas though it were a conscious, living being.\"Oh my heart...do not be my enemy in the presence of the guardian of the balance...Do not tell lies about me in the presence of thegreat god...\" ( Egyptian Book of the Dead , Chapter 30.) The heart was the only organallowed to remain in the mummified body ofthe deceased, while all other organs were removed and preserved separately, or as in the case of the brain, discarded as unworthy.While the weighing of the heart was a crucial step in the Egyptian mortuary cults, the weighingof the soul was emphasized in medievalChristian times and practices. Many depictionsshow the Archangel Micha-el selecting souls fortheir further journey by means of the scales (fig. 2). Weighing up the virtues or sins of the soul was pictured in terms of lightness or heavinesson the balance. Micha-el's seasonal cycle as anarchangel occurs each year in autumn, the time ofLibra, the balance beam (the only inanimate symbol of the zodiac). As a Time Spirit or archai, Micha-el's reign began at the end of the nine- teenth century and is now fully underway.Rudolf Steiner said: \"The Age of Michael hasdawned. Hearts are beginning to have thoughts.\"(The Michael Mystery , GA 26, p. 62.) In Steiner's words, Micha-el's threefold task is: \"He...liberates thought from the sphere of the head; he clears the way for it to the heart; [and] heenkindles enthusiasm in the feelings, so that thehuman mind can be filled with devotion for allthat can be experienced in the light of thought.\"(Ibid.) However, heart thinking does not just come about by itself. It requires a schooling in logicalthinking, for in logical thinking we experience theconsequential necessity of one thought connect-ing to another. Although logical thinking will notserve us in supersensible realms, a kind of logical conscience develops from it and \"a general feeling of responsibility in our soul for truth anduntruth\" (Ibid.) begins to take shape. Sointellectual, logical thinking leads to a consciencethat serves as a foundation for heart thinking.\"Spiritual fervor now proceeds not merely from mystical obscurity, but from souls clarified by thought.\" (Ibid.) A visionary picture of \"spiritual fervor,\" originating in the \"mystical obscurity\" of theFrench Order of the Visitation of Our Lady,between 1673 and 1675, is that of the sacred flaming heart (fig. 3). Celebrated on the first Friday of every month and throughout the month ofJune according to Roman Catholic tradition, theflaming sacred heart of Jesus is veneratedaccording to visions of Jesus Christ described bya humble nun, later beatified as St. Margaret Mary Alacoque. \"Flames issued from every part of His Sacred Humanity, especially from His AdorableBreast, which resembled an open furnace anddisclosed to me His most loving and mostamiable Heart, which was the living source ofthese flames.\" (From the diary of St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, The Revelation of the Sacred HeartFigure 1: The Weighing of the Heart, a crucial part of theEgyptian Book of theDead , from the Papyrus of Ani. Figure 3: The symbol of the Sacred Flaming Heart,according to Roman Catholictradition, was inspired by thevisions of St. Margaret MaryAlacoque in the seventeenthcentury.3of Jesus .) Although relegated to the purgatory of Catholic kitsch art, the sacred flaming heart is areal symbol, not only of religious devotion, piety,passion, courage and love, but also of the futuredevelopment of heart thinking. Althoughsentimentalized in most pictures, it is an imagination of the etheric organ, the heart chakra (wheel), with its turning spokes, flowing lotuspetals or radiating flames. Old Testamentrecognition of this spiritual organ and center ofhuman virtue is noted in Samuel: \"...The Lordseeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.\" (I Samuel 16:7.) Contrast this view withthe late Christopher Fry's declaration in his playThe Sleep of Prisoners, \"The human heart can go the length of God...\" A more recent visionary picture and artistic embodiment of the living heart forces may be seen in the Representative of Humanity , a thirty- foot tall wood sculpture created by RudolfSteiner and often referred to as The Group . This monumental carving is a study in convexity andconcavity, with a composition of figures in asymmetrical balance (fig. 4). The central figure, described by Steiner as the representative of a\"spiritualized, inwardly deepened humanity,\"(Steiner, 21/10/1917) stands as the fulcrum andbalance beam of a dynamic, living scale. It is acontemporary, artistic imagination of the weighing of the heart, as this representative of spiritualized humanity strides between forces ofopposition and extremism, to express a middleposition in freedom and love. This representativeof the inwardly deepened human being wasimagined by Steiner as showing in what streams out from its eyes as \"pure compassion,\" and what is shown through its mouth, \"notdesigned for eating but for uttering true wordsthat express conscience,\" (Steiner, 8/5/1912) therevelation of the \"I am.\" Author James Joyce spoke of proper art and improper art, but said there are two kinds of improper art (fig. 5). One form of improper arthe referred to as didactic because it tries to teachus a lesson, whether we like it or not. It is in-your-face art that pushes itself upon us. It isaggressive and avant gardein character. It is honestbut not very pretty. Theother type of improper art Joyce calls pornographic, not because it constitutessexual content, butbecause it sells itself, pullsus into it, and may bepretty but is a lie. Between these two manifestations of improper art is properart. Proper art presents aposition of aestheticarrest, freedom from beingpushed or pulled, \"a thin line of quiet\" or as Joyce describes it, \"an epiphany.\"This epiphany status ofproper art characterizes theRepresentative ofHumanity, as a scale of balance between extremes in the forming of a heart-centered spiritual cogni-tion. The weighing and balancing functions of both our heart and our thinking might be considered, in their essence, akin to art. The opposite of the word aesthetic is anaesthetic,which means numb, lacking feeling, and inabilityto respond. Aesthetic, on the other hand, meansenlivened being, heightened experience, andresponse-ability. This response-ability is at the same time a responsibility in that it calls on us to be more aware of what we respond to and howwe react and respond to it. In artistic activity, as inthe training of practical thinking, we develop afaculty for conscience and we learn to takeresponsibility for our actions, our feelings and our thoughts. This builds an aesthetic logic and moral imagination that leads to the forming ofheart thinking\u2014to the aesthetic logic of theheart. Figure 4: The Representative of Humanity is a thirty-foot tall carved, wood sculpturecreated by Rudolf Steiner in theearly part of the twentiethcentury.

To reap the benefits oftechnology we need not ignore or simply resignour selves to the harmful effects of technology,particularly to our own health. The contempla-tion of art is an antidote to our technologicalway of life that warrants wider attention. All forms of work cause fatigue. Working on a computer or other forms of technologyfor an extended period, sooner or later, inducesa particular kind of weariness called techno-fatigue. One way to rejuvenate body and soulfrom the stress and weariness of techno-fatigueis to take an art break. Brief but regular glancesat simple artistic forms, such as shown here,can be beneficial if they are placed on our deskor wall where they will catch our eye as we talkon the phone or lift our gaze from thecomputer screen. The effect can be all the moredeep and lasting when we work with artisticforms more intensively, as outlined in thefollowing ways: Drawing the Forms To draw artistic forms ourselves is especially effective if we can give ourselves at least 5-10minutes free from distraction or interruption. In drawing we learn to observe the different elements of each form more exactly.For example, in drawing the sides of the three triangles of Figure 1 we become more sensitiveto their straightness or curvedness, theirconvexity or concavity. As we become moreaware of the outer differences in form, we willbecome more attuned to the correspondinginner qualities of forms. With the threetriangles of Figure 1 we may feel qualities suchas collapsing inwards when the sides areconcave, rigid when straight and filling outwhen convex. A few practical suggestions for drawing these forms: i) Just as we each have a different style of writing, we should experiment to findthe way of drawing that is right for us.However, drawing in outline or shadingto look three-dimensional is notrecommended. Whatever our stroke,drawing them as flat surfaces serves ouraim of coming to a feeling experience ofeach form. ii) If possible, draw all the forms of a particular sequence in one session.However, if we feel rushed, it is better todraw one or two forms at a time. Ouraim is to overcome everything withinand without us that would distract ordeter us from becoming fully engaged inheart and mind. In cultivating thiscapacity to live more deeply in oneactivity our conscious purpose is tobalance the tendency towards multi-tasking that is so prevalent in contempo-rary life and work. Contemplating the Drawn Forms It is possible to contemplate artistic forms without drawing them. In this case, we striveto be as active in observing the forms as wewould in drawing them. Our task is to observewhere the form is wide and narrow, round orangular, convex or concave, in as much detail aswe would when drawing. Our careful observa-tion of the different elements in each form,prepares us, as with the drawing, to come to afeeling experience of each form. Furthermore, itcan lead us to feel the changes through thewhole sequence of forms. Contemplating the Forms Imaginatively After drawing and/or contemplating the outer forms for some time, they will becomeso familiar that we will be able to form them inour minds eye. This enables us to contemplatethem as purely imagined forms. At first, theseimagined forms will very likely seem faint andfleeting compared to the drawn forms. With Art as an Antidote forTechno-Fatigue Michael Howard, Amherst, MA. USA Figure 2Figure 1 5practice, however, they can become increasingly vivid and alive. We build up this inner exercisein two steps: i) We mentally form the various elements of each form\u2014where the form is wideand narrow, round or angular, etc. Wedo this with each successive form in asequence. It is helpful to imagineadjoining pairs and finally, to imagine allthe forms of the sequence either as awhole, or at least in quick succession.The mental gymnastics required to dothis will, at the very least, enhance ourpowers of inner concentration andmobility of thought. ii) It is not essential to see the individual forms or the whole sequence vividly orfor long in order to do the second partof the exercise. Without the stimulusof any outer form or, even an innerpicture in our mind's eye, we now createan inner space of receptivity, akin tolistening, in order to allow the innerquality of each form to resonate withinus as a feeling impression. When speaking of a feeling impression we are referring to an experience of groundedweight or expanding buoyancy as for examplein the triangle and circle of Figure 3. The feelingimpression of each form and sequence offorms is the heart and soul of these exercises.Whether we are contemplating the formsoutwardly or inwardly, we are learning todiscern the difference between a subjectivefeeling, our personal like or dislike, and anobjective feeling of qualities such as groundedweight and expanding buoyancy. In contem-plating objective qualities our inner activitymoves from a concentration exercise to ameditation. It is more difficult to feel the quality of a single form by itself. For this reason it is moreeffective to compare the feeling of twoadjoining forms. Going through the sequenceof forms in successive pairs prepares us toimaginatively feel the whole sequence as aprogression of qualities. Through theseexercises we discover the world of form hasthree different levels: the body of form madevisible in matter, the idea of form made visiblein our imagination, and the soul of formmanifesting as inner qualities. Art as a Way of Life Even fleeting but regular glances upon artistic forms can be beneficial. But moreintensive contemplation of forms throughdrawing and/or building them up in our imagination, will over time enhance our powersof concentration, enliven our thinking andfeeling, and make us more receptive to creativeintuitions in all our affairs. The work of art is not the object but the inner experience which a drawing, painting orsculpture awakens in us. Insofar as we are changed, we are the work of art. Art is the life- blood of the human soul. As we need water,food and air to sustain our body, we need artto sustain our heart and mind. World destinymay require us to live and work with machines.But if we are to avoid becoming evermoremachine-like ourselves, we must take ourdestiny in hand and feed our creative spiritthrough art. As technology has become a wayof life, so art can become a way of life. The drawings shown in this article are available in a bound set that is ready to standon a desk or hang on the wall. The set includesadditional forms, as well as further suggestionsabout how to draw and work with them.

Perhaps, like me, you grew up in a culture which took for granted, and lived by, amechanistic, reductionist view of the world.The explanation of an event lay in a small unitof causation: germs cause disease, flies carrygerms, and so a good spray of DDT over theSunday lunch table would ensure the family'shealth. Such determinism persists in the 21 st century. In addition to germs, we now have genes; the genetic paradigm seems all-pervasive. WhenI was at school, genes caused eye colour. Nowthey cause all kinds of diseases, disabilities anddisaffections, which in turn cause every kind ofsocial ill, including crime, addiction and poverty.We are led to believe that if we can somehowzap or modify these bad genes we can behealthy and law-abiding (perhaps even relaxedand comfortable). A clear statement of genetic determinism is provided by James D Watson (2003 p396): Only with the discovery of the double helix and the ensuing genetic revolution have we hadgrounds for thinking that the powers heldtraditionally to be the exclusive property of thegods might one day be ours. Life, we nowknow is nothing but a vast array of coordi-nated chemical reactions. The \"secret\" to thatcoordination is the breathtakingly complex setof instructions inscribed, again chemically, inour DNA.\" Scientists have learned how toidentify and modify genes and, by so doing, weare told, we can prevent and cure diseases,identify \"at risk\" individuals and producewondrous crops, impervious to herbicides,able to feed the world and make millions forcorporations and their shareholders. The futureis in our genes, we are told. Looking Beyond Reductionism Not everyone has such a reductionist view of life. Anyone with a sense of the spiritual, orwith experience of biodynamics, homeopathyand the like, knows there is something amisswith the uni-directional theory of causation -the view that tiny bits determine the develop-ment of the whole. What Rudolf Steiner (1993, p35) said about seeds probably soundsas strange to many modern scientists as didspherical theory to flat-earthers: In the seed we have an image of the whole universe. Each single time a seed is formed, theearthly organizing process is led to its end, tothe point of chaos. And each time, within theseed-chaos, a new organism is built up out ofthe whole universe. The parent organismsimply has the tendency, through its affinity fora particular cosmic setting, to bring the seedinto relationship with the forces from theproper directions, so that what emerges from adandelion is a dandelion and not a barberry.But the image reflected in the individual plantis always the image of some cosmic constella-tion and is built up out of the cosmos. Steiner was not denying the importance of the tiny entity, the seed, but he was saying thatwe need to understand its life as a manifesta-tion of the organising dynamic of the wholeuniverse. Those of us open to Steiner'scosmic insights have a gut feeling that there issomething wrong with the isolation of thegene as the unit of causation. Geneticengineering fails to take account of the biggerpicture - the organism, the environment, theuniverse. Genetic Engineering as \"Bad Science\" If you try to study genetics, you can easily get lost in all the terminology. Then, if youmove on to the topic of genetic engineering,you become befuddled by the controversiesabout crops, food, stem cells and cloning.None of it seems simple. However, there aresome scientists who have succeeded instripping away all the guff to get to the heartof the matter, to reveal the basic flaws in thescience of genetic engineering. I first cottoned onto this possibility in 2004, when a scientist being interviewed onRadio National issued an unequivocal condem-nation of genetic engineering. \"It is badscience,\" she said. I was intrigued. Such a clear,basic message! Since then, my reading aboutgenetic engineering has revealed that there aremany scientists who believe it is bad science,and indeed that much of modern science is badscience. To give you an idea of what thoughtful scientists are saying, I suggest you look again atProtea Number 53. It had an article reporting on a talk given by Jonathon Banks. He likenedgenetic engineers to R.D. Laing's frog dissec-tors: Each single time a seedis formed, the earthlyorganizing process isled to its end, to thepoint of chaos. 7When R.D. was studying to be a doctor he was required to kill and dissect a frog so that hecould learn all about it. He killed the frog andcut it into little bits, at which point he had alife-changing insight: he no longer had a livingfrog to understand. The whole is always morethan the sum of its parts. It was in the context of this life-destroying approach to science, that Jonathon went on toexplain and question genetic engineering offood crops. From his talk, I understoodsomething about the procedures entailed inGE, and also some of the reasons why weshould be concerned about the use of suchunnatural processes. It has only been subse-quently that I have grasped the strongermessage, that GE is based on false beliefsabout genes and living organisms. It is badscience, which is not surprising, since there issomething wrong with science in general. After Reading Adrian Hofstetter One scientist who tells us so, is Adrian Hofstetter (2004), a Dominican sister, biologistand educator. She is committed to finding \"amore meaningful, organic, pre-experimentalapproach to the science of nature.\" In thisventure, she has gained inspiration fromGoethe and Rudolf Steiner. Adrian Hofstetter ponders the ills of modern life and points an accusatory finger atscience: \"modern science, allied to industry,government and the military, is adrift frommorality, art and wisdom.\" (p134) Modernschooling neglects ancient and mediaevalwisdom, so citizens, including scientists, haveno understanding of metaphysics. This meansthey are unable to question the dominantworldview, the notion that the world is a vastmachine. World-as-machine science is the legacy of Newton and Descartes (of \"I think, therefore Iam\" fame), happily continued by clockworkcosmologists such as Stephen Hawking. Theinfluence of Descartes is that we take dualismfor granted. We see mind separate from body,person from environment and matter fromspirit. We also tend to see as \"real\" only thosematerial things we can see with our eyes andfeel with our fingers. Everything else is \"in themind\", which is taken to mean \"not real\". Forexample, if you are in pain, and no-one canfind a physical (real) cause for it, you will betold that your pain is \"in your mind.\" RudolfSteiner (1928 ch 19) described an experiencewith a friend for whom the spiritual was non-existent: \"I was deeply grieved by the fact that,when I was really uttering that which had for me the profoundest import, yet to my friend Iwas talking of a 'nothing'.\" As Margaret Bruvel(2003) puts it, in the modern world we tend tosee the world of creative spirit beings as Mayaor Illusion; whereas in ancient times that Spiritworld was Reality. Modern science is based on the assumption that we can, and should, observe the world in adetached way. It ignores the possibility thathumans are actually part of, and influencing,what they are perceiving. It seems that modernphysicists have realised this, but many biolo-gists don't want to know. The influence of modern science is that often we cannot see the living whole for its cog-like parts. Scientists can reject metaphysics aspoppycock, while basing all their work on themetaphysical assumption that the world is avast machine. People tend to believe thatscience is \"neutral\", that is, based on self-evident \"facts\". They don't acknowledge thatthe world of facts to be observed by scientists(who are, by definition \"unbiased\") is a verybig assumption. So, we have a science that isblinkered, ungrounded and compromised andgenetic engineering is just one part of it. Hofstetter calls for a \"revolution in the way scientists view reality\" and believes that Goetheand Steiner are among those who can point theway. They would reject a mechanical, purely mathematical way of seeing the universe. Thescientist cannot and should not be a detachedobserver of nature. She proposes a science of\"participative consciousness\", one aware of\"universal coding, not genetic coding\" (a neatparaphrase of Steiner's quote above). Barbara McClintock Reading Adrian Hofstetter introduced me to an amazing scientist who epitomised\"participative consciousness\". The geneticistBarbara McClintock worked in obscurity in themid-1900s and challenged the then (and, itseems still) prevailing doctrine of genes as\"unchanging units of heredity\". She wasinterested in the gene mutations associatedwith coloured streaks in corn. According to thescience of the time, genes could mutate, butthey did not move. They stayed fixed in a setorder like beads on a string. Barbara McClintockdiscovered they could move. It is not only Barbara McClintock's discovery that interested me, but the way she went abouther work. She studied, not just the genes, orseeds, but the leaves and stalk, the whole plant,in fact whole fields of corn. As she said: Hofstetter calls for a\"revolution in the wayscientists and Steiner areamong those who canpoint the way.8No two plants are exactly alike. They're different, and as a consequence, you have toknow that difference. . . . . I start with theseedling, and I don't want to leave it. I don'treally feel I know the story if I don't watch theplant all the way along. So I know every plant inthe field. I know them intimately, and I find ita great pleasure to know them.\" (Hofstetterp158) Barbara McClintock believed it important to have \"a feeling for the organism\" and anopenness to what it reveals to you. Such asearch for nature's wisdom is what is neededfor science to emerge from its reductionistburrow. As a result of her study of mutations in corn, in 1951 Barbara McClintock reported thatgenes are not static, as everybody had thought;they can move. As Hofstetter (p130) puts it: The genes in the corn plants moved about, effected changes in other genes and werethemselves influenced by the cell, the organismand the environment. This apparently simple finding was actually quite revolutionary. BarbaraMcClintock was saying that the influence ofgenes is not one-way. The locus of life andgrowth is not the gene alone, but theorganised life system. When Barbara McClintock published her findings in 1951, her male colleagues took nonotice. It seems the kindest construction onecan place on this was that McClintock was\"ahead of her time\". However, after threedecades, others came to appreciate her contribu-tion and in 1983, when she was 81, she wasawarded the Nobel Prize. Adrian Hofstetterpoints out the huge significance of BarbaraMcClintock's work (p131): Her experiments directly challenged the established belief that a unit of matter, a gene,was a sole carrier of a hereditary trait . . . Shewas free of such as musculardystrophy, Huntington's disease, cancer or evenalcoholism to the effect of a single isolatedgene. Mae-Wan Ho Recently I discovered the name of the scientist I had heard on the radio in 2004. Sheis Mae-Wan Ho, a former geneticist who nowheads the Institute of Science in Society (whichhas a fascinating website). Like AdrianHofstetter, Mae-Wan Ho critiques the world-view that informs, and is informed by, modernscience.The theoretical framework she dismisses is Neo-Darwinism, supported by Mendel's laws,which are not really laws, but theories based onmathematics. The evidence has been squeezedto fit the maths, to produce what Ho calls\"bean-bag genetics\". Mae-Wan Ho (2000, p 1)believes that the biology that results from theseinfluences, though invalidated, persists inacademia \"because it serves so well to promotegenetic engineering, a technology that has thepotential to destroy all life on earth.\" GE \"hasbeen proved wrong by the criteria of scienceitself \" (p49), but its practitioners cannot affordto recognise that. Neo-Darwinian theory says that evolution proceeds by natural selection, with genesplaying a central part. The influence is one-way,that is, genes determine the organism'scharacteristics and cannot themselves be affectedby the environment. Evolutionary changesoccur because of random mutations. Areductionist extreme interpretation of thistheory is presented by Richard Dawkins, whoproposes that organisms are merely carriers for\"selfish genes\" that compete for dominance(and who in January this year launched adiatribe against religion on BBC 4, claimingthat, to quote reviewer Keith Ward, \"thespiritual hypothesis has been demolished bymaterialism\"). Mae-Wan Ho points out what Barbara McClintock and others discovered decades ago,and some have always known, that the onlyvalid way to view biological processes isholistically or ecologically. The old, outmoded(but still popular), reductionist, mechanicalview is quite inadequate. Like AdrianHofstetter, Mae-Wan Ho points out that thiskind of science suits those in power in theglobal industrial economy. Mae-Wan Ho writes that some of the basic tenets of Neo-Darwinian science have beenshown to be wrong. Genes are not fixedheredity units; they are fluid and adaptable.They can move around within an organism,and even travel to another organism (horizon-tal transfer). Mutations are not always random.Many such changes are non-random, deter-mined by the organism, and involve a highlevel of co-operation rather than competition,for example when organisms develop resistanceto anti-biotics. That is, organisms carry outtheir own, quite precise genetic engineering. Another criticism that can be made of modern genetics is that it redefines psychologi-cal and sociological behaviours or events andcalls them \"characteristics\" that can be inherited. GE \"has been provedwrong by criteria ofscience itself\" (p49),but its practitionerscannot afford torecognise that.9So, people argue that there is a gene that can cause alcoholism or aggression. Even if thegenetics were \"right\", we would need toconsider that there is much debate aboutwhether there are, indeed, fixed humancharacteristics. Not that you would know thatfrom reading the popular press, whoseheadlines constantly tell us of the latestdiscoveries about genes and behaviour. Come the Revolution The evidence summarised above points to the revolution in science that Adrian Hofstetterhopes for. However, as Ho puts it, \". . . themainstream biology community has remaineduntouched by this profound revolution,\" asevidenced by its enthusiasm for the \"disrepu-table\" Human Genome Project, aimed atmapping genes, finding blueprints and soforth (Ho,1999, p105). The problem is that thetechnology proceeding from the project isimprecise. As Ho (2000 , p6) writes: For in contrast to natural genetic engineer- ing, which is regulated by the organism as awhole, artificial genetic engineering is uncon-trollable, unreliable and unpredictable. Theforeign genes insert at random, giving corre-spondingly random genetic effects includingabnormalities and cancers in animals and toxinsand allergens in food plants. And there areother greater dangers. Mae-Wan Ho has a lot more to say about the dangers of GE, the many things that can(and do) go wrong and the great number offailed experiments that the public never hearsabout. But to go into those matters is not myaim here. I am interested in the idea that GE isbased on an outmoded paradigm, a false viewof life. Why do people cling to such a para-digm? The writers I have considered suggest itis because people are poorly educated in theliberal arts; they are enmeshed in the agenda ofbig business and the military-industrialcomplex. The Context of Spiritual Science Perhaps Steiner would have something to say about Ahriman in all of this. He predicted(1919) that the incarnation of Ahriman wouldbe assisted if people believed in modern science(with its \"superstitious empiricism\") asabsolute truth, rather than as just one way ofviewing reality. (Steiner's writing on this themehelps me to contextualise what seems to be asense of urgency and vehemence in recentattacks on spiritual and alternative approachesto healing, farming and the like.)In the end, modern biotechnology falls short because it fails to encompass all aspectsof reality - its far reaches, its dynamism, itsmany dimensions. A science that tries toexplain life by telling us that one small thingleads inevitably to another, misses the richness,complexity and interdependence of life. Ittotally ignores spirit and discounts thepossibility of an enriching spiritual science.Steiner (1928 ch 3) wrote that it was only bybeholding spiritual reality that we can reallyknow nature. As Margaret Bruvel (2003) said: The achievements of antiquity, inspired by divine creative beings, had an inherent wisdomin them, which left the nature basis of existenceintact enough for us to carry on living. Not sowith many of the \"achievements\" of modernman. It is becoming increasingly obvious tomany people that we have to find our way backto accessing the whole picture once again . . . Inan age when we see all material reality as opento scientific enquiry, why should we close ourminds to enquiry about spiritual reality?

Barker, Australia In the week before Easter there was a gathering of 75 Waldorf high school students,from schools in Sydney, Melbourne andCanberra, at the Mt Barker Waldorf School. Class 11 students hosted the conferencethrough the Pedagogical section of theAnthroposophical society. Those attendingcamped on the school grounds and were catered for byRosemarie Glasby. The content of the conference was anexploration of theconnection betweenthe Cosmos and theEarth carver), Rosemarie and LaurieToogood (local artists), Morgan Taubert(percussionist and story teller), Lennie Messing(actor dancer), Marissa Brandenburg dance teacher), Dennis Millar (mathemati-cian), David Bowden (physicist), KatherineEllis (circus artist), and others who exploredthe polarities of Stars and Earth and theirconnections not only in the outer world but inthe human being. The evening programs, which were open to the wider school community, began with aCom\u00e9dia play directed by Delia SaundersSexton and presentations from young people,(former students and others) who have beenable to realise their ideas (similar to the worldof stars) and bring them down to earth(stones). These included a small group ofgraduates from Mt Barker Waldorf School whohave built a medical clinic in deserts ofEthiopia during their University vacations.Another young person talked about his workin East Timor for the last 4 years introducingpermaculture gardening techniques to ruralvillages there. The second evening saw a wonderful concert organised by two Mt Barker students,Max McHenry and Alex Walker Symonds. It displayed the musical talents of students fromall the schools in a wonderful evening ofmusic. On the third night, a former student from Mt Barker, Zeshi Fisher led the group through a labyrinth she created as part of her year 12 project. The walk was accompanied by themusic of crystal singing bowls, didgeridoo andpiano. On the last evening\u2014Wednesday, there was a Stone laying ceremony, and circle-dancing leadby local artist Kath Goodall with live music bySonya Mellor and her group. One outcome of the conference was a Stone observatory made up of 11 carvedstones in a circle approximately 20m indiameter, which will become a resource forAstronomy lessons in the whole school. It stands as a reminder of the lasting connection between the world of light and movement inthe heavens and the weight and inertia of theearth. This inertia was overcome by the socialheart-forces of a community of peopleinspired to create this little monument on theEarth during those four days.

SophiaVision is a process that grew out of last year's conference, where fellowanthroposophists financially supported ayoung person's ability to attend theconference - not through an anonymousand impersonal donation to a pool ofmoney, but through soul-to-soul conver-sation and human interaction with theindividual receiving the monies. The program enabled many young people to attend last year's conference thatwouldn't have otherwise been able to.Consequently we had people come fromall over Australia to participate in thedeveloping community of young peoplestriving to know themselves throughAnthroposophy. Many surprising friend-ships and initiatives have grown throughthis. Check out our website at www .youthconf erence .org/austr alia. I am writing to invite you into the program on behalf of younger peopleexploring Anthroposophy. If you were anactive sponsor in last year's program, youmay wish to continue to sponsor thesame person or you may have a new wayyou would like to sponsor. Some of youexpressed an interest to participate earlierthis year at the annual conference. If you are willing, this is how it works. 1 Individuals (i.e. you) express interest to sponsor a young person, record-ing your details on a private SponsorList with me . Details will include full name and telephone and/or emailcontact, with an approximateindication of the amount you arewilling to donate, or the circum-stances you wish to support. 2 Young people in need of financial support for their conference registra-tion and/or travel costs will beoffered one (or more if needed)possible sponsors from the Sponsor List. They then initiate contact withthat potential sponsor and theconversation begins. 3 When you are content with the amount you haveinvested in thespiritual strivingof one or moreyoung will nolonger be givenout to potentialrecipients. 4 The young thesponsorshipprogram notonly with a previouslyunknown fellow spiritual seeker. Thiscould lead to many possibilities,including a profound experience ofsupport on their spiritual path,immense gratitude which may thenarise, and/or true and enduringfriendship. If you feel inspired by this initiative, have any query, question, suggestion, orwould like to register your commitmentto be a SophiaVision sponsor, pleasecontact me. We warmly invite you and your inner- youth(!) to join us in being part of adeepening and hope-filled vision Read, Australia Painting by Chuck Andrade. 12A Glimpse into a Kindergarten in Aotearoa(New Zealand) Diana Bacchus, Havelock North, New Zealand Bordering a park in Havelock North, through which flows one of the many streamsfrom the nearby sacred Te Mata hills, is theMangarau kindergarten, affiliated with theTaikura Rudolf Steiner School in Hastings,New Zealand or Aotearoa (Land of the LongWhite Cloud). As well as having many edibleplants and trees, our large garden hosts manyplants that are native to Aotearoa, includingharakeke . Although this is commonly called flax it is actually a lily and does not belong to theflax family. Harakeke has long been treasured by Maori people and its uses are manifold - leavesprovide fibres for clothing, mats, baskets andtwine; roots are used for medicines; andflowers, filled with nectar for native birds, wereused for face powder. For several years I asked myself, \"what in my kindergarten room expresses that we are inAotearoa and not elsewhere in the world?\" Lastyear I shared my thoughts and ideas with MoeBlack who works with me. She instantly relatedto them and, with her own Maori heritage, wasable to enrich my ideas as we worked togetherto enhance the environment in which thechildren play and work. Respecting Maoriwisdom, we consulted local Maori people during this process and kindergarten parentswere also kept up to date with what washappening. Firstly, we wished to bring something to the dolls', or family area that was protective,embracing and had a connection with the earthand the heavens. After discussing differentways we decided to take the Maori theme ofRanginui, the Sky Father, and Papatuanuku, theEarth Mother. Maori legends tell of theirseparation and the creation of light and spaceand all that exists therein. We also decided to represent the curved Pacific home and the traditional Maori house,not by replication, but by artistic metamorphosisthat was suitable to this specific space and place. Ranginui, the Sky Father is depicted by the arching harakeke (flax) heavens with stars,including a cluster of stars for Matariki(Pleaides). Apart from showing the changingseasons, (for its re-appearance on the horizonin winter marks the beginning of the Maorinew year), Matariki is a place where, in Maoritradition, the spirits dwell. The Earth Mother, Papatuanuku is represented with the hand-woven Samoanmats on the wall and floor (which bring in awider Pacific perspective), and the slightlyrounded branches of a tree, that give theimpression of a house. At the top of this thereis a sculpture, made by a harakeke weaver,which spirals back and forth between heavenand earth. These concepts relate not only to Maoridom but also to my studies of RudolfSteiner's Anthroposophy. Rudolf Steinerspeaks of the domed vault of heaven wherethe fixed stars dwell and the Gods weave toand fro. The heavenly vault relates to thehuman head and to thinking, so we have 12fixed stars representing the zodiacal signs, plus7 smaller Matariki stars which are also fixed. Rudolf Steiner relates the moving planets to the chest, heart and lungs, the central orrhythmic system - we have seven hanging starsto represent the main planets. The earth relatesto the physical human limbs. On the earth welive and work, and the three fold human body(head, heart and hands) becomes a temple intowhich the divine can enter. Rudolf Steinerindicates that the feelings in which we must livein order to practice the great art of life,pedagogy, are brought to life only through anobservation of the cosmos/universe and itsconnection with the human being. Harakeke has long beentreasured by people andits uses are manifold . . . .13What has been created is filled with meaning and is, therefore, not merely anarbitrary decoration just to make the roomattractive. It was a joy for Moe and me to work on this, during kindergarten sessions. The childrenexperienced two people working together withpurpose and direction. The children followedprogress as it took place, and even though wedid not tell them of its deeper meanings, theyimitated the mood of respect that theyexperienced and now that it is completed, theyaccept it unconsciously as part of their environ-ment. Working with harakeke during kindergarten session times meant that the children werenearby, playing or watching as we prepared,plaited and constructed. We respected Maoritraditions associated with harakeke, so childrensaw us cut the long leaves in a certain way; noone ever stepped over, or on the harakeke;children did not play with harakeke and off-cutswere not burnt, but bundled together andplaced under the harakeke plants. I hope this article inspires others to contemplate their local environments moredeeply and come up with their own ideas andcreativities. References Pendegrast, M, (1987) Fun with Flax .

Thank you to everyone for help in keeping the school supplied with Waldorf educationalmaterials, such as water colour paint, colouredchalk, beeswax and wooden coloured pencils. Ifyou are traveling to Nepal and can make room inyour luggage to slip in some water colour paint,wooden pencils or coloured blackboard chalk wewould really appreciate it. It's a challenge to keepthese supplies on hand for the school, especiallyfor 115 children! We deeply thank CON's child sponsors for their most generous and ongoing commitmentto help the school and children. To childsponsors who have recently joined our program,we send a huge welcome and thanks from theTashi Waldorf School community. In June youwill receive by post an annual progress report foryour sponsor child. If your report doesn't arriveplease let us know so we can re-mail it. With thenew school year which started in May there are 40children who are in need of sponsorship at theschool, so please, if you can pass the wordaround in your communities, we really needyour help! For those sponsors whose sponsor child left the school at the end of the last school yearin April we thank you for your patience andunderstanding. It has been yet another year ofpolitical instability in Nepal. For the schoolcommunity this means unstable lives for thechildren's families and therefore the children.Over the past several years, thousands offamilies have relocated to Kathmandu feelingthat it is safer than remaining in their villages.With the recent return to democracy and aceasefire declared by the Maoists, some familieshave decided to return to their villages in ruralNepal. Parents who are working as labourersoften relocate within the valley to live at thefactory where they have been able to find work.Unfortunately the school is not financially able tooffer school bus service to the entireKathmandu Valley. Waldorf education is stillnew to the community and very different frommain stream education in Nepal. The majorityof the school's parents have never attendedschool themselves. Constantly working to bringa deeper understanding to the parent commu- nity is a challenge that will take time. We would like to introduce you to one of our \"pashmina ladies\", Phyllis Townley ofVictoria, British Columbia. Phyllis is Heather'saunt godmother, affectionately called\"Deedee\" by her family. \"Didi\", a Nepaliword, is used to respectfully address one's older sister or an older woman. AlthoughDeedee has been battling cancer over the pastyears this hasn't stopped her from sellingpashmina to help the school. With the helpof her family and friends she has hostedmany pashmina parties and has helped theschool enormously. Deedee now needs toretire from being a pashmina lady due to herhealth. We send her our greatest love andthanks for her most determined help all theseyears. Heather's in Canada andGermany. For this we are so very grateful. Lastly, Heather writes her goodbye to all of you: \"I would like to thank each of you for the encouragement and help you have given to meover the past 6 years. It is because of your helpto the school that I have been able to sleep mostnights knowing that the school will continue togrow and flourish. As the Trustees, Manage-ment Committee, Eva, Rajendra and Rachel takeon their new roles at the school, and the teacherscontinue to deepen their work in Waldorfeducation, I truly thank you for the support Iknow you will continue to give to everyone atthe school. I will always carry deeply within me the experience of how children have healed at theschool. When many children first arrive, there isno light in their eyes or they carry anger, or theyare disengaged from the world. Over time, be it6 months, a year, a year and a half, the lightbegins to shine as the children open to theworld, feel the love around them and experiencetrust. We all must ensure that this continues. I also will carry the love everyone has so generously shown to the school. Thank you forgiving me such special experiences and examplesto live by. I now look forward to joining manyof you in becoming a Tashi Waldorf Schoolambassador.\" With warm wishes and so very many thanks, Heather. We would like to thank everyone for supporting Children of Nepal and TashiWaldorf School. We need your help more thanever as the school moves into the next phase ofdeepening its roots in Nepal. With morechildren to support and the land to buy, we havesome big challenges ahead. Nevertheless, we arenot daunted as we know the school is so neededin helping the children of Nepal. Over the past severalyears, thousands offamilies have relocatedto Kathmandu feelingthat it is safer thanremaining in theirvillages.17I have the privilege to work for the Swiss based Anthroposophic Medicine Foundation,which is an organization developed to supportthe Medical Section at the Goetheanum. Myrole is defined as Asia Pacific project manager,with the aim to support the development ofAnthroposophic medicine in our region andwould like to share with you news of one ofthe Foundation projects in Nepal. I have been traveling to India each summer for the last 3 years to support the InternationalPost graduate Medical Training lead byMichaela, and through these visits I met upwith the managers and pioneer of a leprosy carecentre in Kathmandu. These contacts, KrishnaGurung and Marianne Gropietch respectively,invited Michaela Gloeckler (leader of theMedical Section at the Goetheanum) to cometo Kathmandu to see for herself the centre theyhave developed. They had previously invitedDr, Antony Underwood, who had come totwo of the India based trainings, myself andDr. Lakshmi Prasanna (pediatrician,Hyderabad), however commitments hadprevented us from forming a team at the time. Michaela did visit the centre and came away with a strong vision of needing to develop amedication regime of anthroposophicremedies to assist with the peripheral nervedamage caused by the leprosy illness. Leprosy is a bacterial illness, and there are different strands. If given adequate medication,the bacterial process is brought to an end, but itis often too late, or too little. People may betreated to stop the infectious aspect of thedisease, however, they will have already suffereda \"stocking\" type anaesthesia of the peripherallimbs, and their eye lid muscles, amongst otherthings. In Nepal, it is a clear social stigma tohave leprosy. People are rejected by their ownfamilies and by their village and are often forcedto live in a cave, or outside a community. Theyoften beg for a living, sheltering aroundtemples as a best source of food and income topay for their medication. Many travel far intoIndia to seek treatment. It is a tragic sight to see how reduced a human being becomes after so much rejectionand difficult living. Many first felt theirsymptoms, perhaps a patch on their skin, orloss of sensation in a limb, in their teens, andhave been without true support for many years. There are the lucky ones, who have familysupport, whether amongst the immediate, orextended family, who actively sought medicalintervention for them, and assisted them makea living. In the Hindu culture of Nepal, theleper is denied the same Hindu cremation ritesas the rest of the community has access to, andinstead must be buried without ceremony. Marianne Grospietch was in Nepal, running a small hospital she had funded, andbecame aware of the plight of many leprosy-affected people. In 1992 she began a smallcentre to care for 13 people - Shanti SewaGriha. She soon realized that it is rarely oneperson that is welcomed into the community,as often there are husbands or wives, andchildren who also need to be embraced. Thecentre now cares for over 1,100 people,including 200 children. It has grown from onecentre to 4 - Gaushala which has an outpa-tients clinic as well as providing accommoda-tion, workshops, kindergartens, nursery andcare centres, Budhanilkantha, consisting ofmud-brick apartments made by the residentsthemselves, a Steiner school and disabilitycentre, malnutrition centre and organic gardens,Sundarijal, with gardens and housing, andTilganga - a kitchen for the poor, shantyhousing, and vegetable gardens. As one of my first tasks for her, Michaela asked me to visit Kathmandu to teach somesimple nursing techniques so they could beprepared for the introduction of furtherinterventions down the track. I visited with Dr.Lakshmi, and we gave workshops for 2 days.Since then the idea of a 3 year project hasdeveloped. We are forming teams of medicaland allied health practitioners to visit at leasttwice a year under the auspices of theAnthroposophic Medicine Foundation. Thefirst official visit was in January-February thisyear. The next is due in September. We wereprivileged to have Michael Kokinos join usfrom the Northern Territories of Australia. Hiswork in community education and physio-therapy with disabled children was an enor-mous help. We also had Dr. Lakshmi there,developing community health programmes forthe children and Anne Joris, who developedintensive wound care management practicesand nurse training in this field. What did we meet there? Skin care issues are rife amongst leprosy affected people. Giventhe lack of feeling, the feet often develop deepulcers which in turn can lead to bone infectionsand it is this which causes the need for Shanti Sewa Griha,Kathmandu, Nepal Sue Scott, Sydney, Australia Leprosy care centre managersand pioneers, Krishna Gurungand Marianne Gropietch.Shanti Sewa Griha in Kathnamdu, Programs Vallaki has become a part time supplementarytraining institute, primarily during the months ofDecember/January and July/August. It is supportedby private donations at present. Vallaki conducted thefollowing workshops during January 2006: 1. A Workshop given by Gail Lescher from California, USA on \"How Nature, Outdoors building projects and Artistic Activities relate to the 1 st to 8th Grade Child,\" at the Vallaki Hall. Gail Lescher, a Waldorf Grade School teacher took us through a wonderfuljourney how nature and the Waldorf curriculumare inextricably interwoven. She spoke at lengthabout the Seasons in relation to the Earth andwhat Festivals really signify - which was veryenriching! Many teachers from the schoolsfollowing Steiner's methodology were present andwere immensely inspired to take what they learntback to their schools and children. 2. Solo Eurythmy Performance and Classical Carnatic Music, at the in evening fundraiser tosponsor Jan's trip visit and mentor IndianWaldorf schools. The first half of the evening wasa solo performance of Eurythmy by Jan Baker-Finch to music and spoken literature, and thesecond half of the evening was devoted to ClassicalCarnatic music. During her stay in India Janworked with teachers, students, doctors andparents in presenting a picture of classroomEurythmy for the first through eighth grade classes.She taught workshops at both the InternationalPost-Graduate Medical Training (IPMT) inHyderabad, as well as this year's Kolisko Confer-ence. She was a wonderful asset to the Waldorfcommunity during her stay. 3. A Workshop by Peter Glasby on Electricity in Classes 6 to 8, at Abhaya School. Peter introducedthe class 7 & 8 children to Electrostatics (amber),Electric current (flow of current, fuses and earthingor grounding), as well as voltaic cells (wet & drybatteries) over 4 days. He traced the history of staticelectricity and how it was discovered. The experi-ments he conducted in static electricity by charging/amputations, rather than the leprosy itself. There is also the poor nutrition which adds tothe scenario of poor tissue nourishment, andof course the long term social deprivationsthese people may have suffered. There are alsoparaplegics, who do not have adequatespecialized seating, are on wheelchairs but liveon the second story so must be carried downto go anywhere, have no fresh running water(the water in the centre is not usable forwashing), and have little awareness of pressurepoints, so their ulcers were extremely deep andat times infected. The children suffer largely from parasites, as seen in the dullness in their skin, and chronicundernourishment, as seen in their lack ofgrowth. They have many respiratory infections.They are cold, often running barefoot on coldand wet concrete floors in the middle of aKathmandu winter. The disabled children lackdeveloped programmes of care and stimulation. What else did we meet? Extraordinary dignity and humour, people making the mostof their situation, being engaged in work andearning an income they would not otherwise beable to receive. They have a home, spareclothing, and a possibility to have their childreneducated. They effectively manage, with thehelp of relentless energy from Marianna,Krishna and other key staff, who see that allmembers of the community are their family,and as such focus on building self esteem anda sense for beauty and life. Marianne began an association in Germany to act as a channel for fund raising. A hugeamount is now needed each month, as theGaushala centre is leased and they mustcontinue there until their new centre iscompleted in 3 years time. Marianne is tirelessin her efforts to raise income. The Foundation is seeking support funding to bring anthroposophic medicine tothis community. We are working on having theFoundation registered in Australia, and in themeantime any donations toward this projectwould be greatly appreciated and be directedto Switzerland: UBS AGKto. 233-683673.01ZSwift for more information.Website: www .shanti-le A huge amount is nowneeded each asthe Gaushala centre isleased and they mustcontinue there untiltheir new centre iscompleted in 3 yearstime.19discharging a student and an OHP plastic film, were thought provoking. Phenomenological conceptsand practical work with lead accumulators/dry cellswere presented and the students/teachers lovedevery minute of his work. A few high schoolteachers from other Waldorf schools observed hisclasses. We hope he will be able to return and spendmore time with us in January 2007. 4. A workshop on Electrostatics, Electromagne- tism and Accumulators by Peter Glasby, for Highschool teachers, at Vallaki hall. We had a group ofabout 15 teachers from Sloka, Abhaya, and DikshaSchools attending this workshop. Peter took usthrough various ideas, concepts and practical workrelated to static electricity, electromagnetism, andstored electricity. We were told stories about howtelegraphy was born through Samuel Morse in the19 th century and how members of the American Congress witnessed its working during itsBaltimore convention. A signaling device (electro-magnet) was made to demonstrate how messageswere sent through Morse code over telegraph wires.Prior to this Peter showed us some wonderfulexperiments in electromagnetism through aspontaneously constructed doorbell and itstheoretical working. Compasses, current carryingwires were also used to demonstrate the right handand left hand thumb rules. We were also asked toput small zinc and copper plates in our mouths,which were interconnected with, copper wiresexternally and our group was able to light up anLED. An electrified group then was asked abouteach ones individual experience about the taste ofthe electrodes! This was then carried forward intothe working of lead acid batteries. A grand finalewas the demonstration of a crude radio withoutbatteries on the last day. We were able to pick up thelocal Hyderabad radio station. Peter gave noexplanations about this and some of us hope hewill bring it up during his next visit in 2007! 5. A Series of Workshops given by Rosemarie Glasby, at Vallaki Hall . \"Craft in Waldorf Schools with an Indian Perspective\" was presented by Rosemarie Glasby with her vast experience in craftconducted a workshop on Handwork andStitching for teachers of different schools. Theteachers were given a frame and asked to choose apattern with a backdrop and had to demonstrategreat dexterity to complete the design in chainstitch. Teachers liked the workshop conducted byher and look forward to her next visit. She alsovisited a couple of schools like Prerana and Abhayaand worked with craft teachers in both schoolsduring the morning to deepen the understandingof craftwork in these schools.6. A Lecture for Waldorf Parents by Peter Glasby, at Vallaki hall. \"Does Waldorf Education meet theneeds of Children in India today? A Comprehensive Overview of Waldorf Schooling and Community Building.\"Peter took us through a wonderful journey of howa Waldorf and particularly a Waldorf High Schoolevolves. The concept, practical and experiential work astudent must undergo to participate in his/hercommunity, place and time, was explained in greatdetail. To connect with the group and develop adeeper understanding, Peter used an insightfulpower point presentation, with many photographsof students in various classes and real life situations- as in finding/reaching a particular spot after usingthe tools of Surveying, spending time learning tobuild a boat, etc! We had about 50 teachers, parents,and other interested participants during this session.At the end a lively discussion ensued in the group asto whether this system was elitist and/or practical forthe present generation of Indian children. The following reports given below, of various Anthroposophical activities, are not part of the Vallakiinitiative and have been organized by different groups likeSloka School, Anthroposophical Medical Society andother private endeavours. A forest walk in Silent Valley, Kerala with Peter Glasby, class 8 students, and teachers ofAbhaya School. It was a wonderful idea of Peter Glasby to undertake a forest walk with the students of Class8 of Abhaya School, Hyderabad, India. A fewparents and teachers took this idea forward byorganizing a trip that began at the HyderabadRailway Station with a whole bunch of boisterousand excited adolescents heading to Bangalore. Abrief stopover for a day at Bangalore and thejourney resumed to Palghat, Kerala. The groupreached its final destination of Mukkali ForestStation at around 2 AM. The first day in the forest began at 9 AM with 3 jeeps and a group of 24 individuals driving alonga winding dirt path having a dense growth of treesin valley and hills. The tree cover varied from 20 to60 meters in height with a flora that was abundantwith ferns like Cyanthea gigantica , bracket and plate fungi of all types. The oldest tree which was about900 years when it came crashing down one day inthe year 2000 was a sight to see and climb aroundalong the slope. It took us about an hour of thisjourney at 20 kms per hour to reach our finaltrekking paths at the Silent Valley Forest camp atabout 1500 meters above mean sea level. We allclimbed a 50-meter tower overlooking the gorgeand the river Kunti. The view was breathtakingwith the water flowing in the valley and dense We were told storiesabout how telegraphywas born throughSamuel Morse in the19 th century how members of theAmerican Congresswitnessed its workingduring its Baltimoreconvention.20grasslands and forest peaks; virgin forests at its pristine best. Silent Valley is one of the bestprotected flora and fauna sanctuaries in the worldtoday and has the endangered Lion Tailed Macaque,which was the sole reason why the hydro-electricstations planned in the 1980's, were cancelled by thegovernment of India, due to intense pressurefrom environmentalists. Our guide Usunar was amodern day version of Col. Clink with his tersecommands, ' This is silent valley not violent valley,' when the children became a little to loud with theirexcited chatter. We walked about 2 kms down ahilly path to reach the river across a dilapidated butfunctional suspension bridge. The river wasinviting and a few intrepid students and adultstook a dip in the crystal clear water. The wonderfulday ended with a jeep ride back to the forest stationand a report writing period followed by a gamecalled 'George,' and a wonderful rendering of ' A tale of two cities ' by Peter, for the children to take into their nightlife. A trek through the forest. Days two and three followed in quick succession with longer treks in different parts ofthe forest with experiences of a deer skeleton, frog'seggs, wild pepper, cardamom, spore ferns, bulbuls,lion tailed macaque's, swimming points, leeches(ugh) and rides on top of the jeep with a pan-oramic view of the forest. The days always endedwith the reports, a game and a story. The groupwas desperate to see wild elephants but the closestwe got was giant droppings of an elephantine kindalong the dirt tracks. To make up for this miss wedecided to visit Guruvayoor temple (about 170kms from Mukkali), which had 62 elephants livingwith their mahouts near the temple. It was afantastic sight to see these giant animals fromvarious parts of the country. A few of us visitedthe temple while the rest had a rendezvous withfishermen on the western coast and their catch. Alltoo soon it was time to start back and the studentswished it could have been longer. Plans for next year's visits included the treks in the Himalayas, stayand fish with fishermen in a mangrove forests nearthe Bay of Bengal, and the like!

Themorning lectures provided as base on whichwe could understand the development of thechild from infancy through adolescence andthe entry to adulthood. From these lectureswe were able to move into discussion groupsthat were oriented towards different aspectsof child development. Some of the topics forthese groups were Health and Educationthrough the Twelve Senses, Meeting the needsof growing children, The Inspiration inInteractive Learning, and Natural Sciences forAdolescents. Artistic activities followed in theafternoon, and allowed for the participants tolearn and appreciate through first handexperience what it is to move through acreating process, whether it be painting,woodworking, eurythmy, form drawing,speech or singing.

Woodworking workshop. Overall the Indian Kolisko Conference brought something to everyone. Whether itwas the realization of something that hadbeen hidden inside and had finally come intothe light of understanding, or simply a newskill or idea we came out with a changedattitude towards our work in many areas oflife. We were provided with something tothink on, to let settle into our beings over thenext few month, while we look forward andbring the words into action. The conferenceended with some wonderful performances bythe artistic singing, rhythmic movements,speech, puppetry and woodwork groups.

Manypeople are fluent in English and several arequite capable translators, including Yoshimi Noda and Naoko Nakamura, who spoke forme as I taught three courses concurrently forthree weeks in May and June of 2006. Michael College is part of the Hibiki-no- Mura Community that includes Sunny HillsFarm, a Biodynamic effort, Raphael School, asmall school for young children \"in need ofspecial care,\" and Forest Bay Kindergarten,that services a small group of staff members'children. There is a large and impressive eurythmy hall, a science building, plus themain building which houses the office, twoclassrooms, and the \"Rainbow Caf\u00e9.\" The Torii in Kamagawa, Japan.23latter has a full kitchen and dining area with a stunning view of the bay and three nearbyvolcanoes. There are two small dormitoriescapable of housing sixteen to eighteensingle students each. These have a commu-nal kitchen and dining area also with awonderful view. Each dorm has a washingmachine and dryer. There are also four\"cabins\" for families and a couple of twostory houses for staff and larger families.There is an outdoor meeting place with afire pit, a small kitchen, and restroomfacilities that is called \"Keith Camp-ground,\" named for yours truly by theYouth Section program after my visit andcamping with them in the fall of 2002. Inthe center of the campus there is a seventiered flow-form that pours into a goodsized pond. The community was founded by Yuko Omura and friends in 1998. It began byestablishing a Saturday educational programfor children that evolved into Izumi Gakko, afull on Waldorf school with classes fromkindergarten through high school. To thiswas added courses for adults: Nature, Arts,and Anthroposophy\u2014 a foundation year ofstudy that leads to a second year for teachertraining and/or biodynamic training. In addition to speaking with many academic and medical groups, the pioneeringfounder of this amazing effort, YukoOmura, is the primary administrator as wellas teacher of Waldorf and other foci ofAnthroposophy. Her son Jiro, along with afull time and part time staff of capablepeople, puts in long hours in the commodi-ous office upstairs in the main building. Other faculty members include a BD farmer, plus numerous visiting teachers fromEurope, Australia, Japan, and the USA. HelgaMichaels is the regular visiting eurythmistfrom Germany. An experienced handworkteacher from southern Honshu came duringmy stay there. In the summers Hibiki-no-Mura offers a series of very successful workshops thatattract hundreds of people from all overJapan. These workshops have been life-changing experiences for a number of peopleas have the academic courses. My task during my stay included introducing the foundation year studentsto \"The Nature of the Human Being,\" anda course titled \"Artistic ExpressionThrough the Grades of a Waldorf School.\"With the teacher trainees I shared twenty- As always when oneteaches, one learns agreat deal, even whenthe subject matter hasbeen covered severaltimes before. nine years of experience as a class teacher inpresenting the curriculum of grades onethrough eight. As always when one teaches, one learns a great deal, even when the subject matter hasbeen covered several times before. As\"education\" can be seen as a \"drawing forth\"(from the Latin, educare, to draw out), I offer thanks to those students at Michael Collegefor \"drawing forth\" from me some of theinsights of my journey in anthroposophy(human wisdom), with additional deepappreciation for the spiritual knowledge andwisdom of Rudolf Steiner. As I am completing this essay in Kyoto, Japan, on my last day in this fabulouscountry I find myself in the home of aformer student from the Hibiki-no-Muracommunity (Michiko Nayasin). She and herfamily have been exceptionally gracious andhospitable. Earlier in the week I was near Hiroshima with another former student (Mutsuki Sasaki)and her family. The latter took me on a fullday trip to the Bomb Site, where the hope forpeace in the world is kept alive by themonument to the young victim Sadako andher legendary \"thousand origami cranes.\" Thenumber displayed at that memorial mustnow be well over a million. Walking throughthe nearby museum, with its relatively newadditional building, was an experience not tobe forgotten. I was near tears on severaloccasions at the tasteful yet powerful displaysand photographs. The time with both families was punctu- ated by musical sharings on the piano, guitarand a family string ensemble. In Kyoto,Michiko and her husband, Yoshi, guided methrough quite a number of amazinglybeautiful shrines and temples, plus taking meto the holy mountain, Mt. Kurama, whereReiki was born. I was not only impressed bythe spiritual power and serenity of theseplaces, but that there were so many \"pil-grims\" visiting these locations. Finally, they took me to the Kyoto Rudolf Steiner School that, in its six yearsof existence, now extends from kindergartenthrough high school. As a thirty-three yearveteran of this movement I was thoroughlyimpressed with this sincere, beautifulexpression of Waldorf education. It, muchlike Hibiki-no-Mura, the Peace Park inHiroshima, and the holy places of Kyoto,gives one hope for the future of human-kind.24 stooddown in 2004 and Karl Kaltenbach stooddown at the end of 2005.

Also, Waldorf teacher training has beenestablished in India, Thailand, Philippines andTaiwan. The APIG and the Waldorf Round Table meetings in August 2003, Bangkok planned the first Asia Teachers' Conference , which took place in April 2005 in Taiwan. This was a greatsuccess and it is supported by the PedagogicalSection at the Goetheanum.

The initiative to form a delegates meeting (Asia-Pacific Initiative Group or APIG)\u2014onecould also call it a \"council of theAnthroposophical Societies active in Asia-Pacific\"\u2014was initially taken at a meeting in Dornach by the following AnthroposophicalSociety circle soon grew with theaddition of VanJames (Chairperson of the Hawaiian Society, Nicanor Perlas(Philippines), Aban Bana (India), Hong Kong (Ghamin Siu), and June Yu (Taiwan ). We had our first regional meeting in Manilla in 1996 as the first APIG (Asia-PacificInitiative group) meeting. The task we setourselves was to facilitate the growthof Anthroposophy in Asia-Pacific and to support Waldorf schools, biodynamic agriculture, anthroposophical medicine, threefolding, and a renewal of the arts and sciences.This group grew over the years and hasnow about 16 members, including twoExecutive Council members of the General Anthroposophical Society at the Goetheanum: Paul Mackay and Cornelius Pietzner. This group meets as often as we can. At the beginning it met yearly but lately the frequencyhas been a bit less. We hope, as from April2007 to resume a yearly meeting. Out of the APIG initiative, annual Asia- Pacific Anthroposophical Conferences were held, organized by a so-called \"ContinuityGroup.\" The members of this group were, bycountry: Australia (Karl Kaltenbach), JapanDr. Conference inBangkok, Thailand.25www.anthromedia.net The authoritative database about anthroposophy now also in English The representative website about anthro- posophy, anthroposophical activities andinstitutions - launched its new English-language version on 1 May 2006.

Koetzsch, editor Renewal MagazineNorth American ArtTrainingsDirectoryNowAvailable The Council of the Art Section of the School of Spiritual Science in North America hasbeen increasingly concerned about the decreasing number ofpossibilities for students to acquire an anthroposophical training in the visual arts in NorthAmerica, particularly with the disappearance of several former three-to-five-year training programs similar to those available in Europe. Therefore, we have publisheda 26-page booklet directory of training and study possibilities that do exist as an aid to would-be students of anthroposophically inspired training in painting andsculpture. In this booklet the Art Section Council has been pleased to see the surprisingly rich variety of studypossibilities available, especially in painting (although, unfortunately, there are not yet any in architecture). The majority of these listings are individual artists who arewilling and interested in taking on students for varying periods of artistic study. The booklet also lists contact information for artistic trainings known to us in Europethat will accommodate English-speaking students. We hope to issue periodic updates to this directory as new study opportunities arise or existing situations change.We encourage feedback and information on additional training possibilities not included.
