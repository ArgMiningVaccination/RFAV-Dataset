For this we will need your help. As an association of people of many coun t ries, languages and cultural regions the Anthroposophical Society and many institutions inspired by Rudolf Steiner have spread across the whole world. To create a newsletter for as many of the more than 40,000 members as possible and promote a shared awareness regarding questions of anthroposophy requires multilingualism and the use of emails and the internet. Reaching as many members as possible The historical supplement for members, \u00abWhat is happening in the Anthroposophi - cal Society\u00bb, published in German and sent out ever since the Christmas Conference of 1923/1924 to everyone subscribing to the weekly journal Das Goetheanum , was gradually transformed into Anthroposophy Worldwide after Michaelmas 1998. Now it reaches around 18,000 members world - wide and is presently published in German, English and Spanish. After the 2018 Annual General Meeting at the Goetheanum, Anthroposophical So - cieties in many countries expressed their wish to receive more information on what is happening in the General Anthroposophical Society and in the School of Spiritual Science. This shared awareness and participation is to become possible for many more members in the future! It can be achieved today via email and the internet which means that there will be no expensive printing and dispatching and the most remote places can be reached be - cause most members have internet access. We will make sure, however, that printed versions go out to those who wish for this (subject to a charge).

On the other hand, three themes merit drawing attention to because they were not self-evident at the outset, when planning the gathering, when the speakers prepared without cross-refer - encing with one another, or in the material when presented. Culminating in the Christmas Conference The first was the huge span of history from the Fifth Atlantean period to the current Fifth Post-Atlantean period, and the mo - mentum that such a journey gives rise to and on which, as it were, one can ride out to meet the incoming, and at times inrushing, future. For the anthroposophical movement has a date with destiny, which it is not sure that it will be able to meet. Separated from the deed of Rudolf Steiner for which the Christmas Conference provided the vehicle, it is unclear if the logic currently guiding it is from this or the other side of the threshold, from earthly organisational concepts or those that informed Rudolf Steiner's actions. The second was the context that this vast panorama gave to more close-to facets, in this case the destinies of Ita Wegman and Marie Steiner. Not as personalities with the frailty of anyone who is touched by or touches history, but as examples of the complexity and fraughtness of hu - manity's karma, - from which no one can expect to be immune. The third theme, and perhaps the most important one for our times, was the way in which the inherent logic and purpose of the initiation process, especially \u00e0 la Hi - bernia, evolves with supreme consistency, albeit accommodating the incisions of the many spiritual battles along the way. And how this logic and purpose finds a certain culmination within the Deed of Rudolf Steiner, enacted as it was through the refounding of the Anthroposophical Society at the 1923 Christmas Conference. It wells up within that event, giving rise to financial and legal subtleties that a future humanity will one day look back upon with wonder. They will see the extent to which Rudolf Steiner understood the rights life and economic life of our times in a depth that few today seem to have any inkling of. Foundation Stone and Building Ignore this aspect of the Christmas Confer - ence or eclipse it with earthly organisa - tional methods, and the risk is great that the Anthroposophical Movement - neither unto itself nor as representative of wider humanity - will not find its way out of the cul-de-sac in which it seemingly currently finds itself. It is perhaps a mystery in its own right that so few people seem to have noticed this dimension of Rudolf Steiner's Deed, focusing in the main instead on the Foundation Stone Meditation, rather than the 'building' erected on it. In English it is clear that a foundation stone is at the base of a building. In this case the building is the Anthroposophical Society as bearer of the School of Spiritual Science. But those few will eventually multiply, for to deny or not recognize a deed does not refute or undo it. It just delays the moment when its true leaves replace the cotyledons. Key in this process is for the roots to reach the water table, as it were, for then with the fullness of time the sun cross will be - come by red roses enwreathed. | Christopher Houghton Budd, Folkestone ( gb), treasurer of the Anthroposophical Society in Ireland anthroposophy worldwide Anthroposophy Worldwide appears ten times a year, is distributed by the national Anthroposoph - ical Societies, and appears as a supplement to the weekly Das Goetheanum Publisher General Anthroposophical Society, represented by Justus Wittich Editors Sebastian J\u00fcngel (responsible for this edition ), Michael Kranawetvogl ( responsible the M. respon - sible agency - work Anthroposophy ( nna ).

Does this have to surprise or even annoy us? In the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung (19/20/21 May 2018) the British Indian writer Salman Rushdie claims that \u00abin the nineteenth century, there was relatively wide-spread consensus in the West regarding the nature of truth\u00bb. Today, he continues, it falls to the writers to \u00abestablish communication on reality between author and reader\u00bb. Editors have a similar task. Speaking of literature: in the chapter The Indian Life of his book The Glass Bead Game, the German author Hermann Hesse deals with the relationship between in - ner reality and outer events. Dasa's life unfolds in an escalation of tragic events until he reaches the lowest point and re - alizes, shocked and relieved at the same time, that \u00aball that crowded reality had been a dream!\u00bb Images contain reality. The question is 'what reality?' Could this con - flict of views be the chance to see more reality - precisely because of the diver - sity of viewpoints - than one would see if there was uniform, possibly only imagined, consensus? Could it be that consensus de - pends less on unity and more on respect for multiple approaches to life and to the implementation of anthroposophy? | Sebastian J\u00fcngelIrland: Exploring Hibernia conference Exploring Hibernia Hosted by the Anthroposophical Society in Ireland, but a joint working with the Romanian and Swiss Societies, what was in effect a research gathering took place on Inis Mor, an island off the west coast of Ireland, 13-15 April, attended by some 60 souls from Ireland, Switzerland, Ro- mania and the usa . A coast of Inis M\u00f3r Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 6/18 | 3 Dear Members, The weeks after the Annual General Meet - ing have been extremely intense at the Goetheanum. The non-affirmation of a fur - ther term of office of Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato raises the question with many members near and far, above all also among the co-workers at the Goetheanum, as to how work will continue after the agreed transitional period. The previously well- established in-house operations, as well as the connections all over the world need to be reorganized. After our first report of 13 April (see Anthroposophy Worldwide 5/2018) there now follows a second letter, allowing you to participate in the further progress. New appointments of mandates and tasks The Executive Council and the Goetheanum Leadership have defined a clearly struc - tured process for all upcoming changes. The outcomes of these analyses, evalua - tions and decision-making processes are still open in many areas, but the process is progressing steadily. At present, we still assume that the new appointments of mandates and tasks for all management areas will be finalized on 11 and 12 June at the retreat of the Goetheanum Leadership. In the deliberations it is clear that the determination of the future leadership of the General Anthroposophical Section within our School of Spiritual Science is a particular challenge. Related to this are the questions of profile, the current themes and focus of the research of this section, which is important for the overall develop - ment of the School. All this will be hard to clarify in the four weeks leading up to the retreat. Nevertheless, here too we stand by our decision regarding all the tasks at the Goetheanum: the management mandates will be reassigned at the June retreat. In the interim, Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato continue to carry out their previous respon - sibilities within the currently responsible Collegium of the Sections.Involving the members worldwide At present we are receiving many urgent messages regarding the possibility of how, in the future, members of our Society dis - tributed around the world can be appropri - ately involved in decisions of the General Assembly, e.g. in the reaffirming of Council members, amendments to the statutes or the membership subscriptions. The Goethe - anum Leadership has now mandated Ger - ald H\u00e4fner (Head of Social Sciences Section) and Justus Wittich (Member of the Execu - tive Council) to launch a process by the end of June that will lead to proposals for new forms of participation. These can then be discussed, and possibly decided upon, at the 2019 Annual General Meeting. The General Anthroposophical Society, as it exists today and has developed on a worldwide scale, should be visible and re - flected right down to the statutes. Involved in this from the outset are the nineteen General Secretaries, representing eighteen country societies on five continents. At the same time, the interaction with the other fourteen country societies (with less than 500 members) is being intensified this year. A fresh start for Faust An important decision has been made re - garding the intended next performance of Faust, scheduled for 2020. There will not be a modified repeat of Christian Peter's production of 2016/17. In discussion with all the participants of the stage ensemble and Goetheanum Leadership - as expressed in a letter of the responsible mandate group - it became clear \u00abthat it is not productive to stand in the past and at the same time want something new.\u00bb In this respect, there is now a complete restart! Due to a lack of resources for a large-scale project, there will be a shorter version in 2020 with \u00abhigh - lighted accents of important aspects of the content\u00bb. The production team which has come together consists of Andrea Pfaehler (for drama production), Isabelle Fortagne (assistant producer), Eduardo Torres (direc - tor of Eurythmy), Agnes Zehnter (artistic speech coach), Stefan Hasler (director) and Nils Frischknecht (production manager). Management and operational meetings We also want to mention that the in- house organization of the Goetheanum has been through various stages of develop - ment and upheaval since the agm . Therefore, the newly established management team: Stefan Hasler, Justus Wittich and, until June, Paul Mackay, is now dealing with the inter - departmental work processes within the organization. A weekly operational meeting with ten carrying co-workers ensures the interface of the eleven sections and the house management with the leadership. Finally, there have been a number of changes within the co-worker body, as part of this development process. For example, Martin Zweifel, the long-standing head of the Building Administration who was in recent years also responsible for the suc - cessful renovation of the Goetheanum, was elected by the Municipal Council on May 1st 2018 as director of the Construction Ad - ministration of Dornach. We congratulate him warmly and thank him for the great achievements of recent years. In the coming months we will now reorganize our Build - ing Administration department. | For the Goetheanum Leadership Ueli Hurter and Justus Wittich. English by Joan Sleigh Many questions regarding the future: the Goetheanum in transitionGoetheanum Leadership Second letter to the Members In its second letter after the 2018 Annual General Meeting the Goetheanum Leadership provides information on the transition period until its summer retreat on 11 and 12 June. Some questions are still open. A decision that has been taken is that there will be a fresh start for Faust. Goetheanum 4 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 6/18 We have received numerous letters since the Annual General Meeting of the Gen - eral Anthroposophical Society and the vote that did not reaffirm Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato, two former members of the Ex - ecutive Council. These letters addressed the situation, and some were quite conten - tious. We would like to offer a response here, if only in brief. As we reported in the last issue of the Swiss Society's newsletter, we -along with all the other leadership groups in the An - throposophical Society and the School for Spiritual Science - were asked at the end of October 2017 for our view about a possible 7-year extension of the mandates for Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato. They had already served for 22 years and 17 years respectively, and we did not recommend this further ex - tension after such a long time. Instead, we advocated for new beginnings. Each of us offered our own reasons individually and these were met with respect. Why else would opinions be solicited from colleagues? No electioneering We intentionally did not approach our Swiss members with our own thoughts about the question of a renewed, extended mandate because we - as Council members - were asked for our personal views, and we neither could nor would speak for the entire mem - bership in which there are, of course, various experiences, ideas, and hopes. In 2011, when the Goetheanum Executive Council put forward a new by-law that re - quires reaffirmation of Executive Council members every 7 years, it was the wish and will of that Executive Council to strengthen not only the leadership groups of the Society and the School, but the sense of responsibil - ity among the members as well. The Annual General Meeting is without doubt the place where the members can fulfil their respon - sibility in this regard. In our view, members must be completely free in casting their bal - lots, i.e., free to vote based on their personal knowledge and conscience alone. Before and during the meeting, it was obvious to us that we should not enter into the debates about the pros and cons. In preparing for the February 2018 Annual General Meeting of the Anthroposophical Society in Switzerland we had already con - sciously decided that questions about reaf - firming the Dornach Executive Council mem - bers would not be on the agenda during the members' meeting or the annual conference. This was done to avoid any electioneering and leave members free in the way indicated earlier. We did respond to individual inquiries and, of course, we shared our thoughts\u2014but we were careful to make clear that these were our own, individual thoughts. Council members also have a duty to decide honestly, based on knowledge and conscience - and each of us did just that. Respect and cooperation We found the procedure of surveying the responsible groups and committees and then the members to be eminently fair. Despite claims to the contrary at the Annual General Meeting and in later publications and letters we have a good working relationship with the Dornach Executive Council and many individuals in the Goetheanum Leadership. We have consistently asked members of the Goetheanum Executive Council and the lead - ership of the Sections to speak at the annual conference of the Swiss Society. These invita - tions were accepted and the contributions were quite substantive - as our members can attest. Justus Wittich, Matthias Girke, Joan and Gerald H\u00e4fner have all spoken at our recent conferences. We greatly respect the devoted work being done at the Goetheanum during a difficult political and economic-social period world - wide\u2014and we take an active part in that work. Because of our physical closeness to the Goetheanum ours is a more active role than that of any other national society. This is evident in our large February conferences at the Goetheanum which during the last several years have had themes related to the Christmas Conference 1923/24; in our partici - pation in other events at the Goetheanum; in our regular meetings and discussions; in our commitment to art at the Goetheanum; etc. However, that does not mean we are in agreement with everything, or that we must necessarily agree with everything. We view an independent and critical dialogue on dif - ficult issues as the kind of help the Goethea - num currently needs. No one is served by an unconditional loyalty paralyzed by continual concern about an imminent loss of harmony or a \u00absplit\u00bb. We can read about this in the work of Rudolf Steiner when he hoped for more attentiveness and co-responsibility, more individuality and less group pressure or group identity in regard to situations like this. Favoring a new course Our members who have followed and ac - companied our work in recent years are aware of situations in which we have repre - sented critical views: We did not agree with the dismissal of the highly talented Mirela Faldey, or with the concept for creating a \u00abmuseum at the Goetheanum\u00bb. We repeat - edly asked for a clearer representation of anthroposophy - in the public arena as well. We went through difficult crises during the attempt at a joint edition of a book on the Representative of Humanity. And in various other situations we advocated for a differ - ent anthroposophical direction. We have kept our members informed about all these matters during our member and delegate meetings. One of the many consequences of these situations was Marc Desaules' with - drawal from the meetings of the so-called extended Executive Council. Nevertheless we viewed it as improper to enter into debates over such underlying is - sues during our meetings or even during the recent Annual General Meeting. We would not have viewed reaffirmation of the two Executive Council members as any kind of catastrophe, and we would have carried on with our cooperative work. However, we did feel that we were free to vote against a con - tinued period of service and for setting a new course. We did so, taking full responsibility. Given that this was a democratic en - deavor, we have been deeply disturbed by how we have been characterized both dur - ing and after the meeting. A present-day Goetheanum Executive Council - not Ru - dolf Steiner - introduced the reaffirmation antroposophical society Switzerland Respecting, understanding and implementing the results The Council of the Anthroposophical Society in Switzerland explained its views regard- ing the vote in its newsletter Anthroposophie - Schweizer Mitteilungen. The statement also expresses willingness for continued support of the Goetheanum and working to- gether with the Executive Council. Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 6/18 | 5 The fact that the two Executive Council members Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato were not reaffirmed at the General An - throposophical Society's agm in March has elicited strong reactions in Switzerland too. The Council of the Anthroposophical Soci - ety in Switzerland therefore changed the agenda for its delegate conference at the Bern Rudolf Steiner School and invited all members in responsible positions (branch leaders, delegates, representatives) in order to clarify the situation. Foundations of judgement The discussion was open and respectful, but not without emotions. Individual members described their profound consternation at the discussions about the reaffirmation of Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato at the agm , the way this question was handled in the Main Auditorium and the negative atmosphere around the Goetheanum. Here in Switzerland, too, the growing distance to Dornach played a part ... The problem as to how one should vote on the involve - ment of individuals in an anthroposophi - cal executive body was also touched on. On what foundations should any such judgement be based? The Swiss Council was asked whether it was maybe enjoying its critical role too much. As the meeting went on, more and more of the members present expressed their gratitude for the laudable conduct of the Council which had left the Swiss members free to decide for themselves and for its ex - emplary statements on the events - even though some of them will have voted differ - ently from the four Swiss Council members. Others pointed out that those living closer to the Goetheanum were not simply nega - tive; that they often felt a particularly close connection with the Goetheanum, but had also been through difficult experiences, for instance when it came to artistic questions or the Goetheanum's staff policy. Others again did not find that the mood at the agm had been all that negative, seeing that the few shrill voices had been balanced by hundreds of calmly reflected statements. New quality of dialogue Quite a few expressed their joy - despite their consternation - at the tangible greater openness that was reflected in the greater participation of members and branches in the now changing situation at the Goethea - num. Some spoke of the positive and open conversations the branches around the Goetheanum have had with the Executive Council after the agm , before and now with Justus Wittich and Joan Sleigh, which seem to show that a new quality of dialogue can be cultivated to replace former procedures where the members were expected to nod their approval of what was presented to them. It became apparent that many of those present welcome the new situation as a chance for anthroposophical restructuring. The request to rejoin the extended meetings of the Goetheanum Executive Council and strengthen the cooperation was welcomed by the Swiss Council. The cooperation, it was said, had never been interrupted and if their participation in the extended Executive Council meetings at the Goetheanum was wished for they would be glad to accept. The meeting expressed understanding for the contradictory signals coming from the Goetheanum in recent weeks, given that it was first of all important to create continu - ity for the Goetheanum and the Society in the transition period after the agm . The new allocation of tasks will soon take place. While people were not unanimous at the end of these discussions, they felt rec - onciled and united in the wish to take on the future. Signs are pointing to coopera - tion in all directions. | Konstanze Brefin Alt, Basel ( ch)of Executive Council members. As we noted earlier, the Executive Council sought a greater sense of shared responsibility from the mem - bers. Prior to the Annual General Meeting it became apparent that the leadership groups of the Society and the School were largely in agreement with another seven-year term for Paul MacKay and Bodo von Plato - but that objections from some were being dismissed. This was also very clearly expressed during the meeting. Despite what was reported to be the view of the leadership groups, the majority of the participants at the Annual General Meeting voted otherwise. These were people who came to the Goetheanum from many countries be - cause of a sense of great personal involvement; thus the conference itself was not just \u00abSwiss\u00bb. These members wanted something different based on their own experiences and expecta - tions. These members who were present and competent form the foundation of the Society. Working for the future Enormous pressure has since been brought to bear on the Swiss Council - which has been blamed for the decision not to reaffirm. This view does not correspond in any way with what actually took place. In addition, arguments that draw parallels between the deliberately tar - geted expulsions in 1935 and this unsuccessful bid for reaffirmation (instituted and requested by the individuals themselves) are specious. We would strongly reject these kinds of one- sided and objectively false interpretations of the vote, and we completely understand the irritation and dismay felt by many members. Nonetheless when members are asked to express their views, the outcome must be re - spected and understood, and efforts must be made to implement the resulting changes. It would be important to look at these events objectively and soberly, and to work decisively for the future. We will discuss the details of these circumstances with Branch representa - tives and friends during our forthcoming del - egate conference in Bern. Of course, we are also currently in conversation with the Goethea - num Executive Council about these matters. | With cordial greetings, Marc Desaules, Clara Steinemann, Peter Selg, Johannes - Schweizer Mit - teilungen 5/2018, p. 9. Translated into English by Marguerite and Douglas MillerFrom an article published in the newslet - ter of the Anthroposophical Society in Swit - zerland (Schweizer Mitteilungen), 6/2018, abridged by the author.Switzerland Open discussion Because of the turbulences caused by the General Anthroposophical Society's 2018 Annual General Meeting the Council in Switzerland felt called upon to invite, at short notice, all leading representatives of the Swiss Anthroposophi- cal Society to its delegate conference on 28 April in Bern in order to discuss the situation. And it found support.6 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 6/18 I would like to add a few points to Peter Selg's presentation in Anthroposophy Worldwide 5/2018. As a personal statement it needs to be accepted as presented to the readers: his joy at the rehabilitation of Ita Wegman and Elisabeth Vreede, for instance, and his irritation that this was overshadowed by the emotions vented because of the non-affirmation of Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato as Executive Council members. I think that many will share these sentiments. As much honest information as possible Peter Selg stated that the reaffirmation after seven years could have been better prepared: with an in-depth statement of past activities and future plans. This is a rea - sonable thought, but it comes somewhat late. The Swiss Council stated as early as November 2017 - when preparations were still in full swing - that it was not in favour of the reaffirmation. Better procedures may have been desirable, but would obviously not have made a difference in this case. Peter Selg points out above all how taken aback he was at the \u00abvehement ar - guments\u00bb put forward by some general secretaries and country representatives during the \u00d3agm. This revealed, he said, a dangerous tendency towards \u00abcollective opinion-forming\u00bb. As a general secretary I feel this may have been aimed at me, given that I went on the stage because I felt I had to inform the members (and what would have been better, in the spirit of Ita We - gman, than presenting as much honest information as possible from all sides?) One can, of course, not contradict a feeling and I won't even try to do that. But the actual perspective presented by some \u00abfunctionaries\u00bb, myself included, can easily be overlooked. And therefore I cannot let Peter Selg's statement go unchallenged or leave it there as the final word on the matter. It seems like a strawman argument, as if pressure had been exerted by me or my col - leagues saying that non-affirmation \u00abwould be the end of the anthroposophical cause in the world\u00bb. Of course, that is not what I think and it is not what I said either; nor can I remember any of my colleagues saying anything of the kind. It is nonsense, really, but it shows what I believe to have been the case which is that Peter Selg - and possibly the entire Swiss Council - did not really hear what I (and I believe most of the general secretaries) actually said. Because it is not so much about anthroposophy in the world. Anthroposophy is there and will find its way. Practice-oriented Many individuals and institutions who wish to work out of anthroposophy do not nec - essarily want to do this in connection with the Sections (as Rudolf Steiner wished). The question is whether enough people can connect with the Anthroposophical Society. This is what the Goetheanum Leader - ship, together with the general secretaries, has been working towards for some years: the three \u00abtarget images\u00bb serve above all to rekindle the impulse of the Christmas Conference of 1923/1924 in our time and to illustrate how relevant the Goetheanum as a School of Spiritual Science is to the areas of practice. This makes the Anthro - posophical Society so important for the anthroposophical movement. We, as \u00abfunctionaries\u00bb, must be con - cerned when we have the impression that the Society is focusing too much on itself and its history, and then they even argue amongst themselves. Which (young) modern person would wish to join it un - der these circumstances? (Some young people even said as much on the Saturday morning during the agm ). This is - in my view - why we need an Executive Council and a Goetheanum Lead - ership that can draw from cooperation and from mutually complementing strengths. Paul Mackay is one of the architects and main implementers of the Goetheanum in Development project; he has been involved in the preparation of and invitations for the Goetheanum World Conference at Mich -aelmas 2016 as well as in the conception and realization of the \u00abtarget images\u00bb. His connections with institutions - not only Weleda - are an important aspect. Bodo von Plato's ability to enter into dialogue with people, however different their views, to build bridges not only to anthroposophical friends worldwide but to other cultures generally, is an indispensable asset, particularly in guarding against the accusation of sectarianism. I will keep this short, but it has not been appreciated enough that the Ex - ecutive Council and the Goetheanum Leadership - after lengthy and complex consultations - wished for an extended term in office for Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato because they believed in a fruitful cooperation (which is not neces - sarily one expected to be smooth) that would stand up to the difficult tasks ahead. How can hearing these clear and reasonable arguments set out by several speakers be \u00abcollective opinion-forming\u00bb? Respecting other views I am sorry that the Swiss Council feels it has to defend itself. But I'm also sorry that it, in my opinion, withdrew from the discussion to a certain extent, so that Peter Selg feels called upon to say in his contribution that there were no clear reasons for the argu - ment put forward (by me). I do respect that one can also see things differently, but if one withdraws from dia - logue one cannot accuse others of collectiv - ism. | Jaap Sijmons, general secretary of the Anthroposophical Society in the Netherlands antroposophical society Netherlands A question of perspective In Anthroposophy Worldwide 5/2018 Peter Selg explained the position of the Swiss Anthroposophical Society's Council with regard to the re-affirmation of Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato. Jaap Sijmons, the General Secretary of the Anthroposophical Society in the Netherlands, adds his view on the matter. Jaap Sijmons during the 2018 Annual Conference and agm Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 6/18 | 7 Practising how to deal with democracy A few years ago a procedure was introduced for the affirmation of Executive Council members. Yet, the fact that two members were not reaffirmed at the end of March led to a sense of helplessness and a few quite emotional responses. This is not surprising, since the Executive Council had wished for and recommended the reaffirmation, broadly supported by the Section lead - ers and so on, and had already planned accordingly. Does this mean that the reaf - firmation was not originally envisaged as a democratic instrument and most people had not been well enough informed of this? I don't know. At any rate, the members present thought independently - as explicitly demanded and promoted by anthroposo - phy - and a majority arrived at a result that differed from what the Executive Council expected. What shocks me now, after read - ing Anthroposophy Worldwide 4/2018 and 5/2018, is this: Parallels are constructed with Ita We - gman and Elisabeth Vreede, whose exclusion was, however, an entirely different matter. \u00abAbsurd majority decisions\u00bb (without a question mark) is the title the editors gave to one contribution, even though one has the impression that it does not really do justice to the present and generally known conditions for the reaffirmation. Bodo von Plato and Paul Mackay, I think I have read, were accused and sentenced without defence. If this choice of words is appropriate, I do believe that the two men have been wronged. Was that really the case? Accusations are made of fractions, fac - tions etc., and those who speak like that may not realize that this is exactly what they are encouraging. Sue Simpson from New Zealand was particularly clear in this respect, even speaking of \u00abworking for instead of against something\u00bb. Did those who voted 'no', in using the possibility to make a free decision to the best of their belief, work against something in what was implied to be a bad way? In Anthroposophy Worldwide 4/2018, page 11, Constanza Kaliks already seemed to suggest, I believe, that those who voted 'No' have incurred guilt (\u00abthe remedy ... is forgiveness\u00bb). Is this how one sees a membership vote at the Goetheanum? And rightly? In the same article Constanza Kaliks writes of agreements needing to be kept and that such an agreement had been made in the Executive Council etc. - those involved clearly did not consider that a majority in the Main Auditorium would feel free to ignore the recommendations from above, that, in other words, such binding agreements should only be made af - ter the members have been consulted. I come to the conclusion that, in our Society, \u00abdemocracy\u00bb - if it was intend - ed - should either be abolished again or one needs to practise how to deal with it. I am glad and grateful that the Swiss Council was allowed to make a statement in Anthroposophy Worldwide 5/2018, was even invited to make it, and that Peter Selg was given an entire page for this. I am equally happy about all other contribu - tions that deserve to be called \u00abfactual\u00bb and \u00abconstructive\u00bb. | Peter Gerber, Langnau ( ch) New forms of living Deep pain speaks out of many a reader's letter. Incredible injustice appears to have been done. The freedom of others not re - spected, no free spiritual life in Dornach? Volleys of bitter accusations from every - where - how are we to understand this? Could it be a lack of \u00abinsight\u00bb, particularly on the part of those who live further afield? A lack that casts a shadow on the de - cision-making process? How do people around the globe come by the knowledge they need? Shining visions are not enough. But if the factual foundations for making decisions are missing, our heart force will also go astray. How can it know if and where word and deed are no longer one, but are drifting apart? Could it be that not only the most ideal streams are emanating from the Goetheanum, however much we wish they were (see the carefully written testimonies of Sergei Prokofieff and Peter Selg, for instance). Do we not have to live knowing that drift - ing apart is possible, always and anywhere (with a sidelong glance at our own soul) and that social life is always about making an effort to bring the \u00abdrifting boat\u00bb back from shallow to safer waters? The exten - sive information that many people have devoted themselves to faithfully in years of quiet work (without glossy rewards) are also part of this task. I assume that some would no longer judge the difficult events at the Goetheanum so harshly if such quiet efforts which strengthen our overall con - sciousness were more visible or known. In the end we all know that true harmony can only blossom when we act selflessly out of our love for the truth, in the constant joint striving to bring light to all the work on our earthly organism which is stifled by materi - alism. Then young people, too, who are now missing harmony, will be able to see that harmony does not appear by itself but needs to be gained with ever deepening efforts. May Rudolf Steiner's universal spiritual seed grow in all of us into future social forms of living, kindling a fire in us, trans - forming us for a future brotherhood of all humankind. | Maja Schmid, Kreuzlingen ( ch) New trust On the one hand one hears members who wished to reaffirm the Council members speaking of division and separation, even of shameful behaviour. With all respect for compassionate souls: it is not the task of Council members to hold leading positions, but to devote their forces for the thriving of the cultural impulse that should radiate antroposophical society Readers' letters on the 2018 Annual General Meeting More members' voices The consequences of and responses to the non-affirmation at the 2018 agm con - tinue to be the subject-matter of letters to the editor of Anthroposophy Worldwide. While the main topics in Anthroposophy Worldwide 5/2018 were the consternation and concerns regarding the future of the Anthroposophical Society, the present is- sue focuses on the reasons for the result and the effect of some responses.8 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 6/18 out from the Goetheanum, so that it can always be a noble source for those who seek anthroposophy as a modern science of the spirit. For other members the outcome of 24 March is just right, because they saw a 15-million-Francs disaster and the Faust fias - co, to name but the most visible problems. So, there are serious concerns and there is the hope that the great responsibility of the Executive Council will move into a positive direction again, with capable individuals. When it comes to the Goetheanum and the task of representing Rudolf Steiner's spiritual science in a dignified manner in our time, we must strive for factual knowledge. At annual general meetings the community of members meets the individuals who have responsibility and are expected to justify their actions. Then it is up to the members to consider their reports, or the fact that there aren't any, earnestly and factually and either grant or deny the can - didates a further term in office. If the sentient soul, which is all too easily influenced by sympathy/antipathy, inter - feres with our contemplations, we are at risk of not founding our decisions on factual knowledge. Two Council members leaving the leadership group is a great challenge, in itself and for the Goetheanum community. I hope that the new organ of responsibil - ity will inform the members better about existing tasks and developments so that they can judge for themselves. We have shaped the past together, and we need to face the consequences together. Let us therefore decide together to give new trust to each other so that we can take well-considered steps towards the future. | Alice Huber, Romanshorn ( ch) Untiring commitment In our branch we trusted that the 2018 agm would proceed appropriately even in our absence, because we knew that Motion 1 in particular (the extension of Paul Mackay's and Bodo von Plato's terms in office) had been agreed by the Executive Council, the Goetheanum Leadership and the General Secretaries' Conference. In mid-March one of our branch mem - bers decided to travel to Dornach none - theless, which meant that, in addition to the reports in Anthroposophy Worldwide 4/2018, we received a personal impression of the meeting. We therefore also found out that on 24 March 2018, the day of the vote - particularly on Motion 1 - the number of members pres - ent in the Main Auditorium had grown con - siderably. The figures mentioned in the re - port in Anthroposophy Worldwide confirm this: we are informed that, when the agm began on 22 March, around 650 members were in the Main Auditorium. On 24 March, however, 937 votes were cast on Motion 1! It had also become known before the ballot that there was considerable resis - tance in the Anthroposophical Society in Switzerland to extending Paul Mackay's and Bodo von Plato's terms in office. We at the Sophia Branch have received the impression that the rejection of Motion 1 was mostly the result of votes cast by members of the Swiss Society or by people living in and around Dornach. Can it be possible that issues regarding the global Society are largely decided by members living close to Dornach? If there is to be a vote, a way must be found of ensuring that all anthroposophists worldwide are being taken into account. We would like to thank Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato warmly for their untiring commitment as members of the Anthro - posophical Society's Executive Council. | Jochen Jahn und Christian Michaelis-Braun, Sophia Branch, M\u00fchlheim-Oberhausen ( de) The dignity of the human being What a paradox! Ita Wegman and Elisabeth Vreede are rehabilitated while two other Council members are expelled on the same day. Did the ways of our movement really change or is everything just a lie? It is extremely worrisome to say the least that on the verge of world chaos the anthroposophical movement is behaving like this. We should be acting towards the realization of harmony; we should create spaces for human dignity, for moral awak - ening and self-improvement. But instead we are witnessing how people act out of personal preferences, inspired by their blind desires while affecting and damaging the whole of our society. When personal interests prevail, the gen - uine spiritual endeavors are destroyed. We can only hope that an increasing number of members will stay true to the original spirit of Anthroposophy and carry on with the genuine moral impulses and wisdom that Rudolf Steiner shared with the world so that humanity would continue with its spiritual evolution and rise from the abyss of materialism. The responsibility that weighs upon our shoulders is immense, and those who try to attack our movement from the inside and cause chaos and hatred are in fact pushing towards the destruction of humanity. I am aware that people might dislike this last sentence, but it is just the truth, and the truth needs to be spoken and not get hidden. If we want to defend this precious spiri - tual movement we need to be awake and fully aware of the \u00abbeings\u00bb and \u00abforces\u00bb that want to take away and silence the light and voice of the spirit. Because causing chaos, hatred and division is in fact the best and most effective way to do that. Democracy has no place in a spiritual movement, in fact, democracy opens the gates of evil because in this earthly world truly wise people are always a minority. | Nicolas Olmos, Maria Pinto ( cl) Exerting influence I have read Peter Selg's comments on the 2018 Annual General Meeting with inter - est. His proposal that Council members expecting to be reaffirmed should in future present proper statements of their past activities and future plans: smug but ap - propriate in principle. His criticism of the general secretaries for trying to promote the two Council members: ok! But why does the Council of the Anthroposophical Society in Switzerland, of which Peter Selg is a member, not take this to heart, but declares, as we learn from the lead para - graph, in the same meeting through Marc Desaules how the Swiss Council thinks about the extension of mandates, exerting immense influence on the Swiss members by doing so? Is that worthy of the Society? | Wolfgang-M. Auer, Vidar-Zweig Bochum ( de) General wish to renew our Society? After reading and rereading and ponder - ing on the statements in Anthroposophy Worldwide 5/2018, the following questions came up: is the non-affirmation connected antroposophical society Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 6/18 | 9 During a meeting of treasurers chaired by Justus Wittich and Oliver Conradt in the run-up to the 2018 agm at the Goethea - num, Klaus Bohne, the treasurer of the Anthroposophical Society in Great Britain, suggested that all treasurers should meet once a year independently of the general secretaries. In 2018 this meeting should be held at Rudolf Steiner House in London, the world's financial centre. The role of the treasurer The proposal was prompted by the thought that, given the Anthroposophical Society's massive financial difficulties, the role of treasurer seems to be as important today as that of the general secretary and that separate treasurers' meetings are abso - lutely necessary in order to address these problems. The treasurers, he added, had the expertise required to discuss and decide on financial questions effectively. Another colleague added that treasurers have the responsibility to make difficult financial decisions and that it would be more efficient if they could discuss financial matters among themselves. A separate treasurers' meeting would therefore facili - tate targeted discussions that could focus on the financial situation of the General Anthroposophical Society worldwide. Both proposals were unanimously carried and a new initiative was born. Marc De - saules, the treasurer of the Anthroposophi - cal Society in Switzerland, suggested 9 and 10 November 2018 for the first such trea - surers' meeting. Everyone present agreed with this date. All treasurers worldwide are explicitly invited to this meeting. The idea is not that of a meeting of a few treasurers (of four Anthroposophical Societies in Europe), which already exists, but of a worldwide meeting for all treasurers without excep - tion. This invitation also includes Justus Wittich (Executive Council) and Oliver Con - radt (Goetheanum Leadership). Coordinator Oliver Conradt I would like to use this occasion to thank Justus Wittich for his valuable support of this proposal - and Oliver Conradt for his help in the matter. Oliver took on the role of coordinator and said he would contact all treasurers worldwide in order to make the meeting possible. The extremely difficult financial situation of the Goetheanum and of most Anthro - posophical Societies worldwide makes this meeting of all treasurers essential and I hope very much that many of my col - leagues will attend it. If you have any practical questions re - garding this meeting please contact Oliver Conradt as the coordinator. I am also happy to answer any questions you might have. | Klaus Bohne, treasurer of the Anthropo - sophical Society in Great Britain antroposophical society Treasurers Annual meeting of all treasurers At their meeting on 21 March 2018 at the Goetheanum, the treasurers of the vari- ous Anthroposophical Societies decided that, from 2018, all treasurers will meet once a year in order to discuss financial questions effectively. with these two, quite different, individuals in particular (and what, in this case, are the concrete criteria)? Or are the actual reasons for this outcome the sign of a general wish to renew our Society? Should/could the general secretaries in this case (or after every Dornach agm ) visit various cities in their countries and discuss any upcoming questions directly with as any members as possible? Might such an interim solution be a conceivable way of actively informing the members worldwide?| Margareta Habekost, Helsinki ( fi) We received more letters than could be printed here.

You have studied and earned doctorates at universities. What did you learn from that? Seija Zimmermann That research is hard work. And that one is part of an ongoing process in one's subject. Each subject has its particular culture of discourse where con - troversies are argued out. It is my heart's wish to overcome the antipathy towards academic study. Rudolf Steiner was sur - rounded by highly educated people, some of whom - like Hermann Beckh - held two doctorates. Constanza Kaliks In academic studies one learns to deal with ways of thinking and with principles, and that there are founda - tions of knowledge which can help you to find out what you need to know in order to understand. At the same time you learn about the consequences of seeking partici - pating knowledge. Christiane Haid What I find essential is the awareness of methods and the ability to differentiate between multiple ways of accessing a topic. One is required to con - sider diverse approaches, reflect on them, establish a distance to oneself and get to know the wider context and content. Equal access, practical relevance J\u00fcngel Are information and the rejection of dogmas a concern you share? Zimmermann We have in the School of Spiritual Science everything that the aca -demic world has - but in an extended and complemented form, because we are inter - ested in entirely new questions and in the totality of the subjects. Haid In the context of our work in the Goetheanum Leadership this means that we all widen our horizon because we are working together from our diverse ways of looking at the world and, for this, each of us needs to let go to an extent of her own subject. Since 2008, our joint artistic activities (eurythmy and art contempla - tion) have played an important role in this, too. The meditative path of the School of Spiritual Science is a central, constituent part of this for each of us. Knowledge and esoteric practice are brought together. J\u00fcngel Where do you see differences be - tween the academic and the anthropo - sophical approach? Haid In the School of Spiritual Science we have many approaches and a direct link to practical application. This can be a challenge when it comes to methodology, an aspect that was one of the reasons for producing this book. The book documents how differ - ent the anthroposophical approaches are. \u00abDifferent\u00bb does not mean arbitrary, how - ever: we try to present the approaches so that they can be understood. Because of the complexity of this task we had to hold back with the methodology question. We started with historical outlines - as a basis for the question of methods, which remains open. Zimmermann We realized that the School of Spiritual Science only became consolidat - ed in the last twenty to thirty years, when the Sections really began to work together. Haid The basic underlying idea of the Christmas Conference of 1923/1924 with re - gard to the Sections was not really put into practice until the 1980s, and then thanks to J\u00f6rgen Smit and Manfred Schmidt-Brabant. In 1995, at Michaelmas, Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler organized the first conference during which all the Sections presented themselves to the members. In the 1960s the performing arts and the Mystery Dramas, Faust and ways of celebrating annual festivals were given priority. That the Sections include the spheres of life (the fields of applied anthroposophy) is a new step. Zimmermann We also realized that the School of Spiritual Science has a place within the academic landscape. The evolving human being Haid What is needed for this is a height - ened interest in each other, not least in or - der to avoid isolation, or excluding oneself from current developments. With regard to anthroposophy, we must find ways of being productive so that its many inher - ent ideas can be creatively developed and pursued. Research - both academic and anthroposophical - is about innovation and cultural-spiritual progress. J\u00fcngel Is the perspective of the spiritual question one of the differences? Kaliks Yes. Anthroposophy is about human beings in relation to the cosmos, about hu - man evolution, about reality in all its facets. But the questions of anthroposophy are not necessarily exclusive or unique, because natural science is also interested in the hu - man being. Depending on one's perspective the approach might change, for instance when one includes elements of life. The use of mantras in the First Class of the School of Spiritual Science is also an essential basis. Haid They provide a holistic approach that is, initially, without specialization. In ar - eas like philology or philosophy spiritual questions also play a part, but previously established boundaries first need to be overcome there. The question as to the spirit is constituent to the School of Spiri - tual Science. The way it is posed illustrates the connection between the physical and Book on the history and research of the Sections Knowledge that shapes reality For the first time a book has been published that explores the history and research of the Sections at the Goetheanum (without the Section for Social Sciences). The book also explains the tasks of the Sections, which include basic research, its application and verification through practice research as well as ways of making it effective in society. The editors: | 11 School Of Spiritual Science the spiritual reality as a developmental question and as a task in all spheres of life. Zimmermann It is all about being open, and about being aware of signs and directions that might change the way the question is asked. Anthroposophy can provide unique concepts to any question of evolution. Platform for particular questions Kaliks The School of Spiritual Science sees knowledge as something that shapes reality. Haid The arts are an essential element of experience because they widen the way we look at things. They convey immediate results that need to be addressed. J\u00fcngel: The historical outlines presented in the book give the impression that research in the School of Spiritual Science used to be more classically academic in the past than it is today. Haid Ita Wegman had a large circle of co-workers with whom she did research. Albert Steffen worked more for himself, doing research and writing poetry. At the moment the Sections at the Goetheanum focus more on bringing people together and giving impulses; the research part of things needs to be strengthened - this is what we are working on. Kaliks Research is not only done at the Goetheanum today. There are research groups, for instance, on early years' educa - tion or on the cultural inclusion of Waldorf Education. Dissertations are being written on anthroposophical topics at universities in various countries. The Sections provide a platform for particular questions. But there is certainly still great potential for research. Zimmermann Peter Heusser has made a contribution to the scientific discourse with his book Anthroposophy and Science . He demonstrates where Rudolf Steiner contributed to contemporary issues and thereby - to come back to your initial ques - tion - created a foundation for anthroposo - phy to enter a stream of continuity - of academic continuity, too. Medicine is an - other example. It was important for Rudolf Steiner that anthroposophical physicians had a mainstream medical qualification. Today around 60 per cent of anthroposophi - cal physicians worldwide are specialists, which means that anthroposophic doctors meet high academic standards. J\u00fcngel What new perspectives have opened up for you due to this book? Kaliks The reality of becoming as a form of knowledge. Not all knowledge is ready- made. The Youth Section, for instance, can find much in Christiane Haid's book Auf der Suche nach dem Menschen (In search of the Human Being), which is about an - throposophical youth and student work. In addition, I learned more about individual personalities and how they were part of their time. In the Youth Section particularly, current concerns have always been closely connected with those who are shaping the Section work together. In a way this is only natural - but it also shows in which direc - tion things want to move. A karmic community Haid Rudolf Steiner was not interested in establishing \u00ababstract\u00bb specialist areas. He chose the Section leaders quite delib - erately - and the Sections form a karmic community. The leader, or head, of a sec - tion determined its way of working and its main themes. Today, the horizons of the sections have become wider, because cooperation within and among the sections is more important. Zimmermann I had an aha moment when I realized that what could be seen as a weakness of the School of Spiritual Sci - ence compared to conventional academic institutions with their research and teach - ing is not actually a weakness, but a new approach to higher education. Kaliks As we were putting the book to - gether, we spoke to each other about where we each stand in the research process on the history of our Sections. This led to the Goetheanum World Conference in 2016. The community-building did not remain restricted to ourselves, but led on to a more conscious perception and appreciation of the spheres of life. Haid It became clear to me how much the Anthroposophical Society has achieved - a fact it is often not aware of. As the bearer of the School of Spiritual Science it has, for ninety years - and with the help of donations, legacies and contributions from institutions and foundations - facilitated a free spiri - tual life without the influence of economic interests and without state funding. This school - and that is a unique feature - ex - clusively serves the inner human being in its relationship with the spiritual world. Science and sensitivity J\u00fcngel Are you working together at a dif - ferent level within the School of Spiritual Science compared to academic institu - tions - as a foundation for spiritual research, for instance? Haid The School shapes destinies in a way - as a precondition for individuals to enter this context. Controversy is fruitful for each specialist field. Working in self-suf - ficient groups does not bring you forward. The question is how can one provide the right soil for fruitful controversy? This brings us to a question of methodology: are we prepared to be transparent in this respect? Or are we defending a personal view, an ide - ology? Science, professional expertise and spiritual sensitivity are closely connected. Zimmermann If you are not able to place your personal achievements into a wider context you remain isolated. This is why the capacity for dialogue is so important, and finding a language that is suited to your subject-matter. You need to be interested in the questions of the world without los - ing your own identity. It is a balancing act, individually as well as for the community and there are no ready-made recipes.

It aims to provide an open space for en - trepreneurs to share questions of associa - tive economics and strengthen their links with the Goetheanum as the centre of the School of Spiritual Science. According to Gerald H\u00e4fner, head of the Section for Social Sciences, one of the As - sociation's main tasks will be to promote a culture based on brotherliness. For this it was necessary \u00abto achieve a connection be - tween spiritual activities and economics\u00bb, said Fabio Brescacin, the president of Ecor - NaturaS\u00ec (Italy), at the founding meeting. Thomas Jorberg, executive spokesperson at the ethical GLS Bank (Germany), pleaded that the School of Spiritual Science, as a source of innovative ideas to which the gls Bank also owed its existence, should be supported. Impulses for the economic life The founding of the World Goetheanum Association had been prepared since 2017 by a group consisting of members of the Goetheanum Leadership and partners from agriculture, commerce, banking, education, medicine and social therapy. The associa - tion aims to promote anthroposophical impulses in companies, institutions and self-employment, as well as cooperation in the form of associations and, connected with this, the development of the School of Spiritual Science. | Jonas LismontJoan Sleigh began our work on Friday evening by giving a free rendering of the Seventh Class Lesson. This inspiring beginning, together with eurythmy with Ursula Browning the follow - ing day, working with motifs from the Lesson, provided a foundation for a conversation on Saturday evening. Esoteric content widely available A major theme that Class Holders are currently concerned with is how the Michael School can move forward in a world where its esoteric con - tent is ever more widely available. Does Rudolf Steiner's warning still apply: that the School's mantric verses lose their power if they are possessed by people who have not taken the step of joining the School and consciously unit - ing their destiny with the Archangel Michael? It is not easy to answer this question, but those who work with the School's content can ask themselves how they experience these verses in their own meditative lives. It can be said that it was inevitable for the School's meditative content to become available be - yond its membership. The important question is how the esoteric life of the School can be ever more strengthened. Responsibility to the spiritual world The main question we worked with was how to distinguish between the eternal principles of the School and earthly arrangements that be - long to a particular time and place. What is our responsibility to the spiritual world and what are the human aspects of the work of the School? The one requirement that Rudolf Steiner gave for being a member of the School was being willing to be a representative of Anthroposophy. Joan Sleigh spoke of this as being a vessel for the spiritual world on earth, on the one hand, and, on the other, becoming an instru - ment for the spiritual hierarchies. This intention lies behind Steiner's often repeated injunc - tion for members to treat the School and its content with deep earnestness. This in turn leads to outer practices connected with hold - ing the School's Lessons. For example, the ap - parently outer requirement of showing blue cards on entry to a room where a Lesson is to be held denotes that members are step -ping from the \u00aboutside world\u00bb into a place where the Archangel Michael may be present. There are questions about who is entitled to introduce the content of the Lessons. In some places, a prepared contribution to a local group conversation is given by a member who is not necessarily a Class Holder. A more radical step is being taken in one area, where sometimes a lesson is given by a member rather than a Class Holder but always with a Class Holder present. In both cases, the principle being fol - lowed is that in a Michael community there is no hierarchy amongst members: all are equally responsible and all are qualified. By the same token, members are free to meet together in study groups and work on the School's content without a Class Holder necessarily being present. However, it is good if these groups maintain a connection with Class Holders and thereby to the School's leadership. There is a general view that the ritualistic end - ings which Rudolf Steiner introduced should be confined to lessons given by Class Holders and not used in study groups. Narrative presentation Speaking from the School's leadership at the Goetheanum, Joan referred to the need to recon - nect the Class with the Sections of the School and areas of work inspired and developed out of anthroposophy. One aspect of this is to present the School and its meditative path in confer - ences as a narrative, without using the mantric verses, including those where non-members are present, some of whom may not even be members of the Anthroposophical Society. This impulse may be objected to by those who feel the School's protective sheath may be breached but, in this situation, we can be reassured by Steiner's vision of the School as being the heart and soul of the Society and therefore visible to the world, provided its mantric essence is honoured and shared only among its members. | Andy Beard, Stroud ( gb)Annual class holders' meeting How to deal with the mantras today uk Class Holders held their annual weekend meeting at Hawkwood College from Friday 6 to Sunday 8 April.

Contact a.beard44@ btinternet.com School Of Spiritual Science Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 6/18 | 13 Rudolf Steiner sank the foundation stone for the Second Goetheanum into the hearts of the members who were present at the ceremony - as a metamorphosis of the first building. The First Goetheanum was also a metamorphosis, Rudolf Steiner pointed out in early December 1923 in the weekly journal Das Goetheanum1: the metamorphosis of the entire anthroposophy that had grown in the hearts of active members even before the first Goetheanum was erected - through Rudolf Steiner's public work, through the conferenc - es and lectures for members, but most of all through the work of the Esoteric School which Rudolf Steiner had established in 1904. All the texts of this School have been published2 and we can now discover the seeds from which the Foundation Stone Meditation has grown through the metamorphoses mentioned. In relation to \u00abI am - It thinks ...\u00bb Let us look at the second rhythm with the \u00abwords of power\u00bb in mind that Rudolf Steiner planted into the hearts of the mem - bers in connection with the Esoteric School around the year 1905. \u00abI am - It thinks - She feels - He wills.\u00bb In these statements, Ru - dolf Steiner pointed out, the it of it thinks refers to the universal cosmic thinking that lives in an impersonal way in our words. In she feels she refers to the world soul; this means we are not meant to feel personally, but impersonally, in accordance with the soul of the world. He in he wills refers to God, to whose will we commend our entire being.3 Let us look at the second rhythm of the Foundation Stone of 1923/1924. Rudolf Steiner introduces it by saying, \u00abAgain, we will write a rhythm into our soul so that we can gradually penetrate spiritually to the structure. From the first verse we take the words Your own I / In the I of God / Comes into being. From the second verse, which contains a second soul process, we take the words, Unite your own I / with the I of the World. And from the third verse we take, Bestow [...] / On your own I / For free and active willing. With these words, to form the corresponding rhythm, we now unite the words that always resonate with them and that have an inner connec - tion with what I have already written on the blackboard: And you will truly live / In human world-all being. And from the second verse, And you will truly feel / Within the working of the human soul. The third verse concludes this harmony: And you will truly think / in depths of human spirit.\u00bb4 Rudolf Steiner then wrote a slightly different and shortened version on the blackboard, each time omitting the words \u00aband you shall truly\u00bb, which were, however, spoken in the full version. If we now look at the words \u00abthink in depths of human spirit\u00bb in connection with the exercise outlined above from the Esoteric School, \u00abIt thinks\u00bb, we can sense how the \u00abdepths of human spirit\u00bb and the \u00abuniversal cosmic thinking\u00bb illuminate each other. And also with \u00abUnite your own I / With the I of the World / - feel / within the working of the human soul\u00bb we sense an inner correspon - dence with \u00abShe feels\u00bb, where 'she' refers to the world soul. And lastly, the \u00abI am\u00bb from the beginnings of the Esoteric School appears in the Foundation Stone Verse, but dynamically enhanced in the mysterious word \u00aberweset\u00bb (comes into being). In God's I the \u00abI am\u00bb is always in the process of becoming. But where in the Foundation Stone do we find the \u00abHe wills\u00bb of the old Esoteric School? In the rhythm discussed here the words \u00abfor free and active willing\u00bb are a promise for the future, which is why free thinking is bestowed on us as a gift. \u00abHe wills\u00bb can only be achieved in its entire fullness after the appearance of the Christ, in the fourth verse of the Foundation Stone Meditation, right at the end, in a superpersonal sense: \u00abThat good may become / What we / Would found from our hearts / What we / Would guide from our heads / With purposeful will.\u00bb Words of orientation We must, however, not allow these contem - plations to disturb us as we meditate; they are only meant for preparation. Rudolf Steiner says of his own explanations that they merely serve \u00abas orientation. They should not be pres - ent in our consciousness when we meditate. They would disturb the mantric character of the rhythm\u00bb5. What has been said here about the second rhythm must therefore also be for - gotten once we begin our meditation. | Mich - iel ter Horst, Foundation Stone Initiative GroupAnnual Motif of the Anthroposophical Society for 2018/2019 The second Foundation Stone rhythm as a seed Rudolf Steiner's Foundation Stone Meditation is the General Anthroposophical Society's current annual motif.

Antroposophical Society14 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 12/17 Summer University Polarities in Space and Time From 23 July to 4 August 2018 the Goetheanum will host the Natural Science Section's inter - national Summer University. We would like to introduce our students to the essentials of Goethean Science which reflect what humanity is destined for, bringing together the richness of the sensory world and that of the soul, and therefore - through exact observation and re - flection - mind and matter. In the first week we will be at the Goetheanum ( ch) and prac - tise the paths to knowledge de - veloped by Goethe for the study of inorganic nature, plants and animals. Two field trips, to the Jura and the Vosges Mountains, will be devoted to the topic of \u00ablimestone and silica\u00bb. From the valley to the glacier We will spend the second week in an Alpine valley, the L\u00f6tschen - tal, where we will work on Ru - dolf Steiner's Foundations of Human Experience (formerly \u00abStudy of Man\u00bb, ga 293) and on the stages of human evolution. We will explore the geology, flo - ra and fauna from the bottom of the valley up to the mouth of the glacier. Following the retreat of the glacier from the valley to the mountains we will experience several centuries in the biography of a landscape. The daily activities will con - clude with exercises and con - templations on the path of inner development. The conference languages will be English and Mandarin. | Johannes Wirz, GoetheanumAround Easter of 1915 Rudolf Steiner created a bust of Christ as a preliminary study for the monumental wooden statue of the Representative of Humanity between Lucifer and Ahriman. It is a more detailed, life-size execution of the previously fashioned, smaller Christ head. With its focus on how this being appears to the spiritual researcher who is able to per - ceive in the spiritual world, this piece is a representation of the risen Christ that is unique in the history of art. The bust was made of plas - ticine and placed on a wooden base prepared by Edith Maryon. As early as the 1960s the mod - el, which is sensitive to heat, was so badly damaged that it needed to be restored. This was done by John Wilkes. So far, this piece of art has been preserved in plaster casts. Because of the fragility of this material we are, however, considering a bronze cast as a more durable solution.We have received a generous donation from the Humanus Foundation but still need 4,700 Swiss Francs so we can realize this plan. Any contributions, small or large, will be grateful - ly received. | Dino Wendtland, GoetheanumAppeal Where is the jewellery of the last hundred years? Together with the goldsmith Bertha Meyer-Jacobs, Rudolf Steiner worked on renewing the art of jewellery and seal making. As a spiritualized art impulse it belongs to the cultural initia - tives of the twentieth century. With the exception of a book with Rudolf Steiner's designs we have no publications on this art form, and this art of jewellery making can be learnt hardly any - where today. Goldsmiths have graduated from the jewellery- making school founded by Ber - tha Meyer-Jacobs for decades, however. Their work is distrib - uted all over the world and of - ten ends up with people who do not understand the art form. Publication and archive The Jewellery Art Foundation (Stiftung f\u00fcr Kleinodienkunst) is looking for and collecting ev - erything connected with this im - pulse for a comprehensive publi - cation: designs and photographs of pieces, texts, biographies and the addresses of artists world - wide, whether they are still ac - tive or have passed away, so that the art form can be preserved and documented for future gen - erations and made accessible for them. The Foundation is also looking for jewellery, everyday and cultic objects, seals etc. in order to set up an archive for ex - hibitions and training. We are grateful for any information. | Annette Hug-Risel, Dornach ( ch) School Goetheanum Initiative English): www.forschun - gsinstitut.ch/studium/som - meruniversitaet-2018Accounts for donations (ref - 4901 / Bronze-B\u00fcste): From Switzerland and other appeal Bronze cast of Rudolf Steiner's bust of Christ The head of the Representative of Humanity: in plaster (left) and wood (right) Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 12/17 | 15 On Foundation Stone Meditation's seven rhythms Size and content of the Foun - dation Stone Meditation are so that we are unable to grasp it in its entirety. Only by entering into its seven rhythms can we penetrate to its structure and explore it meditatively. Dur - ing the Christmas Foundation Conference of 1923/1924 Rudolf Seiner recommended \u00abto make the soul aware of these inner rhythms and meditate, that is, calmly reflect on them\u00bb. They could then be experienced as \u00abutterances of cosmic mysteries, so long as these cosmic myster - ies are resurrected as human self-knowledge.\u00bb ( ga 260, p. 107 in the German edition) Through meditation we can come closer to an understand - ing of the difficult concepts of Spirit Recalling, Spirit Awareness and Spirit Beholding. We look at these from a different direction in the first rhythm compared to the three central rhythms (the three 'practise rhythms'). In the first rhythm we look at the creation and evolution of human beings as long as they were in the hands of the gods. It rises from \u00abcoming into be - ing\u00bb to \u00abuniting\u00bb to \u00abbestow - ing\u00bb. More precisely: from the Father (Old Testament) to the Son (New Testament) to the Spirit (Eternal Gospel)1. It was divine intention that the human individuality should be free. And human beings are from now on involved in and responsible for the future evolution. In the second rhythm we be - come aware of the faculties of soul and spirit that we have for interfering in the work of the gods: thinking, feeling, and liv - ing (for willing). In the following rhythms the human being is addressed as co- creator. The practising is at the centre. The three soul forces need to be strengthened so that higher levels of conscious - ness can be attained. Spirit Beholding stands for Imagina - tion, Spirit Awareness for Inspi - ration and Spirit Recalling for Intuition. Meditation means that we experience how, with Intuition, we join the creative - ness (\u00abholding sway\u00bb) of the Father, with Inspiration that of the Son and with Imagination that of the Spirit ( third rhythm ). With the fourth rhythm we can experience that Intuition, Inspiration and Imagination are connected with the way the higher hierarchies are at work in the cosmos. The fifth rhythm finally mentions the motive and reason for the threefold practising: \u00ab[...]That good may become [...]\u00bb. The sixth rhythm points beyond the human being by addressing our responsibility for the three realms of nature. The elemen - tary spirits \u00abhear\u00bb the Christ impulse that passes through the world, redeeming them too, but they also know that this impulse can only be made effective by human beings: \u00abMay human beings hear it!\u00bb When we meditate the sev - enth rhythm , which establishes a relation between the physi - cal human body and the divine trinity, a cosmic mystery can be resurrected in us that is both knowledge of the world and knowledge of the human be - ing: the physical body as the starting point for a new Earth. \u00abPhysicality is the end of the works of God [...] Physicality is the beginning of the works of human beings.2 | Hans-J\u00fcrgen Pingel, Hamburg ( de)We have been informed that the following 46 mem - bers have crossed the threshold of death.

Its goals include dealing with land in a socially ac - ceptable and ecological way, promoting a humane and ecological architecture, the conservation and curation of fine art ob - jects based on anthroposophical impulses and providing suitable premises. Thousands of pictures, hundreds of sculptures On 28 April the Trigon Foundation opened an art warehouse in the grounds of the Juraweg estate in Dornach. The art collec - tion is based primarily on the collection of John C. Ermel, an architect and designer, who has been collecting art for more than thirty years. The collection includes the es - tates of twenty artists, including Rex Raab, Walther Roggenkamp and Erich Zimmer, as well as individual pieces by 34 artists, including Beppe Assenza, Edgar Ende, Chris - tian Hitsch, Emica Mohr-Senft and Gerard Wagner - thousands of pictures and hun - dreds of sculptures, utility art, furniture and architectural models. While these objects will continue to be spread across various places, the Kunst - SchauDepot now provides a centre, offering the possibility to store and show a large part of the collection in public exhibitions. An additional building is planned for artistic activities and events, with seating for up to seventy people. Gaining autonomy More than a hundred interested people attended the opening. The addresses were more profound than the usual congratula - tory speeches. David Marc Hoffmann ex - plained the nature of the gesamtkunstwerk and the striving for unity. \u00abIn anthroposo - phy - as a comprehensive reform move - ment, with its new image of the world, earth and humanity - art, science and religion, world creation and human creations, all the arts from architecture, sculpture and paint - ing to speech, literature, drama and music to applied arts such as education and medi - cine are united by the striving for unity.\u00bb A tour of the premises right at the be - ginning showed that the anthroposophi - cal art on show here does not obey to any uniform clich\u00e9s. Walter Kugler picked out one motif - light - based on Albert Steffen's remark, \u00abThe rainbow is the painter's best teacher. It makes him independent of the colours. [...] The light's activity teaches him freedom of spirit.\u00bb Transparency, Walter Kugler said, would become an experience of transcendence. After World War II, light was also central for the Zero artists. They reduced \u00abcolours and forms to a minimum, in order to give sufficient space to the light\u00bb. It would be worthwhile, Kugler added, going part of the way with these artists. As a former rhythm and special needs teacher Bea Heim felt drawn to the spiritu - al-philosophical ambience. She is concerned with \u00abbringing politics, economics, culture and practised humanity together so that they can bring us forward, as individuals and as society as a whole\u00bb. Art, she said, offered us the possibility to transform our - selves and connect in a feeling and com - passionate way with what is going on in the world around us. Colours and forms can generate strength - \u00abfor the individual and the community\u00bb. This was important, because \u00abif you shape your world, your path will not be determined by others\u00bb. Works of art for hire The obstacles one can meet on the way were described by Sabine Pegoraro who spoke about architecture as an art. \u00abArchitecture cannot claim artistic license in the same way as the arts. It is restricted by countless building and design regulations\u00bb. The build - ing authorities, on the other hand, should be there to support rather than prevent. With a view to the Second Goetheanum Sabine Pegoraro made it clear that a build - ing which initially 'sticks' out can eventually turn out to be a \u00abstroke of luck\u00bb. Remark - ing on various pioneering buildings in the region, the politician said of the Kunst - SchauDepot, \u00abI do hope that this project of the Trigon Foundation will soon be well known in the area and across the border\u00bb. Some of the works of art can also be hired. All works and documents are available for art history research. | Sebastian J\u00fcngelTrigon Foundation: KunstSchauDepot A centre for anthroposophical art On 28 April, John C.
