What About Kids and Transmission? What If Your Child Tests Positive? We've learned a lot about COVID-19 (and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes it) since it first made global headlines. The disease, which is spread via respiratory droplets, is highly transmissible. Millions of Americans have had it\u2014as have many more hundreds of millions worldwide\u2014and it isn't going anywhere. But the good news is that serious illness with COVID-19 can now mostly be avoided. For people who are eligible, the COVID-19 vaccine can significantly reduce their risk of hospitalization, and there are medications that can reduce the severity of the disease should they get sick. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was some speculation about whether kids could catch or spread COVID-19. It is now well-known that kids can and do get sick with COVID-19. And they spread it just like anyone else\u2014possibly even more so. Read on to learn more about how COVID-19 is spread and how long children with COVID-19 are contagious. Everything You Need to Know About COVID-19 in Kids How Is COVID-19 Spread? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COVID-19 is spread when an infected person releases respiratory droplets through coughing, sneezing, or breathing. The most common way to become infected is to breathe in infected droplets through your mouth or nose. More rarely, you can catch COVID-19 by touching an infected surface (like a counter or handrail) and touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. That said, due to the incubation period of COVID-19 (the period between when the virus enters your body and you start experiencing symptoms) and the fact that many people are contagious days before showing symptoms, it can be hard to know when and how you were exposed. Initially, the incubation period for COVID-19 was quite long, especially compared to other respiratory viruses, like the flu. But over time, and as the virus mutated, the incubation period lessened. According to the CDC, you are most contagious for the first five days after symptoms begin. However, you can also potentially spread the virus a couple of days before you even know you are sick (during the incubation period). How Long Are You Contagious With COVID-19? Since COVID-19 was first discovered, experts have been studying the duration of the infection. At first, people were told to isolate for 14 days\u2014or two weeks\u2014if infected. Months later, that number dropped to 10 days. Currently, the recommended isolation period is a minimum of 5 days but can be longer. So how long are you actually contagious with COVID-19? According to the CDC, this window of time depends on the severity of your infection and your symptoms. It's this understanding that has shaped the CDC's guidelines for quarantine and isolation. Quarantine guidelines for exposure As the COVID-19 virus has evolved and health officials' understanding of the virus has increased, so have quarantine and isolation guidelines. Quarantining (staying home if exposed to COVID-19) is no longer recommended, but taking precautions after a known exposure is. The CDC advises the following when you have been exposed to COVID-19: Wear a high-quality mask around other people. Watch for COVID-19 symptoms and test if you develop symptoms. Test on day six and isolate immediately if positive; if negative, continue precautions through day 10. What the End of the COVID-19 Emergency Declaration Means For Your Family Isolation guidelines for illness Isolation means separating yourself from others, including people in your household. If you test positive for COVID-19, the CDC's isolation guidelines are as follows: Stay home for at least five days and isolate yourself from others.If asymptomatic, you may end isolation after five days.If you had a mild case, your symptoms are improving, and you've been fever-free for 24 hours, you may end isolation after five days; otherwise, continue isolating until you meet those criteria.If you have a moderate or severe case, continue isolating for 10 days. These guidelines apply to everyone of all ages, including children. Since young kids need hands-on care, you and your child (if they are able) should wear a mask when you interact to limit your chances of catching COVID-19. Always speak with a health care provider if you're unsure about your child's contagiousness or symptoms. Can You Get COVID-19 More Than Once? The short answer is yes. Early on in the pandemic, there was a question as to whether having COVID-19 provided long-term immunity against the virus. It is now known that neither infection nor vaccination offers long-term immunity. You can be infected multiple times, even if you are vaccinated. Vaccination does, however, significantly reduce the chance of a severe infection. The good news is that COVID-19 infection does appear to offer some short-term immunity that dwindles over time. A 2023 study in the Lancet found that after COVID-19 infection, people had high levels of protection from infection, symptomatic illness, and severe illness for as long as 10 months. According to the CDC, if you become reinfected with COVID-19, you are contagious, just as you would be with an initial infection. CDC Adds COVID-19 Vaccine to Childhood Immunization Schedule How Do Kids Affect COVID-19 Transmission? So it's clear kids can catch COVID-19. But are they spreading it at the same rate as adults, especially when not showing symptoms? Researchers say yes, and maybe even more so. For example, a 2022 study found that while kids, teens, and adults had equal chances of contracting the virus during the pre-vaccine era of the pandemic, kids under 13 were more likely to be infected but not have symptoms. This could be one reason younger kids were more likely to transmit the virus. Kids with mild or no symptoms may be more likely to continue on with their usual activities, exposing more people to the virus than those who get sick and stay home. Researchers in the study observed that younger age was the most significant risk factor for COVID-19 transmission within the household. They speculate this is because younger kids interact more closely with other household members than older kids and teens. What's more, young kids may spread COVID-19 more readily because of various lifestyle factors. For example, they might play closely with other children in daycare or school. They're constantly in contact with caregivers, and they're not as careful with hygiene (think: covering coughs and sneezes and regularly washing hands). It's unclear how these factors affect transmission statistics. Here's How to Use Hand Sanitizer Properly What Should You Do If Your Child Tests Positive for COVID-19? If your child tests positive for COVID-19, they should isolate at home immediately, following the CDC guidelines. In addition, you should reach out to a health care provider. Even though most cases in children are mild, serious illnesses can happen. Kids might experience the following common COVID-19 symptoms: CoughCongestionFatigueLoss of smell or tasteHeadachesFeverVomitingDiarrhea A health care provider should advise you about whether your child's symptoms are expected and what you should be on the lookout for.
