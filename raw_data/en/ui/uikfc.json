All excellent words to describe a spring cleanse, using natural ingredients to give your body a boost and get ready for spring or summer activity. Imagine gaining increased energy as you sprint around the city with the biggest smile that says, \"I feel great!\" If this is your summer goal, start by detoxing your body of toxins. Your lymph nodes are often overlooked \u2014 but they're a great system for detoxing. Here are five tips to get your lymphatic system moving again. 1. Detox - Remove Toxins With Herbs The lymphatic system should be the key to your detox because its primary function is to carry waste away from the cells and bloodstream to the body's organs of elimination. When lymph fluid remains sluggish the lymph nodes become clogged and lose their filtering ability. Without routine flushing of the lymph, debris becomes trapped in the body, creating a toxic overload and contributing to the onset of disease. Recommended revitalization herbs: dandelion (absorbs toxins, stimulate the liver), echinacea (powerful immune stimulant), red clover (has anti-tumor, blood cleansing properties) and burdock root (prevents toxic chemical poisoning). 2. Cleanse - Purge Remove and purge your body of any white flour and processed products. These include: sugar, junk food, processed foods and meat, pesticides, chemicals, preservatives and all heated fats and oils. Drink as much water as you can and more for an optimal detox. A great rule-of-thumb measuring tool is to drink half your body weight in ounces. Flush those toxins out! Fresh lemon juice in 1/2 cup water early in the morning, beet juice and carrots are all great cleanse tactics. Also, try alternating in dandelion tea \u2014 an excellent diuretic that does not excrete potassium from your body but stimulates the liver. You may drink this tea at least 3 times each day. Finally, consume organic cucumbers daily which are loaded with water to flush excess toxins from your body. Doing these simple changes can facilitate you to a long term healthier lifestyle. 3. Exercise - Get Moving! The worse thing you can do for yourself is NOT move your body. Movement helps the fluids in the lymphatic system circulate and removes stored toxins. If you don't move you can have an accumulation of fluids in the body which can affect your heart and lungs. Brisk walking, running or even more fun \u2014 jumping on a mini trampoline could revitalize the lymph nodes, helping them into detox mode. 4. Digestive - Eat The Right Foods Certain foods assist the body in removing excess water. Cucumber is loaded with water and is an excellent source of fiber, potassium, all the B vitamins, phosphorus and magnesium. Salad greens contain vitamin A and C (just don't buy Iceberg; it has virtually no nutritional value). Spinach is a wonderful source of calcium and it doesn't cause mucus buildup like dairy milk. And, do yourself a favor by trading in Romaine lettuce for spinach in salads. 5. Lifestyle Changes - Water Therapy That's correct! Alternating hot and cold water via a shower is so much easier to do to than bath version. A great way to start is to alternate hot water then cold water for five minutes during your daily shower. Save those weekends to indulge in aromatic bath infusion. What you are doing is stimulating your body and circulating your lymphatic system. And, a great lymph massage is so rejuvenating. This can be your personal indulgence. What is your favorite detox tip? Explore more amazing health articles and "}
