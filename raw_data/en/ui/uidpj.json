Over 6,100 articles in European scientific literature have attested to the effectiveness of this safe, inexpensive and powerful healing modality, and has been administered by an estimated 15,000 European doctors, naturopaths and homeopaths to more than 10 million patients in the past 70 years to successfully treat practically every known disease -- including but not limited to cancer, AIDS, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease. hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, herpes, Rheumatoid Arthritis and asthma. This very thin, large-type book actually has about one chapter which is on the subject of the book's title \"The One-Minute Cure\" which is basically the practice of drinking distilled water with a measured about of Food Grade Hydrogen Peroxide. The other chapters explain the value of oxygen to the body and immune system. Oxygen therapies include introducing extra oxygen to the body by one of various means: 1) Hyperbaric Chambers 2) IV administration of Hydrogen Peroxide 3) drinking water w/Food Grade Hydrogen Peroxide. The later one you can do at home with a couple of proviso's. Since Hydrogen Peroxide is a powerful oxidizer, you don't want to mix it with food or other medicine. The recommendation is to drink the mixture one hour before or three hours after a meal. My main criticism is that the author fills the book with chapters about the corrupt self serving \"sickness\" system (it is NOT a health care system). While all these criticisms are valid, they feel like they are just filler material for a book which is too unsubstantial to merit its high price. The entire time I read this book (1 hour) I kept thinking that the author is a hypocrite because he, himself is guilty of the same thing that he accuses other players in this corrupt \"health care\" system. He is using his expert knowledge to earn unjustified rewards from sick people. He is selling this unsubstantial book for too high a price considering that the content for which I bought it filled only a few pages. I was interested in how to safely consume the Hydrogen Peroxide. Answer: One drop (35%) per 8 oz of distilled water. Increase an additional drop each day until about 25 drops. Decrease if signs of an upset stomach. Now that I have given away the recipe you don't need to buy the book. I knew about charged oxygen being used in a variety of diseases with great success. I knew about the phagocytes in body using hydrogen peroxide as a first line defence. I practically knew about all the author was talking about. I agree that with our current lifestyles oxygenation of tissues can help a lot especially in chronic, degenerative and infectious diseases. However what leaves my dubious is the administration of H202 in water. Hydrogen peroxide is highly unstable so Oxygen will be released immediately in the water used for administration. How much will be absorbed in the blood stream assuming that the bulk goes via oral systemic absorption not via mouth mucosa which avoids the first pass effect of the liver (the detoxification mechanisms of the liver)? How much will be neutralized by the acidic environment in the stomach? The book is full of historical annotations of the use of H2O2 in various diseases but practically nothing is said how eventually the absorption is going to happen via oral systemic absorption and deposit active Oxygen there where in is needed that is deep inside tissue levels and in cells. The author admits that most of the data comes from intravenous administration of H2O2 which makes sense since bioavailability of H202 is highest via this route. So yes the idea is interesting but I have my doubts how much is effective by the oral method the author is advocating. As the author states, \"[H:]ostile micro-organisms are eradicated by hydrogen peroxide.\" 35% hydrogen peroxide, when properly diluted, can flood the bloodstream with oxygen to such an extent that it pushes out anerobic bacteria and viruses while avoiding any harmful effects on the good bacteria or the enzymatic wall of the cell. The protocol for health is found on one page (page 75) of this 114-page, six-chapter paperback, and it consists of, at a minimum, 3 drops of food-grade hydrogen peroxide in an 8 oz. glass of distilled water three times a day, up to a minimum of 25 drops (in an 8 oz. glass of distilled water) three times a day for a minimum period of 46 days, after which time one simply makes a regular health regimen for oneself through the use of 3 drops of food-grade hydrogen peroxide in an 8 oz. glass of water three times a day for the rest of one's life. The opening and uphill chapters before the reader reaches the protocol consist of a critique of the medical establishment as well as the pharmaceutical industry and anecdotal as well as historical evidence for the healing powers of 35% food-grade hydrogen peroxide. The author also includes a warning about not ingesting 3% hydrogen peroxide which you can find in a shopping mall because it contains \"stabilizers.\" While stabilizers can be harmful, they can also be good for you (anti-oxidants are stabilizers), and the author never details why the stabilizers in 3% hydrogen peroxide are harmful. (They're harmful because they are toxic and contain metal.) While the title of the book uses the word \"cure,\" the inside page contains a disclaimer that the information in this book does not claim to prevent or \"cure\" disease and the author states as well in the first chapter, \"The oxygen therapy presented herein does not actually 'cure' disease, but rather creates an environment in your body that is uninhabitable by disease organisms, viruses, harmful bacteria and pathogens.\" In the last and sixth chapter, the author alerts the reader to the fact that stress is an illness-creator, adding as well that stress can close the cells of the human body and prevent oxygen from being captured by them, thus setting up inside the body an environment for microbial invasion. How then do we eliminate stress? Madison Cavanaugh, the author, sadly does not answer the question directly but does include an \"Appendix\" where she leads the reader by the nose to a website where one can learn something about \"The Greatest Manifestation Principle in the Word,\" a site that allows you to buy a book that supposedly helps supplement those followers of the New Age phenomenon, the Law of Attraction, in order to make it even more successful and more complete. So . . .ho, ho, ho, it's Magic! The prospective buyer of this book can try this protocol to find out whether it works for her or him or the buyer can go straight to \"The Greatest Manifestation Principle in the World\" since the testimonials there include the eradication and cure of all disease -- even without the aid of hydrogen peroxide! Perfect mind control! Or the prospective buyer can simply use Miracle Mineral Solution, which does what hydrogen peroxide claims to do, except there's no risk since H2O2 can burn the skin and is highly flammable. This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers. Terrific! There is a glaring conflict of interest in the pharmaceutical industry. Drugs are supposed prescribed to 'cure' people of disease, but if said people were actually cured, the pharmaceutical companies wouldn't sell any drugs and they wouldn't make any money. It's literally that simple. This is an economic conflict of interest. I can't believe more people don't see this, or if they do, aren't willing to accept it. This is an okay, informative book about the benefits of hydrogen peroxide and ozone. These products provide the body with oxygen and can thereby heal practically anything. If I had known that the book was about oxygen/hydrogen peroxide, I would not have ordered it from the library, however, since I have previously read another book on the subject - Hydrogen peroxide: Medical Miracle by William Campbell Douglass, in which I understood that the substance did not always have a healing effect and sometimes could be harmful (see my review of this book). In the present book we are also informed of its dangers, if not used correctly. The author states that the substance`s health benefits are \"accompanied by practically no known risks\" - the key word being \"practically\". For me, one of the difficulties in using hydrogen peroxide would be measuring the correct amount. I would need to be able to find out exactly how much an ounce is; some of the dangers involved with this therapy are in making sure you get the right amount and not too much. We are advised to use \"35% Food-Grade H2O2 diluted in 6-8 ounces of distilled water\" - (and where do you get hold of distilled water?). I eventually found the product with this strength on Amazon. Of course, it may be possible to find a doctor/therapist who offers hydrogen peroxide or ozone treatment, but I have never heard of anyone offering it. And I understood from the book that it has been discredited owing to the obvious threat to the pharmaceutical industry. Since the treatment cures practically all diseases, nobody would need pharmaceutical drugs any more, I would recommend this book to all those willing to try this apparently miraculous treatment, and who are not afraid of the practical measurement problems involved. I can't give this more stars until I see if their argument actually works. After I read this, I found out that a woman my mother visits uses this remedy every day and hasn't had to go to the doctor for 10 years. If you believe the author, the reason people like me haven't heard about this (I'm purposefully NOT telling you what \"this\" is) is because of the mafia-like behavior of the big-money pharmaceuticals in actually preventing us from hearing about it. I'm not sure I don't agree with that. I'm going to try this remedy and see how it goes. As we say in basketball, \"No blood, no foul,\" or another way to put is could be the axiom, \"Nothing ventured, nothing gained.\" For anyone who believes that traditional medicine does not have a corner on health and healing, this book is a must. If you believe in actual healing, or in the fact that a loving father would not allow terrible diseases to run rampant on the earth while the only treatments would be terribly expensive and involve cutting and/or administration of drugs, often with horrendous side effects, you must read this book. I have always believed that the cure for whatever ails the human race, medical or otherwise, will ultimately be simple. This book bares that out. This is a book that I got into online when I was randomly researching and clicking on a bunch of different links. A video to this book came up and then brought me to a website that raved about how this amazing cure worked for many people. BUT, nothing ever said what this cure was and I thought it was just a hoax to get people to buy the book. Then a few weeks later I see it laying on a friends table and was able to read it for myself. Nice coincidence, huh? I'll tell you this now THIS IS NO HOAX ITS A VERY INFORMATIONAL BOOK and I agreed with a lot of what Cavanaugh talked about. You get an insight on our corrupted medical world along with a freakishly simple therapy that has cured many diseases. The only reason they don't talk about it on the website or the videos is because its all legal stuff. The first pages of a book is a disclaimer that basically says how its all an opinion and shouldn't be taken as actual medical advice and blah blah blah. I think I'm allowed to tell you what this cure is, so... Its just hydrogen peroxide! A simple way of oxygenating the body which leads to amazing healing capabilities in it. I've been using the 99 cent external hydrogen peroxide on my face and my acne is really starting to go away. If you want to try this therapy you DO need to get the book because there are many different kinds of hydrogen peroxide and the book goes into the exact directions. Its fairly simple, but you the directions are needed. Overall; I was pleasantly surprised. This book is a bit misleading. The author claims to have a cure!- a secret for all diseases! (WWWWOOWWWW!! Okay, that got my attention.) The very first inside page disclaimers that the book does not exactly claim to prevent, fix, or cure disease, but only brings attention to oxygen therapy that can provide a helpful environment for the body. (And that right there for starters shows the false claims in the title used as an attention factor. Not a fan) The first half consists of critiquing the medical field for not releasing more information about the benefits of hydrogen peroxide because of the business it must upkeep. While the second half talks about stress and testimonials of healthy living. The topic was very interesting to me but it really could have easily been a third as long or a web article. Lack of consistency and structure in the points didn't help the author's stance, even though I agreed with most of what the author stated, and it made sense. There are many more books on the benefits of hydrogen peroxide which I wish to look into. The book did successfully get me to pursue the topic further. I really enjoyed the information provided from this book. I know that the pharmaceutical industry hides the truth from the masses in order to keep its financial security, so I am glad that I am now aware of the protocol to live a healthier lifestyle. I recommend this book to anyone, living with sickness or not. Are you interested in a simple medical therapy that has been known for at least 150 years, that creates conditions inside the body where disease cannot thrive, that is currently being prescribed by over 15,000 European doctors, and that can be self-administered and costs less than 2 cents per day? The magic ingredient is . . . hydrogen peroxide. The human body is approximately two-thirds oxygen. It has been shown that unwanted germs and viruses cannot thrive in an oxygen-rich environment. Unfortunately, in our increasingly polluted world, and with the American sedentary lifestyle, most people don't get enough oxygen. It requires more than just being outside and deep breathing. Several things have to be kept in mind. The hydrogen peroxide found in the local pharmacy is good for use on cuts and bruises and acne, but it should not be taken internally. It is necessary to find 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide (it can be found online). Then it has to be diluted by a lot, down to a 3% strength (taking \"straight\" hydrogen peroxide internally can be fatal). The diluting has to be done with distilled water, not regular chlorinated water. It also has to be taken on an empty stomach. The hydrogen peroxide could react with the food's bacteria and cause nausea or vomiting. You may feel sick for a few days after starting this therapy. Don't worry about it; it's just your body getting rid of toxins and dead cells. Why don't American doctors prescribe this therapy? Blame Big Medicine and Big Pharma. This has the potential to revolutionize American healthcare and they are not shy about intimidating any doctor who says nice things about hydrogen peroxide. Needless to say, this book is not meant to replace your primary care physician. That being said, this book is short, easy to understand, and extremely highly recommended. This book is for everybody but especially for people who have long term illness or terminal illnesses. First throw away your pre-conceived thoughts, the information that you have been provided via years of subliminal brain washed into you. This is not foo foo. This is proven information that will assist you in either healing or at the very least minimising your illness symptoms. At the very minimum take the time to read the book and consider the information. You have nothing to lose reading the book, you have nothing to lose following the cure. I have thumbed through the book. I don't know when I will get to read it but I did read the appendix, THE MISSING PIECE IN THE HEALING PUZZLE, and if you read no other part of this book, please read the appendix. So I read the reviews and I think most are scared to take the plunge and try it. I have used this protocol from this book for over 12 years now. I've been sick 3 times during 12 years. I do the treatment advised in book once a year and I do a few days of 3 drops 3x a day if I start to feel as though I might be coming down with something. A man gave directions below which isn't completely accurate..you start your first time at 3 drops (not one) 3 times a day until you reach 25 drops three times a day. You don't have to use distilled water, you can use spring water as well as organic juice if you can't stomach the taste. You can also stick a piece of sugar free gum in your mouth after drinking solution. I prefer to chug the water and definitely not sip or you will not want to finish glass. The closer you get to 25 drops the harder it gets lol BUT IT IS WORTH IT! When I do treatment I feel great, full of energy, my back pain goes away, I wake up early, there's no cravings for things such as alcohol, cigarettes, and sweets (I used to do all of the above when I started 12 years ago but no longer do). And I literally never get sick, people all around me will be sick and I get nothing. There have been years I've done it two/three times a year but I have found I didn't need to do it that much. I also used to have a virus when I started and it miraculously disappeared. So I know without a doubt taking orally does have benefits. When I do treatment I usually feel a little sick (like a cold) a little more than half way through but it goes away as it is flushing your body of toxins...from both ends. I do a fast with the water mixture for breakfast and lunch and don't eat until around 2/3pm. This isn't possible for everyone nor does everyone want to do that so be sure to drink at least an hour before you eat and about 2.5/3 hours after you eat. So as to the contents of book...I think it's very important to read about the history of hydrogen peroxide use and the different ways you can administer it. (REMEMBER TO ONLY USE FOOD GRADE NOT BROWN BOTTLE FROM GROCERY STORE). So there is information in book that you may find that you can work better for your particular ailment, like taking intravenously, or in an oxygen chamber, or a bath, etc. So the information in book it pertinent. It's always important to inform yourself especially on something like this so you can make your best assessment of what you feel is safe and worth the risk, if any. Don't go on my protocol or anyone else's, buy the book used if need be but definitely take the time to do the research as I researched it for quite some time before I ever administered it on myself. Side note, I use 35,% food grade as that is what was suggested in the book but a lot of retailers only carry 12% now. I still found a bottle I think on Amazon that wasn't a gallon but do what you feel comfortable with, although the results will not be as good, imo.ake sure to be accurate in the amount of drops diluted do not go over the recommended doses and pay attention to your body. I was scared the first time but I was pretty fearless and took the plunge and I couldn't be happier that I did. I've been healthy for 12 years now and am grateful for this book. The book is well written, well edited, but a little repetitive in some parts. There is: 1) a short explanation on how to use/dilute 35% food-grade hydrogen peroxide; 2) a good amount of information about diseases that can be cured with H2O2; 3) some anecdotal facts (true or not, it's up to the reader to figure out); 4) some tested and proved facts (also, biased or not it's up to the reader to figure out); 5) and a lot of explanation, numbers, facts, and disclosures about the medical and pharmaceutical industry. In fact, more than 50% of the book is about how corrupt the medical and pharmaceutical industries are. And the author is spot-on! However, I missed more detailed information on the product itself, which is the core of the book. I know already about the corruption in the world; now I just wanted to know more details about H2O2. Example: The author says H2O2 can also be administered to pets and plants, in their water. But he does not make it clear about the ratio, whether is the same as for humans or what. He also recommends using food-grade H2O2 for bathing, foot bath, and mouth wash. However, in other parts of the book he says that pharmaceutical grade can be used for skin and gums. So, it was a little contradicting. Some recommendations are a little too vague, for instance, he says we can use 1 to 8 pints of 3% H2O2 in a tub of water for bathing. But 1 to 8 is a very large scale. I'd like to see something more precise. In a certain part he says we can ingest 3% H2O2 (diluted from 35% food-grade), but even so, 3% should be further diluted in water if we are to drink it. BUT, he does not say the dilution ratio (how many drops of 3% in how many ounces of water?). So, all in all, it's good information, but it's by no means exhaustive or super clear. I'd rate it 5 stars if there were more complete info about the product he advocates and less repetitive info on the corruption of the System. Yes, it's good to know what's going on and why and how we are all being negated ways to be cured; it's important that many people who haven't seen it yet, start noticing it -- for example, that there is no such thing as \"the science hasn't found the cure for cancer yet\". Of course it has, but it's not beneficial to the System to use it. (And that's no novelty, by the way.) So, it's a good book. More complete and clearer info about H2O2 usage would be perfect! As for the accuracy of the facts, or, better yet, the veracity of the claim (healing virtually all diseases), it's up to each reader to consider after reading the book, analyzing it, gathering more info, and maybe even trying this cure! Some people claim this is fake, or inaccurate, or snake-oil. The author is not selling the product, he's just conveying information. Nobody is forced to believe it or use it. And each one should use their own senses to discern if such information is beneficial or not to him or herself. So, I see no reason to discredit the author or the product. He writes what he wants. We read and adopt what we want. Each individual is responsible for their own acts and choices. If you are still in doubt about the benefits of H2O2, read the book. If you read and are still skeptical, just forget about it, then. It's not for you. If you've read and tried it, share with us your experience, good or bad. That's the best way to show if it works or not. Just opinions about the product (H2O2), without trials, are not good enough, because the world is full of bias. You know that, don't you? The only way to accept or reject an idea, unbiasedly, is by using your own experiences. ****This book is a fraud, and a deception...........do you people understand????? ****\"Madison Cavanagh\" is a fake......fabricated name.......understand?? *****This book is \"plagiarized\" from another book that was written years ago!! **** A criminal \"Hispanic\" woman, who has a fake name \"Madison Cavanagh\".......somehow has plagiarized, and copied this book from another author. ......The non-English speaking , illiterate, \"Mexican\" woman , has no education ,or credentials, and is just deceiving you to make a buck.....with \"snake oil\". ****That being said, The \"medical organized criminals.............However their are many \"snake oil\" criminals like \"Mexican female\"....who claims to ......You can't cure cancer with \"carrot juice\", \"radiation\" ,chemicals, peroxide, or praying to god. ****Do not waste your money and time..........this \"plagiarized\" book is snake oil and a big fraud. After a warning from a friend who is better versed in health and science, I researched medical feedback on this practice of consuming H2O2. The overwhelming results from my searches were that this is probably toxic and an unsafe idea. I feel fortunate that I had only consumed the smaller levels when I discontinued consumption. My edition has a copyright of 2008. I also found the bibliography too sparse to support the claims within the book. I would not recommend this book. It seems like dangerous quackery.

Get your cure today from this wonderful herbalist, Dr. UMA. You can also reach doctor UMA on WhatsApp +23,47035619585 This is short book that gives info on using food grade hydrogen peroxide. It gives some history to fill out the book with the meat of the book in the middle. Personally, although it looks intriguing it is a little more complex than what I'm willing to try. Although this is a nice guide, this information can also be found on the internet. This book gives a good overview of the concept of treating virtually all illnesses using food grade hydrogen peroxide. It's written in layman's terms while giving examples and evidence of how hydrogen peroxide works and lists the resources in the bibliography. That being said, the therapy recommended is cheap enough and seems safe enough that I'm willing to give it a shot for helping my asthma. This was a very quick read, only a little over 100 pages. I read it because I was interested in having a bit more in-depth information about oxygen therapy than what is offered online in articles and testimonials from people. The truth is, I believe that you can find thorough and in-depth information just by doing research online. This book did not offer anything extra that I did not already know about the topic at hand. That is not to say it is a bad book. If you know nothing of the subject, it definitely is a good book to build your foundation of knowledge. What I was looking for here, was for this book to offer more info on the actual application of the treatment as far as how to make the hydrogen peroxide solution, the science behind how it works, and to go more in depth about what it does in the body. The book does touch on these things...briefly, but I just wanted more info regarding that. What this book does do a good job of is providing you with the historical context behind the use of oxygen therapy and why it is seen as controversial in the present day society. What I did not like about this book is that it constantly refers to oxygen therapy as a \"panacea\" or a \"cure all\" for all disease. I think that statement is a bit overzealous. I think it is more accurate to say that it would be highly effective in the treatment of most pathogen-based diseases of the body (i.e. this would not include diseases or conditions that are genetically based, for example). What I did like about the book is that it is very short and concise and easy to understand. There is not a lot of \"filler\" info, it's just straight to the point. I wouldn't advise this to be your only source of info on the subject. Please dig deeper, which is why I like that there is a bibliography that references other books in the back of this one. I did appreciate the segment of the book that dealt with the subject of \"stress\" that could cause the oxygen therapy to not be effective. I think this was a nice rebuttal to saying that this was a cure-all answer to all health problems. It basically implies that health is holistic and not just physically based. I don't know what to think. The author informs us about concepts I am very well aware of. Of course doctors and the medical industry NEED us to be sick, otherwise their existence together with their income will be threatened. Therefore I rarely follow the advice of doctors and my doctor in general. But, somehow I find it also very difficult to believe that this so-called cure is without any danger. There are so many rumours and \"cures\" on the internet, that at the end you start wondering what is real? So, I decided to give it a try, but starting with the 3% solution and only externally. If no problems, I could begin with the inhalation method, but I really need to be convinced to try the 35% solution internally! This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers. OH MY GOD! When you learn things you don't know that you should, it is surprising how things can be changed quickly with the right knowledge. This book took me for extremely sick, about to lose limbs and possibly my life. Too low blood pressure ( first time in my adult life), decreased swelling, regaining of the natural color of skin and nails, elimination of extreme pain, and an increase of natural energy. I am now a 62-year-old woman who takes NO drug, including aspirin, and has the ability, with a little motivation to regain my total health and reverse what aging effects I have endured. I am so grateful for this book and the information it has provided. It has made me look at life, healing, health and the medical industry with a side-eye, moving forward. "}
