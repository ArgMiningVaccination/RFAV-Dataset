Introduction Cardiovascular disease (CVD), as a disease that implicates heart and blood vessels, is considered as the highest rate of morbidity and mortality worldwide [ [1](#B1)]. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, CVD results in about 18 million deaths, which accounts for more than 30% of all global deaths [ [2](#B2)]. Anxiety as an ambiguous and unpleasant emotion of panic can affected several aspects of human life and is considered as one of the main difficulties in people's lives [ [3](#B3)]. Anxious patients may not be aware of the cause and source of their anxiety and may not know that the anxiety is due to a feeling of inner insecurity or is the result of an external situation in which they project their fear [ [3](#B3)]. Today, it has been proven that stress and anxiety affect cardiovascular regulation and subsequently negatively affect cardiovascular parameters and tissue perfusion [ [4](#B4)]. Studies in recent years continue to show that stress and anxiety can have negative effects on cortisol levels, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory crises, etc. [ [5](#B5)]. In addition to cardiovascular complications, depending on the severity and duration of exposure to stress and anxiety, a person may be prone to certain diseases such as sleep disorders, neurological diseases, high blood pressure, MS, and even a weakened immune system [ [6](#B6)]. In people with cardiovascular disease, the presence of some certain factors such as high treatment costs and poor prognosis of the disease causes stress and anxiety in patients [ [7](#B7)]. Therefore, maintaining mental health and controlling anxiety in patients is very important. Today, the use of synthetic drugs is no longer the best way to reduce patients' anxiety due to its many side effects. For this reason, there are many strategies, including methods available in complementary medicine, that can help control patients' anxiety [ [8](#B8)]. One of these useful methods in complementary medicine is aromatherapy, which in recent years and in different parts of the world has received much attention compared to other complementary medicine treatments [ [9](#B9)]. In aromatherapy, plant-derived volatile extracts and essential oils, which contain natural chemical compounds with potential medicinal effects, are used to treat diseases [ [10](#B10)]. According to studies, during aromatherapy, plant odor, by acting on the olfactory nerve cells and subsequently activating the limbic system, can accelerate the secretion of various neurotransmitters such as enkephalin, endorphins, noradrenaline, and serotonin, and ultimately the effect. We have a reduction in patient anxiety and stress [ [11](#B11)]. In recent years, many studies have been conducted on aromatherapy with some essential oils as a noninvasive intervention in the treatment of some diseases such as improving anxiety in patients undergoing surgery, hemodialysis, mental disorders, etc. [ [11](#B11), [12](#B12)]. In addition to several studies, it has been shown to have a positive and therapeutic effect of aromatherapy in reducing anxiety in patients with cardiovascular disease [ [13](#B13)]. However, a comprehensive review study about the potential effects of aromatherapy in various cardiovascular diseases such as ischemia, open heart surgery, and angiography has not yet been made, so the purpose of this study was a comprehensive review of studies on the effect of aromatherapy with plant essential oils on the improvement of some conditions, for example, anxiety, stress, sleep quality, fatigue, and pain in people with cardiovascular disease. 2. Materials and Methods We carried out this systematic review based on the instructions of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [ [14](#B14)]. Ethical agreement was not necessary as main data have not been collected. 2.1. Search Strategy During March 2022, we searched the main English databases, for example, Google scholar, Web of Sciences, EMBASE, EBSCO, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and PubMed/MEDLINE, with limitation to human clinical trials. For this study, no time limit was applied for the publication of articles. The search strategy and keywords/MeSH find all published articles, which look at the effect of aromatherapy in patients with cardiovascular disease. 2.2. Selection of Studies At first, all papers were imported into EndNote X10 (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY, USA), and duplicate publications were omitted. The titles, summary or both, of every paper were independently checked by two review authors to assess which papers should be evaluated further. The authors then examined and read full texts of all potentially eligible papers that adequately encountered the inclusion criteria for more analysis. Disagreements were resolved through consent or judged by a third review author. 2.3. Eligibility Criteria In this study, the inclusion criteria of publications were as follows: full and peer-reviewed clinical trials assessing the effect of aromatherapy on patients with cardiovascular diseases were included in this study. We excluded basic experimental studies, nonclinical trial studies, studies that are presented as abstracts and only in congresses as preceding papers, and editorial papers without full text. In the next step, studies with week methodology, insufficient data, unsuitable analysis, discrepancy between methods and results, too much emphasis on important of results, and confusing presentation were excluded from this review (Figure [1](fig1/)). 2.4. Data Extraction The extracted and required data were included authors' name (last name of first author), type of cardiovascular disease, the name of plant that was used, type of factor evaluated (e.g., anxiety, sleep quality, and hemodynamic parameters), intervention method, outcome of study, and reference. 3. Results Out of 1380 papers, 52 papers up to March 2022 were eligible for review in this systematic review with the extracted required information existing in Tables [1](tab1/). Based on the obtained results, the most widely used medicinal plants for aromatherapy in patients with cardiovascular diseases were Lavandula angustifolia (lavender, 55.7%), (peppermint, 5.8%), respectively. Figure [2](fig2/) depicted the used medicinal plants for aromatherapy in patients with cardiovascular diseases. As shown in Figure [3](fig3/), most studies have been performed on the effect of aromatherapy on coronary angiography (21 papers, 40.4%), followed by artery bypass graft surgery (14 studies, 26.9%), and cardiac patients (5 studies, 9.6%). Most studies on the effect of aromatherapy in cardiovascular diseases were performed on anxiety (31 papers, 59.6%), sleep quality (8 studies, 15.4%), and hemodynamic parameters (6 studies, 11.5%), respectively (Figure [4](fig4/)). 4. Discussion From last centuries, aromatherapy as a natural complementary and alternative therapy has been broadly used for treating various diseases and conditions [ [10](#B10)]. In recent years, aromatherapy, which uses essential oils, has taken more attention due to its high efficacy, popularity, and extensive use. [ [65](#B65)]. Essential oils as highly concentrated products derived from various parts of plants (e.g., leaves, root, and flowers) are composed of phytochemicals such as phenols, terpene, aldehydes, and esters, which can provide characteristic odors [ [66](#B66)]. The external application and inhalation of oils are the main basics of aromatherapy for treating a number of mental disorders and illnesses [ [67](#B67)]. Previous studies have been proven the promising effects of aromatherapy for improving anxiety, stress, depression, pain, sleep quality, and life quality in individuals with long-term health complications like dementia [ [68](#B68), [69](#B69)]. Although several studies have been reported the positive and therapeutic effect of aromatherapy in patients with cardiovascular disease, a comprehensive review about the potential effects of aromatherapy in various cardiovascular diseases such as ischemia, open heart surgery, and angiography has not yet been made, so the aim of this study was to review the systematic review and determine the effects of aromatherapy with herbs. It is different in cardiovascular patients. Out of 1380 papers, 52 papers up to March 2022, were eligible for review in this systematic review. Based on the obtained results, the most widely used medicinal plants for aromatherapy in patients with cardiovascular diseases were lavender, Damask rose, and peppermint, respectively. Most studies have been performed on the effect of aromatherapy on coronary angiography (40.4%), followed by artery bypass graft surgery (26.9%), and cardiac patients (9.6%). Most studies on the effect of aromatherapy in cardiovascular diseases were performed on anxiety (59.6%), sleep quality (15.4%), and hemodynamic parameters (11.5%), respectively. Todays, Lavandula angustifolia Miller (lavender) is considered as one of the most frequent essential oils for treatments of mental disorders, for example, anxiety, insomnia, stress, and depression [ [70](#B70)]. Reviews regarding the mechanisms of lavender in aromatherapy, previous studies have revealed that this plant due to the high content of terpenoid compounds such as linalool and linalyl acetate displayed their promising effects in aromatherapy for improving anxiety, and depression through some mechanisms, for example, interact with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and dysfunction of voltage-gated calcium channels, inhibit serotonin transporter (SERT), and increased parasympathetic tone [ [71](#B71)]. In addition, previous investigations showed that linalool and linalyl acetate as the main compounds of lavender essential oil had potent sedative effects through affecting the -aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, indicating the promising effects of lavender essential oil on improving of sleep quality in people [ [72](#B72)]. Rosa damascena Mill (Damask rose) belonging to the Rosaceae family is one of the most frequent aromatic herbs with various pharmacological properties in traditional and modern medicine [ [73](#B73)]. Reviews showed that aromatherapy with Damask rose had positive effects on improving some conditions and disorders, for example, pain, anxiety, and sleep quality in various diseases such as cardiovascular ones [ [74](#B74)]. Concerning the mechanisms of action aromatherapy with Damask rose essential oil, studies showed that this essential oil due to having some flavonoid components, nonadecane, henicosane, and docosane provokes the olfactory parasympathetic activity, releases of endorphin and encephalin neurotransmitters, decreases the sympathetic activity, and releases cortisol and noradrenalin subsequently [ [75](#B75)]. Another plant used in aromatherapy in cardiovascular patients is the Mentha piperita, which also called peppermint. Reviews showed that this plant has various pharmacological properties, for example, anxiolytic, analgesic, sedative, and sleep quality enhancer [ [76](#B76)]. Recent clinical trials reported the potent effects of peppermint in aromatherapy for treating some illness and conditions such as anxiety, fatigue, stress, depression, and pain through affecting the olfactory pathways of the brain, decrease anxiety, relieve pain, relaxation increase, regulating pulse rate, and improving sleep quality [ [77](#B77)]. Although studies reported the possible mechanisms of plant essential oils in aromatherapy, more studies are required to elucidate the main mechanism in various pathways [ [78](#B78)]. 5. Conclusion This study systematically reviewed the effects of aromatherapy in patients with cardiovascular diseases. The review of studies showed that lavender, Damask rose, and peppermint are the most frequents plants used for aromatherapy, whereas they significantly improved some illnesses and conditions, especially anxiety and sleep quality. Therefore, it can be concluded that cardiologist can used aromatherapy as a natural complementary and alternative therapy particularly with lavender, Damask rose, and peppermint to improve quality of life and some conditions such as anxiety and sleep quality.
