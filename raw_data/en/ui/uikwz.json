Cumulative vaccine response *Cumulative vaccine response -proportion of participants have either serum immune response ( a serum rotavirus IgA antibody titer or a serum neutralizing antibodies titer 3 times as high as titer at baseline) 28 days after administration of vaccine and or shedding RV3 -BB between days 3 and 7 after vaccine was received Bines, J.

Incidence values are calculated over a five -year period, five years after the introduction of vaccination. Each boxplot shows the median, IQR and range over 10 simulation runs.
