In order toidentify these changes, we have undertaken cellular andmolecular characterization of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts(CAFs) and their adjacent counterparts (TCFs) isolated from12 breast cancer patients. Normal breast fibroblasts (NBF)from plastic surgery were used as normal control. While the -SMA protein was undetectable in NBF cells, CAFs and TCFswere both positive for this myofibroblast marker. Furthermore,the p53/p21 response pathway to -rays was defective in 70%CAFs, whilst it was normal in all the TCF and NBF cells. Inaddition, the basal levels of p53 and p21 tumor suppressorproteins were lower in 83% of CAFs, and modulated in themajority of TCFs, as compared to NBFs. Interestingly, bothTCFs and CAFs expressed high levels of the cancer markersurvivin, and consequently exhibited high resistance to thekilling effects of cisplatin and UV light. Moreover, most CAFswere positive for the proliferation marker Ki-67 and exhibitedhigh proliferation rate as compared to NBF and TCF cells.Using the 2 dimensional gel electrophoresis technique, havealso shown that CAFs, TCFs and NBF present differentproteome profiles, with many proteins differentially expressedbetween these cells, indicating that different genetic alterationsoccur in breast carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and also theircorresponding adjacent counterparts. 2 INTRODUCTION TO RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY Gregory P. Adams 1, Jorgen Carlsson2and Torgny Stigbrand3 1Department of Medical Oncology, Fox BA, USA; 2Biomedical Radiation Sciences, Uppsala University, Sweden; 3Department of Immunology and Clinical Microbiology, University of Umea, Sweden Targeted radionuclide therapy can provide an effective method of selectively focusing cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. Thesemethods have been successfully employed in the clinical treatment of diffuse (liquid) malignancies but have, as of yet,failed to achieve similar successes in the setting of solidtumors. This talk will provide an overview of the successes oftargeted radionuclide therapy, outline some of the hurdles thatremain and discuss possible approaches that can be taken toenhance therapeutic outcomes. 3 OPTIMIZING ANTIBODY-BASED MOLECULES FOR RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY ANDRADIOIMMUNOIMAGING Gregory P. AdamsDepartment of Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, 333 Cottman Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA Due to prolonged retention in the circulation and restricted ability to penetrate into solid tumors, intact antibodies areoften not the most effective vehicles for the delivery ofradioisotopes to tumors for therapeutic and imagingapplications. However, antibody-based molecules can berationally modified to improve their ability to selectivelydeliver radioisotopes to tumor tissue. This presentation willreview our experience and that of others on the impact ofaltering antibody size, affinity and ability to interact with FcRnon targeting efficiency. 4 CETUXIMAB WITH HEPATIC ARTERIAL INFUSIONOF CHEMOTHERAPY FOR THE M. Aerts F. Vandenbroucke, H. Everaert, V . Meert, J. De Mey, M. De Ridder, G. Delvaux and J. De Gr\u00e8ve (HAI) of chemotherapy and cetuximab (CET) have interesting activityfor the treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRC-LM). Patients Methods: Intravenous CET with HAI oxaliplatin (OXA) or i.v.Irinotecan (IRI) followed by HAI of infusion of folic acid modulated 5-fluorouracil 5-FU/l-FA wasadministered to patients (pts) with CRC-LM who had failedat least one line of prior chemotherapy . Results: Eight pts received i.v.CET with HAI-OXA (5 pts) and i.v.-IRI (3 pts) and HAI-5-FU/l-FA. Adverse events: repeated grade 3 skintoxicity (1 pt), abdominal pain with elevated liver enzymesand asthenia (2 pts), duodenal ulcer (2 pts) with cathetermigration and intestinal bleeding (1 pt), reversible interstitialpneumonitis (1 pt), and cystic bile duct dilatation (2 pts) withAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3185arteriobiliary fistulisation (1 pt). A partial response was documented in 5 pts (62%). The median time to progressionwas 8.7 months (95% confidence interval 8-14 months).Conclusion: Intravenous administration of CET with HAI of chemotherapy is feasible and has promising activity but isassociated with specific toxicity. 5 PATHOLOGY AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE Niki J. AgnantisDepartment of Pathology, University of Ioannina Medical School, Greece The word \"Pathology\" originates from the Greek words Pathos (suffering) and Logos (study) and, as its name implies, it is adiscipline devoted to the study of the cause, the pathogenesis,the morphological changes and functional derangement ofcells, tissues and organs in disease. Anatomic pathology hasoriginated in Europe 245 years ago and it has come a longway since the time that Morgagni encouraged the postmortemsearch for the cause and nature of disease. During this longcourse the histological techniques have been continuouslyimproving and pathologists have been incorporating a varietyof methods in their every-day practice, making diagnosis morerefined and definite. Today, pathologists are able to makediagnoses by examining a whole organ, a fragment of tissue,or even a few cells. Advances in facing cancer range widely,from basic research designed to understand the molecularcauses of cancer, through the application of this knowledge forthe patients' benefit. Both basic and clinical research, the latterbeing dependent on the former, are now developing at a fastpace. Pathology is the discipline that acts as a bridge betweenClinical Medicine and Basic Sciences. A classical paradigm on the role of the pathologist in basic research is his contribution in elucidating the pathogenesis ofcolorectal carcinoma. Every stage of adenocarcinomadevelopment has been identified and the progressiveaccumulation of genetic changes at the molecular level hasbeen shown to parallel the clinical and histopathologicprogression defined as \"adenoma-carcinoma sequence\". Another example is that of breast cancer. Subclassification of breast carcinomas is important, since some types such astubular and medullary carcinomas, have better prognosis thanothers. However, the morphological features of the neoplasmdo not always reveal its underlying biology, as patients withthe same tumor type can demonstrate different courses of theirdisease. Several molecular markers have recently beendeveloped to predict the response of neoplastic cells to acertain type of therapy. Immunohistochemical analysis ofestrogen receptors (ER) and ERBB2/HER2/NEUexpression can be used to predict responses to tamoxifen oraromatic inhibitors and trastuzumab/hesrceptin respectively, as these therapies are designed to target these molecules. FISHhas proved to be a powerful molecular DNA technique inpathology. Another technique that is used with increasingfrequency is CGH. New technology using DNA microarraysprovides a systemic method to identify key markers forprognosis and treatment response by profiling thousands ofgenes expressed in a single tumor. Microarrays have thepotential to revolutionize the practice of pathology byproviding a molecular \"signature\" that is characteristic of eachneoplasm. All these new molecular pathology techniques are necessary, but they should be applied with caution. Theyshould be critically appraised and analyzed in detail regardingcost/benefit, in order to contribute the most to patient care. 6 EFFECTS OF THERAPY WITH THERADIOLABELLED SOMATOSTATIN ANALOGUE[ 90Y-DOTA0,TYR3]OCTREOTATE IN PATIENTS WITH MENINGIOMA: REVIEW OF 16 CASES M. Agostini1, F. De Lauro1, M. Casi1, C. viale 286, 47023 47023 Cesena, used primarily in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrinetumors. Here we present the effects of this therapy in a smallnumber of patients with meningiomas. In these patients thetherapy of choice is surgery and radiotherapy, however, thepresence of cellular structures for amine uptake and storageallow targeted therapy. Meningiomas are tumors derived fromcap cells adherent to the dura mater, mostly close to thearachnoid villi or skull base foramina; they express differentkinds of receptors. Meningiomas are frequently somatostatinreceptor-positive, and somatostatin receptor scintigrafy maybe used to differentiate remnant or recurrent meningioma fromnon-specific hyperperfusion during postsurgical follow-up.Treatment with 90Y-labeled somatostatin analogs patients with meningioma has been undertaken in selected cases.Materials and Methods: We evaluated 16 consecutive patients (7 male/9 female; mean age 64 yrs, range 39-78 yrs.) treatedin our unit with 90Y DOTA-TOC in the period 01-03-03 to 15- 04-07. Eight patients received surgical treatments beforenuclear medicine therapy, 4 had radiotherapy, 3 surgicaltreatments and radiotherapy and one patient no treatment. Themean cumulative administered activity for each patient wasANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 31866400 MBq (range 1480-12987 MBq), divided into 4 cycles. The interval between each single treatment was 6-9 weeks.Mean follow-up was 12 months (range 6-24 mo.). Renalscintigraphy with GFR study was performed before eachtreatment cycle. Routine haematology, liver and kidneyfunction tests were applied prior to each therapy, as well as atfollow-up visits. CT scan or MRI and somatostatin receptorimaging was performed within 3 months before the firsttherapy and 4-5 months after the last treatment to evaluate theeffects of the therapy on tumour size and metastases. Results: Partial remission was found in 3 patients (19%), stable diseasein 8 (50%) and progressive disease in 5 (31%). None of thepatients presented bone marrow and renal toxicity after anytreatment. The patient-assessed quality of life was judged asstable by 5 patients (31%), better by 6 (38%) and worse by 5(31%). Conclusion: 90Y DOTA-TOC can be effective in patients with meningioma. Response rates are lower than thosein patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.Most meningiomas were very large. Further studies are neededto confirm the treatment outcome because of the limitednumber of patients in our study. The side-effects of therapyare few and mostly transient, and neither renal nor marrowfunction seriously deteriorated in any of our patients. 7 GROWTH OF HUMAN TUMOUR CELLS IN A CELLULAR MICROENVIRONMENT SUPPLIED BY HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL INDUCED TERATOMAS J. 1, Kogner1and L. \u00c4hrlund-Richter1 1Department Child of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, 171 76 Central Hospital, 80187 G\u00e4vle, Sweden Objectives: For clinically relevant studies on tumour progression, in vivo experimental systems with a human cellular microenvironment would be advantageous. We have forthis purpose studied growth support for adult vs. paediatric neuroectoderm-derived human tumours (melanomas cell derived in themouse (the hEST-model). Results: A mature hESC-teratoma environment was permissive for the integration and growth ofall the injected tumours (Cedervall et al. submitted), in line with previous results of Tzukerman et al. , in a similar experimental system (Cancer Res, 66(7) : 3792-3801, 2006). Inaddition, we found the resulting tumour histology similar to conventional xeno-graft models, with predominantly areas ofdensely packed tumour cells. Uniquely for the hEST-model,some tumours also showed areas with less dense growthappearing in a surrounding of loose mesenchymal or fibrousstroma. The latter tumour population, but not the former,showed markers and morphology indicative of dedifferentiationand migration. An enhanced neovascularisation was indicatedin areas of human mesenchymal tissues facing the tumourgrowth. The results furthermore indicated a specificity in theprocess of integration, distinct for each tumour type. Theunique experimental advantage of a human cellularmicroenvironment revealed species-specific interactions of thetumour cells with the surrounding microenvironment, asindicated by differential appearances of a selection of markerslinked to differentiation/migration/malignancy. In conclusion,the hEST-model provides new exciting options for molecularin vivo studies on differentiation, invasiveness and malignancy, opening also possibilities for improved clinical relevance instudies and evaluations of novel therapeutic interventions.

Davis Jewish General Hospital,Departments of Medicine and Oncology, McGill University,3755 Cote Ste-Catherine, Montreal, Canada H3T 1E2 An early event by which cancer cells switch from localized to invasive phenotype is initiated by the acquisition of motileproperties; a process driven by dynamic assembly anddisassembly of multiple focal adhesion (FA) and cellcytoskeleton proteins, which mediate cell-matrix attachments,extracellular matrix degradation, and can serve as traction sitesfor motile cells. These processes are regulated by theAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3187activation of integrins, as well as by growth factor receptors, including the ErbB/Her tyrosine kinases. We previouslyreported that cancer cell invasion induced by overexpressionof the ErbB-2 receptor is dependent on focal adhesion kinase(FAK), a major kinase and adapter protein of the FA signalingpathway. Here, we report that ErbB receptor signalingregulates FA turnover via the Src-FAK pathway. Using biochemical and confocal imaging assays, we demonstratedthat inhibition of the Src-FAK signaling in a panelof ErbB-2-positive cells regulates FA turnover, leading toenhanced number and size of peripherally localized adhesionsand inhibition of invasion. These phenotypes following inhibition of ErbB signaling in cellslacking Src or FAK, but are restored after re-expression of Srcand FAK in these deficient cells. Furthermore, molecularstudies on downstream events revealed that ErbB signalingregulates the turnover of several FA-associated proteins,including FAK, in part via increased calpain 2 activity. Immunohistochemical analysis on progression tissuemicroarray, composed of a large breast tissue bank frompatients treated at this institution for various stages of breastdisease, showed a correlation between overexpression of FAKand specific FAK-partners in FA signaling and cancerprogression and outcome. The implications of thesedownstream targets for invasive breast cancer models and theimpact on novel FA inhibitors in preclinical trials will bediscussed.

Al-Saji 1and M.D. of Graduate Studies, Molecular Biology MSc Program; 2Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University, Kuwait Introduction: Estrogen receptors -alpha and -beta mediate Several mRNA splice variants exist forboth receptors and the normal estrogen function results from abalance between the wild-type ERs and their functional variants that may interfere with the coexpressed wild-typeforms in a dominant negative manner, or by becoming ligand-independently activated. In addition, ER-alpha and ER-betaisoforms can exert opposite biological activities, as it isevident that ER-alpha stimulates cell proliferation while ER-beta can inhibit ER-alpha-stimulated cell proliferation.Methods: 45 FFPE breast cancer samples were used in this study. ReT-PCR analysis was conducted using ER-alphaprimer sets detecting wild-type (wt) and exon deleted 3, 5, 6and 7 variants. The ER-beta primer sets used detected the wtER-beta 1 and the ER-beta 2 and ER-beta 5 variants. At theend of the ReT-PCR cycles a dissociation curve (meltingcurve) was generated which showed the number of peaks foreach sample at specific melting temperatures (Tm). If morethan one peak is obtained at the higher melting temperaturesthen this indicates the presence of variants for the specificgene of interest. In addition the dissociation curves provide uswith a peak derivative that reflects the intensity of the band.Results: Using this method minimal amounts of mRNA could be detected and many samples expressed not only the wt ERisoforms but also their variants. The Tm value served as a cut-off point for determination of wt versus variant ER expression. Wild-type to variant ratio was easily calculated from the peakderivatives. Conclusion: This method allowed us to detect both ER isoforms and their variants in FFPE breast cancer tissue.This method, by showing wt and variants, can be used as aninvaluable tool in the clinical field to predict the response ofpatients to antiestrogen therapy. 10 EXPRESSION OF GROWTH HORMONE RECEPTORIN NEOPLASMS OF THE PROSTATE Anwar Al-Banaw 1and David T. Lincoln2 1Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Kuwait University, Kuwait; 2Entity Systems, Independent Research Foundation, Chapel Hill, QLD, Australia Knowledge of the mechanisms initiating and regulating prostate neoplasm and mesenchymal-epithelial interactionduring its development is limited and information aboutpotential trophic agents incomplete. Apart from regulating thegrowth and functions of the normal human prostate gland,androgens are also involved in the growth of prostate cancer.In addition, receptors for steroid hormone, including insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), have been shown to exert aregulatory effect in the normal prostate gland. Recent evidenceindicates that growth hormone (GH) may play an importantrole in tumour cell growth. Somatostatin analogues have beenfound to retard the growth of experimental prostatecarcinomas. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3188This study further investigates the expression of growth hormone receptor (GHR) in human benign prostatehyperplasia (n=20) and in prostate carcinomas antibody (mAb against human GHR.Tumours, consisting of classified according to the gradingsystem of Gleason and based on the degree of glandulardifferentiation and the growth pattern of the tumour in relationto the stroma, as evaluated on low-power examination. Todelineate tumour cell growth, immunohistochemical analysisof proliferating cell nuclear antigen, using PCNA polyclonalantibody, was used to investigate proliferative indexes. Results from this investigation confirm the presence of specific receptors for GH in prostate tissue from patientsaffected by benign prostate hyperplasia (BHP) andcarcinoma. GHR Immunoreactivity showed sub-cellularlocalization of the receptor in cell membranes, andcytoplasm and nuclei were also reactive in some cases. Incases of BHP, the GHR expression was localized throughoutthe epithelium of the tumour acini. Of the weakly reactive with mAb 263. In prostatecarcinomas, regular distinct expression of GHR wasobserved in the epithelium of the small, atypically formedglands in irregular arrangement. Heterogeneity ofimmunoreactivity was present with a variable range ofpositive cells. Of the 62 cases studied, 77% were moderatelyto strongly positive, In foci within higher Gleason grade andcorrelating with prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the relativeproportion of positive cells and intensity of immunoreactivitywas increased in higher grade carcinomas, compared tolower grades and BHP. In contrast to BHP and prostatecarcinomas, GHR expression was absent in normal prostateepithelial cells. Furthermore, there was a positive correlationof GHR immunoreactivity with neoplastic cellularproliferation, as measured by PCNA, the percentage ofPCNA-positive tumour cells, representing the average of 10fields each tumour case was 1.97% in prostate hyperplasia;6.3% for and 61.1% grade 5b prostate Inconclusion, the presence of GHRs in human BHP andcarcinoma strongly supports the concept that GH, known toincrease mRNA levels of androgen receptor, IGF-1 and IGF-1 receptors in immature prostate, reacts on prostate targettissue to facilitate cellular proliferation. Our results areconsistent with the hypothesis that GH acts locally togenerate IGF-1 which then acts as mitogenic factor for thesecells. Whether these effects of GH on prostate tissue aremediated by a direct action of IGF-I in an autocrinemechanism regulating tumour cell growth remains to ENDOTHELIAL CELL PROLIFERATION ANDANGIOGENESIS IN V ASCULAR TUMOURS: ADIRECT ROLE FOR GROWTH HORMONE Anwar Al-Banaw 1, Fred Sinowatz2and David T. Lincoln3 1Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Kuwait University, Kuwait; 2Institute of veterinary Anatomy, University of Munich, Germany; 3Entity Systems, Independent Research Foundation, Chapel Hill, QLD, Australia Introduction: Vascular tumours are common lesions of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, but also occur in many othertissues and internal Well-differentiated tumours may show solid strands sheets,resembling carcinoma or lymphoma. Several growth factors,including basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growthfactors and vascular endothelial growth factor, play a role intumour angiogenesis. Growth hormone (GH) is mitogenic fora variety of vascular tissue cells, including smooth musclecells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells and exerts its regulatoryfunctions in controlling metabolism, balanced growth anddifferentiated cell expression by acting on specific membrane-bound receptors, which trigger a phosphorylation cascaderesulting in the modulation of numerous signalling pathwaysand of gene expression. Materials and Methods: To address the site/mode of action through which GH exerts its effects invascular technology miceimmunized with purified rabbit and rat liver GH-receptor(GHR) and directed against the hormone-binding site of thereceptor, was applied to total of 64 benign and malignantvascular tumours from different human organs to determineGHR expression. Quantitative immunohistochemical analysisof GHR expression, cycling nuclear protein (Ki-67) andproliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was carried out bycalculating the percentage of stained cells using a Zeissmicroscope connected to a computer with image analysissoftware. To ensure reproducible and objective assessment ofstaining, 10 representative areas, each containing 1,000 tumourcells, were observed under high-power field (objective lensx40) in a vertical section taken from the centre of the lesion.The proportion of positive cells was expressed as percentageof total cells counted. Grading of microvascular density(MVD) was according to a scoring system: up to 25 vessels =1+, 26-50 vessels = vessels = 3+, while >100 vessels was graded as 5+. Results: Compared to their normal tissue counterparts, nuclear and cytoplasmicexpression of GHR consistently resulted in strong receptorAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3189immunoreactivity in the highly malignant angiosarcomas and Kaposi's sarcomas, and was localized in the cell membranesand cytoplasm, but strong nuclear immunoreactivity was alsoidentified. The presence intracellular GHRs is the result ofendoplasmic reticulum and Golgi localization. Nuclearlocalization is due to identical nuclear GHR-binding protein.The receptor expression was especially prominent in the solidbuds of newly forming capillaries of infiltrating vasculartumours, indicating a role of GH in tumour angiogenesis.There was a positive correlation of GHR expression andcellular proliferation and cycling, both Ki-67 and PCNA beingsignificantly higher in vascular tumours with high GHRexpression. The median grade MVD score of the vasculartumours varied from 2.4 for benign haemangiomas to 4.7 inhighly malignant haemangiopericytomas. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that GHRs are strongly expressed inmalignant vascular tumour cells. cells in angiogenesis and vascular tumour growthis emphasized by the positive correlation between vasculartumour cells having endothelial cell characteristics and bothtumour vascularity and tumour growth rates. Malignanttumour cells, which are highly expressive of the receptor, havea greater proliferation rate compared to benign tumours. Thepresence of GHRs in endothelial cells of vascular neoplasmindicates that they are target cells and GH is of importance inthe proliferation of vascular tumour angiogenesis. GH isnecessary not only for differentiation of progenitor cells, butalso for their subsequent clonal expansion and maintenance.This study supports the hypothesis that GH is involved inparacrine-autocrine mechanism, acting locally in regulatingvascular tumour growth and will be useful for site-specificstudies of the evolution of vascular cancer. The use of anti-GHR antibodies to block tumour progression is an intriguingpossibility. 12 MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF CIRCULATINGTUMOR CELLS (CTC): CLINICAL Germany Background: Therapy is typically based on distinct properties of the primary tumor like HER2 or hormone status. However,metastases exhibit frequently a different phenotype leading toresistance towards therapy. The (re-)appearance of CTC mayreflect this situation. Objectives: The studies were designed to evaluate the phenotype of CTC, to compare it with the one ofthe primary tumors in the same patients and to correlate the presence of CTC in metastatic breast cancer patients with theclinical outcome. Methods: Duplicate samples of 5.5 ml blood were drawn from patients and tested for the presence of CTCwith the AdnaTest BreastCancer according to the manufacturer's instruction (AdnaGen AG) in a multiplex RT-PCR. This the of The over-expression of the estrogen receptor (ER)and of the progesterone receptor (PR) was determined with theAdnaTest ER/PR in a separate multiplex RT-PCR using the same cDNA. The over-expression of HER2, ER and PR in theprimary tumor was evaluated by IHC. Results: The primary tumors of 30 CTC positive patients were analysed for ER andPR over-expression. 21 (70%) tumors were positive and 6(20%) negative for both, ER and PR. 2 (7%) tumors over-expressed ER only. One tumor was negative for ER butpositive for PR. 2 patients had ER/PR positive, 22 (73%)negative CTC. 6 (20%) CTC were ER positive but PRnegative. None of the patients with an ER/PR negativeprimary tumor developed positive CTC. Similarly, the primarytumors of 47 patients were analysed for HER2 over-expression.7 (15%) cases were defined as triple positive, 40 (85%) asnegative. However, 16 (40%) of the patients with HER2negative harboured HER2 positive CTC. The overallconcordance of the histological findings on the primary tumorswith the results obtained with the AdnaTest BreastCancer was 55% for HER2 and 50% for ER, strongly indicating thatphenotypic changes may occur during the course of the disease.In a separate cohort of 32 metastatic patients therapy responsewas predicted in 78% of all cases. The persistence of CTCcorrelated significantly ( p=0.005) with shorter survival. Conclusion: There is often HER2 over-expression on CTC in patients with HER2 negative primary tumors. This might offerthe possibility to treat patients with Herceptin \u00aewho so far would not be eligible to it. On the other hand, the over-expression of ER/PR is rarer on CTC, which might reflectresistance to hormone therapy. Testing for CTC may offeradditional information with respect to prognosis, riskassessment for recurrence and prediction of therapy response. 13 IMPLICATION OF OXIDATIVE STRESS IN THEANTITUMOR EFFECT OF TAXANES: FROM BASICRESEARCH docetaxel, are microtubule- targeted agents (MTA) widely used in cancer therapy. Theirprimary cellular effect is to cause abnormal stabilization of thedynamic microtubule polymerization. T induce failure ofANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 3190mitosis but also alter intracellular signaling that involves microtubules. Recently, oxidative stress has emerged as a major component of the intracellular signals controlling cell death andproliferation. We showed that paclitaxel (PCX) induces earlyhydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) accumulation in human cells. PCX is inversely correlated to intracellular contentof The GSH precursor, N-acetylcysteine, abolishesPCX antitumor activity in mice, confirming that H 2O2 generation is a crucial step for T-induced cancer cell-death. We showed that PCX promotes oxidative stress through enhancing the activity of NADPH oxidase (NOX) associatedwith plasma membranes. Treatment of breast cancer an increased translocation of Rac1 to the membranefraction. Rac1 is a positive regulatory protein of NOX andmay be associated with microtubules in cytosol. By activatingNOX, PCX induces H 2O2accumulation outside the cells. Using co-culture systems, we observed that extracellular H2O2 causes lethal damage and proliferation inhibition to thebystander cancer cells not exposed to PCX. This maycontribute to the anticancer activity of PCX. The bystandereffect was also observed with other MTA but with or to H 2O2, constituting a rationale to develop therapeutic combinations of T and SOD mimics.Mangafodipir, a contrast agent used in magnetic resonanceimaging, has SOD-, catalase-, and GSH reductase-likeproperties, allowing it to act at multiple steps of the reactiveoxygen species cascade. We observed that mangafodipiramplifies the inhibitory effect of PCX on tumor growth andprotects mice against PCX-induced leucopenia and sepsis,improving its therapeutic index. This differential effectbetween normal and cancer cells may be related to theobservation that, in cancer cells, basal H 2O2concentration is increased and antioxidant systems are overwhelmed. These findings open important clinical perspectives. Expression of proteins controlling the cellular redoxenvironment may influence the sensitivity of tumor cells to Tand other anticancer agents. Finally, oxidative stress-modulating agents may improve the therapeutic index of T. 14 LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT PROTEIN TYROSINEPHOSPHATASE ISOFORMS AND Silva, Lu\u00eds Costa and Manuel Bicho Genetics Laboratory, Metabolism and Endocrinology Center, Faculdade as crucial for the generation of signals necessary for cellular metabolism,proliferation, growth, migration, and invasion of malignantcells. The contribution of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)for the control of cell phosphorylation state is as relevant asthat of phosphotyrosine protein kinase. Low molecular weight protein tyrosines (LMW-PTPs) are a family of 18 kDa enzymes that have been implicated in theregulation of cell growth without tissue specifity. Human redcell acid phosphatase (ACP1; EC 3.1.3.2) member of the cytosolic LMW-PTPs: three commonalleles (A, B and C) segregating at the ACP1 locus on theshort arm of chromosome 2 (2p25) give to six genotypes.Each allele encodes two electrophoretically different isozymes,fastand slow (according to their relatively fast or slow anodal electrophoretic mobility), derived by alternative splicing of theprimary RNA transcript and differing only in the sequencespanning residues 40-73. These isozymes are produced inallele specific ratios. These two isozymes may have differentroles in the progression of oncologic pathology: fast are involved in migration, invasion and cell adhesion, activatingdifferent substrates after PDGF-R stimulation; slow isozymes, PDGF-R, have growth factors as substrates,e.g. PDGF, leading to a decrease of cellular growth through its dephosphorylation. ACP1 seems to have an oncogenic role through the increase of fastgenotypes in cancer patients. Fast isozymes, associated with cytoskeletal organization, are the only ones activated bytyrosine phosphorylation in two positions of tyrosine aftergrowth factor stimulus, which promotes adhesion and cellularmigration and facilitates metastasis and invasion. 15 A GENETIC LOOK AT MIDDLE EASTERNCOLORECTAL CANCER Khawla S. Cancer Genomic Research, Research Center at KFNCCC&R, 2Department of Pathology, 3Colorectal Unit, Department of Surgery, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, P.O. Box 3354,Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. In Saudi Arabia, the incidence of CRCis increasing, whereas the incidence rate was originally lowerthan in Western countries. According to latest statistics, CRCis considered the second most common cancer among Saudimales and the third most common among Saudi females.Significant improvements have been made in the managementof this disease mainly through the introduction of adjuvantchemotherapy agents such as flurouracil and oxaliplatin. MoreAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3191recently, advances in the understanding of tumor biology have led to the development of targeted therapies, allowing progressin the treatment of colorectal cancer. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) regulates a number of intracellular proteins that govern cell cycle tumor, growthand survival via degrading a number of different polypeptides important for cell cycle progression and apoptosis. SKP2, anF-box protein targets generaltypes of cancer. We investigated the role of SKP2 and itsubiquitin-proteasome pathway in CRC using a panel of celllines, clinical samples and a nude mouse model. Usingimmunohistochemical analysis on a large tissue microarray of448 samples, an inverse association of SKP2 expression withp27 Kip1protein levels was seen. A CRC subset with high level of SKP2 and low level of p27Kip1showed a decreased overall survival ( p=0.0057). Treatment of CRC cell lines with bortezomib or expression of siRNA of SKP2 caused down-regulation of SKP2 and accumulation of p27 Kip1. Furthermore, treatment of CRC cells with bortezomib caused apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway and activation of cell line xenografts with bortezomib resulted in growth inhibition of tumors in nudemice via down-regulation of SKP2 and accumulation of p27 Kip1. Altogether, our results suggest that SKP2 and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may be a potential target fortherapeutic intervention for treatment of CRC. 16 DOMAIN I OF THE UROKINASE PLASMINOGENACTIV ATOR RECEPTOR IN SERUM IS ANINDEPENDENT PROGNOSTIC FACTOR NON-SMALL CELL LUNG Research The urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) system is a cascade of reactions participating in thedegradation of extracellular matrix during cancer invasion. TheuPA receptor, uPAR, is a key enzyme consisting of threedomains denoted I, II and III. In addition to its involvement inthe plasminogen activation, uPA can cleave a neighbouring uPAR molecule between domains I and II. We have previouslyshown that high blood levels of both intact and cleaved uPARforms are associated to short survival in patients operated fornon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Purpose: To validate the prognostic impact of intact NSCLC patients. 171 patients radicallyoperated for NSCLC ( population A ). The median observation time was 3.8 years. A subpopulation of 124 lung cancerpatients was selected with squamous cell carcinomas (SCC)or adenocarcinomas stage I-III ( population B ). This subpopulation was further restricted to those patients (n=90)having no other treatment than operation ( population C ). The levels of the uPAR(I-III), three in-house time-resolvedfluoroimmunoassays. Results: Significant associations were found between both uPAR(I-III) and uPAR(I) and gender.uPAR(I) was the uPAR form with the most significantassociation to survival, and was therefore used for furtheranalyses. High serum levels of uPAR(I) were associated toshort survival in the three populations. These associations wereindependent of stage, histology, age, WHO performance statusand therapy ( Population A C.I.: 1.47-6.34, p=0.003). addition to uPAR(I), only stage was a significant prognostic factor inall three populations. No interactions between uPAR(I) andhistological subtype could be detected. Conclusion and Perspectives: This study validates that uPAR(I) in serum is an independent prognostic factor in patients radically operated forNSCLC. A possible application of uPAR(I) is as asupplementary tool in the selection of early-stage NSCLCpatients for adjuvant therapy. 17 THE THIOREDOXIN-THIOREDOXIN Anwar G. Al-Banaw1and David T. Lincoln3 1Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Kuwait University, Kuwait; 2Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University, Kuwait; 3Entity Systems, Independent Research Foundation, Chapel Hill, Australia Oxidation-reduction has emerged as a fundamental biological control mechanism. One of the major redox control systemsconsists (2008) 3192R). Together, they form a powerful system involved in many central intracellular and extracellular processes, including cellproliferation, redox regulation of gene expression and signaltransduction, protection against oxidative stress, anti-apoptoticfunctions, growth factor and co-cytokine effects, and theregulation of the redox state of the extracellular environment. Inrecent times, this system has increasingly been linked to thedevelopment and expression of cancer phenotypes, cancer cellssecreting thioredoxin in varied amounts. The secreted TRXtends to sensitize the cells to growth factors, produced by thecancer cells themselves, by increasing the potentiation of thegrowth factors, making the cells more susceptible to them andtherefore leading to increased cellular proliferation. Thus, TRXacts like an enhancement for growth factors and stimulates thegrowth of cancer cells. In this investigation, we have usedimmunocytochemical approaches to simultaneously determinethe expression and localization of both TRX and TRX-R inneoplasms of the thyroid gland. Thyroid cancer is the secondmost common malignancy following breast cancer in Kuwaitifemales. The incidence of thyroid cancer per every 100,000females is 7.4 and constitutes ten percent of all commonmalignancies. This retrospective study of thyroid cancers,involving 111 female and 55 male patients, (n=48),Immunohistochemical identification and localization of TRXwas performed using purified mouse anti-human TRXmonoclonal antibody. Expression of TRX-R was demonstratedusing an anti-human TRX-R antiserum prepared byimmunization of rabbits against purified human placentalthioredoxin reductase. The antiserum was assessed forspecificity by Western Blot analysis against purified humanTRX-R and human cell and tissue extracts and detected assingle 56K band of human TRX-R. The results from thisinvestigation show increased staining intensity of both TRXand TRX-R in the cytoplasm and nuclei of thyroid cancer cells,compared to normal thyroid tissue. Expression of increasedTRX immunoreactivity was found in 15% of the benign colloidnodule in 45% of and in 85% of all invasive follicularthyroid carcinomas. Furthermore, increased levels of TRXimmunoreactivity positively correlated with thioredoxinreductase (TRX-R) expression and localization. This enzyme,involved in the reduction of thioredoxin, was also highlyexpressed in thyroid cancer cells, reflecting that a large amountof its thioredoxin substrate is also present. Of the 166 thyroidcancer cases investigated, overexpression of TRX-R was foundin 12% benign colloid colloidgoiters, in papillary and in80% of follicular thyroid carcinomas. In the caseof invasive follicular carcinomas, showed between thioredoxin andthioredoxin reductase expression, and number of positivelymph nodes. In conclusion, the correlation of TRX and TRX-R immunoreactivity with advanced malignancy suggests apositive association of enhanced expression of these twoproteins with the more aggressive tumour phenotypes. Suchtumours have a high proliferation rate, a low apoptosis rate andan elevated metastatic potential, all of which can be influencedby the actions of the thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system.Results from this investigation also indicate that thyroid tumourcells use thioredoxin as an autocrine growth stimulate.Occurrence of oxidative stress within the cells induces TRX-Rrelease which, due to its anti-apoptotic activity, causesinhibition of apoptosis, resulting in abnormal cell proliferationinitiating development. Aggressive tumours displayintense immunoreactivity of thioredoxin and thioredoxinreductase and due to the former, have a high proliferation rateand low apoptosis rate. This indicates that increased TRX andTRX-R expression is associated with tumourigenesis. Inaddition, secreted TRX can also act as an extracellular growthfactor for both normal and tumour cells and enhance thesensitivity of the cells to other growth factors. As such, thisstudy further emphasizes the potential benefits of anti-TRX/TRX-R agents in cancer therapeutics in the treatment ofthyroid cancers. 18 ASSESSMENT AND COMPARISON OF EFFLUXPUMPS OF CANCER CELLS AND MDR BACTERIAUNDER PHYSIOLOGICAL for Food Safety, School of Agriculture, Food Science and Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin,Dublin, France; Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 31936Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Szeged H- 6720, Szeged, Hungary Assessment of overexpressed efflux pumps (EPs) is usually conducted with the common EP substrate fluorochromeethidium bromide (EB) in the absence and presence of agentsthat are believed to inhibit EPs and hence promote theaccumulation of EB. This method is conducted at roomtemperature with a buffer of pH 7 and usually without anysource of metabolic energy. These conditions are far fromthose under which EPs are expected to function optimally. Thesemi-automated method to be presented utilises a buffer whosepH ranges from 5 to 8, contains a source of metabolic energyand is maintained at 37C. These are conditions that favourefflux and hence should be suitable for the study of EPs ofmultidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Accumulation of EB, itsefflux, and the effects of agents that increase accumulation andinhibit efflux, has been followed on a real-time basis with theaid of the Rotor-Gene 3000. The method has been appliedfor the study of EPs of MDR strains of Escherichia coli , Salmonella, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and mycobacteria. Overall, whereas at pH 5 CCCP, PAN andphenothiazines do not increase the accumulation of EB orprevent its efflux under conditions that favor efflux, withincreasing pH, these agents cause increased accumulation ofEB, although the medium is highly supportive of efflux. Theresults suggest that at low pH, the energy (protons) that is usedfor driving efflux is supplied by the proton gradient, whereasat high pH the needed protons are provided by metabolicenergy. Evaluation of the efflux pump of cancer cells was alsoconducted by the same methodology. The results presentedshow that the assessment and inhibition of efflux pumps ofcancer cells that render the cells immune to cytotoxic agentscan be conducted on a real-time basis with a degree ofprecision not possible with flow cytometry. Moreover, becauseof the capacity of the system, a large number of cell systemscan be evaluated and compared with any one run of themethod. 19 AN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK-BASEDEV Ameiryan , Gajanan . Sherbet, Wai L. Woo and Satnam S. Dlay School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK The presence of tumour cells in the regional lymph nodes is routinely employed to determine tumour spread and predictprognosis. Minimally invasive methods to achieve this havebeen keenly sought. Many biomarkers have been identified that appear to relate to the aggressive behaviour of cancer.This study aims to assess four biomarkers using an ArtificialNeural Network (ANN) to predict the presence of metastatictumour in the regional lymph nodes and to predict 5-yearsurvival of patients with breast carcinoma. Evaluation of theimpact of individual markers on predicting outcome anddetermining an optimum subset that can yield a high level ofprediction accuracy in both cases is another objective of thisstudy. The data set used for the analysis consists of four inputmarkers viz. DNA ploidy, S-Phase Fraction (SPF),G0G1/G2M Ratio, oestrogen receptorexpression status (ER/PR) and two corresponding outputs tobe predicted, one related to the nodal involvement and theother to 5-year survival of patients. The results indicate thatamongst individual biomarkers, ER/PR provides the bestaccuracy of performance for both survival and nodalinvolvement of the tumour with 89% and 70% of accuracyrespectively. Inspecting the accuracy outcome of differentbiomarker combinations for survival analysis, the best resultshave been obtained from the two biomarker subset consistingof SPF and G 0G1/G2M ratio which provided 89% prediction accuracy. In the case of nodal involvement prediction, thethree marker subset containing DNA ploidy, ER/PR andG 0G1/G2M ratio demonstrated the highest accuracy which is 73%. Hence, for predicting prognosis in breast carcinomas,identifying two markers instead of all markers is sufficient toobtain more accurate prediction for survival analysis whilst thethree-marker configuration is more suitable for nodalassessment. In addition, when all four markers werecombined, the highest predictive accuracy is found to be 90%for both survival and nodal prediction. These findings suggestthat ANN-based analysis commends itself as a highly accuratemethod for the prediction of lymph nodes metastases andprognosis. The authors thank Dr C. Bartoli and Professor F.

Overexpression ofRALT in cultured cells inhibits activation of ERK and AKTdownstream to ErbB receptors and attenuates the expression in EGF- treated cells causes a) extended duration of ERK and AKTactivation; b) higher expression of G1/S cyclins; c) increasedrecruitment of cells into the mitotic cell cycle. Ralt null mice show a fully penetrant skin phenotype, characterized byaberrant proliferation of keratinocytes and enhanced sensitivityto skin carcinogens. Consistent with studies in cultured cells,skin lesions in Ralt null mice are reversed by Iressa, a clinically used inhibitor of the EGFR kinase. Thus, RALT isan essential negative regulator of ErbB signals and a potentialtumour suppressor. Herein we present our most recent work aimed at clarifying the molecular mechanisms which account for the essential roleof RALT in the regulation of ErbB signalling. RALT binds toligand-activated ErbB receptors via a region spanning aa. 325- 375 (EBR, ErbB-binding region). The EBR is necessary andsufficient to inhibit the kinase activity of ErbB RTKs in in vitro assays, as well as in intact cells. Deletion mutagenesis studies indicate that the EBR binds to the -COOH lobe of thekinase domain of EGFR, a region known to be essential forthe allosteric activation of the EGFR kinase induced by ligand-driven receptor dimerization. The EBR function isevolutionarily conserved, as the EBR module of the D. rerio RALT ortholog is capable of suppressing human EGFR. Surprisingly, we observed that RALT-bound EGFR molecules undergo a seemingly normal endocytic traffic. Thisappears to contradict the consolidated notions that EGFRsignalling is required for receptor down-regulation andinhibition of EGFR kinase blocks receptor endocytosis. Wewill present supporting a of RALT as of theendocytosis of namelykinase suppression and receptor down-regulation, will bediscussed. 21 FREE RADICALS AND CANCER Jane AnastassopoulouNational Technical University of Athens, Chemical Engineering Department, Radiation Chemistry andBiospectroscopy, Zorgafou Campus, 15780 Zografou,Athens, Greece It is well documented that lifestyle, environmental factors, exposure to chemicals, radiation (UV , X-rays -rays) andmetabolic abnormalities can induce oxidative stress leading tothe formation of free radicals, (HO anions (O2-), peroxyl (OO), of their very fast biochemical reactivity, free radicals can damage directly or indirectly DNAand then this damaged DNA, when in excess, can causemutations, which alter cell signalling pathways creatingcancer. The primary sites of attack are the heterocyclic purine and pyrimidine bases. Several investigations, in vitro and in vivo, have shown that the most important reaction in these cases is the addition of hydroxyl free radicals to imidazolerings of DNA, producing 8-OHdG, which also is used as abiomarker. It was found that the amount of 8-OHdG is higherin tissues of women with breast cancer than to those with nocancer. Free radicals can also induce DNA strand breaks,single (ssb) or double (dsb), which are characterized by the 3-phosphoglycolate-ended fragments. We have used micro-Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, an easy-to-use and non destructive technique, toinvestigate the very early-stages of breast cancer through theinfrared spectra. Considerable changes were observed in thespectra in the region 1650-1500 cm -1of amide I and amide II absorptions, as well as in the region of 1200-900 cm-1, where the phosphate groups of DNA absorb. Spectral analysis allowsus to conclude that mapping of the spectra of breast tissuescould give us information about damages in the tertiary andsecondary structures of proteins and in particular thefunctional groups of biological molecules, which are indicativeof early-stages of development of cancer. For the early diagnosis (pre-diagnosis) and therapy of breast cancer it is crucial to develop a non-destructive bioanalyticaltechnique, such as micro-FT-IR spectroscopy, to obtain imagesof the breast, which are independent of breast shape and massdensity in order to detect lesions, which are difficult to scanwith the existing techniques. 22 DNA TOPOISOMERASES - CELLULAR TOOLSWITH HUGE IMPACT ON GENOME Lotte Bjergbaek and Anni of Molecular of Aarhus,C.F. M\u00f8llers All\u00e9, Bldg. 130, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes which have evolved to solve the topological problems generated wheneverthe two DNA strands are separated to expose the encodedgenetic information. This is the case during DNAtranscription, where the separation of the strands is local andtransient, and during DNA replication, where the separation ispermanent. Two types of topoisomerases exist, type I, including eukaryotic topoisomerase I and type II, including eukaryotictopoisomerase II. The enzymes remove topological problemsmanifested as changes in the number of windings in the DNAdouble helix, DNA interlinks, and DNA knots. Type I enzymesoperate by introducing a transient cleavage in one of the DNAstrands, whereas type II enzymes introduce a transient double-Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3195strand break. During the DNA cleavage event, the enzymes become covalently linked to the generated DNA ends andtopological structures are solved by passage of intact DNAthrough the breaks. After DNA passage, the breaks areresealed and the enzymes leave the DNA or go through a newcatalytic cycle. The covalently linked topoisomerase-DNA complex generated as an intermediate in the catalytic cycle of DNAtopoisomerases presents a potential danger to the cell as thebreaks can become permanent if DNA tracking machineriescollide with the complexes. Balanced enzyme activities andefficient repair systems are therefore crucial to avoidgenomic instability as a cause of topoisomerase action.Advantage is taken of the intermediate topoisomerase-DNAcomplexes by antitumor agents targeting DNAtopoisomerases. These drugs change the enzyme into acellular poison by stabilizing the complex, the result beingchromosomal fragmentation and cell death. Lack oftopoisomerase activity is another cause of genomicinstability. In this case accumulating, unresolved topologicalstructures may act as roadblocks and result in DNA breaksduring replication and transcription. We are currently investigating the role of DNA topoisomerases for global gene expression and the impact ofthe enzymes for genome stability during replication. Aspectsof topoisomerase action and biological functions, as well asimplications for genomic stability will be discussed. 23 S100A4 IN Bissell2 Cancer Research, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway; 2Life Science Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, CA; 3University of New York, College of Staten Island, NY , USA S100A4, also called FSP1, belongs to the S100 family of small (10-12 kDa), calcium binding proteins. The members inthis family have no known enzymatic activity, but undergoconformational changes during calcium binding, openinghydrophobic domains responsible for binding target proteins.S100 proteins are expressed both intra-, and extracellularly, ina cell- and tissue-specific manner. The evidence linking theexpression of S100A4 in cancer cells to increased metastaticcapacity is, after almost 20 years since its discovery, quiteconvincing. In addition, numerous publications on clinicalmaterial from several types of cancer have confirmed theassociation between S100A4 expression in primary carcinomacells and a more severe prognosis. This was previouslydemonstrated in a panel of 349 early-stage breast cancer biopsies, where expression of S100A4 was a strongerprognostic marker than both lymph node infiltration andhormone receptor status. Interestingly, both the intracellularand extracellular version of the protein have been coupled toincreased metastatic capacity of cancer cells. Both versionshave been shown to induce MMP expression, and studiessuggest that extracellular S100A4 activated NF- B through an as yet unknown receptor. The mammary gland undergoes extreme morphological changes throughout puberty. Hormones trigger the epithelialcells to proliferate and invade the mesenchyme, giving rise toa defined tree-like structure of ducts, with complex tissuearchitecture, in a highly regulated branching morphogenesis.Interestingly, the highly controlled branching morphogenesisand the metastatic spread of breast carcinoma cells haveseveral similarities, they both require cell proliferation andinvasion of the surrounding extracellular matrix. In this study,our goal was to elucidate the expression of S100A4 in normalbreast tissue and to investigate whether S100A4 has a role inthe normal mammary development. Mammary glands frommice and humans were analyzed for in vivo S100A4 protein expression by immunohistochemistry and RT PCR,respectively. Furthermore, organotypic 3D cultures of primarymouse mammary epithelial cells, and mammary epithelial celllines from mice, were employed as functional model systems.We found S100A4 expressed in some mammary epithelialcells and its mRNA expression peaked during the elongation in mice mammary gland. Using 3-dimensional organotypic in vitro models and shRNA, demonstrated that both extracellular andendogenously expressed S100A4 up-regulated MMPexpression, and contributed to a branching phenotype innormal epithelial cells. We propose the stimulatory effects ofS100A4 on branching morphogenesis as an explanation as towhy S100A4 promotes a metastatic in early-stagemammary carcinoma CROSSTALK BETWEEN molecules, extracellular matrix and soluble informative factors isessential for cancer cell migration and invasion. Here, weinvestigated the mechanisms by which the E-cadherin/catenin complex and v integrin can modulateinsulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-induced cell migration.Human colon mucosa, human colon cancer cell lines, HT29-D4 and HCT-8 derivatives that differ in their expression of-catenin were used as models. Interactions between E-cadherin, v integrin and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) wereanalyzed by co-immunoprecipitation andimmunolocalization experiments. The impact of theseinteractions on cell mobility was determined by haptotaxisassays. We report that v integrin, E-cadherin and IGF-IRform a ternary complex in both cells andhuman normal colonic mucosa. Alpha-catenin regulates thescaffolding of this complex. IGF-IR ligation by IGF-Iinduces the disruption of the complex and the relocalizationof v integrin from cell-cell contacts to focal contact sites.This perturbation is correlated with the observed increase incell migration. These results suggest that regulation of thev integrin/E-cadherin/IGF-IR scaffolding is essential forthe modulation of cell mobility. Its alteration could be ofmajor importance to sustain alterations in cell adhesion thatoccur during cancer cell invasion and metastasis. 25 ADV ANCES IN THE TREATMENT OFAMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS) E. AndreadouDepartment of Neurology, Athens National University, \"Aeginition\" Hospital, Athens, Greece Motor neurone disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that specificallyaffects upper and lower motor neurones (MNs) and causes lossof power and function of skeletal muscles, with an annualincidence 0.3-2 per 100,000 population. The course of thedisease is relatively rapid, with an average duration of around3.5 years. Death is most frequently due to respiratory failure.Although the cause of ALS remains unknown, severalpathways have been implicated in management of patients with ALS has changed rapidly over the past 20 years. Although ALS is incurable, it istreatable. Advances in understanding the biology of ALS hasled to the development of one marketed treatment, improvedclinical management of people with ALS, and many clinicaltrials of novel therapies. This lecture will focus on recentadvances in the development of new pharmacological agents, the combination of drug therapies, the new promisingtreatment strategies such as the transplantation of stem cellsfor the replacement of the damaged or lost MNs and thesymptomatic care of patients with ALS. Until now, the only drug that has shown evidence of neuroprotective effects in clinical trials in MND is riluzole.The drug has only marginal effects on survival and quality oflife of ALS patients, as it prolongs survival by an average ofonly 3-4 months. Although it is considered an antiglutamateagent, its mechanism of action is obscure. In a recent studywe have confirmed the lower rate of disease progression aftertreatment with riluzole, both in the spinal and the bulbarsubtype of ALS, without any significant impact on plasmalevels of the aminoacids glutamate and glycine. Our resultspossibly indicate additional mechanisms of action of the drug,besides its antiglutamatergic properties. Although many otheragents have been tried in ALS without clear benefit, severalnew promising therapies are under development. Encouragingdata are available from human studies for several agentsincluding talampanel, tamoxifen, sodium phenylbutrate,arimoclomol and lithium. However, recent results suggest thataddressing multiple components of ALS pathology incombination therapies might be the most effective way oftackling the disease. Combinations of anti-inflammatory andanti-excitotoxic drugs as treatments in animal models of ALS(mSOD1 mice) have been shown to be superior to applicationof their single components alone. Recently, in a face II trialthe celecoxib-creatine combination was selected as preferableto the minocycline-creatine combination for further evaluation,although each of the three drugs individually has failed aphase III trial in ALS. Other therapies besides the administration of pharmacological agents include viral vectors for gene delivery,other therapeutic factors that reduce endogenous motor neuronloss, minimize reactive astrocytosis and enhance connectivityof new neurons with host circuitry, as well as trainingregimens that modify these new spinal cord circuits. Moreover,transplantation of stem cells (adult, embryonic or neural)offers an intriguing strategy for slowing disease progressionand/or promoting recovery of function because engrafted cellshave the potential of replacing lost or dysfunctional neuronaland glial cell types as well as non-neural elements whichcontribute to recovery. Stem cell grafts can also provideadditional benefits, including neuroprotection, modification ofthe immune response, reprogramming of endogenous stemcells, generation of new bridges or lost circuitries and deliveryof therapeutic factors such as neurotrophic proteins andmissing gene products. However, stem cell therapy remainsentirely speculative at present. It is uncertain whether cell-based therapies will succeed without firstly interrupting thesystemic disease process. Therefore progress in the field willaccompany understanding of the underlying disease-specific Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3197pathways and cell-replacement may need to be combined with immunosuppressant or neuroprotective approaches. More realistically at present, a multidisciplinary approach can prolong survival and improve or maintain quality of lifeof patients with ALS. Disease progression gives rise to severedisability, respiratory impairment, speaking and swallowingdifficulties. The management of respiratory impairment in patients with ALS comprises ventilatory support. Assisted non-invasiveventilation is usually provided by a bilevel positive pressuredevice (BiPAP) and is a major advance in the management ofALS, as it has a survival benefit much greater than that ofriluzole. Starting non-invasive ventilation is recommendedwhen patients with ALS have symptoms related to nocturnalhypoventilation, frequently with dyspnoea and orthopnoea.Tracheostomy ventilation is an option when non-invasiveventilation is not able to compensate for respiratoryimpairment; however it is beyond the means for most patients.Swallowing difficulties lead to malnutrition and weight loss.Since nutritional status is a risk factor for survival, nutritionalsupport is essential to the care of patients with ALS. Entericfeeding maintains good nutrition and hydration, stabilisesweight, provides a way to give drugs, and might improvequality of life. Enteric feeding can be done by nasogastrictube, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, or radiologicallyinserted gastrostomy. Patients with ALS also develop deficitsthat impair their ability to communicate. Development ofbrain-computer interfaces that provide connection between thebrain and a computer can help to restore communication inseverely impaired patients, through voluntary regulation ofbrain activity as a response to sensory stimulation. Despite remarkable progress in understanding the underlying biology, ALS is a progressive, devastating andultimately fatal disease and all patients will reach the terminalphase of respiratory insufficiency, inadequate nutrition andhydration and severe psychological distress. Consequently,there remains a critical need to develop additional treatmentsthat will slow disease progression and ultimately turn ALSinto a long-term treatable illness. Until more effective, disease-modifying therapies will be developed, improved clinicalstandards of care will play a major role in survival and qualityof life of patients with ALS. 26 MULTIPLE PATHS TO DRUG RESISTANCEPHENOTYPE IN Boon Peng and Abdul Aziz Baba School of Medical Sciences, Health Campus, University Sains Malaysia, changed the currentmanagement of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients.Despite being the first line treatment for CML, resistance toImatinib is emerging as a real clinical problem in themanagement of CML. Therapeutic resistance to Imatinib maybe primary or secondary. Resistance development is amultifactorial phenomenon in patients with CML, mediated bya diversity of mechanisms. There are two broad mechanismsof resistance (1) BCR-ABL dependent and (2) BCR-ABLindependent. BCR-ABL mutations and molecular response of with Imatinib, at Hospital University Sains Malaysiaand the data on dHPLC based mutation analysis performed on16 CML patients showing signs of disease resistance will bepresented. BCR-ABL independent pathways may includeseveral mechanisms. Various genetic and epigenetic alterationsare proposed as candidate mechanisms involved in BCR-ABLindependent pathways to IM resistance in CML patients andthese multiple paths to IM resistance phenotype will also bediscussed. 27 SAHA ANTICANCER ACTIVITY THROUGHDEREPRESSION EFFECT ON CRITICAL GENES of Bucharest, Romania The interaction between DNA and histones is crucial for modulating the accessibility of transcription factors to DNAregulatory sequence. The chromatin structure is important fortranscription regulation, the balance between active or silencedstatus being coordinated by the activity of enzyme effectorsinvolved in chromatin remodeling, which modify DNA (DNAmethyltransferase - HAT and histone - HDAC).New anticancer drugs are therefore currently targeting theseepigenetic factors by their inhibitors, aiming at reactivation ofthe aberrantly silenced tumor suppressor genes. Currentexperimental and epidemiologic confirmed that thehuman papillomavirus (HPV) is the causal agent in thedevelopment of cervical carcinoma. Taking into account HPVrole in carcinogenesis, the aim of our study was to of SAHA lines CaSki and Hela and a low riskHPV cell line obtained from a cervical xenograft, were treatedwith increasing doses of SAHA (0.5-2.5 M) for 24 throughANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 319848 h. We noticed that SAHA has an antitumor activity by blocking cell proliferation and inducing tumor cell apoptosisin HeLa and CasKi cell lines. p21(WAF1) and p53 expressionlevels at 2.5 M/24h SAHA appreciated inreal-time PCR. mRNA levels of Dnmt1 slightlyincreased at the same concentration of SAHA and wereappreciated in the same conditions. By contrast, in lrHPV line,DNMT1 activity seems to increase at 2.5 M SAHA after 48of SAHA treatment. An interestingly effect upon DNAmethyltransferases has been also observed. While DNMT1mRNA levels slightly increased, DNMT3b immunoreactivitypresented a rather constant feature. The only affected enzymewas DNMT3a whose immunoreactivity decreased significantlyat high SAHA CHROMOSOMALABNORMALITIES Antsanklis3 Critical Care Athens University, Cytogenetics Unit, vangelismos spital,Athens; 2Department of Genetics, Alexandra Maternity Hospital, Athens University, Athens; 3First Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Alexandra Maternity Hospital, Athens University, Athens, Greece Ovarian cancer represents the leading cause of death among patients with gynecological cancer. The identification ofchromosomal abnormalities is a useful strategy towardunderstanding tumorigenesis and specific chromosomalassociations. Since single chromosomal changes might beprimary events implicated in the initiation of the neoplasticprocess, the aim of the present study was to investigate thepresence of simple structural chromosomal changes in ovariancancer. Reviewing samples of ascitic effusions cytogeneticallystudied in our laboratory by direct culture of tumour cells anda G-banding technique, we found two cases with a diagnosisof ovarian cancer, which presented simple chromosomalabnormalities. The first case presented an abnormal clone ofcells with an acquired pericentric inversion of chromosome9, a sole anomaly. simple chromosomal changes with involvement ofthe Xq23 chromosomal region, while a translocationt(X;11)(q23;q23) was also defined. The significance of theacquired pericentric inversion 9 in the development of theneoplastic process remains unknown. It is necessary, thechromosomal regions Xq23 and 11q23 to be molecularlyfurther investigated in ovarian cancer. The documentation ofmore ovarian cancer cases with simple chromosomalabnormalities is considered of major importance facilitatingthe identification of candidate genes involved in the neoplastic process. 29 TAUROLIDINE J. Banke, Roman Muff, Walter Born and University Hospital Balgrist, Orthopaedic Research, Forchstrasse 340, 8008 Zurich, Switzerland Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone cancer and pulmonary metastasis the leading cause of death in OSpatients. The currently used chemotherapeutics exhibit severe,toxic side-effects which may cause life-threatening conditions.Thus, the development of novel agents with anti-metastaticpotential and reduced toxicity is essential. Honokiol, an extractof the Magnolia tree, has recently been shown to have anti-neoplastic properties against several malignancies includingmultiple myeloma, breast, gastric and cancer.Taurolidine (active agent of Taurolin \u00ae) is a well-known broad spectrum antibiotic that has been used for over 15 years forthe treatment of severe surgical infections. It has also recentlybeen shown to possess anti-neoplastic properties against avariety of human cancers. Therefore, in the present study, weinvestigated the therapeutic potential of these two novelanticancer drugs in our OS models. In vitro , both compounds showed pro-apoptotic and growth-inhibitory activity in a dose-dependent manner against all 9 human and 2 murineosteosarcoma cell lines tested. The IC 50values ranged between 8 and 16 g/ml for honokiol and between 19 and 64 M fortaurolidine. Subsequently, we examined the effects of honokioland taurolidine on OS metastasis in our two syngeneic OSmouse models. Highly metastatic, lacZ-tagged LM8 and K7M2 OS cells were injected s.c. into C3H mice and i.v.into BALB/c mice, respectively. Treatment with honokiol (3mg/mouse/day) significantly reduced lung and liver metastasesby 41% to 75% in both OS models. In contrast, treatment withtaurolidine (15 mg/every other day) enhanced experimentalK7M2 lung (1.7-fold) and liver (up to 50-fold) metastasis.Also in the LM8 model, taurolidine treatment significantlyincreased spontaneous LM8 lung (up to metastasis. atrophies could be observed intumor-bearing as well as healthy mice upon treatment withtaurolidine. Histological examinations revealed that liverlesions consisted of a multifocal fibrous thickening of the livercapsule, which was most pronounced in the strongly atrophicleft median liver lobe.

These data indicate for the first time an unexpected, lung and liver metastasis promoting activity oftaurolidine, accompanied with severe liver deformations.These organ-specific side-effects need to be taken into accountregarding clinical introduction of taurolidine in cancertreatment. On the other hand, the natural compound honokiolwas shown to possess potent antineoplastic and antimetastaticactivity against osteosarcoma cell lines and may have potentialas a novel OS chemotherapeutic agent. 30 SCINTIGRAPHY WITH Medicine, Institute for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, CCS, Belgrade, Serbia Aim: The aim of the study is the detection of neuroendocrine tumors with 99mTc-Tektrotyd, a radiopharmaceutical indicated for the diagnosis of tumors with overexpression of somatostatinreceptors. Patients and Methods: Whole body scintigraphy was performed in 66 patients up to 24h after i.v. administration of 740MBq 99mTc-Tektrotyd, as well as SPECT of particular regions. Results: From 18 patients with neuroendocrine tumors of unknown origin there were 14 true positive findings (TP) (8with liver metastases, 6 with lung metastases, 4 one with mediastinal gland metastases), 4 falsenegative findings (FN) (2 with liver metastases of the poorlydifferentiated tumors, and two second with very small lungmetastases <1 cm). In 12 patients scintigraphy contributed tothe further management of the patients. In the group of 16patients with gut carcinoids there were 8 TP (6 with livermetastases), 4 true negative findings (TN) (after surgery), 2 FN(after surgery, small lung metastases <1 cm) and 2 FP(physiological accumulation of the activity in the bowel). In 8patients scintigraphy contributed to the further management ofthe patients. In the group of 14 patients with neuroendocrinepancreatic carcinomas there were 8 TP (6 with liver metastasesand one with metastases in paraortal lymph nodes) and 6 TN(somatostatinoma, insulinoma and carcinoid after surgery). In 6patients scintigraphy contributed to the further management ofthe patients. In the group of 12 patients with lung carcinoidsthere were 8 TP (4 with liver, 2 with lung metastases and 2with bone metastases), 2 TN (after surgery) and 2 FN (poorlydifferentiated). In 4 patients scintigraphy contributed to thefurther management of the patients. In the group of 6 patientswith gastrinomas (jejunal, paraduodenal and pancreatic) therewere two TN. In 4 patients scintigraphycontributed to the further management of the patients. Overall,the sensitivity of the method is 84%, specificity 88%, positivepredictive value 95%, negative predictive value 64% and accuracy 85%. Conclusion: These preliminary results show that scintigraphy of neuroendocrine tumors with 99mTc-Tektrotyd is a useful method in diagnosis, staging and follow up of thepatients suspected to have neuroendocrine tumors. It is alsohelpful in the appropriate choice and monitoring of the therapy,including radionuclides. 31 THERAPY OF NEUROENDOCRINE Medicine, Institute for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases Clinical Center of Serbia,Laboratory for radioisotopes \"Vina\", Institute for NuclearSciences Vina, Serbia Aim: Preliminary results of the therapy of NETs with 90Y DOTA TATE (Polatom, Poland) are presented. Patients and Methods: We investigated 15 patients with various neuroendocrine tumors. In all of them, together with otherlaboratory analyses and imaging methods, scintigraphy withsomatostatin analogues was performed (in 3 with 111In Octreoscan and in the other 4 with 99mTc Tektrotyd) and a high tumor was uptake observed. The therapy was performedwith 2-4,5 GBq 90Y DOTA TATE per patient per one cycle, by slow infusion in physiological liquid (150 ml/15min).Between the cycles, there was a time delay of 6-8 weeks.Thirty min before therapy, patients began receiving an infusionof amino acids (arginine and lysine) for 4h. Before that, alltherapies with somatostatin analogues were withdrawn. 24h-96 h after therapy, \"bremsstrahlung\" whole body imaging,SPECT and particular planar images were performed with agamma camera. Results: Analysis of the \"bremsstrahlung\"images showed uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in the liver,but the most of the activity was observed in the regions of the\"hot spots\" registered with previous 99mTc Tektrotyd and 111In Octreoscan images. According to our results, after therapy, intwo patients progressive disease (PD), in seven stable disease(SD), and in six partial remission (PR) occured. Up to now,there were no major clinical side-effects in the hepaticfunction. Transient pancytopenia occurred in two patients, andimpairment of kidney function in one. Conclusion: In spite of insufficient data, beneficial effects on clinical symptoms,hormone production and tumor proliferation were found,without major clinical side-effects. Thus, according to thesepreliminary results, treatment with 90Y DOTA TATE is a feasible method and might be useful for the management ofpatients with inoperable or disseminated neuroendocrinetumors. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 320032 SETUP AND CHARACTERIZATION OF ANIMALMODELS OF HEAD AND NECK CANCER INIMMUNOCOMPETENT RATS Karine Aubry 1and Michel Rigaud2 1E.N.T. Department and University Hospital Center 2, AvenueMartin Luther-King, 87000 Limoges, France Setup of animal models of cancer is indispensable for pre- clinic therapeutic assays. We developed a new animalmodel of squamous cell carcinoma from a Using the same protocol, a model ofmandible osteosarcoma was obtained by graftingosteosarcoma tumors. These tumors were characterized bypathological, immunohistochemical (PET/CT). They presented a therapeutic testusing bevacizumab (Avastin \u00ae) on osteosarcoma rat models. Bevacizumab showed a statistically significant effect (p<0.001) on development of osteosarcoma. We propose a protocol to produce animal models of cancer in immunocompetent rats. 33 TPA SERUM LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITHSUSPICIOUS SIGNS OF LUNG CANCER:COMPARISON WITH OTHER TUMOR MARKERSUSED IN THIS MALIGNANCY (CEA, SCC, NSE,CYFRA 21-1, CA 125, CA 19.9, 1Biochemistry, 2Pneumology and Medical 3Oncology Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain Tumor marker serum levels were prospectively studied in 267 patients with suspicious signs of lung cancer, being the finaldiagnosis, in 58 patients with no malignancy (15 infectious,43 non infectious diseases), 28 patients with malignanciesexcluding lung cancer and lung cancer in the remaining 181patients (146 NSCLC, 35 SCLC). Slightly high abnormalserum levels were found in CEA 8,6%, 19.9 and TPA in 13.7% of the patients withbenign diseases. Significantly higher concentrations of TPA,CA 19.9 and CYFRA 21.1 were found in patients withinfectious diseases than in other benign pathologies. ( p=0.002, 0.01 and 0.02, respectively).Tumor marker sensitivity was related to cancer histology and tumor extension. Significantly higher NSE serum levelsand sensitivity was found in SCLC than in NSCLC ( p=0.001). SCC, CEA, CA 15.3 and CA 125 were also related to thehistological type, with significantly higher values in patientswith NSCLC ( p<0.02 in all of them). CYFRA and TPA, show a high concordance of results in patients with lung cancer, inboth NSCLC and SCLC (85.5% and 91.4%, respectively). Thebest combination of tumor markers was CEA, CA 15.3 andone cytokeratin in adenocarcinomas and CEA, SCC and Cell 2Medicine, 3Chemistry, McGill University, Montreal QC, Canada Infinite replicative potential requires telomere maintenance, which, in most eukaryotic organisms, is mediated bytelomerase. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that consists ofa catalytic reverse transcriptase TERT, associated proteins andan integral RNA subunit (hTR in humans) that carries thetemplate to generate telomeres de novo . Eighty-five percent of tumor cells maintain telomeres through an active telomerasecomplex. Telomere dysfunction can lead to senescence orapoptosis and impair the continued growth of immortal cancercell lines. Thus anticancer strategies which target telomeraseand telomeres are actively investigated. An alternative to telomerase inhibition-based therapy consists of targeting the integrity of telomeres rather thantelomerase activity. One of theses approaches has beenvalidated by us and others and consists of destabilizingtelomeres with a mutant human telomerase RNA (hTR)template that dictates the synthesis of mutant telomeresequences. Cell lines expressing a mutant hTR (MuAhTR)exhibit increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs suchas DNA damaging or cytotoxic agents, manifested bydecreased cell proliferation. Consistent with the hypothesisthat MuAhTR expression engages a DNA damage response,we found increased and ATM-P foci at the telomeresby in MuAhTR cellscompared to cells not expressing MuAhTR. We are currentlyanalyzing the mechanisms implicated in the increasedsensitivity of these cells to drugs and the requirement for p53activation. For example, treatment with doxorubicin leads toaltered cell cycle profile and apoptosis in one cell line. We arealso validating the specificity of MuAhTR-mediated telomeredestabilization in telomerase-positive cells. Since telomeraseis absent or weakly active in primary cells, we hypothesizeAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3201that expression of a mutant hTR should minimally affect the proliferation of primary cells. Telomere integrity can also be compromised via telomere disruption by G-quadruplex ligands. Such ligands typicallystabilize the G-quadruplex structures that can form attelomeres. Such structures are poor substrates for telomeraseand several G-quadruplex ligands have been reported tomediate antiproliferative responses in cancer cells. Moleculeswith distinct structural features, unattainable usingconventional covalent synthesis, can be generated usingsupramolecular self-assembly, and would be particularlyuseful for targeting higher-order biological motifs such as theG-quadruplex. The generation of such a molecule, andevidence that it is an efficient G-quadruplex binder andtelomerase inhibitor will be discussed. 35 EURYCOMANOL FROM EURYCOMA LONGIFOLIA JACK EXHIBITS ANTIPROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITYON Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,43600 UKM 43400 UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia The present study investigated the antiproliferative effect, mode of cell death and the mechanism of action ofeurycomanol, a quassinoid from the root of Eurycoma longifolia Jack on the human breast cancer Eurycomanol exhibites cytotoxic activity towards MCF-7(IC 50=15.23\u00b10.66 g/ml) and is less sensitive against a normal breast cell line MCF-10A (IC50=66.31\u00b10.47 g/ml). Based on the IC50values obtained, eurycomanol displayed a certain extent of cytoselectivity towards normal breast cells. Theantiproliferative activity of eurycomanol was due to apoptosisinduced in MCF-7 cells and not necrosis. This wasdemonstrated by the Hoechst 33258 nuclear Hoechst 33258 and propidiumiodide). apoptotic index was found to increase from 0% at0 h, to ~50% by 24 h and then to >75% after 72 h. Theeurycomanol-treated MCF-7 cells also showed typicalapoptotic morphology such as DNA fragmentation, cellshrinkage, and nuclear condensation. The apoptosis triggeredby eurycomanol in MCF-7 was associated with the antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteinexpression, but not with BAX and p53. BCL-2 proteinexpression levels decreased 2 h after treatment witheurycomanol, and remained lower than controls throughout the experiment, resulting in a shift in the BAX to BCL-2 ratiowhich eventually induced disruption of the mitochondrialmembrane potential thus favouring apoptosis. Next, theprocessing executioner procaspase-7 but initiator procaspase-9 was found not to play in caspase-7 activation in MCF-7 cells. Active caspase-7then cleaved and inactivated poly (ADP-ribose) effectson of BCL-2 protein levels, increased BAX to BCL-2ratio, activation of caspase-7 and inactivation of PARP-1,without the involvement of p53 and caspase-9. 36 NANOTECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS IN siRNA ANDANTISENSE DELIVERY TO SILENCE MDR1 ANDEGFR IN RESISTANT BREAST CANCER CELLS E.

Advances in nanotechnologyapplications for gene and drug delivery open new hopes toovercome the old problem of drug resistance in cancer cells.For many years, chemical and biological compounds havebeen investigated to reverse mdr1 over-expression that is themost important cause of failure of chemotherapy in differentcancers. There is a high homology between the compounds. In addition, over-expression of certaingenes such as EGFR, a proto-oncogene that induce cellproliferation, in cancer cells significantly decreases theefficiency of anticancer drugs. has employedtiny structures including liposomes, or dendrimersat nanoscale to combat cancer cell proliferation.

In conclusion,the new gene and drug delivery systems using nanotechnologycan improve cancer chemotherapy at a great extent. 37 EFFECTIVENESS OF NEOADJUV ANTCHEMOTHERAPY IN JAPANESE PATIENTS WITHCOLORECTAL CANCER LIVER METASTASES H. Baba , T. Beppu, M. Watanabe, H. Komori, N. Hayashi, E. Toyama, K. Horino and H. Takamori Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto,Japan Background: Patients (Pts) with colorectal liver metastases have a poor prognosis even after curative resection because ofhigh incidence of recurrence in the remnant liver and thus maybenefit from preoperative chemotherapy and curativeresection. However, neoadjuvant settings of chemotherapy forpts with CRC liver metastases have not yet been establishedin Japan and need to be assessed. Methods: Pts with CRC liver only metastasis initially unresectable were eligible for thesingle institute, non-randomized phase II trial. Eligible criteriawere synchronous or metachronous liver metastases, primallyunresectable, organs function preserved, and PS less than 2.Pts received FOLFOX for 6-8 cycles preoperatively. Clinicalresponse, analysis of tumoraland nontumoral liver, primary lesion and lymph nodes and survival data were assessed. Results: Sixty pts with colorectal liver metastasis were admitted to our hospital from May 2005to March 2008. Of those, 35 pts initially unresectable receivedFOLFOX and 17 pts turned out to be respectable after amedian of 7.5 cycles of FOLFOX and underwent hepatectomy,and 8 pts also had primary tumor resection. There was nosevere perioperative complication, and intra-operativeincreased bleeding. Mean number of tumors was 6.8 and meantumor size reduced form 5.8 cm to 3.5 cm. Clinical andhistopathological response rates were 81.0% and 29.2%,respectively. Complete tumor necrosis of liver metastases wasobserved in 2 pts and of primary tumor was in 1 pt. Half lifetime of CEA in responder and nonresponder was 17.9 and38.5 days, respectively. Two-year progression free and over allsurvival rates was 50% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: These data suggest that FOLFOX can be safely administeredfor Japanese as an neoadjuvant setting in CRC liver metastaseswithout increasing perioperative complications. Moreover,high response, respectability, and superior survival data wereobtained with this preoperative chemotherapy andkeratectomy, suggesting that a future nationwide clinical trialcan be warranted. 38 MELANOMA VS. NEVI PROBLEM IN THE EYES OF THE TRANSCUTANEOUSELECTRODYNAMIC IMAGING Yurii F. Babich , Eduard A. Bakai and Maya A. Nuzhdina Centre of Biomedical Electroengineering, Kiev, Ukraine Purpose: Further development of early diagnostic criteria of malignancy. Materials and Methods: Our approach was based on analysis of initial and hypoxia-induced electrical dynamics,which reflects relative metabolic differences between thetumour and its microenvironment at the background of theadjacent tissues. We have developed a new functional imagingmodality of broad application - transcutaneous electrodynamicintroscopy (TEI), which enables in vivo non-invasive 3-4D visualization (extremely low-intensive electromagnetic fieldsare used) of the integral spatial electrobiochemical dynamicsin normal conditions and pathology. Adequate resolution (lessthan 1 mm) had already enabled us firstly (20 years ago) tonon-invasively read and monitor the skin electrical landscape(SEL) and discover a new class of initial and induced spatialand temporal phenomenological features (reflecting in vivo deep processes of tissue metabolism and intercellularsignalling), which may be used as novel diagnostics signs, asfor real-time assessment of individual reactions and thus forpurposes of targeted/controlled therapy. Currently, we areusing a portable experimental TEI setup designed forinvestigation of superficial tissues, specifically for chosenAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3203model objects, i.e. directly visible ones: cutaneous melanoma and nevi. This TEI setup enables the tissue (scan-area 32\u00d764mm) to be scaned simultaneous in six spectral electricalbioimpedance/potential parameters of the tissue at 1 kHz - 1MHz-band, making thus possible tissue characterization attissue, cellular and sub-cellular levels. Fifteen healthyvolunteers, thirteen nevi and seven malignant melanomas wereinvestigated. The hypoxic test, e.g. simple breath-holding for 20-60 s, was used as contrast factors (various mildphysicochemical factors and that of X-ray therapy werestudied before). Results: No abnormal reactions to the hypoxia test were registered in healthy subjects nor in most of thosewith nevi. Noticeable hypoxia induced SEL dynamics wereregistered in all melanomas. Distinct SEL local changesappeared one by one around the pigmented zones, thus makingvisible the tumours' true microenvironment. The hypoxia testalso revealed prospective metastasis, i.e. remote areas of supposedly chronic or transient hypoxia with characteristicrelaxation times (specifically in comparison with those of thetumour microenvironment). A coherent zone of abnormalmitochondrial electropotential was also detected. The zonecrossed the area of supposed metastasis and had an epicentreinside the melanoma. Under the test circumstances, the zonewas of less variable character. It was also possible to tracephase differences between intercellular media, cellularmembranes and sub-cellular responses to the tests. SuspiciousSEL changes were also registered in 3 out of 13 nevi, e.g. sound spatially directed dynamics taking its start from the neviboundary. Subsequent histological analysis was effectiveenough to heterogeneities ofthe primary melanomas. Conclusion: TEI demonstrates an intriguing ability to reveal in vivo a unique set of basically important anatomic and particularly functional features whichmay be used both for: (i) earlier tumour and metastasisdiagnosis and, (ii) for targeted therapy (providing an effectivebiofeedback for real-time assessment of individual sensitivityto therapeutic factors). Any proposition as to joint researchparticularly that aiming to identify the TEI findings ( e.g.with the aid of PET, sMRI, in vivo confocal laser imaging techniques) would be highly welcomed. 39 MITOCHONDRIA AND CANCER: PROSPECTS FORNOVEL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS Gyorgy BaffyHarvard Medical School and V A Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA Acquisition of mitochondria was a defining step in the evolution of eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria regulate pivotalcellular functions such as metabolism, bioenergetics, andprogrammed cell death. Along with this evolutionary milestone,cancer has taken a seemingly inherent position in our life. Selfishly defiant of the rules of multicellular existence, cancercells may hijack all the robust homeostatic functions of higher-level organisms. By defining aerobic glycolysis, Warburg wasthe first to link mitochondria and cancer, but the importance ofaltered energy metabolism in cancer cells has not been fullyappreciated for a long time. Recent advances have transformedour concept on the role of mitochondria in cancer cells andinvite a review of new approaches for metabolic targeting ofcancer cells including aerobic glycolysis and beyond. In contrast to high-yield oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis provides high-rate ATP production with a selectiveadvantage to rapidly growing cells that compete for sharedresources. Also, excess lactate production may promoteinterstitial acidification and invasiveness. Moreover, glycolysismay improve redox control via the pentose phosphate cycle (a major source of NADPH). Based on these considerations andexperimental validation, inhibitors e.g., 3- bromopyruvate, 2-deoxyglucose, have enteredpre-clinical and clinical testing, while additional research isfocused on molecular regulators of the metabolic andbioenergetic phenotype in cancer cells. One of the metabolic regulators is hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, a transcription factor commonly activated in cancercells even in the absence of cycle and limits mitochondrialelectron transport. Recent studies indicate that cellular energymetabolism is also regulated by the tumor suppressor p53. Bygene-level suppression of glycolysis (TIGAR) and promotionof electron transport (SCO2), p53 shifts ATP production backto the mitochondria. Thus, successful adaptation of energymetabolism in cancer cells is linked to purposeful restraint ofmitochondrial respiration, while tumor suppression may relyon an opposite action. To fully understand the impact of 'mitochondrial neglect' in cancer cells, it is also important to recall that mitochondrialelectron transport is a major source of intracellular reactiveoxygen species (ROS) and cancer cells often struggle withincreased oxidative stress. Thus, decreased mitochondrial ROSoutput may be another benefit of aerobic glycolysis. by of pyruvate, cancer cells via increased ROS production and caspase activation. Our recent observations on the role of mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) in cancer cells provide a newaspect to the metabolic adaptation of cancer cells. UCP2 is amitochondrial anion carrier protein located in the innermembrane along with the respiratory complexes. By mediatingproton leak, UCP2 controls the rate of superoxide productionand acts as a potent suppressor of oxidative stress. Cancercells may exploit this effect and increased UCP2 expression ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3204has indeed been linked to advanced neoplastic changes and chemoresistance. We found that overexpression of UCP2 incolon cancer cells inhibits ROS accumulation and apoptosisinduced by cytotoxic treatment. The protective effect was alsoobserved in tumor xenografts. By contrast, UCP2 silencingappears to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy. Also, UCP2overexpression interferes with post-translational modificationof p53 UCP2 modulates energymetabolism in cancer cells and this approach may beconsidered in combination treatment of chemoresistance. In summary, recent advances confirm that oncogenic and metabolic regulatory pathways are strongly interconnected.New therapeutic strategies may become available throughbetter understanding of metabolic and energetic adaptation ofcancer cells, with a particular attention to the role ofmitochondria in this process. 40 IN VITRO MODELING FOR THE EV ALUATION OF Lu-177 ANTISENSE RADIOTHERAPY Ethan R.

In aggressive lymphoma,large cohort studies have shown that the overexpression of thebcl-2 gene correlates strongly with resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, increased survival of cancer cells, high relapserate, and poor cause free survival rate or disease free interval.Thus, patients who are found to overexpress bcl-2 might respond better to alternative treatments like targetedimmunotherapy, radioimmunotherapy, or antisense therapy, allof which act through mechanisms that down-regulate bcl-2 . Human NHL also expresses Type 2 Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR2) in approximately 87% of cases. Previous workindicates that 177Lu-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate provides effective, selectively targeted radiotherapy in human SSTR expressingtumors. Furthermore, this peptide is an attractive vehicle fordelivery of other tumor-targeting agents, such as thosedesigned to act against bcl-2 .In vitro uptake, efflux, proliferation and viability assays are designed to assess the bcl-2 mRNA targeting the human NHL cell line Mec-1in suspension culture. In vitro cell uptake and efflux was evaluated by assaying the 177Lu-labeled anti -bcl-2 PNA- peptide conjugate. The percent uptake of the total radioactivitywas found to increase from 1.1\u00b10.5% at 1 min to 2.5\u00b11.1% at4 hr. The percent retention versus time was found to decrease from 71.0\u00b18.5% of the cell-associated radioactivity at 1 minto 29.5\u00b12.6% at 4 hr. 41 ARSENIC INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN THELYMPHOCYTES OF INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TOARSENIC THROUGH WESTBENGAL, INDIA Apurba Nilanjana Banerjee and Ashok K. Giri Molecuar and Human Genetics Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata- 700 032, India In West Bengal, India, more than 6 million people in nine districts are exposed to arsenic through drinking water. It isregarded as the greatest arsenic calamity in the world.Arsenic is a well-documented human carcinogen, which doesnot induce cancer in any other animal model. Interestingly, atlower concentrations, arsenic is known to induce apoptosisin various cancer cell lines in vitro . We have studied apoptosis in human peripheral blood mononuclear of arsenic exposed skin lesion individuals byannexin V-FITC staining and compared it with that inunexposed individuals. The percentage of apoptotic cells inindividuals with skin lesions was significantly higher(p<0.001) in comparison to unexposed individuals. In the exposed individuals with skin lesions, there were elevatedlevels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS),mitochondrial membrane permeability crelease, to increased downstream caspase activity. Arsenic-induced DNA damage wasconfirmed by DNA ladder formation and confocalmicroscopy. These findings suggest that chronic arsenicexposure causes cell cycle arrest at the G1-phase. Arseniccauses significant DNA damage, and DNA damage is knownto trigger apoptosis. Results of DNA laddering and confocalmicroscopy confirm that chronic arsenic exposure leads toDNA damage and thus might lead to enhanced apoptosis inthe exposed group. Cell apoptosis is a normal physiologicalprocess by which correct functional cellular populations aremaintained, by removal of cells with abnormal geneticinformation. Arsenic, like some other metals, plays a dualrole in that they have apoptotic effects on the cells but alsoAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3205contribute to cell transformation and carcinogenesis. The exact mechanism of how this switching occurs is not knownyet. It may so happen that increased apoptosis of certainimmune cells, such as NK cells and cytotoxic T-cells, couldimpair the immune surveillance against cancer in variousorgans and thus explain the increased risk of cancer. Anotherpossible explanation is that metals under certain conditionscause greater apoptosis, but it is not known whether thisapoptosis induced by the metal is a perfect process or animperfect process. An imperfect apoptotic process mightresult in the escape of cells that would be potentiallycarcinogenic. This may be true in the case of arsenic-inducedapoptosis also, which ultimately leads to the various types ofcancer. Further research is required to determine exactlywhether increased apoptosis of immune cells or defectiveapoptosis is responsible for arsenic-induced cancer of skinand other internal organs. 42 THE BANERJI THE REGRESSION OFMALIGNANT TUMOURS Kolkata- 700020, India Background: Although there is significant improvement of treatment outcomes of most malignant tumours byconventional therapy, in many neoplasms, particularlyoesophageal, brain and lung tumours, there is still apersistent grim outlook of conventional therapy results. Toobviate this long lasting problem, we have treated manypatients belonging to this group with ultra diluted medicines(under Government-regulated standard pharmacopeias indifferent countries) which are commonly used inhomeopathic practice. In the course of our relationship withvarious scientific bodies, we have previously presentedbefore the NCI, USA, a Best Case Series on Cancer, whichwas unanimously accepted by the Advisory Panel. Theoutcome of our treatment with these ultra-diluted medicinesis described here. Materials and Methods: During the past year, we have treated 1132 malignant tumour casesbelonging to these categories, in our busy clinic located inKolkata, India: 689 cases of brain tumours were treated and Calcarea Phosphorica 3x; 367 cancer caseswere treated with Kali Carbonicum 200c and 76oesophageal carcinoma cases were treated with Condurango 30c. All available clinical, histological and radiologicalrecords for diagnosis and follow-ups were analyzed.Results: Complete regression was noted in 32% cases of brain tumours, 22% lung cancer cases and 28% oesophagealcarcinoma cases and we are aiming to discontinue theirtreatment. Conclusion: At present in our clinics in Kolkata, India, we use these ultra-diluted medicines as the solespecific therapy in cases of malignant tumors, withencouraging results. From our results, it is apparent thatthese medicines can also be given as an adjunct therapy inother countries in all such malignant cases whereconventional therapy fails. We will present here some casesof lung, brain and oesophageal malignancies treated solelyby the Banerji Protocols to show the remarkable efficiencyof these ultra-diluted medicines. 43 FUNCTIONAL MODULATION OF DENDRITICCELLS of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Av. Prof. Lineu Prestes1730, 05508-000 - Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil Dendritic cells (DC) have a unique role in the establishment of immune responses. Their ability to recognize the \"status\"of the environment and translate it into specific activationsignals for clonally selected lymphocytes allows theimmune system to react appropriately to microbialchallenges at the same time as it tolerates innocuousantigens. Accordingly, the decision to tolerate or to reactagainst tumor cells should also depend on the DC reactionto the tumor microenvironment. Since clinically significanttumors frequently generate potentially activating signals forDC, which, in turn, should trigger an immune reactionagainst tumors, the development of progressive cancer inimmunocompetent individuals could be a sign of an alteredDC activation. Indeed, we show here that the altered, with an imbalance betweenmacrophages, immature and mature DC, a phenomenon thatcould be correlated to the pattern of cytokine secretion (IL4and TNF-alpha) within the tumor environment.Furthermore, the analysis of the differentiation of cancerpatients' monocytes into DC suggested that thisphenomenon was not restricted to the tumor site.Monocyte-derived DC from cancer patients also presentedan altered membrane phenotype and responded poorly toenvironmental challenges found in cancer, as low local pH,jaundice or the presence of tumor cells. The mechanismsresponsible for these phenomena still need to becharacterized, but preliminary data suggest that they maydepend on low levels of phosphorylated INHIBITS PROSTATE CANCER Israel BarkenProstate Cancer Research and Education Foundation, La Mesa, CA, USA Background: Noscapine, a non-toxic, alkaloid and common constituent of cough medicine, stabilizes tubulin. It inhibitsthe growth of several human and murine neoplasms, with nosignificant toxicity. Its effect on prostate cancer has not beenevaluated. Materials and Methods: Noscapine was administered orally (300 mg/Kg per day) for 56 days to PC3humans prostate cancer-bearing immunodeficient mice (n=10).Immunodeficient control mice (n=10) diluent identical regimen.

Simplified,protein designated for degradation forms a complex withchains from ubiquitin or polyubiquitin and the complex istransferred to the 26S proteasome under contribution ofseveral enzymes, where - after removal of the ubiquitin - thetargeted protein is cleaved. A member of of thedeubiquitinating enzymes (ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolaseisozyme L3; UCH-L3), is autoantibodies were detected in sera fromcolon cancer patients. We have recently demonstrated altered expression profiles of UCH-L3 in hepatocytes grown under conditions ofmoderate, non-toxic oxidative stress and in rat livers exposedto oxidative stress by selenium deficiency. Here weinvestigated the expression pattern of this enzyme in colons obtained from rats with varying selenium status and the coloncancer cell line HT-29 cultured in the presence of variousmetal ions. Therefore cells were incubated individually with high concentrations of molybdenum, manganese, selenium,cadmium, or other metals for 72 hour each. As determined bytetrazolium assay the applied concentrations lead to minor cellproliferation. Harvested cells and colon tissues from seleniumadequate or selenium deficient rats were homogenised andUCH-L3 was detected by western blotting andimmunochemistry. By using beta-actine as an internal standard our results showed that the expression of UCH-L3 was elevated in HT-29cell line and selenium deficient colon tissue about 1.5-foldcompared to rats fed with an adequate selenium diet.Admittedly this increase was much lower then that caused bythe incubation with high concentrations of manganese (4-fold). A possible explanation might be the involvement ofmanganese in the protection against reactive oxygen speciesas a compound in the superoxide-dismutase. Although further investigations will be needed to understand the involvement of UCH-L3 in selenium's cancerprotective effects, we propose that selenium deficiency causesat least two changes in the cell that can lead to cancer in theend: Primary a reduction in the protection against specificoxidants by the loss of selenoproteins. And secondly theinduction of UCH-L3 would prevent a removal of oxidativelydamaged cells by apoptosis. 46 ANTI-ANGIOGENIC ISOFORMS OF VEGF - A KEY TO ANTI-ANGIOGENIC THERAPY D.O. Bates and S.J. Harper Microvascular Research Laboratories, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Bristol Heart Institute,Southwell Street, Bristol BS2 8EJ, UK VEGF is generated from differential splicing of 8 exons, with exons 6 and 7 being differentially spliced to generate isoformswith altered heparin and neuropilin binding affinities. Anadditional alternate splice site exists in exon 8, which resultsin a more distal splice site selection in this final exon. Thisresults in a sister family of isoforms termed VEGF xxxb, which differ only in their terminal 6 amino acids from conventionalVEGF isoforms. Using antibodies generated to the unique c-terminal protein sequence, we have found that the VEGF xxxb isoforms are widely expressed at the protein level in normalhuman tissues. In fact in most tissues studied, they appear tobe the predominant isoforms with tissues the placenta, an angiogenic tissue doesAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3207not express much VEGFxxxb (1.5% of total VEGF). These isoforms are downregulated in cancers and other pathologiesassociated abnormal (cancer, diabeticretinopathy, retinal vein syndrome, andpre-eclampsia). Using human recombinant VEGF 165b, we have shown that this terminal splice site selection causes theseisoforms to lose angiogenic activity, and to inhibit VEGF 165b mediated angiogenesis in the rabbit corneal eyepocket, the ratmesentery and the mouse retina and choroid. when over-expressed by tumour cells growthof prostate sarcoma. Furthermore, localadministration of recombinant VEGF the of colorectal carcinoma cells in vivo . Recombinant VEGF121b also appears to inhibit migration of endothelial cells stimulated byVEGF 165. Thus these isoforms form a family of anti- angiogenic VEGFs. We have identified a number of cytokinesthat alter the regulation of the splice site, such that cells canswitch from the anti-angiogenic TNF- and PDGF-AB. The reverse switch can be induced by treatmentwith TGF-1. These isoforms are recognize by most over-expression ofVEGF 165b inhibits the anti-angiogenic action of bevacizumab in mouse models of human cancers. In summary, C terminaldistal splicing is a key component of VEGF biology,overlooked by the vast majority of publications in the field, andthese findings require a radical revision of our understandingof VEGF biology in normal human physiology.

The alternative theory of breast cancerdevelopment is that of \"parallel disease\". According to thistheory, DCIS is classified as low- and high-grade and isbelieved to progress in low- and high grade IDC respectively,independently, in parallel fashion. Today, despite intensivemolecular research, we are not able to predict with certaintythe risk of DCIS progression to IDC or recurrence. Besides standard histopathological parameters, such as nuclear gradeand necrosis, biological markers that appear promising are: thestatus of steroid receptors (ER, PgR), markers of proliferationand regulators of cell cycle such as MIB-1, bcl-2, p53, p21,cyclin D1 and cyclin A, as E-cadherin, matrix metalloproteinases, regulators of angiogenesis(growth factors and their VEFG-C, and VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), VEGFR-2 (Flk-1) and VEGF-R3(Flt-4). The great progress in understanding invasive breast cancer has come during the last decade from gene expressionprofiling studies, which have established a molecularclassification, with relevance to patient outcomes. So, it hasbecome apparent that the morphological heterogeneity ofinvasive breast cancer, which has been appreciated bypathologists for the last 4-5 decades, is reflected at thetranscriptomic level. The molecular classification has beendeveloped based mainly on cases of IDC, and distinguishesfive main groups: luminal A and luminal B (both ER+), basal-like, HER2+ (ERBB2) and normal breast-like. The last threesubtypes are usually ER-. Furthermore, prognostic gene setshave been developed, including a 70-gene prognosis profileand a 21-gene recurrence score. Pathologists follow closelythe molecular progress in IDC classification and haveincorporated much of this new information in every-daypathology practice. Today, besides ER and PgR,characterization of HER2 expression has become an integralpart of the work-up of a breast cancer patient in the Pathologylaboratory and of the corresponding pathology report. Thispractice has led to identification of new entities and use ofnovel terms, such as triple-negative cancer, whichencompasses a heterogeneous group of neoplasms withdistinctive, but quite variable, pathologic and clinical features.

BatsisMedical School, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece Since 1894 when William Halsted introduced the radical mastectomy as the definitive surgical procedure for theANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3208treatment of breast cancer, remarkable progress has been made in the local treatment of this disease in the last 100years,reflecting changes in our understanding of the biology ofbreast cancer and improvements in diagnostic and therapeuticmodalities. The breast conserving surgery (BCS) andradiotherapy has become more common, as surgeons havebecome convinced of the efficacy of this treatment throughdata from large prospective randomized trials. Veronesi, Fisherand others have shown the surgical rates with mastectomy andBCS plus radiotherapy to be equivalent. Because of thecomplexity of the disease process, the availability of multipletreatment options and the need to individualize each woman'scare, a multidisciplinary approach is essential to optimize thetreatment. Discussion of the local treatment of breast cancer should be divided into treatment of invasive breast cancer and treatmentof ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Invasive breast cancer and DCIS are clinicopathologic entities that require differenttreatments. Furthermore, treatment of invasive cancer must bedivided into early breast cancer (stage I-II) and advancedbreast cancer (stage III-IV). Most women with stage I-II breastcancers are good candidates for BCS and radiation but thereare certa in situ ations where the mastectomy is probably the best choice of therapy. The standard of care in treatment of theaxilla for patients with invasive breast cancer is currently alevel I and II axillary dissection. Sentinel node biopsy of theaxilla would decrease the risk of side-effects from dissection,while still accurately staging the axillary nodes in appropriateclinical situations. The treatment of stage III breast cancershould be decided after multidisciplinary consultation, with acombination of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or initial hormonaltreatment, making surgery feasible some weeks or monthslater. The local treatment of stage IV is palliative and not lifesaving. The treatment of DCIS consists of local treatment alone. Most women are good candidates for BCS alone or BCS andradiotherapy but there are some contraindications wheresimple mastectomy with or without reconstruction ispreferable. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is a rare pathologic entity poorly understood by patients and this isconsidered rather as a marker that places a woman atinscreased risk for the subsequent development of invasivecancer. The treatment options include close follow-up orbilateral prophylactic mastectomy with or withoutreconstruction. 49 THE XRCC4 IN CARCINOGENESIS ANDANTICANCER DRUG DISCOVERY Da-Tian BauDepartments of Terry Fox Cancer Research Lab, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, ROCIn the past decades, the incidence of cancer continues to rise rapidly all over the world and is always an important threat topublic health. It is believed that cancer results from a series ofgenetic alterations leading to progressive disorder of thenormal mechanisms controlling cell proliferation,differentiation, death, and/or genomic stability. The responseof the cell to genetic injury and its ability to maintain genomicstability by means of a variety of DNA repair mechanisms aretherefore essential in preventing tumor initiation andprogression. From the same viewpoint, the relative role ofDNA repair as a biomarker for prognosis, predicator of drugand therapy responses, or indeed as target for novel genetherapy (recently patented) and is very promising. Here, wesummarize and evaluate associations between the SNPs ofXRCC4 , one of the NHEJ genes, and the susceptibility of multiple types of cancer, and discuss its role in carcinogenesisand application in anticancer drug discovery. 50 SENSITIZATION OF TUMOR CELLS FOR ROS -MEDIATED INTERCELLULAR APOPTOSISINDUCTION: A NOVEL CHANCE TO ESTABLISHSELECTIVE BauerDepartment of Virology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany Transformed cells are subject to the control intercellular induction of apoptosis, cells. The efficiency of intercellularinduction of apoptosis, as well as its selectivity with respectto the transformed state of target cells, is driven byextracellular superoxide anions that are generated contribute to intercellular induction acquire resistancemechanisms against intercellular induction of apoptosis. Thisresistance is based on active interference of tumor cells withintercellular ROS-mediated signaling through membrane-associated enzymes. Resistance against intercellular ROS-signaling is found in all tumor cell systems tested, includingthe most frequent and the most aggressive human tumors. Resistant tumor cells can be sensitized for intercellular ROS signaling and subsequent selective apoptosis induction throughseveral distinct approaches established by our group. Amongthem are: i) siRNA-mediated knock down of the majorinterfering enzyme; inhibition of interfering enzymes generation singlet oxygenthrough modulation of the tumor cells ROS signalingchemistry. The latter approach utilizes tumor cell specific ROS Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3209interactions for singlet oxygen generation as a first step, followed by inactivation of the major interfering enzyme andsubsequent efficient intercellular ROS signaling, leading toselective tumor cell apoptosis. Ligand-dependent and independent death receptor activation as well as low-dose gamma irradiation showsynergistic interactions with the sensitization of tumor cellsand with intercellular ROS signaling. These synergisticeffects may be utilized for further optimization of thesensitization process. As intercellular ROS-signaling is specific and typical for cells with the transformed phenotype and as resistance againstROS signaling seems to represent a regular phenotypiccharacteristic of tumor cells, sensitization of tumor cells forintercellular ROS signaling should allow to establish noveltumor therapeutic approaches that bear the chance for highselectivity and efficiency. 51 REACTIVE OXYGEN AND NITROGEN SPECIES(ROS AND RNS) IN ANTICANCER MECHANISMS Georg BauerDepartment of Virology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany Transformed and tumor cells are characterized ROS-mediated mechanism that leads to theselective elimination of transformed cells. Intercellularinduction of apoptosis is based on four ROS/RNS-basedsignaling pathways, which may either interact synergisticallyor in an inhibitory mode. During tumor progression, tumorcells acquire resistance against intercellular ROS signalingthrough specific interference with intercellular ROS signalingby defined mechanisms. Our data allow i) multistep oncogenesis: ROS/RNS-driven intercellular ROS-sensitive transformed cells during multistep oncogenesis andthus represent a hitherto unrecognized natural control system.The interaction of certain secondary plant products andintercellular ROS signaling leads to the sensitization of ROS-resistant tumor cells (at later stages of oncogenesis) forintercellular induction of apoptosis. ii) Tumor therapy:Apoptosis establishedchemotherapeutics like taxol or epothilone B depends onfunctional intercellular ROS signaling. Besides its directapoptosis-inducing effect, mediated by singlet oxygen,photodynamic therapy leads to sensitization of tumor cells forintercellular ROS signaling. Death receptor activation andintercellular ROS signaling are interconnected and thus amplify apoptosis induction. The knowledge of the functional role of ROS/RNS during multistep oncogenesis and tumor therapy may be useful tooptimize tumor prevention and to improve tumor treatment. 52 ANTIOXIDANTS IN MULTISTEP ONCOGENESIS Anna Burcza and Georg Bauer Department of Virology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany Natural antioxidants from food are well-known for their scavenging activity for reactive oxygen and nitrogen species(ROS and RNS) such as hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxideor peroxynitrite. This scavenging activity may theinitiation step of multistep oncogenesis. Certain flavonoids have been shown to exhibit chemopreventive as well as therapeutic potential throughinduction of apoptosis in tumor cells (please see thecontribution by C. Gerh\u00e4user in this symposium). Here we report on the potential of flavonoids and other antioxidants to sensitize ROS-resistant tumor cells forintercellular induction of apoptosis, an ROS-drivenintercellular signaling system with possible relevance formultistep oncogenesis and tumor therapy. At the first sight, itseems a paradox that antioxidants can trigger and enhancethis prooxidative mechanism which is directed againsttransformed and tumor cells. Our detailed analysisdemonstrates a complex network of ROS/RNS/antioxidantinteractions. As the first step, antioxidants increase theavailable nitric oxide (NO) concentration through inhibitionof the consumption reaction between hydrogen peroxide andNO. In addition, certain compounds inhibit NO dioxygenaseand thus prevent consumption of NO. In a complex series ofbiochemical reactions, the increased NO concentrationfinally leads to singlet oxygen generation. Singlet oxgenrestores the ability of tumor cells for intercellular ROSsignaling. Ongoing ROS signaling first leads to theconsumption of the antioxidant which is the prerequisite forsubsequent that of apoptosis through establishment of specificresistance mechanisms are rendered sensitive for ROS-dependent apoptosis induction through the action of theantioxidant. These data add an unexpected aspect to the multifaceted picture of antioxidant action during multistep oncogenesis.Our findings may be useful for the understanding of the role ofnutritional antioxidants in tumor prevention as well as 3157-3556 (2008) MUCOSAL CULTURES P. Baumeister , N. Kleinsasser and U. Harr\u00e9us Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Germany Objectives: In the past decades, large interventional trials were carried out to test cancer chemopreventive effects of nutrionalsupplementation with micronutrients such as vitamins or traceelements. Unfortunately, no positive influence on cancerincidence could be shown. On the other hand, epidemiologicalstudies suggest that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables hasstrong cancer chemopreventive effects. We here present anoverview of our studies evaluating DNA protection of differentvitamins, several polyphenols and zinc. Methods: Miniorgan cultures (MOCs), with oxidatively or with a metabolically activatedcarcinogen. DNA protective effects were evaluated using thealkaline single cell microgel electrophoresis (Comet) assay.Results: All tested micronutrients show remarkable DNA protective action against oxidative or carcinogen-induceddamage in our model. Our results indicate their potential toprevent DNA fragmentation from endogenous and/orxenobiotic sources. The lack of this effect in interventionaltrails could be due to their metabolism. 54 CANCER PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM TUMOR-INDUCED EV ASION OF THE ADAPTIVEIMMUNITY BY INCREASED BENEFIT FROM ANTICANCER TH2CYTOKINES ANTAGONISTS Yechiel BeckerDepartment of Molecular Virology, Facultty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel Background: human tumors release antigenic glycoproteins that are processed by dendritic cells and presented by HLAclass I and HLA class II to CD4 +T-cells in the lymph nodes. CD4+T-cells that interact with HLA class I polarize into two types of T helper 1 cells: Th1 cells produce Th1 cytokines IL-2, cells activate +T-cells. Th17 involved in autoimmunity. In addition to the CD4+and CD8+T-cells, members of the adaptive immune system, innate system cells, mast cells,basophils, monocytes and dendritic cells, are regulators of theadaptive immune cells, due to their ability to release large amounts of Th2 cytokines that induce B-cells to switch to IgEsynthesis. A new test for simultaneous analysis of Th1, cytokines was developed. Passive immunotherapywith humanized monoclonal J.

COLI IN THE CONTEXT OF TARGETEDANTICANCER THERAPY Rahely Hakim and Itai Benhar Department of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology, the George S. Wise Faculty of Life Sciences, Ramat Aviv69978, Israel Antibodies are among the most powerful tools in biological and biomedical research and are presently the fastest growingcategory of new bio-pharmaceutics. With regard to anticancerimmunotherapy, antibodies can be used \"naked\" as are mostFDA approved ones, or as immunoconjugates to directcytotoxic moieties to tumor cells. Recombinant forms of smallantibody fragments fused to cytotoxic moieties, namedrecombinant immunotoxins, are also being developed as anadditional approach for an antibody-targeted cancer therapy. For treating solid tumors, tumor penetration, which is inversely proportional to the size of the drug, is currentlyregarded as the prime factor for its efficacy, while otherparameters such as binding affinity and residence time in thebody are of lesser importance. This dogma may be challengedby recent study from our lab when immunotoxins that targetthe tumor-associated antigen ErbB2 (200 kDa) was muchsuperior to immunotoxin(scFv-toxin fusion, 66 kDa), in killing ErbB2 expressingtumor cells in culture and as xenografts in nude mice. Theseresults suggest that higher avidity and longer residence timemay outweigh tumor penetration. This led us to designAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3211additional models to study whether our previous observation was a peculiarity of the model system we used, or a moregeneral phenomenon. While looking for an easier and more rapid way to achieve the full-length IgGs that are required to this study, wedeveloped an expression and purification protocol for full-length IgGs in E. coli , called \"Inclonals\". By using this protocol, we can obtain a yield of up to 50 mg pure IgG from1 liter of shake flask culture and highly purified IgGs that arefree of contaminating and partially assembled species. The\"Inclonals\" we produced equaled the performance of the sameIgGs that were produced using conventional mammalian cellculture. Antibodies that are produced in E. coli are aglycosylated and hence are not useful for purposes thatrequire effector functions such as ADCC and CDC. However,the large majority of antibodies that can be potentially usedfor therapy, diagnostics or research purposes are not dependenton Fc glycosylation to be effective (some examples are asvirus neutralizing antibodies, antibodies that are used to ferrya cargo to the target cells, or bi-specific antibodies). Webelieve that our rapid and cost-effective IgG productionprocess and the high quality of the resultant may makebacterial production of full-length IgG, and IgG-based fusionproteins a viable and attractive option for antibody production. 56 CIRCULATING TUMOR CELL DETECTION BYCELLSEARCH SYSTEM DURING BREAST CANCERNEOADJUV ANT CHEMOTHERAPY F.C. Bidard Vellefaux, 75010 Paris, France Background and Aim: Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs), detected by the CellSearch system in metastatic breast cancerpatients have been reported as a surrogate marker for tumorresponse and shorter survival. The aim of this study was todetermine whether CTC are present in the blood of patientswith large operable or locally advanced breast cancer beforeneoadjuvant chemotherapy (pre-CT) and after neoadjuvantchemotherapy, prior to surgery (post-CT). Patients and Methods: 7.5 ml blood samples were obtained on CellSave tubes from patients included in a phase II trial (REMAGUS02). CTCs were immunomagnetically separated andfluorescently stained by the CellSearch \u00aesystem. Twenty metastatic breast cancer patients were screened Results: From 10/2004 to 7/2006, pre-CT and/or post-CT blood samples were obtained from 118 patients. Atleast one CTC was detected in 22 out of 97 patients with pre-CT sample (23%, 95%CI=[15-31%], median 2 cells, range were 17% in 86 post-CTsamples and 27% in all 118 patients. Persistence of CTC at the end of CT was not correlated with treatment response.After a short median follow up of 18 months, the presence ofCTC ( p=0.017), hormone receptor negativity and large tumor size were independent prognostic factors for shortermetastasis-free survival. Conclusion: The CellSearch \u00aesystem can detect CTCs in 27% of patients receiving neoadjuvantchemotherapy, using a low cut-off of 1 cell/tube. CTCsdetection was not correlated to the primary tumor response butis an independent prognostic factor for early relapse. 57 DA VID PAUL HANSEMANN, CHROMOSOMES ANDCANCER Leon P. Bignold , Brian Coghlan and Hubertus Jersmann University of Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia Chromosomes were described, named and identified as the basis of the cellular hereditary material in the 1870s-80s. Inthe same period Weismann's theory that 'differentiation'(conversion of blastula cells into the various types of adulttissue cells) occurs by progressive loss of chromosomes duringmitoses of the cells was popular. Also, studies ofchromosomes during oogenesis showed that the 'polar bodies'associated with this process involve loss of chromosomes fromthe egg cell. In 1890, David Paul Hansemann (1858-1920)noted asymmetric mitoses in cancer cells while recognisingloss of tissue differentiation and increased capacity forindependent existence ( i.e.\"autonomy\" - ability to grow in remote tissues and form metastases) as features of cancer cells.Probably because Virchow insisted that tumour formation mustinvolve only an abnormality of a \"physiological\" tissueprocess (not a new process), Hansemann thought thatoogenesis might be a counterpart of this particularcombination of changes because (i) the egg loseschromosomes as it ripens (ii) it is less 'differentiated' thanovarian epithelial cells (in fact, it is 'de-differentiated') and(iii) the egg can survive for days free in the endometrial cavity.Hansemann called the normal process \"anaplasia\", andproposed that it could occur to variable degrees in differentcases of tumour according to the degrees of chromosomeimbalance in the tumour cells. He considered that populationsof chromosomally unbalanced cells would arise, some ofwhich have the (ovum-like) anaplastic features, but still havefeatures of the cell type from which they arose. Hansemann's ideas were criticized by many authors (summarized in (1)) but several authors (Hauser, 1903; Mooreand Farmer, 1904; and Boveri, 1914, see (1)) producedtheories of tumors involving alterations of cellular hereditarymaterial. None of these was as comprehensive asHansemann's, and Boveri's in particular was largely based ononly one abnormality and one new cellANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3212biological observation (wandering of cells of the blastomere in doubly-fertilized - 'dispermic' - eggs) (1). Also in the earlytwentieth century, the directions of cancer research movedtowards investigating Mendelian genetics in relation totumours, and the mechanisms of action of viral, physical andchemical carcinogens. Only in the last 30 or so years, have theroles of chromosomal abnormalities in tumour formation -which were first studied by Hansemann - attention. 1 Bignold LP, Coghlan Context, Commentsand Translations.

BignoldUniversity of Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia Chromosomal abnormalities occur spontaneously in cancer cells. However also, they are inducible in normal cells byagents which affect covalent bonds relating only to DNA ( e.g. bromodeoxyuridine), only to proteins ( e.g.etoposide), to DNA and proteins ( e.g.X-rays, alkylating agents) or to neither DNA nor proteins ( e.g.higher phenols and acridines). Although it does clastogens, a widely heldtheory of chromosomal aberrations (1) is agents causedouble strand breaks during interphase, and translocations etcarise if two breaks are followed by inappropriate rejoinings toconcurrently doubly broken DNA strands from the same oranother chromosome. In recent years, it has become clear that (i) during interphase, DNA strands are clothed by chromatin proteins,and so are rarely so 'proximate' that two fibers could interactas a result of one ionizing event (2); (ii) DNA synthesis occursin intranuclear 'factories', where clusters of polymerasecomplexes act on 'proximate' and 'bare' DNA strands; (iii)several steps of DNA synthesis, mismatch repair involve active strand-breaking, including 'double-strand breaking' by nucleases especially at the 'replicationfork' and during various repair mechanisms (3) and (v) allprocesses of synthesis or repair of DNA involve complexes ofproteins which maintain strand alignment (DNA-protein'clamps'). Here, it is suggested that DNA damage caused at any time in interphase including G2 leads to double and single strandbreaking by repair or synthesis-related enzymes. While thesestrand breaks are in existence, 'clamp protein' function mayfail, either due to excessive persisting abnormal DNA or due todamaged clamp proteins (many of which are present in thenucleus throughout the cell cycle) or both. This results in simple chromosome \"breaks\". However also at this point, thestrands are being processed naked of other proteins, so thatwhen the clamps on two adjacent DNA strands fail, swappingof strands may occur. If the swap involves another part of thesame arm of a chromosome, an 'intrachange' entirely the 'DNA-protein clamp are the 'target' of agents which cause aberrations wouldaccount for aberration-causing agents which do not react withDNA. Mutation(s) of clamp protein genes may contribute tochromosomal aberrations in cancer. 1 Genetics 23: 494, 1938. 2 Mut Res 512: 93, 2002. 3 DNA Repair (Amst.) 5: 404, 2006. 59 177LU RADIOLABELLING AND QUALITY Biricova, Francisciho 27, Levoca 054 01, Slovakia Dendritic highly branched polymeric materials seem to be potential antitumour drug carriers.

It plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cellproliferation and migration. In neoplastic cells, GD3 expressionis once again up-regulated but becomes acetylated acid residue to form 9- O-acetyl GD3 (GD3A). Whilst the accumulation of GD3 in cell inducesmitochondrially mediated apoptosis, this phenomenon when GD3 is acetylated. GD3A appears to promotetumour polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) can efficiently transduce mammalian cell lines leading to stable andtransient gene expression whilst remaining non-pathogenic andmay be a suitable expression system for in vivo therapeutic targeting of GD3A. Aims: Target GD3A expressing brain- tumour cells with acetylesterase in vitro by exogenous addition and transfection with influenza c virus HE protein cDNA toassess the effect on levels of GD3/GD3A expression, apoptosisand invasion and to determine whether the baculovirusAcMNPV can transduce human brain-tumour cells and maytherefore be a suitable vector system for therapeutic targetingof GD3A. Materials and Methods: Recombinant acetylesterase from influenza C virus, produced in SF9 cells and supplied byR. Vlasak, was used at 10 mU in all assays. Cells used in allassays were from a glioblastoma culture. The pCHE4 encoding the acetylesterase(hemagglutinin esterase (HE) protein) from the influenzaC/California/78 virus was also supplied by R. Vlasak.Transductions with the baculovirus were performed by J.Danquah using recombinant baculovirus AcEGFP-VP39 atmultiplicity of infection (MOI) 50, cells were then fixed and lablelled with anti-VP39. GD3/GD3A expression studies werecarried out by incubating cells with acetylesterase followed bystaining with anti-GD3, anti-GD3A and analysis assays incubatingcells with acetylesterase followed by either staining withAnnexin V or the JC-1 probe and analysis by flow cytometry orrunning lysed cells on SDS-PAGE and cytochrome cand caspase-9 and caspase-3. Invasion assays were carried by themodified transwell-Boyden chamber invasion assay where cellsapplied to the upper surface were suspended in SFM +acetylesterase (SFM + PDGF was used as a chemoattractant) orby live cell imaging for 24 hours in the presence ofacetylesterase. Results: The exogenous addition of acetylesterase results in a decreased expression of GD3A andan increase in the expression of GD3. This is correlated to adecrease in cell survival since the percentage of dead/apoptoticcells was significantly more when pre-treated with the enzyme.Discussion: Since exogenous addition of acetylesterase only targets GD3A on the surface of the brain tumour cells, weexpect to see much more convincing effects when the enzymeis active within the cell. Since the baculovirus transductions areso far very promising we hope to start work cloningacetylesterase cDNA into the baculovirus.

Andersen and Lotte Bjergbaek Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus,C.F. M\u00f6llers All\u00e9 building 130, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark The S-phase is a period of great vulnerability for the genome of eukaryotic cells. Many complicated processes areundertaken during this critical phase of the cell cycle,including the complete unwinding and duplication ofenormously complex DNA molecules. During this process,replication forks frequently encounter obstacles that impedetheir progression. The replication fork must be able to copewith such obstacles as this otherwise it can cause replicationfork stalling and eventually lead to collapse of the replicationfork with the result of single- or double-strand breakformation. Replication fork stalling or damage will thereforecompromise genomic integrity if not properly processed. Single-strand breaks (SSB) are frequent endogenous DNA lesions in cells and impose a great danger to an advancingANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3214replication fork. SSBs can be induced directly by free radicals or damaged bases. Furthermore, poisons against DNAtopoisomerase I (TopoI) will also generate nicks in the DNAas the enzyme gets trapped in a cleavage intermediate beingcovalently linked to the DNA at the 3' end of the nick. Notonly do anticancer drugs such camptothecin stimulateTopoI-DNA cleavage is believed that TopoI-DNAcleavage intermediates damage DNA and kill cells bygenerating replication-mediated double-strand breaks (DSB)and by stalling transcription complexes. Topoisomerase I is anabundant enzyme and is furthermore known to travel alongwith the DNA replication machinery, possibly removingtopological strain in front of the replication fork, it is thereforelikely that TopoI can induced damage arise in every S-phase. In order to identify and characterize pathways engaged in repair of topoisomerase-induced DNA damage, we havedesigned an in vivo system where we can induce an SSB at a single locus in the genome. The induced SSB mimics a TopoI-DNA cleavage intermediate. Using this system, we have aunique opportunity to examine which stress response factorsget activated and to study in detail how the DNA replicationfork copes with these challenges. Data obtained with thesystem will be presented. 62 RESISTANCE OF FRESHLY ISOLATEDPERIPHERAL BLOOD LEUKOCYTES TO VIRALINFECTIONS AS ONE OF THE INNATE IMMUNITYMECHANISMS IN HEALTH ANDDISEASE-POSSIBLE THERAPEUTIC EFFECT OFPLANT PREPARATIONS Z. Bach-Olszewska 1, E. Zaczyska1, Sochocka1, 1Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute Immunology Experimental Therapy, Polish of Sciences,Wrocaw; 2Department of Hematology, Medical University, Wrocaw; 3Department of Fertility and Obstetrics, Medical University, Wrocaw, Poland The aim of this study was to compare the resistance of healthy blood donors leukocytes ex vivo to viral infection with the resistance of leukocytes isolated from cancer patients. Theresistance is individually on TNF and IFNs (, , ). The degree of resistance was measured by using a direct method of infection of leukocytes with vesicular stomatitisvirus (VSV), which is an indicatory virus in the test. The lackof VSV replication by infected leukocytes (0-1 log TCID 50) was taken as a complete resistance; a low level of VSV (2-3log) for partial, and a high VSV titer (4 or more log) for no orvery low resistance. Results showed statistically significant differences between the resistance of the healthy and leukemia groups at diagnosisand the importance of the degree of the resistance forinduction of remission after chemotherapy and survival time.Very low immunity was also found in leukocytes of cancerpatients (ovarian and endometrial cancer). With respect topotential therapeutic usefulness, intensification of theresistance plant and donepezil (used in Alzheimer's disease therapy) was found. 63 ASSESSING THE ROLE OF HUMANPAPILLOMA VIRUS (HPV) ONCOPROTEINS INREGULATING CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY:IMPLICATIONS Bodil Norrild3Graham P. Cook2and G. Eric Blair1 1Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK, 2Leeds Institute of Hospital, Leeds 7TF, of Copenhagen, DK- 2200, Copenhagen, Denmark Previous work from this laboratory has investigated the modulation of cell surface Major HistocompatabilityComplex class I (MHC class I) expression by the E7oncoprotein from high risk Human Papillomavirus 16(HPV16). We utilized two complementary cell-based systemsto induce or knock-down expression of the E7 protein, anddetermined changes to MHC class I expression. We shown that siRNA-mediated inhibition of E7 results of cell-surface MHC class I molecules. We havealso shown that induction of HPV16 E7 using a tetracycline-repressor system results in a significant down-regulation ofcell surface MHC class I molecules. In addition, analysis oftotal cell MHC class I heavy chain protein by Westernblotting has confirmed the results obtained by flow cytometryon cell-surface MHC class I. Interestingly, total cellular levelsof the invariant chain of the MHC class I heterodimer, 2-microglobulin, appeared to be unaffected by E7 expression,suggesting a selective effect on molecules encoded in theMHC locus (since 2-microglobulin is located outside the MHC locus). We are currently examining levels of othercomponents of the antigen processing and presentationpathway (TAP, LMP2, LMP7 etc).Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3215We have also examined the functional implications of MHC class I down-regulation by HPV E7 using a co-culture systemwith peripheral blood Natural Killer (NK) cells. These co-culture experiments revealed that the cell surfaces changes inMHC class I levels mediated by E7 observed have asignificant effect on susceptibility to NK mediated lysis,consistent with \"the missing self hypothesis\". Thus, E7-expressing cells having reduced MHC class I were lessresistant to NK cell mediated lysis. Conversely, E7-knockoutcells having increased cell surface MHC class I were moreresistant to NK cell lysis. We are now investigating inhibitoryand activating NK cell ligands on HPV-transformed cells toelucidate the mechanism of the NK interaction with thesemalignant cervical cells. 64 NESTED MORPHOLOGY IN UROTHELIALCARCINOMAS: AN ELEMENTARY LESIONSHARED BY MANY DIFFERENT SUB-TYPES OFURINARY BLADDER CANCER Enrico BollitoDivision Gonzaga Hospital- Orbassano, Turin, Italy The incidence of bladder cancer has markedly increased, mainly as a result of smoking, particularly within women. Recently, the new 2004-WHO classification of these tumors has re-opened the debate on many aspects of these lesions,improving the distinction of the different variants of bladdercancer. The existence of a group of bladder cancers that seemsto have special features has become more evident: they arecarcinomas frequently showing an inverted or endophyticgrowth pattern, and presenting heterogeneous histologicalaspects and different grades, sometimes high, ofaggressiveness, but they seem to share the same elementarylesion: the nest. The group of urothelial lesions with nested morpholgy may include different benign or malignant conditionsranging from von Brunn nests, inverted urothelialpapillomas to inverted, nested type, microcystic andmicropapillary carcinomas. Among the latter, somemalignant forms were recognized as malignant tumorshaving a worse prognosis than conventional urothelialcarcinomas. The study of bladder cancer with nestedmorphology is therefore of interest for a better knowledgeof the development of these tumors and because the nestedvariants may represent, if not a true separate sub-type, atleast a separate growth pattern with possible prognostic andtherapeutic implications. Further investigations, particularlywith molecular techniques are needed to assess the existenceof a true difference beetween tumors with nested oresophytic morphology.65 P53 FAMILY Mudaliarpet, Puducherry, 605 004, India It is known for years that several tumor suppressor genes exist in a cell. However, it remains elusive whether there is anycoordination among the established tumor suppressor genesto determine the fate of the cell in response to aberrantproliferative signals/DNA damage. Every gene in a cell needsto be linked to another gene through gene network. Genesthat perform similar functions may be functionally linked andthey could be coordinately regulated. If this is true, thengenes that are classified under the title of tumor suppressorgenes may not be an exception to this possibility. Hence, Ipropose that it is very important to understand how one tumorsuppressor gene is connected to another tumor suppressorgene - through tumor suppressor network - within the cell.Any biological or chemical agent that disrupts the tumorsuppressor network will result in the initiation oftumorigenesis. A single nucleotide/codon alteration canchange the fate of the cell. For example, missense mutationin the tumor suppressor p53 results in cancer. The p53 andINK4s(a,b,c)-ARF tumor suppressors are the most prominentamong all the tumor suppressor genes known so far. Itappears that in most of the cancer cell types, if not all, acquirea mutation in the pathway leading to the induction of p53- orINK4s(a,b,c)-ARF tumor suppressors. Having realized theimportance of these tumor suppressor genes, it is ofparamount importance to identify other tumor suppressorgenes that link both p53- and INK4s(a,b,c)-ARF genestogether within the cell. With the arrival of two p53 relatedgenes, p73 and p63, the p53 tumor suppressor family networkappears to have enlarged in scope and significance. I haveidentified several tumor suppressor genes that link both p53-and INK4s(a,b,c)-ARF-family genes together. Thebioinformatics approach was used to identify the potentialtumor suppressor network. The models that emerge from thisstudy will mainly explain how p63 and p73 function as tumorsuppressors. Then, the identified tumor suppressor networkwill be classified to illuminate the specific tumor suppressorpathways. Additionally, the concept of \"tumor suppressome\"will be elaborated. In aggregate, this study was aimed toidentify: a) Networks among the established tumorsuppressors that directly link the p53 family tumor suppressorproteins together; b) p63/p73-dependent tumor suppressorpathways; c) the unidentified tumor suppressor networks thatdirectly link several tumor suppressors. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 321666 A REVIEW OF PROGNOSTIC FACTORS OF EARLYCERVICAL CARCINOMA J. Bouda 1, L. Boudova2, Z. Rokyta1, B. G. Gitsch3and E. Stickeler3 Departments of 1OBGYN and 2Department Pathology, Medical Faculty Hospital, Plze, Czech Republic; 3OBGYN, Freiburg University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany Establishing prognosis is an important step for therapy planning in malignant diseases. The classical morphologicalprognostic factors in cervical carcinoma are: stage, type,grade, tumor volume or diameter, depth of stromal invasion,lymphovascular invasion, regional lymph node status, andpositivity of surgical margins. Recently, the focus of researchmoved to novel factors such as oncogenes, tumor and microsatellite instability,neovascularisation, this review, we analyse the role of classical prognostic factors of early cervical carcinoma and the role of novelfactors such as CD 44v6 adhesion molecule, focal adhesionkinase (FAK) and hTra2-beta1 splicing factor. We also discussthe impact of prognostic factors for treatment individualisationand outline the future directions in this field of research. 67 CAS MEDIATES CROSSTALK and Br\u00e1bek Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, CharlesUniversity in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic mTOR signaling was found to contribute to various aspects of Src mediated transformation, especially anchorageindependent growth. CAS (Crk associated substrate) is a majortyrosine phosphorylated protein in cells transformed by v srconcogene and was found to be critical for invasion andmetastasis of src transformed cells. CAS was recentlydocumented to contribute to the activation of PI3 kinase, anupstream regulator of mTOR signaling. To analyze the role of CAS in crosstalk of mTOR and Src pathways, we employed CAS null and CAS re expressing Srctransformed MEFs. We found that CAS profoundly 4E MEFs, reexpressing CASmutant with all 15 tyrosines in substrate domain mutated tophenylalanines, we showed that functional CAS substratedomain is necessary for 4E BP1 and to lesser extent also for Akt 473 phosphorylation. CAS mediated invasiveness of Src transformed MEFs is accompanied by great elevation of MMP 2 activity (Br\u00e1bek et al., 2004). We analyzed whether mTOR signaling participates in regulation of MMP 2 activity. Remarkably, we found thatMMP 2 activation in Src transformed MEFs was while mTOR inhibitors inhibited growth of Srctransformed cells under both non adhesive and adhesiveconditions, PI3 kinase inhibitor wortmanin inhibited thegrowth of Src transformed cells only under non adhesiveconditions, suggesting that under adhesive conditions thecrosstalk of Src and mTOR signaling is independent of PI3kinase. To summarize, we found that CAS mediated crosstalk of Src and mTOR signaling and that this crosstalk is at inpart PI3 kinase independent. Ospedale S. Maria, Terni, Metastatic advanced renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is historically refractory to conventional available treatmentssuch as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. As a result, untilrecently, immunotherapy (interleukin-2 and or interferon-)has been considered the treatment of choice for advanceddisease. Recent advances in understanding the biology and genetics of RCC have led to the identification of a number of moleculartargets, with several novel drugs developed for these targets,particularly tumor-associated angiogenesis, a key step in thepathogenesis and progression of RCC. Several angiogenic growth factors are highly expressed in RCC, but vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), becauseof the inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene and the subsequent activation of the hypoxiaresponse pathway, and mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR), for its central metabolic and angiogenic role, are ofparticular importance. As a consequence, VEGF-targetedtherapies and mTOR inhibitors have been identified aspromising treatment strategies in patients with mRCC. To date,three main treatment approaches have emerged: VEGF ligandblockade, through anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies (such asAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3217bevacizumab); VEGF signal blockade, by targeting VEGF receptors with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors suchas sunitinib and sorafenib; and, more recently, mTORinhibition with intravenous or oral agents such as temsirolimus(CCI-779) and everolimus (RAD001). Recent data about clinical efficacy and significant toxicities of these agents and actual innovative treatment strategies foradvanced renal cell carcinoma will be presented and discussed.1 Motzer RJ, Hutson TE, Tomczak : Engl Porta C, Boni C et al: Randomized prospective phase II trial of two schedules of sorafenib daily andinterferon-2a (IFN) in M, Tomczak P et al : Temsirolimus, interferon alpha, or both for advanced renal-cell carcinoma.N Engl J Med 356: Bracarda S al: Bevacizumab plus interferon alfa-2a treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma: a randomised, double-blindphase III Porta C, Bracarda S et al : RECORD-1 Study Group.

They both have strongpromitotic and antiapoptotic effects. The actions of IGFs aremediated by their activation of the specfic cell membranereceptor with tyrosine- kinase activity called IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR). There is also another type of IGF receptor - IGF IIreceptor (IGF-IIR). This receptor has no tyrosine-kinaseactivity, and does not exert mitogenic and antiapoptotic action.The activity of IGFs is regulated by their binding proteins.Because of their mitogenic and antiapoptotic actions IGFs canact on tumor growth. There are many epidemiological studiesshowing that incresed circulating levels of IGFs are connectedwith increased risk of several cancers. Not only circulating butalso locally produced IGFs, can act on tumor growth in aparacrine-autocrine way. Production of IGFs, and presence ofIGF-IR has been observed in several cancer cells. IGF-I andIGF-II have strong mitogenic and antiapoptopic effects onnormal and transformed kidney cells. This evidence suggeststhat IGFs may promote the development and growth of renalcancer. Renal cancer represents 3-4% of all human malignantneoplasms. Recent studies suggest that the incidence of RCCis increasing. About 2500 new cases of renal cancer per yearare registred in Poland. The most frequent among them isrenal cell carcinoma and among them 70-80% are clear cellcarcinoma.Radical nephrectomy is stil the main therapy of thiscancer. Materials and Methods: Patients qualified to radical nephrectomy, aged 25-65, were included to the study. Patientsunder 25, and over 60 were excluded. Production of IGFsdecreases with age, being highest in young people, andstrongly decreases in older patients, so this exclusion was usedin order to have an homogeneous. Patients qualified fornephrectomy because of cancer were included to examinedgroup, and patients qualified for other reason were includedto the control group. All patients signed informed consent asper institutional guidelines. After radical nephrectomy tumorspecimens were histopatologicaly evaluated. Only materialsobtained from patients with tumors qualified as caclarocellulare were subject to further examination. Finally 49(age 40-65) patient were included into examined group, and15 (age 32-63) patients to control group. Material from tumorswas subsequently evaluated according to Fuhrman malignancyscale. Then specimens coming from tumors, health tissue oftumor area and from kidney nephrectomized because of otherthan cancer reasons were processed according to geneexpression. Expressions of genes for IGFs, IGF receptors andIGFBP were evaluated by QRT-PCR (Taqman). Data analysiswas performed by means of standard statistical proceduresusing STATISTICA 7.1. Results: IGF-I. Only in 19 samples of tumor tissue and in 3 samples of tumor area, expression ofIGF-I gene was observed. The expression in tumor is inverslycorrelated with tumor grade. IGF-II. Expression of IGF-IIgene was observed only in tumors with high Fuhrman grade(3 and 4). Expression was observed also in 3 samples fromtumor area and in 5 samples from kidney nephretomizedbecause of non cancer reasons. IGF-IR. Expression of IGF-IRgene was noted only in 2 samples from non cancer kidney andonly in 2 (of 16) samples from the tumor area of patients withANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3218cancer Fuhrman grade 1. Expression was observed in all other cases. Expression in cancer tissue with Furhrman grade 2, 3and 4 was higher (statistically significant) than in cancers withFuhman 1. IGF-IIR. Expression of IGF-IIR gene was presentin all samples from non cancer tissues. Expression wasobserved only in five samples from a healthy area from kidneywith cancer (4 with Fuhrman 1 and 1 with Fuhrman 3).Expression was observed in 3 tumors with Furhman 1. In allother tumors no expression of IGF-IIR was observed. IGFBP-3. IGFBP -3 gene expression was not present in all samplesfrom non tumor kidney, and was observed in all (excluding 2)samples from cancer and cancer area. 70 MODULATION BY STIMULI TREATMENT OF CAMEXPRESSION, PROLIFERATION AND APOPTOSISASSOCIATED TO CERVIX TUMOR S. Nicolau\", Bucharest, Romania Proliferation of mammalian cells is tightly regulated by multiple environmental influences, adhesion to extracellularmatrix (ECM), cell-cell adhesion and loss of adhesion generallyresults in complete G1 phase cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Incontrast, formation and spread of tumors are closely associatedwith decreased dependence on adhesion for growth andsurvival. Cervical cancer represents the second malignancy asfrequency among women and is due by persistent infectionwith high risk human papilloma viruses (hrHPV). Co-expression of certain cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) bycervix tumor cells, which might be involved in cellularinteractions, changes in adhesivity and cellular mobility, couldinfluence the aggressiveness and metastatic potential of acertain tumor. The present study focused on the potentialinfluence of treatment with several stimuli as cytokines ordrugs(doxorubicin) on proliferation by cell cycle phases andapoptosis of cervix tumor cells using as models the HPV + immortalized CaSKi and HeLa cell lines. In addition, theeffect of stimuli treatment on expression of several CAMs (E-cadherin, ICAM-1, MUC-1, VCAM-1) byindirect immunofluorescence followed by flow cytometryanalysis. Percentages of apoptotic cells were detected by usingannexin V/FITC and propidium iodide (PI) double staining,while progression through cell cycle phases was evaluated byusing PI staining. Data obtained showed that both theexpression of CAMs associated to the human cervix cell linestaken under study and proliferation thorough cell cycle phasesor apoptosis were differentially influenced depending on the stimuli used. All these data bring new information regardingCAMs and proliferation profile associated to cervical tumorcells and their possible involvement in regulating theinteraction between tumor cells and host immune system,leading to new antitumor gene- and immuno-therapeuticalstrategies. 71 Urology, University of Mainz, Germany Background: The most common reason for death in cancer patients is the development of metastases. The formation ofmetastases depends on adhesion of tumor cells to theendothelium, migration into the subendothelial tissue andproliferation versus apoptosis in the secondary organ. These processes depend on many intracellular signaling mechanisms,which are partly regulated by protein kinase C (PKC). DifferentPKC isoforms have various regulatory effects in ofmetastases. analysed the role of PKC isoforms inprogression and metastases of renal cancer. Materials and Methods: The expression of all PKC isoforms was determined in the human renal carcinoma cell line CCF-RC1 and in tissuespecimens of renal tumor and normal renal tissue. Forfunctional analyses, cells were treated with the PKC endothelial cells was investigated. Themigration was quantified using a microchemotaxis chamberand proliferation was determined by BrdU incorporation. Thecellular expression of target focal adhesion kinase wasquantified by Western blot. The expression of beta-1 integrinson the cell membrane was quantified by flow cytometry.Results: With the exception of PKC lambda and theta, all PKC isoforms were expressed in the renal carcinoma cell line CCF-RC1, in renal tumor specimens and in normal renal tissue. Celladhesion and proliferation were unaffected by all PKCinhibitors. Cell migration was reduced after treatment withGF109203X or Rottlerin down to 69% or 29% of untreatedcells, respectively. The cellular expression and phosphorylationof beta-1 integrins and FAK are also inhibited by Rottlerin, aPKC delta specific inhibitor. In contrast, the expression of beta-1 integrins on the cell membrane was most potently reducedby RO31-8220 down to 8% of with PKC inhibitor GF109203X demonstrated aclear influence on cell migration. PKC delta is the only isoformwhich is inhibited by GF109203X but not by RO31-8220 orAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3219G\u00d66976. Since also Rottlerin, a strong PKC delta inhibitor, reduces cell migration, it is feasible to assume that PKC deltaregulates migration, but not adhesion and proliferation of renalcarcinoma cells. On the other hand, the only PKC isoformwhich is inhibited by RO31-8220, but not by one of the otherused PKC inhibitors, is PKC epsilon, this membrane expression of beta-1 integrins, althoughit has no influence on cell migration. Our results suggest thatthe inhibition of cell migration depends on the regulation of theactivity of beta-1 integrins and its downstream target FAK. 72 THE USE OF MULTIPLEXED APTAMERMEASUREMENTS OF PROTEINS FOR THEDIAGNOSIS AND SCREENING OF LUNG CANCER Edward N. BrodySomaLogic, Inc., 2945 Wilderness Place, Boulder, Colorado, 80301, USA Aptamers are single stranded nucleic acids that are evolved through the SELEX procedure to bind tightly and specificallyto cognate proteins. Recent advances in the SELEX protocolhave led to a new kind of aptamer (called SLaptamers);SLaptamers have very high affinity and specificity for cognateproteins, and not others, due to very long dissociation rates(>30 min) for the cognate protein. By coupling the newprotocol with the use of chemically modified bases in startinglibraries, SomaLogic has evolved new specific binding reagentsfor multiplexed measurements of proteins in blood and otherbiological fluids. Because one SLaptamer can give the samespecificity and sensitivity that requires two antibodies in theELISA format, SLaptamer arrays reduce cross-reactivitybetween reagents in a multiplexed array; there is essentially nolimit on how many measurements can be made simultaneously.SomaLogic now has the capacity to measure over 600 proteinsin blood. Using blood samples from smokers without cancer,early-stage (I and II) lung cancer, and late stage (III) lungcancer, measurement of serum proteins has detectedbiomarkers which, within this study, can discriminate smokerswithout cancer from both early and later stage lung cancer. 73 FUNCTIONAL FOOD SCIENCE AND SELENIUM INCANCER PREVENTION. A SHORT-TERMINTERVENTION TRIAL WITH SELENIUM-ENRICHED FOOD: BIOA V AILABILITYAND DEFENCE Ortopedico Galeazzi, Milan, Italy Results from several but mostly small observational studies as well as the secondary analysis of an intervention trial providesupport for a chemopreventive effect of selenium againstcancer, in particular prostate, lung, liver and colorectalcancers. Several cancer preventive mechanisms have beendescribed and it is likely that selenium acts through multiplepathways. In particular, the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects mediated through activity of seleno-enzymes are discussed, given the relevance of oxidative stressand inflammation in these cancers. The effect seems to bestrongest in those individuals with the lowest Se status. Thereis some evidence that Se may affect not only cancer risk butalso progression and metastasis. Current primary andsecondary prevention trials of Se are underway in the USA,including the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial(SELECT) relating to prostate cancer, although a largeEuropean trial is still desirable given the likelihood of astronger effect in populations of lower Se status. If Se mayprotect against cancer, an adequate intake of Se is desirable.However, the level of intake in Europe and some parts of theworld is not adequate for full expression of protectiveselenoproteins. Selenium levels in soil generally reflect itspresence in food and the Se levels in human populations.Thus, food content is influenced by geographical location,seasonal changes, protein content and food processing.Periodic monitoring of Se levels in soil and food is necessary.Diet is the major Se source and approximately 80% of dietarySe is absorbed depending on the type of food consumed. Sebioavailability varies according to the Se source andnutritional status of the subject, being significantly higher fororganic forms of Se. Se supplements can be beneficial forsubjects living in regions with very low environmental levelsof Se. Several strategies have been followed: (1) employmentof Se-enriched fertilizers; (2) (3) of multimicronutrient supplementswith Se. Nevertheless, detailed investigations of possibleinteractions between Se supplements and other foodcomponents and their influence on Se bioavailability areneeded. Given this background, in a 3 week randomised,double-blind study, 7 healthy young women (age 25\u00b12 years,Body Mass Index 23\u00b11) supplemented their usual diet withSe-enriched food and 7 were supplied with a similar diet butnot supplemented with Se. Before and after 21 days ofsupplementation serum Se level and erythrocyte glutathioneperoxidase (GPX) activity were evaluated. Serum Se levelswere significantly increased in the intervention group(99.3\u00b117.7 microgram/ml at time 0 and 114.1\u00b128.6microgram/ml at time +21 day, p<0.003 by Man-Withney test), while the control group did not show any significantdifference (98.2\u00b118.7 microgram/ml at time 0 and 100.2\u00b123.4ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3220microgram/ml at time +21 observed when erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity wasevaluated. The group supplemented with enrichedSelenium showed a significant increase in GPX activity after21 days of intervention (19.1\u00b13.1 at time 0 and 22.1\u00b14.0 attime +21 day, p<0.01), while its value did not change in the control group (20.2\u00b12.8 at time 0 and 19.1\u00b12.9 at time +21day). Moreover, the follow-up of the supplemented subjects,showed that ten days after the end of the supplementation,both the serum selenium levels and GPX activity decreasedand did not differ significantly when compared with values attime 0. In conclusion, this study demonstrated thebioavailability of Selenium supplemented through fortifiedfood, thus proving that this approach could be helpful tofavour the optimal intake of Selenium in the population andtherefore to favour cancer prevention. 74 THE SERINE/THREONINE KINASE AKTACTIV ATED BY FIBROBLAST GROWTH Saint-Jacques,75674 Paris, France Hormone-independent breast cancers proliferate in response to \"fibroblast growth factor\". The oestrogen-independentbreast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, expresses (FGFRs), and secretes FGF1 thatexerts an autocrine mitogenic effect. Analysis of FGFRssignalling is rendered difficult by the concomitant expressionof several tyrosine kinase receptors and their sharedtransduction cascades. To specifically investigate FGFRsignalling, we used a biological system the Xenopus oocyte, a giant cell, devoid of endogenous FGFRs, that allowsmicroinjections and expression of various RNAs. Thisparadigm offers a powerful experimental approaches toquestion cascade transduction regulation in relation to the cellcycle G 2/M checkpoint. Oocytes expressing FGFRs from MDA-MB-231 enter in M phase, after stimulation byexogenous FGF1. This G 2/M transition involves Ras- dependent and Ras-independent cascades. The phospholipaseC gamma (PLC) and the serine/threonine kinase (Akt), twoenzymatic effectors activated by FGFRs, are involved in breast cancer growth. In oocytes expressing FGFRs from MDA-MB-231, inhibitors of PI3Kinase-Akt SH2 domain)block FGF1-FGFR transduction. Activation of PLC is theresult of a direct binding to the FGFRs p(Y)766 site. APLC/calcium dependent chlorure current, measured byelectrophysiological techniques, starts 2 to 4 minutes afterFGF1 addition, and displays a duration of 20 minutes. Akinetic analysis shows that PLC is phosphorylated ontyrosine 5 minutes and on serine 30 minutes after FGFRsactivation. PLC immunoprecipitations show that the serinephosphorylated PLC is associated with active phosphorylatedAkt (serine 473). A PLC mimetic peptide PLC-Akt interaction, the serine phosphorylationof PLC and Akt binding to an other downstreamtarget: Chfr, a mitotic checkpoint protein deregulated in breastcancers. Moreover, an acceleration of the G 2/M transition occurs when the Akt-PLC interaction is substituted for theAkt-Chfr interaction. In conclusion, in the oestrogen-independent breast cancer line, MDA-MB-231, cell cycleprogression in the M phase induced by FGF receptors iscontrolled by a time regulated interaction of activated Akt withtwo partners PLC and Chfr. 75 INCREASED CYTOPLASMIC EXPRESSION OF THERECEPTOR (R) FOR IS AMARKER FOR EPITHELIAL PROLIFERATION,PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN),AND of Vienna; Hospital Hietzing, Vienna, Austria Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (CaP) were found to be related to chronic inflammation and cytokineproduction. We previously reported the expression of theinflammatory master cytokine IL-23 and its receptor in theprostate. In this study we investigated the association betweenIL-23R expression and prostatic carcinogenesis. IL-23R was localized immunohistochemically in 28 prostate carcinoma sections and 14 carcinoma-surroundingprostate sections from 20 patients, and 1 benign prostatebiopsy core. Tissue IL-23R expression was evaluatedparticularly with regard to the sequential stages of prostatecarcinogenesis, ranging from normal glands to carcinoma in situand invasive cancer. IL-23R expression of 3 CaP cell linesAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3221(PC3, LNCaP, and DU145) was compared to the benign prostate epithelial cell line PNT2 by flow cytometry, real-timePCR, immunoflourescence, and nuclearantigen (PCNA) expression was analyzed by flow cytometry,and growth effects of recombinant human (rh) IL-23 or aneutralizing anti-IL-23 antibody were assessed in a[3H]thymidine incorporation assay in PNT2 cells and allmalignant cell lines. Two expression patterns of IL-23R were identified: Cells of normal glands expressed IL-23R restricted to the luminal cellmembrane and in apocrine secretion structures. Glandularsectors showing morphological signs of proliferation, atrophicglands, PIN, and prostate cancer cells displayed a clearlyincreased staining intensity as well as distribution of IL-23Rexpression over the whole cytoplasm. In accordance, 3 CaPcell lines displayed higher cytoplasmic IL-23R expression thanthe benign prostate epithelial cell line. 18/28 carcinomatousand 7/14 surrounding sections contained 30 (high grade) PINlesions. One was found in the benign prostate biopsy. 100%of these were clearly marked by increased cytoplasmic IL-23Rstaining, as were 26/28 (93%) of prostate carcinomas. 7/26prostate carcinoma sections showed areas of partial loss of IL-23R expression. In tissue sections, malignant and proliferatingcells were characterized by a shift of IL-23R localization fromthe luminal membrane to the cytoplasm. Proliferation of 2/3carcinoma cell lines and of PNT2 cells was significantlyinhibited by rhIL-23, and on the contrary increased by IL-23immuno-depletion. IL-23R expression level and pattern is a marker for epithelial proliferation, prostatic carcinoma in situ and invasive cancer. IL-23R signaling from the cellular surface might relaygrowth inhibitory stimuli. In accordance, intracellulartranslocation and hence accumulation of the receptorwithdraws proliferating and malignant cells from anti-proliferative signals. Interfering with the (dysregulated) IL-23R signaling pathway might therefore serve as a potentialmolecular therapeutic target in prostate cancer. 76 EXPRESSION OF THE VITAMIN D SYSTEM ANDCOX-2 IN HUMAN COLORECTAL CANCER TISSUE Wolfgang of 2Surgery and 3Pathology, Hospital Rudolfstiftung, Vienna, Austria We suggested that the balance between colonic synthesis and degradation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3) maydetermine concentrations of the active metabolite locally, andthus may be crucial for growth regulation of colorectal tissue and prevention of tumor progression. Chronic inflammation asindicated by over-expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2often precedes and accompanies colorectal tumorigenesis. Inthe present study we investigated differences in mRNAexpression related to the vitamin D system (CYP27B1, (COX-2). These were evaluatedstatistically in relation to patient age, sex, tumor subsite andgrading. 113 patients with colorectal tumors and 10 diverticulitis patients (controls) were randomly chosen for this study.Colorectal tissues were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCRand results were quantified by densitometry. Parametrical andnon-parametrical methods were used for statistical evaluation.In a multivariate factor analytical model, the number of factorswas chosen based on a scree plot of eigenvalues from thecorrelation matrix. Maximum likelihood and principal factormethods were used for generation of the initial factor matrix,which was rotated applying the varimax method. Expressionof the two splice variants of CYP24A1 was significantlyelevated in tumor tissues of all grades compared with that innormal mucosa ( p<0.001), though in moderately differentiated low-grade tumors (G1/2) from the left colon (LC) of femalepatients reduced levels of both splice variants occurred(p<0.05). While expression of CYP27B1 mRNA was also increased in tumors of all grades over that of normal mucosa,statistical significance was only reached in differentiated G1/2tumors primarily derived from male patients ( p<0.05). However, in female patients even high-grade (G3/4) tumorsexhibited increased CYP27B1 expression compared with G1/2tumors as long as they were derived from LC ( p<0.05), while VDR expression was lowest there ( p<0.05). Rectal tumor tissue, especially from females ( p<0.01), exhibited lowest CYP27B1 gene expression ( p<0.05) and a significant decrease of VDR expression during progression towards higher grades(p<0.05). Significant age-related expression changes were observed in male right colon (RC) tumors: Those graded G1/2displayed higher VDR levels with advanced age of patients(p<0.05), whereas in those graded G3/4 this correlation was inverse ( p<0.05). Compared with females, tumor resections from male patients expressed COX-2 mRNA at significantlyhigher p<0.05) especially in in G3/4 tumors ( p<0.05). of COX-2 expression was preserved in femalepatients ( p<0.01). Factor analysis of this evaluation indicated four mutually not exclusive patient or tumor types: i) old patients are female,ii) correlated VDR, CYP27B1, COX-2, and, to a lesser extent,wildtype in tumor tissue, iii) an increase ofCYP24 splice variants in undifferentiated tumors, and iv) asite-dependent expression in male patients.ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3222Collectively, our data confirm the concept of distinct expression patterns of the vitamin D system and of a markerfor inflammation in colorectal tumors, which are not onlyvariable during progression, but are also depending on factorslike tumor subsite, gender and age. 77 MUTUAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN AGE,GENDER, ANATOMICAL LOCATION ANDMALIGNANCY OF COLORECTAL CANCERS -RELATIONSHIP TO 1,25-DIHYDROXYVITAMIN 3 A-1030 Vienna, Austria We addressed the question whether age- and gender-related incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) at specific anatomicalsubsites is associated with different degrees of malignancy byanalyzing data from 107 patients presenting with colorectaltumors at a Vienna hospital in 2001/2002. Data were pooledaccording to anatomical subsites, i.e. proximal or right colon (cecum, ascending and colon(descending and sigmoid), and rectum. Parametrical and non-parametrical statistical methods were used for multivariateanalysis of associations between age, sex, tumor site andtumor grading. On the average, female CRC patients were significantly older than male patients (median age 73 vs. 63 yrs, p<0.05). The more advanced age of female cancer patients comparedwith males was primarily the result of age differences inproximal colon tumor patients ( p<0.05): Men presented at a median age of 60, whereas the women's median age was 75years. Male patients with high grade (G3+G4) cancers weresignificantly younger than those with low grade (G1+G2)lesions (71 vs. 59 years, p<0.01). This was not observed in women, whose median age, regardless whether they had lowor high grade cancers, was around 75 years. However, at age70-80 years more than 80% of patients with a G3 and G4cancer were female, and at age of 80 years, all high gradecancer patients were women. By contrast, at age 60 years andyounger, the majority, i.e. 67%, of G3 and G4 patients were men. No association was found between age and a specific anatomical sub-site in male high grade cancer patients,whereas female patients with proximal colon tumors weresignificantly older than women with rectal cancers ( p<0.05). Both men and women presented with high grade rectal cancersat the early mean age of slightly above 60 years.The observation that women are protected from highly malignant cancers in the proximal colon for a long period oftime, might be due to enhanced anti-proliferative potential of1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-OH 2D3). We found (Nittke et al., manuscript in preparation) that under cancer-promoting conditions, concentrations of 1,25-OH2D3in human and mouse colonic tissue were in general significantly higher infemales than in males, with values in the right colon exceedingthose at any other site of the colorectum. 78 EARLY MODIFICATION OF C-MYC, HA-RAS AND P53 Ember1and Z. Gy\u00f6ngyi1 1Institute Public str. 12, H-7643 P\u00e9cs; 2Institute of Otolaryngology Head Surgery, Faculty Medicine, University of P\u00e9cs, Munk\u00e1csy str. 2, H-7621P\u00e9cs; 5Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University R\u00f3kus str. 2, H-7623 (MNU) is pluripotent direct- acting carcinogen. Formation of MNU following incubationof various meats with additional nitrite under in vitro acidic conditions is possible. It is possible that many species,including humans, are exposed to carcinogenic MNU,generated in their gastrointestinal tract. Previously, an animalmodel was developed by our research group to investigate theexpression of three key onco/suppressor genes c-myc, Ha-ras and p53 as early molecular epidemiological biomarkers of carcinogenic exposure or carcinogenesis induced by DMBA(dimethylbenz[]anthracene). The aim of this study was toinvestigate the early effect of MNU on the gene expressionlevels, in order to compare the initializing role of these genesin MNU/DMBA-induced carcinogenesis. MNU is a direct-acting carcinogen which spontaneously and rapidly degrades,so any effect on the gene expression is observed within 24hours. Our results show the maximum effect in vivo on the gene expression at 12 hours after the MNU treatment; on theother hand, 24 hours after the treatment, the elevated geneexpressions decreased in target organs (bone marrow, lung,lymph nodes). Our results correspond to \"long-term\"experiments of the carcinogenic effect of MNU in differenttarget organs. Our findings suggest that MNU has an impactAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3223on the expression of c-myc, Ha-ras and p53genes in 12 hours, especially in bone marrow. This corresponds to the fact theDMBA has a delayed effect on the gene expression profile incomparison to MNU because DMBA is a metabolicallyactivated carcinogen. Overexpression of these genes occurs asan early biological effect to exposure to chemical carcinogens.According to our results, these genes could indicate MNUexposure and they could be the member of genes which takepart in MNU-induced tumorigenesis. 79 TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATOR, BRN-3B/POU4F2AND ITS BEHA OF BREAST CANCERCELLS Vishwanie Budhram-MahadeoMedical Molecular Biology Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford St, London WC1N 1EH, UK Regulation of gene expression controls all aspects of tumour growth, progression and response to treatment. By identifyingthe mechanisms that control such behaviour, it may be possibleto specifically target these tumours to reverse growth effects.The Brn-3b transcription factor is an important regulator ofgrowth in breast cancers and neuroblastomas because itcontrols expression of key target genes e.g. by transactivation of cyclinD1/CDK4, Brn-3b increases proliferation andanchorage independent growth in vitro , and tumour growth in vivo. Reducing Brn-3b reverses these growth effects. Brn-3b also confers drug resistance and may increase migratorypotential in these cells by its effects on other target genes e.g. HSP 27, and gamma catenin. Brn-3b is highly expressed in>60% breast cancers and ~75% of neuroblastomas so reducingBrn-3b may be a useful for reversing its effects in such cancers.We have identified mechanisms that control the expression ofBrn-3b in these cancer cells and that may be used to control itsexpression, under different conditions. 80 PACLITAXEL/CARBOPLATINUM + CETUXIMAB ASSECOND LINE CHEMOTHERAPY FOR PATIENTSWITH RECURRENT OR METASTATIC HEAD ANDNECK CANCER J. B\u00fcntzel 1, Stritzel4, GermanyBackground: In patients with platinum-resistant recurrent head and neck cancer the anti-EGF-receptor antibody cetuximabcould be used as a treatment option. There are only limiteddata about results of this therapeutic option. The objective ofthis study was to evaluate therapeutic benefit of this indication.Methods: Thirty-three patients with histological confirmed recurrent head and neck cancer (30 male, 3 female, mean agewas 59\u00b112 years) were included in this exploratory study. Allrecurrences had occurred after chemotherapy with platinumderivates. Thirty patients received radiation therapy duringprimary treatment. No surgical or radiotherapeutic option inrecurrent disease was possible. Fifteen patients were sufferingfrom local or locoregional recurrences; 18 patients had distantmetastasis (17 pulmonary and 1 cerebral). The 2nd-linetherapy consisted of carboplatinum (200 mg/m 2) + paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) every three weeks (week 1, 4, and 7) and additionally cetuximab, which was given with 400 mg/.Results : A significant tumor response was observed in 19/33 patients (56%): 13 partial, 5 minor and one completeremission were registered. The median survival time was 7months (range 1-14), 10 patients are still alive. Median timeto progression was 5 months (range 2-8). Side-effects wererash (21/33), fever (12/33) and typical chemotherapy-inducedtoxicities such as neuropathy (10/33) and (pan)cytopenia(7/33). All side-effects were moderate and easily managed.Conclusion: The described combined chemoimmuntherapy with cetuximab and paclitaxel + carboplatinum seems to in 2nd- and 3rd-line chemotherapy for patientswith platinum-resistant head and neck cancer, potentiallyovercoming primary platinum resistance. 81 MYC AND GASTRIC ADENOCARCINOMA CARCINOGENESIS: IN CEP 66075-900, Bel\u00e9m, PA, Brazil MYC is an oncogene that participates in cell cycle regulation, cell growth arrest, cell adhesion, metabolism, ribosomebiogenesis, protein synthesis, and mitochondrial function.MYC has been highlighted as a key element of several carcinogenesis processes in humans. Many studies reportedan association between MYC deregulation and gastric cancer. MYC deregulation is also observed in gastric preneoplasic lesion. Thus, MYC may be involved in the beginning of gastric carcinogenesis. Our results suggest that amplificationis the main mechanism of MYC deregulation in gastric cancer. In this review, we focus on oncogene MYCANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3224deregulation in gastric adenocarcinoma carcinogenesis, including its relation with Helicobacter pylori and clinical applications. 82 CHANGES IN POST-TRANSLATIONALMODIFICATIONS (O-LINKED GLYCOSYLATION)OF BREAST CANCER CAN Beatson, Joyce Joy Burchell Breast Cancer Biology Laboratory, Research Oncology,King's College London, 3rd Floor, Bermondsey Wing, Guy'sHospital, Great maze Pond, London SE1 9RT, UK Glycosylation is one of the most frequent forms of post translation modifications and is essential for many protein andcellular functions. Changes in the composition of glycansadded to glycoproteins and glycolipids are common events inmalignancy and these changes can influence the course of thedisease. Dramatic alterations occur in glycans attached toserine and threonines in mucin-type O-linkage and this hasbeen particularly studied in breast cancer. We have shown thatthis can be attributed, at least in part, to changes in theexpression of key glycosyltransferases involved in thesynthesis of O-glycans. Greater than 90% of breast carcinomas show changes in the expression of their O-linked glycan and this raises thehypothesis that altered O-linked glycans is advantageous forbreast cancer. That this is indeed the case is demonstrated byour data that show that transplantable and spontaneousmurine mammary tumours tumour-associated O-linked glycans grown significantly faster than the parentalcontrol. Interestingly, we have also shown that whenmonocyte derived dendritic cells are induced to mature andmigrate to the lymph nodes, the composition of their O-linkedglycans changes in a way that mirrors the change in breastcancer. Changes in glycans attached to the MUC1 glycoprotein, a membrane mucin that carries a large amount of O-linkedsugars, alters how this glycoprotein interacts with lectin-likereceptors of the immune system. Indeed, certain tumour-associated glycoforms of MUC1 can bind to the macrophagegalactose receptor and be internalised into antigen presentingcells, while a different tumour-associated glycoform can beimmunosuppressive. Thus changes in O-linked glycosylation can affect the behaviour of tumour cells and how tumours are recognised bythe immune system. Understanding the mechanisms thatinduce these changes may eventually lead to identifyingtargets for therapeutic interventions.83 ROLE OF HEDGEHOG SIGNALING IN PROSTATE CANCER Aubie Shaw Wade Bushman1,2,3 Laboratory for Cancer Research, 3Paul P. Carbone Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway contributes to prostate cancer growth and progression. Hh responses in tumors may arisefrom autocrine signaling in cancer cells or paracrineinteractions with stromal cells. The evidence for autocrine andparacrine signaling will be reviewed and we will then showusing a xenograft model that paracrine is sufficient to drivetumor growth. Paracrine Hh signaling occurs in embryonicprostate development and we used the developing prostate toidentify mesenchymal factors that are regulated by Hhsignaling. Using a xenograft model, we identified nine suchfactors that are aberrantly expressed in the stroma of Hh over-expressing tumors. Five of these factors correlate withHedgehog signaling in human prostate cancer but not inbenign tissue. In tumors with reactive stroma, each of the ninefactors correlate with Hh signaling. We conclude that changesin the prostate stroma associated with the presence of cancerresult in an altered transcriptional response to Hh ligands thatmimics the growth promoting actions of the fetalmesenchyme. 84 DIAGNOSTIC AND PROGNOSTIC V ALUE OF CD10IN 1NEUROFIBROMATOSIS AND MALIGNANTPERIPHERAL NERVE SHEATH TUMORS Daniela CabibiDepartment of Human Pathology, University of Palermo, Italy Neurofibromas are the most common benign peripheral tumors. They arise from the cutaneous and more rarely fromthe visceral, peripheral nerve sheath. In 90% of cases they aresolitary, sporadic, localized, superficial tumors which areusually benign, with a very low probability of becomingmalignant. In other cases they may be diffuse or plexiform andare frequently associated with Type 1 neurofibromatosis(NF1), with a higher risk of malignant transformation. NF1, also known as V on Recklinghausen's disease or peripheral neurofibromatosis, is the most common form ofneurofibromatosis, with an incidence of 1/2,500-3,000newborns (about 1.5 million people affected throughout theworld) and is one of the most frequent, progressive geneticdiseases, with serious medical and social consequences. It isAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3225transmitted in an autosomic dominant manner in about 50% of cases and is sporadic in the remaining cases due to newmutations (small deletions or puntiform mutations) on thegerminal cells of paternal origin, involving the NF1 gene, mapping on the long arm of the chromosome 17 (17q11.2).The NF1 gene is an oncosuppressor gene with a probability of mutations 10-100 times greater than the mean of the othergenes; it encodes neurofibromin, a protein that inhibits cellproliferation by modulating mitogenic pathway signalingthrough inactivation of p21-ras. Inactivating mutations of theNF1 gene, with the production of truncated, inactive protein, determines hyper-activation of p21 Ras and proliferation ofneoplastic cells. The clinical presentation of NF1 is not always clear since the onset of the clinical signs is age-dependent and there is astrong variability both among patients and in the same patientduring different stages of the disease, with no relation betweengenotype and phenotype. Due to the strong inter- and intra-familiar phenotypic variability and its different clinicalcourses, NF1 may sometimes require a long follow-up, lastingfor more than 4 years, before being diagnosed with certainty. The most serious risk of NF1 is the malignant transformation of neurofibromas (mainly diffuse andplexiform neurofibromas) into malignant peripheral nervesheath tumors (MPNSTs). These represent about 5-10% ofsoft tissue sarcomas and are extremely aggressive, with only34% of patients reaching a 5-year survival rate. Histologically,neurofibromas consist of Schwann cells, positive for S100immunostain, together with perineural cells and fibroblasts,which are CD34 positive, but S100 negative. The S100 protein is the most useful marker in the diagnosis of neurofibromas, but in some low-grade MPNSTs and inmore than 2/3 of high-grade MPNSTs, it is reduced or absent.Nestin and PGP9.5 are more sensitive markers than S100,although they are not specific since they are expressed in othermesenchymal neoplasias (1, 2). As it is extremely importantto reach a correct, early diagnosis, several markers have beeninvestigated with the aim of distinguishing benignneurofibromas from those with a greater malignant potentialand from MPNSTs. For example, malignant transformation ofneurofibromas has been associated with CDKN2A/p16inactivation and loss of p16 expression. P16 is an oncosuppressor gene involved in regulation byinhibiting CDK4, the cyclin D1-dependent kinase whichenhances the progression of the cell cycle by thephosphorylation of the Retinoblastoma protein. (3, 4).Furthermore, overexpression and mutations of P53 have been reported in high grade MPNST, but late appearance of themprecludes their use as predictive markers of malignancy (3, 5). Recently, the CD10 antigen, (also known as neutral endopeptidase (NEP), neprilisine or CALLA Antigen), firstidentified on the precursors of B and T lymphocytes, has beenfound in several hematopoietic neoplasia tumors, such as melanomas, gastric cancer andbreast cancer, a relation between CD10 expression and agreater potential of neoplastic invasiveness has been observed,probably related to the similarity of CD10 to the matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs) in creating a micro-environmentfacilitating neoplastic invasion (8, 11, 12). CD10 is normallyexpressed in breast myoepithelial cells, in kidney theliver, in mesenchymal dermal cells noteworthy, in the normal myelin sheath ofperipheral nerves (13). Nevertheless, CD10 expression inlesions arising from the peripheral nerve sheath has still notbeen sufficiently investigated. We retrospectively performed an immunohistochemical seriated sections from 38neoplastic lesions, 18 of which (Group A) consisted oflocalized, sporadic, solitary neurofibromas, and 20 (Group B)consisting of MPNSTs and of neurofibromas a higherrisk of malignant transformation (myxoid, plexiform, diffusewith atypias). In group B, 7 patients had a well-known historyof NF1, 3 had a relapse history, 2 had undergone the surgicalexcision of more than one neurofibroma and 3 were affectedby MPNSTs (one of whom developed pulmonary metastases ayear later). The group A lesions were smaller than the Group B lesions: group A mean diameter=0.84 cm (range 0.3-2 cm), 15/18(83%) had a diameter expression was significantly different in the two groups: In group A 13/18 cases (73%) stained negatively andonly a weak, focal CD10 positivity was present in 5/18 (27%);in group B, 19/20 cases (95%) stained positively for CD10;(p<0.0001, paired t-test). On the contrary, the immunohistochemical assay performed with S100 and CD34 showed no statistically significantdifference between the two groups: S100 stained positively inall of the group A cases and in 18/20 cases (90%) of the groupB cases (the two negative ones consisting of 2/3 MPNSTs).CD34 stained positively in 17/18 (94%) of group A cases andin 15/20 cases (75%) of group B cases. It is interesting to note that in a patient who underwent surgical removal of two neurofibromas, both were CD10positive and in one of them CD10 highlighted just theperipheral plexiform areas that were not onhaematoxylin-eosin staining. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3226Furthermore, in with primary cutaneous MPNST, there was positive staining both for S100 and CD10,nevertheless, pulmonary metastases observed one year laterlacked S100 expression but stained positively with CD10, justlike the primary tumor, suggesting for CD10 may be useful inthe diagnosis of metastatic MPNSTs, mainly when S100positivity has been lost. In conclusion, CD10 proved to be able to distinguish Group A lesions from Group B lesions, with 95% sensitivity and 72%specificity; it proved negative in benign, localizedneurofibromas and positive in higher risk lesions, in NF1 cases,in recurrent neurofibromas (as early as at the first removal), inMPNST and their metastases (including those negative forS100 and CD34). Moreover CD10-positive immunostainingwas related to the size of the lesions and was able to highlighthistological areas (myxoid, plexiform, atypical areas) withfeatures suggesting a greater risk of malignant potential. Asrecently evidenced in melanoma progression, theseobservations could be related to the synergetic increase of NEP gene transcription (the gene encoding CD10 antigen), togetherwith the co-expression of many genes involved in cellproliferation and cancerogenetic mechanisms, such as theMAP-kinase pathway, apopotosis and WNT signalinginhibition, hyper-expression of the proliferation marker Ki 67and so on (8, 14). It is not clear, however, if CD10 hyper-expression could have a causal role in these cancerogeneticevents or if it represents only an epiphenomenon of them, or ifthe synergetic gene over-expression observed in melanomasalso applies to neurofibromas. any case, whatever themechanism underlying CD10 over-expression, its diagnosticand predictive value cannot be ignored. Thus, although not specific because it is expressed in other neoplasias of different origin, prompt assessment of CD10 atthe first resection, together with S100, might help in thehistological diagnosis of NF1 and might allow a more correctmanagement of higher-risk CD10-positive cases, with a follow-up aimed at limiting any serious complications of NF1 by earlyidentification of any eventual malignant transformation.1 Campbell LK, Thomas JR and Lamps LW: Protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) is not a specific marker of neural andnerve sheath tumors: an Tsuzuki T and Kuroda M: Nestin expression as a new marker in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.Pathol Int 57(2) : 60-67, 2007. 3 Zhou H, Coffin CM and Perkins SL: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor: a comparison of grade, immuno-phenotype, and cell cycle/growth activation markerexpression in sporadic Am J Surg Pathol : 1337-1345, 2003.

Gray, JR, Thomas Prince, Jinrong Cheng, Mary Ann Stevenson and Stuart K. Calderwood Department of Radiation Oncology, Beth Israel DeaconessMedical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA02215, USA Members of the ninety kilodalton heat shock protein (HSP90) family are known to bind and stabilize intermediates in a widevariety of cell signaling pathways and contribute to theirAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3227dysregulation in cancer. An important intracellular co-factor for HSP90 is Cdc37, a protein with a broad role in fosteringthe activities of protein kinases. By targeting Cdc37 usingRNA interference approaches, we have shown that that loss ofCdc37 function induces irreversible growth arrest in androgenreceptor positive and negative prostate carcinoma cells andsensitizes such cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. In contrast toHSP90-directed agents, Cdc37 targeting appears to affectcancer cells through a distinct mechanism, and does notsignificantly deplete the intracellular levels of most knownHSP90 client proteins. Instead, Cdc37 depletion inhibitscellular kinase activity and flux through growth promotingsignal transduction cascades. We show that loss of Cdc37leads to reduced activity of the Erk, Akt, mTOR andandrogen-induced pathways. Cdc37 inactivation proved to bemore effective in inhibiting prostate carcinoma growth thanindividual tyrosine kinases, indicating the power of multi-target therapy involve of proteins essentialfor growth and inhibition of 17AAG-induced expression of theanti-apoptotic heat shock protein 70. Thus Cdc37 is essentialfor maintaining prostate tumor cell growth and may representa novel target in the search for multi-targeted therapies basedon the HSP90 chaperone system. 86 SAFETY 08024, Spain Purpose: To determine the feasibility and safety of treating 21 lung tumours with a multiple-tine electrode Boston Scientifics).Materials and Methods: Between January 2006 and July 2008, 17 patients (mean age 68 years, range 50-80) with 21pulmonary lesions (13 primitive non-small cell lung cancersand 8 metastases from corectal cancer) underwent the ablationprocedure. All the patients had absolute contraindications tosurgery. The method was performed under CT scan guidanceusing a expansible Le Veen needle electrode. groups were defined: i) \"Normal\" risk(NRG) (n=17 lesions) with adequate respiratory reserve (n=9)or insuficient respiratory reserve (n=8). ii) High risk group(HRG) (patients with domitialiry O 2-therapy n=2 patients or patients with previous lobectomy n=2). To evaluate results andcomplications, the SIR reporting standards for image-guidedtumour ablation were followed. Results: 5 complications were detected (23% of the procediments) Only 2 patients in theNRG presented complications (11.7%) meanwhilecomplications were appreciated in 3 patients of the HRG(75%). Main complications were: NRG 1 case with 1 case with secondary stroke; HRG 2pneumothorax, both needing drainage and 1 infection.Treatment was completed in all the cases and no deaths wererelated with the procedure. A initial complete ablation wasobtained in 21 of the 21 tumours (100%). Mean follow-up is17 months (range 4-31). 85% of the patients are alive and 69%free of disease. 1 patients died due to tumour progression, anda patient died due to ARI. Conclusion: RF is an efficient method to treat patients with \"non-surgical\" lung tumours(both primary or secondary lesions). The procedure is, ingeneral, well tolerated with a low incidence of severecomplications. Good results in terms of local tumour controlwere received in our short-term follow up-evaluation. 87 PRO AND CONS FOR Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Charit\u00e9, University Medicine of Berlin, Germany Up-front maximal surgical effort at cytoreduction with the goal of no residual disease is necessary for a better outcome.Systematic resection of para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes isnow over decades part of the surgical procedure. In early stageovarian cancer the goal of the lymphadenectomy as a key partof surgical staging is accepted. Controversies remain on thevalue of systematic lymphadenectomy in patients withadvanced ovarian cancer. The effect of lymph node dissectionon progression free survival and overall survival in patientswith advanced ovarian cancer is unknown. In patients withresidual tumor, there is no indication for systematic lymphnode dissection. To date there is no randomised studycomparing systematic lymphadenectomy versus nolymphadenectomy in patients with no residual tumor. TheLymphadenectomy In Ovarian Neoplasms (LION) studyaddress this Question and will be discussed. Furthermore, thetechniques ( e.g. sampling and systematic lymh node dissection), the indication as well as the pros and cons ofpelvic and paraaortal lymph node dissection in early andadvanced stage based on the available evidence, will bediscussed. ANTICANCER 28: 3157-3556 Campanella1, D. Corona2, M. 4University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, Centre of Marine Biotechnology, Baltimore, MD, USA Heat-shock proteins (Hsps) are often overexpressed during carcinogenesis and recent studies show that when expressedextracellularly, Hsps can mediate anticancer immune responses(1-3). However, the mechanisms by which Hsps are releasedfrom tumor cells into the extracellular space are not fullyunderstood. We are investigating the pathways involved in Hspsrelease, including the Golgi-mediated and the exosomal andlipid-rafts pathways. For the present study, we examined NCI-H292 (mucoepidermoid carcinoma) and 16HBE (normalbronchial epithelial) cells. Both cell lines show normally lowlevels of apoptosis (annexin V assessment), while NCI-H292cells present higher levels of Hsp60 and Hsp70 than 16HBEcells. Cells were therefore treated for 1 h with secretioninhibitors: Brefeldin A (BFA, dialyzed, lyophilized andresuspended in RIPA buffer; whole cell Exosomes were separated from the surnatants byultracentrifugation (2 h at 110,000\u00d7 g). Released exosomes were quantified by measuring the activity of acetylcholineesterase. Hsp expressions in various cellular compartmentswere detected by Western blotting with anti-Hsp60 and anti-Hsp70 monoclonal antibodies. We found Hsp60 and Hsp70[the latter is considered an exosomal marker (4)] in theexosomal fractions of the NCI-H292 cells, but only indicating secretory route this protein is throughexosomes. Elucidation of the secretory pathways for Hsp60 andother Hsps is fundamental in understanding their role inantitumor immune responses and in tumor survival, as well asspread mechanisms that may represent a novel target fortreatment (5).1 DR and Calderwood Sci 31: Cappello F et al: Cancer Biol Ther 7, in press, 2008. 4 Johnstone RM.

Lo Iacono1, of Marine Biotechnology, University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, Baltimore, MD, USA Hsp10 expression has been investigated in several cancer models, with contrasting results. It is homologue to earlypregnancy factor (EPF), a secreted protein which modulatesthe immune response of the mother versus the fetus. The impact of cigarette smoke (a major risk factor for lungdiseases) on Hsp10 expression by airway cells has not beencharacterized yet. In this work we studied the effects of non-lethal doses of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on the expression of Hsp60 andHsp10 in human lung cells. Proteomics was carried out by 2D-IPG, silver stain, Western blotting, and mass-spectrometry(MS). Database searches and chaperonomics were used toidentify the proteins and genes of interest. Following CSE cell exposure as compared with unstressed cells, significant variations in Hsp10 did occur, in both lungfibroblasts and epithelial cells. In unstressed cells, threeisoelectric variants of Hsp10 were found, which have not beenreported for any other system, yet. After CSE exposure, onlythe most basic isoform was still expressed. To characterize thethree variants found in unstressed cells, we performed MSanalyses. Digested spots were analysed by nano-RP-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS to determine the fragments' amino acidsequences. Database searches showed that the most basicvariant was human Hsp10 with 56% sequence coverage, andthe other two isoforms had the same amino acid sequence,even if with a lower sequence coverage. The data thus far indicate probably that Hsp10 protein variants are due to post-translational modifications. We recentlyshowed the in vivo correlation between lung cancer development and down-regulation of Hsp10 expression (1), andAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3229proposed a model for the antitumoral role for Hsp10, together with Hsp60 (2). The precise role of Hsp10 in carcinogenesis isstill unclear. The immunosuppressive activity a tumor-promoting role, mediating immuneevasion and apoptosis resistance. On the other hand, the in vivo and in vitro evidences obtained in human lung models suggest that different Hsp10 isoforms may mediate diverse processesand should be differentially Ther, 90 HUMAN INHIBITION Matthew interest in histone deacetylases (HDACs) has grown in the last few years following discoveries that aberrantepigenetics associated with cancer involve the over-recruitment of HDACs, and that over-expression of HDACs islinked with various cancers. Consequently, HDACs havebecome appealing targets for the development of anticanceragents. One compound, V orinostat (suberoylanilidehydroxamic acid, SAHA), has been approved for thetreatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. More recently,HDACs inhibitors have been shown to be effective both in vitro and in vivo as anti-inflammatory agents and in the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy. Here we describe the structure of the catalytic domain of a class IIa histone deacetylase, human HDAC4, in bothinhibitor-bound and compare it with aclass I enzyme, HDAC8. The structures and accompanyingbiochemical data explain enzymatic activityof class IIa HDACs towards acetylated lysines basis for the design of class-specific HDACinhibitors. Finally, the structure of the HDAC4 catalyticdomain reveals a conformationally flexible structural zinc-binding domain conserved only in the class IIa HDACs.Biochemical and functional data suggest that this domain iscritical for HDAC4 function and for its association withpartner proteins in repressor complexes. 91 EGFR-FAMILY EXPRESSION AND IMPLICATIONSFOR TARGETED RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY J. Carlsson Biomedical Radiation Sciences, Uppsala University, SE- 75185, Uppsala, SwedenHigh expression in the primary tumor of receptors in the EGFR-family is most often also accompanied by a similarhigh expression in corresponding metastases. This makesthese receptors interesting as putative targets for targetedradionuclide therapy of metastases and disseminated tumorcells. The expression of all four family members, EGFR,HER2, HER3 and HER4 is reviewed in this chapter. Studieson breast, urinary bladder, colorectal, prostate, head and neck,esophageal and glioma tumors are described and possiblestrategies for targeted radionuclide therapy are discussed.Quantification of receptor expression and the possibleinfluence of genomic stability on the expression are alsodiscussed. 92 EFFECTS OF LOW DOSE-RATE RADIATION ONCELLULAR SURVIV AL J. Carlsson Biomedical Radiation Sciences, Uppsala University, SE- 75185, Uppsala, Sweden The experience of external radiotherapy can only to a limited extent be used to understand therapeutic effects ofradionuclide therapy. A major difference is that the dose-rateat radionuclide therapy is at least two orders of magnitudelower. Part of this chapter deals with estimates of thenecessary dose-rate and exposure time in combination inorder to deliver therapeutic effects to tumour cells. It isproposed that combinations of about 0.1-0.2 Gy/h for severaldays or about 1 Gy/h for at least 1 day is necessary. Suchdose-rates can be achieved with the help of cross fireradiation. Effects of radionuclide therapy in terms ofapoptosis, cell-cycle blocks and hyperradiosensitivity arealso discussed. 93 ROLE OF LESION BYPASS BY DNA POLYMERASEETA, AND PIK KINASE SIGNALLING, IN S\u00e9verine Cruet-Hennequart, Sangamitra Villalan, Elaine O'Meara and Michael P.

Targeting pathwaysANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3230used by cells to overcome DNA damage is one approach to increasing the effectiveness of these anticancer agents. Thecapacity of cells to carry out replication of damaged DNA,using the process of translesion synthesis (TLS), is onemechanism by which cells can tolerate DNA damage. TheDNA damage response (DDR) activated by damage-induced replication arrest plays a key role in determiningthe response of human cells to DNA damage. Activation ofthe DDR is mediated in part by phosphorylation phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-related The relationship between TLS and PIKK signalling in the response of human cell lines to cisplatin and carboplatinwas investigated. Human XP30RO fibroblasts that lack theTLS enzyme DNA polymerase (pol) as a result of amutation in the POLH gene are more sensitive than normal GM00637 fibroblasts to cisplatin, oxaliplatin andcarboplatin. To characterise the influence of cell cycle phaseon the outcome of exposure to platinum-based drugs, pol-deficient XP30RO cells were synchronised in mitosis bytreatment with nocodazole, and released for varying periodsto generate cell populations in M-, G1-, or S-phase. Cells ineach phase were treated with equitoxic doses of cisplatin(1.66 M) or carboplatin (50 M). In XP30RO cells, drugtreatment led to delayed S-phase progression, and arrest inthe G2 phase of the cell cycle. Resumption of cell cycleprogression was delayed in cells treated with carboplatincompared to cisplatin-treated cells. In pol-deficient cells,platinum-induced DNA damage led the ATR, ATM ATR, ATM and DNA-PK respectively, asdetermined using a series of small molecule inhibitors ofindividual PIK kinases. To define the sequence of events activation, the kinetics of phosphorylation of RPA2 on serines 4/8 wereexamined by carboplatin. Comparison of RPA2 phosphorylation inresponse to the two platinum agents with their effects oncell cycle progression indicated that RPA2hyperphosphorylation on serines 4/8 correlated withresumption of cell cycle drug-inducedreplication arrest in pol-deficient cells. Elucidation of theprecise sequence of events that occur in response to DNAdamage by cisplatin and carboplatin may help identify keyDDR pathways that can be targeted to potentiate the effects of these cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. 94 IMBALANCE BETWEEN SYNTHETIC LOAD ANDPROTEASOMAL CAPACITY SENSITIZES NORMALAND MALIGNANT PLASMA CELLS of Veterinary Medicine, University of Turin, via L. da Vinci 44, 10095 Grugliasco (TO); 2Department of Biology and Technology, Olgettina 58, 20132 Milano,Italy; 3Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber 44 Binney Street, Boston,MA 02115, USA Introduction: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an aggressive, debilitating and still incurable hematological malignancy,arising from clonal expansion of plasma cells at multiplesites in the bone marrow. Recently, MM proved sensitive toa new class of drugs, proteasome inhibitors (PI), but themechanisms of action and bases of individual susceptibilityremain still largely unclear. Obviously, their clarificationwould improve the clinical application of PI, and opennovel therapeutic strategies. Recent work linked PIsensitivity to protein synthesis and proteasome activity (1-3), raising the question whether different levels ofproteasome expression and workload underlie PI sensitivityin normal and transformed plasma cells. Results: To test this hypothesis we first adopted different models of mouseB cell activation in vivo , and observed that following polyclonal activation, proteasome activity decreases evenmore than previously reported in vitro . This decrease is linked to enhanced apoptosis after treatment with the first-in-class anti-myeloma titres in T-dependent and -independent mouse immunization models, thereforeproviding the rationale for limiting the activity of Ab-secreting cells in vivo by impacting proteasome function. Next, to asses whether the exquisite sensitivity of certainMM cells (MMC) to PI is also due to an imbalancebetween limited proteasome capacity and high workloaddue to intense protein production, we directly assessedprotein degradation by proteasomes using radioactivemetabolic labeling and pulse-chase assays in two humanMM cell lines - U266 and MM.1S - that display adifferential apoptotic sensitivity to bortezomib. These twoAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3231lines reveal a striking direct correlation between the degradative flux of proteins through proteasomes and theapoptotic response to bortezomib. In particular, proteasomaldegradation within 30 minutes of chase is almost 20 timeshigher in MM.1S, the far more sensitive line, indicatingthat these cells are intensively degrading short-lived proteinspecies through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Paradoxically, cell extracts from show 2.5times lower proteasomal activity than U266 cells,suggesting a decreased pool of proteasomes as compared tothe resistant line. In this scenario, accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins and the accompanying decrease offree ubiquitin reveal proteasome stress in PI-sensitiveMMC. Finally, to establish cause-effect relationships, wemanipulated proteasome workload, by means of ERstressors, and proteasome capacity, via treatment with rapidly reversible PI, achieving profound alterations of PIsensitivity. Altogether, our data demonstrate that thebalance between proteasome workload and degradativecapacity represents a critical determinant of apoptoticsensitivity of MMC to PI, providing both a novel predictivetool of potential prognostic value and the framework fornovel Cenci al: Res 67: 1783-1792, 2007.

However, only in the last decade thisparticular mode of steroid action has been explored in depth.RSA trigger a number of very rapid effects, including ionmovement, signaling cascade activation, leading to specificsubsequent gene activation, cytoskeletal changes and secretion.The nature of steroid membrane binding sites remainscontroversary. The most compelling theories integrate theexistence of either new (possibly G-protein-coupled), orclassical steroid receptors, docked to the plasma membranethrough post-transcriptional modifications (palmitoylation). Inbreast and prostate cancer, specific binding of estrogen andandrogen has been identified in tumors, but not in theperitumoral non-cancerous tissue. Activation of these sites,through non-permeable steroid (2008) 3232(estrogen) or apoptosis (androgen). In latter specific signaling molecules mediate actin cytoskeleton reorganization,while a potentiation of cytoskeleton acting drugs is found in vitro and in vivo . Interestingly, in the same tissues, membrane-acting steroids interact with growth factors (EGF).We have also identified an interaction of these steroids withthe system EPO-EPOR, promoting cell survival, through aspecific signaling cascade switch. Additionally, steroids affectthe transcription of EPOR gene, interacting on the EPORpromoter, suggesting a potential drawback of a concomitantEPO-aromatase inhibitor administration. The abovecharacteristics make membrane steroid receptor agonists a newtherapeutic target in breast and prostate neoplasia. 97 A NEW PARADIGM IN RECEPTOR TYROSINEKINASE REGULATION AND ITS IMPLICATIONSFOR CANCER PROGRESSION Ugo CavallaroIFOM-IEO Campus, Via Adamello 16, Italy Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane glycoproteins that control a variety of cellular functions. Thederegulated expression and/or activity of RTKs leads todifferent pathological conditions, with cancer being aprominent example. The stimulation of RTK-mediated signalling is classically triggered by the binding of soluble ligands, best exemplifiedby polypeptide growth factors. Other membrane proteins, suchas adhesion molecules, are thought to exert a regulatoryfunction on RTK activity by modulating their localizationand/or their response to ligands. We have recently obtained evidence that instead assign a more direct role to adhesion molecules in controlling RTKfunction. Indeed, working on specific adhesion molecules ofthe immunoglobulin superfamily (Ig-CAMs), wedemonstrated their activity receptor (FGFR), a prototypical RTK.On one hand, Ig-CAMs interefere with of toFGFR, thus repressing FGF-induced cellular response(Francavilla et al. , 2007). On the other hand, Ig-CAMs themselves bind to and activate FGFR, emerging as novel,unconventional RTK ligands. It is intriguing that Ig-CAMsand FGF stimulate divergent signalling cascades downstreamof FGFR, implying differential mechanism of FGFRactivation. Finally, our data implicate this novel interplay between adhesion molecules and FGFR in specific events associatedwith tumor progression, in particular in ovarian carcinoma.These findings offer a solid rationale to explore the feasibilityof targeting the Ig-CAM/FGFR crosstalk as a novel approachto TUMOURS: Ljubljana, Veterinary Faculty, Clinic for Small Animal Medicine and Surgery, Cesta v mestni log 47, SI-1000Ljubljana; 3University of Medicine, Korytkova 2, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is a novel local tumour treatment that combines administration of chemotherapeutic drugs,cisplatin or bleomycin with application of electric pulses tothe tumour. It is based on the local application of short andintense electric pulses to the cells or tissues that makes the cellmembrane transiently permeable and thus allow influx offoreign molecules from extracellular space into the cytoplasm.The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness ofelectrochemotherapy (ECT) with cisplatin and to compare itwith effectiveness of surgery of mast cell tumours (MCT) indogs. In the present retrospective study, between January 2002 and August 2004, 25 dogs of different breeds with MCT wereincluded into the study. The dogs were divided in twotreatment groups, surgery (16 dogs with 16 tumours) and thosewhose owners refused surgery being included in an ECTgroup (9 dogs with 12 tumours). ECT was performed byintratumoral injection of cisplatin (1 mg/cm 3tumour) and 1-2 min thereafter exposed to electric pulses (8 electric pulses of100 s pulse duration, amplitude to electrode distance ratio1300 V/cm and frequency 1 Hz) were by anelectric pulses generator (Jouan GHT 1287) and deliveredthrough two parallel stainless steel electrodes with an innerdistance between them of 7 mm. Response rate and durationof response to the treatment were evaluated and comparisonbetween groups was made. The clinical stages of the tumours were stage I in 4 (45%) and stage III in 5 (55%) in dogs treated by ECT, 12 (75%) dogstreated by surgery were stage I and 4 (25%) dogs were inclinical stage III. Median size of the tumours treated by surgerywas 5.2 cm 3and 2.9 cm3of tumours treated by ECT. ECT resulted in comparable antitumour effectiveness as surgicaltreatment. In 8/16 dogs that were surgically treated, tumoursrecurred after 0.7 to 22.5 months, while tumour recurrence wasobtained only in 2/9 dogs treated by ECT (2 and 8 months). ECT is an easy, highly effective, and well tolerated treatment of MCT. It can be an alternative treatment tosurgery, especially for small nodules in which the completeresponse with long duration can be obtained.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 323399 PREDICTION OF IN Vilnius, Lithuania Various parameters of the immune system have been studied in an attempt to predict clinical response to immunotherapy,mostly in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Theseparameters include profile of peripheral blood lymphocytesubsets, circulating monocytes and neutrophils, blood naturalkiller cell function, T-cell types and quantities oftumour infiltrating lymphocytes and serum autoantibodies. Despite observed discrepancies between immunological response to therapy and clinical outcome, the followingconclusions can be drawn from the literature. Firstly, in vivo numbers and/or proportions of cells of the immune systemseem to better correlate with clinical outcome than theirfunction in vitro . Secondly, types and quantities of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes may have predictive value forimmunotherapy, but probably do not have an advantage overperipheral blood lymphocyte subsets. Thirdly, development ofautoimmunity, as measured by the increase in serumautoantibodies, correlates with positive outcome ofimmunotherapy, but does not help to select patients for thistype of treatment. A biomarker that would strongly predict the response in cancer immunotherapy remains desirable. Theoreticalconsiderations and clinical evidence suggest that the mostimportant prerequisite of antitumour immune response is theproliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Clonal expansion ofCD8+ T lymphocytes is associated with the loss of co-stimulatory molecule CD28 and acquisition of CD57 antigen.Thus, expression of antigen on CD8+ T lymphocytesmay indicate the \"proliferative history\" of these cells. Thepositive relationship between CD8+CD57+ T lymphocyteexpansions and survival has been observed in leukaemia andmultiple myeloma. In solid tumours, this lymphocyte subsethas not yet received much attention. Our recent results suggestthat high risk melanoma patients with low (<23% in CD8+subset) pre-treatment levels T lymphocytesmay benefit from adjuvant interferon-. Interferon- probablyacts by increasing the numbers of these lymphocytes earlyduring treatment. In contrast to our results with melanoma, benefit of interferon- treatment in renal cell carcinoma is limited topatients with high (>30% in CD8+ subset) levels ofCD8+CD57+ T lymphocytes. This contradiction may beexplained by the fact that the expression of CD57 antigen byCD8+ T lymphocytes has been associated not only withcytotoxic potential, but also with an immunosuppressiveeffect. Further studies are needed to determine more precisely the predictive value of CD8+CD57+ T lymphocytes in cancerimmunotherapy. 100 THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OFCOLLABORATION BETWEEN DISCIPLINES INCANCER Konstantinos CharalabopoulosDepartment of Physiology, Clinical Unit, Medical Faculty, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece Recent advances in understanding malignant disease have been dominated by creation of genetic models. Many humanneoplasms develop through genetic and epigenetic alterationsof oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. The accumulationof various molecular alterations is a multistep process, whichleads to carcinogenesis. The most studied model ofcarcinogenesis is colorectal carcinoma. With the advent ofendoscopic techniques, it became possible to excise lesions inall stages of colon cancer development. Pathologists havedescribed specific morphological features for each step andmolecular studies have defined the corresponding geneticalterations. This close collaboration enabled the creation of themulti-step model of carcinogenesis. Another example is human breast cancer. In this model, each step of tumour progression correlates with one or moredistinct mutations in major regulatory genes. Furthermore,recently, molecular studies have determined specific sets ofgenes, whose expression is correlated with survival and riskof recurrence. Again, pathologists are closely collaboratingwith clinicians and basic scientists in order to optimize thecharacterization of the disease. 101 IMPLICATIONS OF INTRANUCLEAR ORDER ONDIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY OF GENETICDISORDERS Jyoti P. Chaudhuri Liliana Li Song and John R. McGill Genzyme Genetics, 4310 E. Cotton Center Blvd, Suite 120, Phoenix, AZ 85040, USA Cytogenetic and genetic observations indicate the existence of intranuclear order (1-3). The first level of order is the genomicintegrity - maternal and paternal chromosomes comprise twoexclusive groups, each controlled by one of the two centriolesof a diploid cell (4). At the second level the chromosomes ofa genome generally maintain some spatial order (5). A selection of our new data from metaphase and interphase cells of specimens of cancer cases using GTG-banding andANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: trisomies, polyploidies etcwill be presented as an additional support to the aforesaid orders of chromosomes. Profound implications of these observations on diagnosis and therapy procedures will be discussed to define therationale of more realistic and realizable protocols ofpersonalized medicine with further aim towards the target genetherapy.1 Ashley T and Pocock N: Genetics 55: 161, 1981. 2 Chaudhuri JP et al: Cellular Oncol 27: 327, 2005. 3 Kmita M and Duboule D: Science 301: 331, 2003. 4 Chaudhuri JP and Walther JU: Int J Oncol 23: 1257, 5 al: Genet 15 s1: 2007. 102 M.

TNF also exertsproliferation by p38 activation, or when TRAF-2simultaneously induces the transcription factor NF- B by NIK. NIK and p38 may also be activated by IL-1. P38activated several transcription factors such as Elk-1, ATF-2and NF-B. NIK also may activate NF- B. The aim of this study was to elucidate the possible involvement of thistransduction pathway in prostate cancer development and itsrole in the breakdown of the apoptosis-proliferationequilibrium. Methods: Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses were performed in 20 samples of normal prostates,35 samples of BPH, and 93 samples of PC (low, medium orhigh Gleason grades). Results: 60%, JNK,and NIK (respectively) and immunoreaction were of epithelial cells. Immunoreaction to p38 (18%) inNP was found in the nucleus of epithelial cell. The samelocation was observed in PC to TRAF-2 and NIK. Noimmunoreaction to JNK was found in PC samples. To TRAF-2, percentages of positive patient samples decreased with the malignancy, but the immunoreaction intensity was increasedin PC (no differences were found between Gleason groups).For NIK, percentages and optical density were higher in PCsamples, but no differences were observed between the threeGleason groups. P-p38 was found with cytoplasmic andnuclear location in the 89% of PC samples. Conclusion: In PC we sugget that TNF-/AP-1 pathway is probably inactivatedby other factors such as p21 (at ASK-1 level), or bcl-2 (at JNKlevel) whereas proliferation and/or apoptosis inhibitionpathways mediate by NIK and p38 might be activated. P38and NIK activate different transcription factors related withcell proliferation and survival such as ATF-2, Elk-1 or NF- B. This activation increased in patient with high Gleason score.Additional fundamental research with these different pathwaymembers and their correlation with clinical experimentationwill be required in the field of prostate cancer.

Nuclear inmmunostaining was only observed for NF- B (p50 and p65), only in PC and independently of Gleason grade.Conclusion: We concluded that NF- B (p50 and p65) enhances cell proliferation, but also several transcriptionfactors, such as ATF-2 or Elk-1. In this way, several multipletransduction pathways may be involved in the uncontrolledapoptosis/cell proliferation balance. Since another studycarried out on the same patients revealed thatimmunoexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 or TNF, increased in PC, inhibition of these cytokinesmight be a possible target for PC treatment, because suchinhibition could decrease the activity of all transductionpathway members that activate transcription factors such asNF-B, Elk-1 or ATF-2.

This study is to identify and isolate activeanticancer components from the mushroom. A bioassay-guided fractionation was used to identify and purify active agents from the mushroom. Twenty differentfractions were isolated from the mushroom and their in vitro anticancer activity was tested against EL 4, MCF7and PC3 cancer cell lines with a standard high-flux anticancer-drugscreening method. Two triterpenes (fasciculol C and fasciculic acid B) were identified and isolated from the apolar fractions of the mushroomextract with IC 50against 60.5 g/ml. A polar fraction of the mushroom extract exhibits more potent in vitro anticancer activity than the two triterpenes with g/ml. The active constituents have not been identifiedyet. The results illustrate that Hypholoma fasciculare has a potent in vitro anticancer activity and the active agents isolated from the mushroom could be used as a starting point fordeveloping of anticancer agents. 105 ANTICANCER ACTIVITIES OF DIFFERENT TEAS Lin Zhai, Ming Chen and Arsalan Kharazmi Department of Clinical Microbiology, 7602, University Hospital of Copenhagen (Rigshospitalet), Tagensvej 20,Copenhagen, DK-2200 N, Denmark There are many reports on the anticancer activity of green tea in the recent years. In this study, we have investigated the in vitro anticancer activity of other teas, including 25 different Chinese teas, which belong to five different tea groups(fermentation tea, non-fermentation tea, half-fermentation tea,flower tea, and white tea), and four European teas, and onecoffee. Water extractions of the teas and coffee were made and were sterile filtered through a 0.22-m-pore-size Milliporefilter. The in vitro anticancer activity of these tea water extractions have been tested against three different cancer celllines, EL 4(leukemic cell line), MCF7 (human breast cancer cell line), and PC3 (human prostate cancer cell line). McCoy cell (mouse fibroblasts cell line) has been used as a non-cancercell control. A standard assay (sulforhodamine B stainingmethod) for anticancer-drug screening recommended byNational Cancer Institute has been employed for the study. The results show that most of tested teas exhibit potent inhibitory activity on the in vitro growth of the three tested cancer cell lines. The anticancer activity of non-fermentationtea, half-fermentation tea, and white tea are stronger than otherteas. Among three tested Jasmine teas, one of them has muchstronger anticancer activity than other two, which indicatesthat where tea grow and the way of tea preparation may playan important role, too. Water extraction of coffee also shows aslight inhibitory effect on EL 4cell, but no effect on other two cancer cells. The anticancer activity of teas is significantlystronger than that of coffee. Preliminary toxicity studies show the tested teas have no toxicity on the human mononuclear cells at the concentration16 times higher than the IC 50against EL4cell. The in vitro inhibitory effect of the tested teas on a mouse fibroblasts cellline, McCoy, is also at least four times less than that on EL 4 cell. Our data indicate that other teas have also potent anticancer activity. Since tea is a very popular beverage, further study onidentifying and isolating active components from these teasand study on mechanism of action are necessary. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3236106 CRUDE EXTRACT OF INDUCES HUMAN A549 LUNG CANCER CELLDEATH THROUGH 2Department of Pharmacology, and 3College of Pharmacy, China Medical University, 91 Hsueh-Shih Road, Taichung,40402, Taiwan; 4Department of Pharmacy, China Medical University Hospital, 2 Taichung, 40402 Taiwan, ROC Background: Desmodium gangeticum , Leguminosae, has been widely used as a traditional herb in Taiwan and other countries.In past decades, it has been reported to have anti-inflammatoryactivity in carrageenan-induced inflamed rats, and to potential histamine induced gastric ulcer in rats andpigs. In this study, we explored its anti-nociceptive andantitumor activities in lung cancer cells. Methods: As an in vivo test, the formalin-induced nociceptive behavior was employed.In vitro , the growth of various various bacteria was evaluated. The MTT viability assay was used for the evaluation of growthinhibition in In lung cancer cells. Flow cytometric analysis andWestern blot were used to detect the cell cycle arrest andapoptosis in Desmodium gangeticum treated lung cancer cells. Results: In this preliminary study, Desmodium gangeticum inhibited the biting and licking behavior induced by formalin ina dose-dependent manner. Additionally, it was shown thatDesmodium gangeticum could completely inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas and partly that of E. coli at higher concentrations. However, it had no effective on the Klebsiellaspecies. Additionally, Desmodium gangeticum dose- dependently inhibited cell viability and induced G 1phase arrest with down-regulation of cyclin A and B1, and ofP21, cells. Conclusion: Desmodium gangeticum exhibited anti-nociceptive and anti-bacterial effects. It also inhibited cell viability and induced cell cycle arrest inG 1phase in lung cancer cells. 107 UROTHELIAL ORIGIN OF CLEAR CELLADENOCARCINOMA OF THE URINARY BLADDER Liang Cheng 1, Ming-Tse Pathology University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA; 2Department of Pathology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital- Kaohsiung Medical Center, Chang Gung University Collegeof Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, ROC; 3Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA; 4Department of Pathology, Cordoba University, Cordoba, Spain; 5Institute of Pathological Anatomy and Histopathology, School of Medicine, Polytechnic University of the MarcheRegion (Ancona), United Hospitals, Ancona, Italy; 6Department of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore Clear cell adenocarcinoma in the urinary tract is an extremely rare neoplasm predominantly occurring in adult females, andmorphologically identical to tumors of the same name that arisein female genital organs. Its precise histogenesis has remainedcontroversial. We analyzed molecular genetic evaluation byfluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and X-chromosome inactivation with conventional morphological and immuno-histochemical analyses in 12 patients with clear celladenocarcinomas in the urinary tract. Concurrent urothelialcarcinoma or urothelial carcinoma in situ were present in 6 cases (50%) and foci of cystitis glandularis were observed in 4cases (33%). Neither intestinal metaplasia Cytoplasmic expressionof racemase (AMACR) was demonstrablein (83%). Moderate to diffuse immunostainingfor CK7 was identified in all 12 tumors (100%), whereas only3 of 12 (25%) tumors showed positive immunostaining forCK20. Focal uroplakin III staining was seen in 6 of 12 tumors(50%). In 5 cases (42%), focal to moderate CD10immunoreactivity was observed. Immunostains for OCT4 andCDX-2 were completely negative in all tumors. In UroVysionFISH assays, all tumors displayed chromosomal alterationssimilar to those commonly in urothelial carcinoma.Identical patterns X-chromosome inactivation inconcurrent clear cell adenocarcinoma and urothelial neoplasiawere identified in two informative female cases. Our datasupport an urothelial origin for most clear cell adenocarcinomasof the urinary tract, despite their morphologic resemblance tocertain M\u00fcllerian-derived tumors of the female genital tract. 108 SCHWANNOMA OF THE KIDNEY: ACLINICOPATHOLOGICAL ANDIMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS N. Eble1 1Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, USA; 2Dipartimento di Patologia, Universit\u00e1 di Verona, Verona, Italy; the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 32373Department of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY , USA Schwannomas of the kidney are rare, with only a few reported cases. We report three additional cases withimmunohistochemical analysis. All three tumors were fromfemales (aged 27, 35, and 59 years) and ranged from 4.8 to8 cm in diameter. All of the patients underwentnephrectomy. The tumors were totally or partiallyencapsulated; two were in the hilum and one was centeredin the renal cortex. All tumors were diffusely positive for S-100 protein. Two were positive for neuron-specific CD10 were negative. Follow-updata available for two patients; neither had tumorrecurrence or metastasis. In conclusion, renal schwannomais rare, usually arises centrally, impinging on the hilum orthe pelvis and is cured by resection. Sarcomatoid carcinomaand other spindle cell tumors should be considered in thedifferential diagnosis. 109 RENAL CELL CARCINOMAS WITH PAPILLARY ARCHITECTURE AND CLEAR CELLCOMPONENTS: DIAGNOSTIC UTILITY OFCYTOGENETICAL ANALYSES Liang Cheng 1, Stefano Gobbo1,4, N. Eble1 1Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis,Indiana; 2Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio; 3Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; 4Dipartimento di Patologia, Universit\u00e1 di Verona, Verona, Italy Although histological features enable an accurate diagnosis in most renal carcinomas, overlapping morphologic findingsbetween some renal neoplasms make subclassificationdifficult. Some renal carcinomas show papillary architecturebut are composed extensively of cells with clear cytoplasm,and it is unclear whether they should be classified as clearcell renal cell carcinomas or papillary renal cell carcinomas.We analysed the immunohistochemical profiles and thecytogenetic patterns of fourteen renal carcinomas showingpapillary architecture in which there were variable amountsof cells with clear cytoplasm. The patients were eight womenand six men (mean age: 54 years). Immunohistochemistryand fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis distinguished two different groups. The first consisted of ten renal cellcarcinomas with strong immunoreactivity for alpha-methylCoA racemase (AMACR), of which 9 also expressedcytokeratin 7. All of these neoplasms showed gains ofchromosome 7 or 17 and chromosome Y was lost in all themale patients whereas 3p deletion was detected only in onecase. In the other four renal cell carcinomas, cytokeratin 7was not detected and AMACR was positive in only one. Inthese neoplasms, no gains of chromosomes 7 or 17 and noloss of chromosome Y were observed whereas 3p deletionwas detected in three of them. None of the 14 neoplasmsshowed immunoreactivity for TFE3. The combined use ofimmunohistochemistry and cytogenetics enabled us toprovide a definitive diagnosis for 12 of 14 renal cellcarcinomas with papillary architecture and clear cellcomponents: 9 cases were confirmed to be papillary renalcell carcinomas and 3 cases were confirmed to be clear cellrenal cell carcinomas. Despite these ancillary techniques, twocases remained unclassified. Our study establishes the utilityof these procedures in accurately classifying the greatmajority of renal cell carcinomas with these findings. 110 THE UROVYSION FISH ANALYSIS OFFERS APROMISING SURVEILLANCE STRATEGY INPATIENTS Rink3 1Department of Pathology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital- Kaohsiung Medical Center, Chang Gung University Collegeof Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, ROC; 2Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and 3Urology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA Patients who have undergone intestinal augmentation cystoplasty are at risk for developing latent vesicalmalignancy. The present study was conducted to evaluate thehistological and immunohistochemical characteristics andmolecular genetic alterations in these neoplasms. Four patients developing urothelial neoplams after augmentation cystoplasty were included in the current study.Tumor specimens were assessed for morphological featuresand immunohistochemical expression of uroplakin III, CDX2,-catenin, and cytokeratin 7 and 20. Gene mutations infibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene and p53gene were analyzed and the UroVysion fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) tests were performed. The mean age ofthe patients, including two men and two women, was 37. Thelatency from bladder augmentation to developing malignancyANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3238ranged from 17 to 21 years (mean 19 years). All patients died of widespread metastasis months after cancer diagnosis(mean, 5 months). In the morphological evaluation, all tumorswere high-grade (grade 3) invasive urothelial carcinomacomprising various architectural patterns with brisk mitosesand tumor necrosis. Three harbored glandular differentiation(75%) and the remaining one showed squamousdifferentiation (25%). All cases revealed abnormal decreasing-catenin expression with moderate to strong membranousstaining in 30~60% of tumor cells. Two tumors (50%)showed nuclear expression of CDX2, with variable stainingintensity and percentages. Moderate uroplakin III stainingwas focally identified in one case. All but one tumors (75%)were intensely stained by cytokeratin 7. One case (25%)displayed focal cytokeratin 20 expression. In UroVysionFISH analysis, all tumors displayed characteristicchromosomal abnormalities (100%). Point mutations of bothFGFR3 and p53 genes were identified in one case. Insummary, neoplasms developed after augmentationcystoplasty were extremely aggressive urothelial carcinomasand exhibited distinct morphologic, immunohistochemicaland genetic characteristics. These neoplasms represent a rareand specific variant of urothelial carcinoma which isuniformly lethal. The UroVysion FISH analysis may offer anattractive surveillance strategy in patients who underwentaugmentation cystoplasty. 111 SENSITIZATION OF LIVER CANCER CELLS TOCHEMOAGENTS THROUGH GEP-TARGETEDTHERAPY Siu Tim CheungDepartment of Surgery, The University of Hong Kong Primary liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is the fifth most common cancer and the third cancer killer in theworld, with about half a million individuals dying from HCCannually. The disease is frequently diagnosed at an advancedstage and thus precludes curative surgical treatment.Chemotherapy has shown marginal efficacy and isaccompanied with severe side-effects. A new therapeuticstrategy is essential to sensitize cancer cells to chemotoxicagents. Granulin-epithelin precursor (GEP) was shown to be a therapeutic target for HCC treatment in our earlier studies (1).We firstly identified GEP overexpression through genomicexpression profiling studies using the microarray approach The GEP expression at the mRNA level (2-3) wassubsequently validated at the protein level in more than 200HCCs and liver tissue adjacent to tumor samples, andconfirmed that more than 70% of HCC tissues revealed GEPoverexpression (4-5). We showed that GEP controls HCC cellproliferation, invasion and tumorigenicity (4). These biological roles correspond to the clinical findings thatexpression of GEP is associated with aggressive cancerfeatures including large tumors, venous infiltration(micrometastasis) and early recurrence after curative surgery(4). We then examined the therapeutic potential of GEP-targeted therapy using the in-house made anti-GEPmonoclonal antibody Hep3B and HepG2, butrevealed no significant effect on normal liver cells MIHA. Ina nude mice model transplanted with human HCC cellsHep3B, GEP mAb decreased the serum GEP level andinhibited the growth of established tumors in a dose-dependent manner (1). There are reports showing that GEPmediates drug resistance in some cancer types (6-8). Wetherefore hypothesize that GEP targeted therapy will enhancethe sensitivity of HCC cells to chemotoxic agents. We investigated the effect of GEP neutralization on the chemosensitivity of HCC cells. The biological responses ofGEP mAb A23, alone and in combination with cisplatin, onHCC cells Hep3B in vitro and in vivo have been examined. Hep3B cells treated with GEP mAb A23 in and control treatment (0%) by flowcytometry analysis. The combination therapy approach wasthen examined in in vivo system with the Hep3B xenograft in nude mouse model. We demonstrated that GEP mAb pluscisplatin can further inhibit the alone (53.8%), GEP mAb A23 alone(45.4%) with the control treatment. In summary, the current data indicated that the GEP targeted therapy in combination with cisplatin demonstratedsynergistic cytotoxic effect. The cell apoptotic event inducedby cisplatin was further amplified by neutralization of GEP,and the combination treatment approach further enhanced thegrowth inhibitory effect of tumor xenograft in nude micemodel. The mechanism of GEP-targeted therapy in sensitizingHCC cells to chemodrugs is currently underway. 1 Ho JC, Ip YC, Cheung ST, Lee YT, Chan KF, Wong SY and Fan ST: Granulin-epithelin precursor carcinoma.

Wepreviously established that DMXAA has two distinctactivities that appear critical to its effectsin mice: the induction of tumour of cytokines within thetumour. Multiplex assays were used to screen for cytokinesproduced by human blood leucocytes (HBLs) cultured withDMXAA, with the aim of identifying a select panel ofcytokines that could be used as surrogate markers ofresponse. HBLs were cultured with DMXAA for 16 using a 42-plex cytokine kitand the Luminex 100 MAP platform. While quantitativedifferences were observed between donors, a consistentpattern of modulation of a panel of 7 cytokines could beobserved amongst the donors tested thus far. DMXAAinhibited constitutively-produced IP-10, andsCD40L, MIP1-, IL-6 and IL-8 in 50% of the donors, who were designated ashigh responders. Our data suggest that the pattern ofmodulation of this panel of cytokines may be used to selectfor patients who will best respond to DMXAA treatment. Inclusion of such multiplex cytokine assays in the clinicaltrials, we suggest would also be useful in providing surrogatemarkers response. 113 EP2 RECEPTOR-MEDIATED PROSTAGLANDIN E 2IN ESOPHAGEAL SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA C.H. Cho and L. Yu Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., HongKong, China The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is associated with a lower risk for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, inwhich overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 E 2 (PGE2), a COX-2-derived eicosanoid, is implicated in the promotion of cancer growth.The precise role of PGE 2in the disease development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, however, remainselusive. In this study, we investigated the effect of PGE 2on the proliferation of cultured esophageal squamous cell carcinomacells Results showed that PGE namely EP1 to this EP2 agonist butaprost markedly by RNA interference-mediated knockdown of EP2receptor, indicating that this receptor mediated the mitogeniceffect of PGE 2. In this connection, c-Fos expression and activator reversed the mitogenic effect of PGE 2. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time thatEP2 receptor mediates the mitogenic effect of PGE 2in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via activation Erk/AP-1 and c-Myc pathway. This study supports the growth-promotingaction of PGE 2in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and the potential application of EP2 receptor antagonists in thetreatment of this disease.The work was supported in part by the Hong Kong ResearchGrant Council (7499/05M) and the Direct Grant from theChinese University of Hong Kong.ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: Clinical Oncology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Room 1305, 13/F, Block R, 30 Gascoigne Road, Kowloon,Hong Kong Cancer is the leading cause of death in most of the developed countries. Early diagnosis and prevention are key factors neededto reduce the mortality and morbidity of all types of cancer.Traditional diagnostic methodologies, to a certain extent, havetheir limitations of sensitivity and specificity. It is imperativethat more useful and specific cancer biomarkers are discovered. Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins. With the advent of new and improved proteomics technologies, such asthe development of quantitative and well as advanced bioinformatics for datahandling and interpretation, it is now possible to discoverbiomarkers that can reliably and accurately predict outcomesduring cancer management and treatment. Oncoproteomics is the study of proteins and their interactions in a cancer cell by proteomics technologies. Bystudying the interrelationships of protein expressions andmodifications in cancer and normal cells, proteomicscontributes important insights into the pathophysiologicalbasis of cancer. Oncoproteomics has the potential to beapplicable for clinical practice, including cancer diagnosis andscreening based on proteomics platforms as a complement tohistopathology, individualized selection of therapeuticcombinations that target the entire cancer-specific proteinnetwork, assessment of therapeutic efficacy and toxicity, andrational modulation of therapy based on changes in the cancerprotein network associated with prognosis and drug resistance.In addition, protein biomarkers identified can also serve astherapeutic targets and provide mechanistic approach for thestudy of drug effects as well as effective drug design. In this presentation, some remarkable discoveries of cancer biomarkers as well as the challenges ahead and perspectives ofoncoproteomics for biomarker development will be overviewed. 115 EMODIN-INDUCED Microbiology, Science and Technology, China Medical University,Taichung, Taiwan, ROCWe wanted to test whether or not emodin has suppressive effects on glioma cells. In the present study, emodin inhibitedthe proliferation and induced apoptosis of C6 cells at a 12 htreatment, but surprising results showed that C6 cells surviveda 72 h drug treatment and resistance to emodin occurred. C6cells overcame emodin-induced apoptosis by emodin. EMSA analysis showed that emodin decreased NF- B expression at 24-h treatment but at 48 h treatment, emodinincreased NF- B activity. Confocal microscopy showed that B translocation from cytoplasma to nuclei. C6 cells activated the MAPK survival pathway andexpressed DNA repair gene ( MGMT ) and associated proteins (PARP and XRCC1 ) to recover cell activity. C6 cells also expressed GRP78 to decrease emodin-induced ER stresswhich would cause apoptosis in C6 cells, and GRP78 inhibitedthe expression of GADD153 to enhance the expression of Bcl-2 which could balance the ER-induced and mitochondria-induced apoptosis of C6 cells. 116 THE ROLE OF PROTEIN PHOSPORYLATION INBREAST CANCER Jonas Cicenas Evolutionary Biology, Zoological Institute, University of Basel, Vesalgasse 1, CH-4051, Basel, Switzerland Molecular analysis of cancer tissue samples, carried out for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, provides valuable dataabout the expression of individual proteins or genes. The mostfrequent method for extracting molecular information fromhuman tissues is to visualize protein levels in tissue either byimmunohistochemistry or enzyme immunoassay approaches.Such analysis, however, remains limited in its ability toelucidate the function of such proteins. Protein function isregulated not only by transcription and translation, but also bysuch posttranslational modifications. On of the most importantof these modifications is phosphorylation, which lies behindmost pathways cell signal transduction and is thus fundamentalboth normal physiology and disease. Given these considerations,the number of proteins in the activated (phosphorylated) statemay be more important biologically than the total number ofproteins present. Our data suggests that protein phosphorylation,provides either additional or independent prognostic value forprimary breast cancer patients. In this overview we will demonstrate, that increased levels of phosphorylated akt predicts poor prognosis in breast cancer.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3241We will also discuss some data showing, that phosphorylation of ErbB-2 is an independent predictor of poor prognosis inprimary breast cancer patients. In addition we will show somenew, unexpected and yet unpublished results on SchAphopsorylation in breast cancer. 117 INFLUENCE OF THE STRUCTURE OF NEWANTHRACYCLINE ANTIBIOTICS IN THEIRSTABILITY IN COMMONLY USED I.V. 1Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Pozna; 2Department of Modified Antibiotics, Institute of Biotechnology and Antibiotics, Warsaw, Poland The aim of this study was to determine the influence of the structure of new derivatives of daunorubicin, which weresynthesized at the Institute of Biotechnology and Antibiotics inWarsaw (Poland) (1), on their stability in various commonlyused i.v.infusions solutions. This study is a continuation of biological activity investigations of these derivatives (2, 3). The stability of daunorubicin derivatives containing at position mannitol after store: at room temperature (2, 4, 6, 24 h), at 2-8C (2, 6 24 h) and at-16C (30 days). The derivatives were recognized as stable when changes in their initial concentration did not exceed 10%. After storageat room temperature the derivative with pyrrolidine moietywas the most stable (in 84.6% of the solutions) whereas themorpholine derivative was stable only in two of the solutionsduring 2 h. After storage at 2-8C stability of DD-1 in seven solutions, DD-2 in three solutions, DD-3 in four solutions and DD-4 innine solutions were bigger. However, storage of DD-3solutions in aqua pro injection, 0.9% sodium chloride andDD-4 Jonosteril \u00aeBasic and 5% glucose solutions at -16C 30 days decreased their stability. A previous study showed that the derivative with morpholine moiety had the highest biological activity,whereas it was the less stable in i.v.infusions solutions therefore solutions of this derivative have been prepared ex tempore. 1 Wsowska M, Oszczapowicz Oszczapowicz Influence theStructure Antibiotics Anticancer A, J and Oszczapowicz I: Effect of structural modifications ofanthracyclines on the ability to overcome drug resistance ofcancer cells, Anticancer Res 26: 2009-2012, 2006. 118 THE CHICK EMBRYO CHORIOALLANTOICMEMBRANE AS AN IN VIVO MODEL FOR STUDY TUMOR ANGIOGENESIS Department Human Anatomy and Histology, Piazza G. Cesare, 11, Policlinico,70124 Bari, Italy Tumor angiogenesis and metastasis - two sides of the same coin, two processes which are directly involved in theprogression of malignant tumors. Many unresolved problemsconcerning these two aspects impair the clinical managementof the tumors and also the choice of proper therapy. Mostheterologous transplants of human and rodents tumors cansurvive on chick CAM by several passages with differentpatterns, and the intravascular and extravascular pathways oftumor metastasis can be easily differentiated on CAM model.The behaviour of a tumor and its metastasis are differentconcerning therapy response and prognosis because of anincomplete molecular characterization of the tumors andtheir microcirculation. Metastases and their vascularizationare not well understood. The chick embryo chorioallantoicmembrane (CAM) represents an experimental model fordynamic study of tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. Therich vascular network of the CAM provides a useful tool forstudying the recruitment of the neovessels by the tumorsimplanted on the CAM. The daily direct observation ofmacroscopic changes of a tumor and its vascular networkrepresents an advantage for this in vivo model. Many antiangiogenic agents were studied using the CAM model.Fluorescent labelled tumor cells can be directly monitoredfor their capability of local invasion and metastasis on chickCAM. The lack of a inflamatory response whichcharacterizes this model in early-stages of embryonicdevelopment can help us to study tumor angiogenesis andmetastasis in the absence of this process. Morphologicalchanges and molecular characterization of metastatic cellsANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3242are little studied and could be a starting point for a better understanding of differences in the behaviour of a primarytumor and its metastasis in different organs. The reducednumber of antibodies and reagents available with specificityfor chick CAM blood and lymphatic vessels limits the finecharacterization of the angiogenic response by using thismodel, but the relatively recent complete characterisation ofthe chick embryo genome will be helpful to synthesize abroad panel of antibodies with high specificity for chickentissues, especially for blood and lymphatic endothelial cellsand stroma components. This aspect could be useful to bettercharacterize the interactions between implanted humanand/or mouse tumors and chicken tissues. Embryonicmicroenvironments have been shown to inhibit thetumorigenicity of a variety of cancer cell lines. In thiscontext, the embryonic microenvironment of the chick CAMcould provide an opportunity to study the influence of suchmicroenvironment on cancer cell development and theirmetastatic properties. 119 PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS OF PROSTATE TUMORTISSUE AND PROXIMAL FLUID FOR CANCERBIOMARKER DISCOVER Brian L. Hood 1,2, Joel B. Nelson3 and Thomas P. Conrads1,2 1Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, 2Clinical Proteomics Facility, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, 3Department of Urology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA Armed with sequence information of the human and mouse genomes, a major aim of biological science is towardunraveling the underlying molecular events that lead tocellular function/dysfunction in cancer, with the goal ofdiscovering better diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.Proteomics aims to facilitate this process by applying newlydeveloped methods and advanced analytical tools, such asmass spectrometry, for the investigation of the proteincomplement en masse . Conventional protein biomarker discovery investigations are predominantly performed withsamples such as serum/plasma. While serum/plasma is moredesirable from a clinical standpoint, tissue likely possesses agreater abundance of readily identifiable proteins directlyreflective of disease; however, most of these proteins areunlikely to be released from the tissue into the circulatorysystem, thereby limiting their clinical utility. We propose thatinvestigation of proximal fluids may provide a novelconnection between tissue and serum to permit theidentification of proteins that posses a high likelihood of beingdirectly related to pathophysiology and that are readilyassayable from serum. This lecture will highlight our effortsin applying advanced proteomic discovery methodologies inidentification and validation of prostate cancer biomarkers from prostate tissue and expressed prostatic secretions, a novelproximal fluid for proteomic discovery. 120 PET IN BREAST CANCER A. Constantinidou The Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK Background: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been an exciting development in recent years, providing accuratefunctional information on disease status as well as anatomicalinformation when combined with Computed Tomography(CT). The role of PET/CT in breast cancer is not yet clearlydefined. Aim: To summarize the current data on the utility of PET in breast cancer and to assess its contribution inoptimising management. Methods: Available data on the role of PET in breast cancer come from rather small predominatelyretrospective studies. Results: The principal areas where PET/CT appears useful in breast cancer management havebeen identified. It is currently the most accurate modality todefine/ restage metastatic breast cancer. It is often revealingunsuspected metastases in up to 30% of patients. It isparticularly useful in detecting bony lytic diseaseand the entity is now clearly recognised. PET/CT is effective inassessing response to chemotherapy and hormonal treatmentearlier than any other method currently available. It hassuccessfully been used in the evaluation of indeterminatelesions on conventional imaging. Conclusion: As PET/CT becomes more widely available it is likely to be used early andextensively in the management of breast cancer. Evidencesuggests it can play a key role in a number of areas. Formalguidelines for the use of this modality in breast cancer arewarranted. 121 SMALL RENAL TUMORS: ALTERNATIVE NONSURGICAL TREATMENTS G. ContiDepartment of Urology, St. Anna Hospital, Como, Italy In the last two decades surgical conservative approach has become an accepted standard treatment in patients withsmall renal tumours either in presence of a normalcontralateral kidney or in case of a solitary one or ifmultiple neoplastic lesions are present. More recently thedevelopment of new technologies as cryotherapy,radiofrequency and high intensity focused ultrasounds hasoffered an alternative way to conservatively manage smallrenal masses. Cryoablation is the most diffuse andAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3243experimented technique. By a creation of a well controlled ice-ball cellular damage and necrosis are obtained(immediately related to ice crystals formation inside thesphere, late by coagulative necrosis, apoptosis regulationand vascular damage). Real time step by step control maybe obtained by sonography. The preferred way is thelaparoscopic one but percutaneous approach is nowadaysavailable with the new generation's probes. Radiofrequencyinduces a thermal damage by the insertion of needle probes(single, multiple or spiral shaped) inside the tumourdelivering a high frequency (300-800 kHz), high powered(90-200 W) electrical current that drives the temperature upto 105C with a non reversible coagulative necrosis. Thereal time control by sonography is possible but lessaccurate. Percutaneous approach is easily feasible with thistechnique. In a series presented by the Cleveland ClinicTeam local failure was 1.8% for Cryo and 11.1% forradiofrequency without any difference in renal functionpreservation. Cancer specific survival range between 97%and 100% at a median follow-up of 3 years for bothtreatments in four different series of patients, and overallsurvival between 80% and 100% at 3 after 3-4 months offollow-up and 92% at 1 year. Bleeding and perirenalhaematoma as well as capsular fractures are the mostcommon cryo-related morbidities; upper urinary tractdamage afterradiofrequency procedures. Post Cryo fibrosis appearedmore extensive than that following primary radiofrequencywhen salvage surgery was performed. The principalindication for alternative techniques is very similar to thatfor nephron sparing surgery regarding tumours dimension,presence of solitary kidney, multiple bilateral lesions;Cryoablation and radiofrequency are more simple thansurgery, morbidity is significantly decreased and, whenpercutaneously performed, hospital stay is very short (dayor one-day surgery procedures) with comparable results interms of cancer specific and overall survival in particularwith last generation's Cryo probes.Rehman J, 83-104, 2004.

Copeland 3Biochemisty and 4Microbiology College of Medicine and Cancer Center, Howard University, Washington, D.C. 20059, USA Prostate cancer (PC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in American men with an estimated 186,320 new casesdiagnosed in 2008. Androgen ablation is highly effectivepalliative therapy; however, most men eventually relapse dueto the presence of androgen independent cancer cells.Currently there are no therapies that effectively eliminatethese androgen-independent PC cells. It has been reportedthat MAPK pathways play a critical role for survival andproliferation of androgen-independent cells. Our hypothesisis that enhanced response in PC therapy may requireinhibitors that affect multiple signal transduction pathways.In our studies, imido-substituted chloronaphthoquinones havebeen synthesized that of MAPK.Experiments showed that 2-chloro-3-( N-succinimidyl)-1,4- naphthoquinone and analogs have IC 50s against purified MEK in the range of 0.4-10 M. Subsequently these imido-substituted normal prostate cells, RWPE1.Growth inhibition of each cell line revealed significantantitumor activities within concentration ranges of 1-3 Mfor the cancer cells. The effect 1.5\u00b10.1, 3\u00b10.3, 10\u00b10.5 and 15\u00b10.6 M basis of this cell-based cytotoxicity screen, DCDMNQ demonstrated the best efficacy. Cell cycle analysisANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3244showed that DCDMNQ inhibited progression through the cell cycle in PC-3 and DU-145 cell lines in a time-dependentmanner stopping at the S-phase. The result for LNCaP cellline was inconsistent; whereas, in CWR-22 cell line the drugarrested cells in G 1phase of cell cycle with greatest proportion of cells in G1phase by day 5. The compound showed no effect on the cell cycle progression in bonemarrow HS-5 cell line. In addition, DCDMNQ inducedapoptosis in the androgen-independent cells preferentiallyover that of the androgen-dependent cell lines in a time-dependent manner. These findings were further validated by Western blot analysis. To verify that DCDMNQ maintains ability to inhibitMAP kinases, Western blot analysis was performed to evaluatethe effect of this compound on generation of phosphorylatedMAPK protein in PC-3 and DU-145 cell lines. The resultsrevealed that the initial insult of DCDMNQ decreased AKTactivity and at later time points inhibited other cell survivalpathways such as MEK 1/2, ERK 1/2, and JNK 1/2 inandrogen-independent cell lines (PC3 and DU145), whereasandrogen-dependent LNCap showed significant decrease inERK AKT in time-dependent manner but MEK 1/2,and JNK 1/2 showed activation at 3 days following significantdecrease at 5 days exposure. It was demonstrated thatDCDMNQ can inhibit MEK, ERK, AKT and p38phosphorylation either through inhibition of multiple kinasesorvia direct inhibition which would then prevent downstream phosphorylation. Furthermore, active small molecule kinase inhibitors to date are ATP mimics that bind to the intracellular ATP-bindingdomain within the kinase. It has been proposed that MEK1/2can be inhibited through a novel, noncompetitive mechanism.X-ray crystallography structure of MEK1/2 in complex withMgATP reveals that the enzyme has a unique inhibitor bindingpocket adjacent to the ATP binding site. We carried outmolecular modeling using DCDMNQ in concurrence with thepublished structure of bind via a similar non-competitive mechanism. Our studies showed that in the crystal structure a binding pocketfor DCDMNQ is deep inside of MEK. Evaluation of hydrogenbonding for DCDMNQ when docked to this pocketdemonstrates that it can form hydrogen bonds with LYS97,SER212 and water (HOH97). Thus the presence of DCDMNQinduces conformational changes in the unphosphorylatedMEK1/2 that locks it into a closed but catalytically inactivespecies. Thus cytotoxicity of DCDMNQ is mediated via inhibition of MAPK/AKT pathways in prostate cancer cells in vitro . Therefore, this compound represents a novel class ofcompounds which might lead to future therapeuticinterventions of prostate cancer while protecting bone marrow and normal prostate epithelial cells.Supported by NCI grant U54-CA914-31 and G12 RR003048RCMI. 123 EXPRESSION OF VITAMIN D-24-HYDROXYLASE(CYP24) IN BENIGN AND MALIGNANT BREASTTISSUES AND CELL LINES T. Cordes 1, M. Friedrich2, is well known that vitamin D and its metabolites have a protective effect against cancers, 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 3, the biological active metabolite of Vitamin D, is known to regulate cell proliferation in variouscell lines. It is also essential for the regulation of calcium andphosphate levels and of the bone metabolism. Vitamin D 3is a secosteroid hormone which derives from 7-dehydrocholesterole. In the skin it is synthesized incombination with UV-radiation from the precursors 7-dehydrocholesterole and provitamine D it to Six P450 The subsequentstep is a 1-hydroxylation by CYP27B1 (1-hydroxylase)which produces the most active form of vitamin D 3, 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin-D3(calcitriol). This metabolite is inactivated by a 24-hydroxylation by CYP24 40 (24-hydroxylase).Alternative splicing frequently occurs in breast cancer cells;different splice variants of a given protein can display differentbiological functions and may cause tissue-specific variations.In this study we describe the expression of 24-OHase inhuman benign and malign breast tissue. Methods: Expression of 24-OHase RNA and protein was assessed by real-time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). To determine whichvariants are translated in protein we accomplished western blotanalysis. Results: The expression of 24-OHase RNA wasreduced by more than 50% in RT-PCR as well as in westernblotting compared to benign breast tissues. Discussion: Breast cancer tissue has a reduced activity of 24-OHase which leadsto higher levels of active metabolites of Vitamin D. Alternativesplicing of 24-OHase might play a role in regulating levels ofthe active enzyme. High levels of splice variants might lead toa reduction of the active protein. We found less splice variantsin malignant breast cancer tissue. These results correspondwith the data found in previous studies we performed inmalignant and benign gynaecologic cell lines. Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3245124 Angelo CortiDepartment Oncology, Cancer Immunotherapy and Gene Therapy Program, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 58, 20132 Milan, Italy The use of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) and interferon- (IFN), in cancer therapy is often limited bystrong systemic toxicity and poor efficacy. To improve thetherapeutic index of these drugs we have developed, in the lastyears, a vascular targeting approach based on specific integrins expressed by angiogenic endothelial cellsand, consequently, to deliver these cytokines to tumorneovasculature. Studies in various animal models have shownthat the therapeutic index of these fusion proteins is greaterthan that of non-targeted cytokines. Furthermore, we alsoobserved that systemic administration of very low doses(picograms) of NGR-TNF or isoDGR-TNF fusion proteins can increase the penetration of chemotherapeutic drugs intumors, by altering endothelial barrier function. NGR-TNF isnow under investigation in phase II clinical studies for cancertreatment, alone and in combination with chemotherapy. Sinceearly preclinical studies we soon realized that the dose-reponsecurve of these peptide-cytokine fusion products is complex,either when used alone or in combination with chemotherapy.For instance, while synergy with chemotherapy can occur withdoses of NGR-TNF in the picogram range (about 10 6-fold lower than the LD50) increasing the dose to nanograms leads, paradoxically, to lower responses. Furthermore,coadministration of NGR-TNF with endothelial-monocyteactivating polypeptide-II (EMAP-II), an inflammatorycytokine caninduce synergistic pro-apoptotic effects with low-dose EMAP-II (picograms), but not with high doses (nanograms-micrograms). This behavior has been observed also withIFN-NGR. Studies on the mechanism of action have shownthat high doses of targeted or non-targeted TNF, IFN orEMAP-II can activate counter-regulatory mechanisms thatefficiently block or counteract cytokine activity. Thus, targeteddelivery of low doses of cytokines to tumor blood vessels is anovel strategy for avoiding not only toxic reactions, but alsofor overcoming counter-regulatory mechanisms. 125 A PHASE II MULTICENTRIC Maini1on behalf of the Italian Society of Locoregional Therapies in Oncology 1Regina Elena National Cancer radiotherapy (SIRT) enables delivery oftumorcidal doses of radiation to malignant tumor, withminimal damage to adjacent tissue. This multicentre phaseII study is the first prospective evaluation of SIRT as salvagetherapy for patients with colorectal liver metastases who hadfailed prior oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based regimens.Methods: Eligible patients had a life expectancy of >6 months, adequate hepatic and renal function and an absenceof major vascular anomalies and pulmonary shunt >10%.The gastroduodenal and right gastric arteries wereembolized before injection microspheres (median dose1.7 GBq; range 0.9-2.2) into the hepatic artery byarteriography. Results: Patients were enrolled and followed up for a median of 11 months (mos) (range 2-27). Of 50eligible patients, 38 (76%) had received at least 4 lines ofchemotherapy. Most patients had synchronous disease(72%), >4 size of the liver tissue (60%)and bilateral spread (70%). Early and late (after 48 h) WHOG1-2 toxic events (mostly fever and pain) were observed in16% and 22% of patients, respectively. One respondingpatient died after 60 days due to liver failure. Of 46 patientswho were evaluable for response using RECIST criteria, 1patient (2%) had a complete response (CR), 11 (22%) apartial response (PR), 12 (24%) stable disease (SD) and 22(44%) progressive disease (PD). In responders (CR + PR +SD), the maximum diameter of nodules diminished to 35mm. The Kaplan-Meyer overall median survival was 13 (CI7-18) mos, with a significant difference ( p=0.0006) between responders 16 (CI 13-19) mos and PD 8 (CI 4-12) mos. At2 years, survival was 40.3% and 0% in responders and PD,respectively. The median time to progression (mostlyextrahepatic) was 4 (CI 3-5) mos. Conclusion: In heavily pretreated patients, 90Y resin microspheres produced an encouraging median survival, with acceptable toxicity, thatcompares favorably with previous phase II/III studies ofchemotherapy regimens used as third- Caterino The Colorectal Disease Management Team, Regina National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CHRT) downstages up to two thirds of low rectal cancer patients (pts.) clinically staged T 3- 4, any N or any T, node-positive (N+); risk of positive lymph nodes in major responders (pT0-1) ranges from 0 to 17%.

In conclusion, ultraconservativerectal surgery is feasible and oncologically safe in well-selected rectal cancer pts. after major response to CHRT. 127 MECHANISMS OF REDOX-MODULATEDRESISTANCE TO APOPTOSIS IN TUMOUR CELLS Thomas G. Pettigrew, Ruth Naughton and Claire Quiney Tumour Biology Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, University College Cork, Ireland There is increasing evidence within the literature that the decreased susceptibility of tumour cells to stimuli that induceapoptosis can be linked to their inherently increased redoxpotential. This research work focuses on the PI3-kinase/Aktpathway, and the multiple points along this signalling pathway that may be redox regulated. The PI3-kinase/Akt pathway caninfluence a cell's sensitivity to death-inducing signals, throughdirect manipulation of apoptosis regulating molecules or byregulating the activity of key transcription factors. Proteinsinvolved in the control of apoptosis that are directly regulatedby the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway include caspase-9, Bad and thetranscription factor GSK-3beta. Lately, it is becomingincreasingly obvious that phosphatases are a major counterbalance to the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway. Phosphatases such asPP2A and PP1alpha can dephosphorylate signalling moleculeswithin the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway, blocking their activity. It isthe balance between the kinase activity and the phosphataseactivity that determines the presence and strength of the PI3-kinase/Akt signal. This is one reason why any proteinmodifications that hinder dephosphorylation can increase thetumour survival advantage. One such modification is theoxidation of the sulphydryl group in key cysteine residuespresent within the active site of the phosphatases. Thegeneration of H 2O2by the Nox (NADPH oxidase) system is central to this effect in prostate and CML leukaemia cells. 128 REGULATORY MECHANISMS OF VITAMIN DSYNTHESIS AND CATABOLISM FOR COLORECTAL CANCER PREVENTION Heide Maya Khorchide and Enik\u00f6 Kallay Department of Pathophysiology, Medical University Vienna, A-1090, Austria Occurrence of non-familial sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) is frequent, especially in rich industrialized countries. Highincidence has been related to environmental nutritional factorsand progression into clinically manifest disease may takeseveral decades. Epidemiological studies indicate that vitaminD insufficiency may also play a role in its etiology. Vitamin Dinsufficiency is determined by serum 25-hydroxy vitamin (<75 nmol/l). Lifestyle and nutritionmay contribute to insufficiency, though a major part of vitaminD is produced in skin cells by UV-B, and only fatty fish andegg yolk contain vitamin D in appreciable amounts. isconverted in picomole concentrations andseems not to correlate with cancer incidence. Since in vitro only nanomolar levels have been shown to display antimitoticactivity, we hypothesized that localized 1,25-D3 synthesiscould occur in extrarenal tissues, reaching nanomoleconcentrations, and the prerequisite condition for this is theavailability of sufficient 25-D3 serum levels. We demonstratedthat indeed there is active 25-D3 1-hydroxylase (CYP27B1)Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3247in colon mucosal cells and that early during human colon tumor progression expression of the synthesizing enzyme aswell as of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is enhanced. In high-grade undifferentiated tumors this expression is diminished andthe vitamin D catabolizing hydroxylase CYP24A1 becomesprominent. Thus enhanced expression of the vitamin D systemmay be an innate defense against further progression ofmalignancy, and raising extrarenal local production in organsprone to malignancy could curb progression. We established that (phyto)estrogens improved expression and activity of CYP27B1, and decreased that of CYP24A1.This could conceivably account for reduced CRC incidence inwomen compared with men, and also for reduced incidence insoy-consuming countries. Dietary calcium is a well-acceptedinhibitor of colonic hyperproliferation. We demonstrated in amouse model that low dietary calcium led tohyperproliferation and to enhanced expression of CYP24A1in colon mucosa. Interestingly this occurs only in the right(proximal) colon in both genders. However, only in femalemice on low dietary calcium is CYP27B1 as well as VDRexpression raised, again only in the right colon. In females,enhanced vitamin D synthesis may override its enhanceddegradation since 1,25-D3 measured in colon mucosa was atleast doubled. This paralleled raised apoptotic activity. High expression of the catabolic CYP24A1 in undifferentiated tumors is apparently not associated with geneduplication, but rather with epigenetic regulation. CpG islandsin the CYP24A1 promoter of cells derived from advanced human colon tumors are not methylated whereas those of cellsderived from early well-differentiated malignancies are highlymethylated and they do not possess CYP24A1 mRNA or activity. When the latter cells were treated with ademethylation agent, they expressed not only CYP24A1 mRNA but also the capacity to degrade 1,25-D3. This demonstrates that colonic 1,25-D3 could be harnessed as a biological weapon against tumor progression by enhancingits mucosal synthesis and by curbing its degradation. Whilehigh doses of active 1,25-D3 given to tumor patients generallyresult in hypercalcemia, improving local production in organsprone to malignancy could slow down progression withoutleading to enhanced serum levels and to hypercalcemia. 129 EFFECT OF AN ALLELIC POLYMORPHISM IN THEDOPAMIN RECEPTOR D2 GENE ON of Preventive Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, P\u00e9cs University of Sciences, P\u00e9cs;3Department of Oncotherapy, P\u00e9cs University of Sciences, P\u00e9cs; 4Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Di\u00f3sgyr Hospital, Miskolc, Hungary In spite of the decreased mortality rates, cervical cancer is still an important tumor in developed countries, because of its highincidence, including precancerous lesions. Humanpapillomavirus infection, particularly with high-risk strains isconsidered to be the most important risk factor for cervicalcancer. However, in spite of the infection, the cancer will notdevelop in several women, which suggests that other riskfactors play also an important role in cervical carcinogenesis. During the recent years a few studies tried to find an association between dopamine metabolism and cancer risks.Since dopamine is an important neurotransmitter, thisconnection is probably mediated by causing changes incancer-risk modifying behavioral patterns like alcoholconsumption and smoking, but direct molecular effects cannotbe excluded, either. Dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) takes partin the intracellular transmission of dopamine effects. TheTaqIA polymorphism (a C32806T substitution) in the DRD2gene was shown to affect the receptor function, personalitytraits and the occurrence of certain mental diseases. In our case-control study we investigated the effect of DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism on the risk of cervical cancer.Altogether 143 women participated in the study. Their HPVstatus was determined, and their disease progression was alsorecorded. The HPV positive cases were genotyped for DRD2TaqIA polymorphism by PCR-RFLP, and allele frequencieswere compared between individuals who remained disease-free and who developed cancer or precancerous lesion. Ourresults indicate a moderate risk modifying effect of the TaqIApolymorphism, which, together with other low penetrancegenetic factors, might have an influence on the risk of cervicalcancer. 130 POLY(ADENOSINE DIPHOSPHATE-RIBOSE)POLYMERASE-1 EXPRESSION IN CUTENEOUSMALIGNANT MELANOMAS AS family of enzymes which catalyse poly (ADP-ribosyl)ationof DNA-binding proteins and are directly involved in genomicANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3248stability, DNA repair and apoptosis. In this study, we evaluated the immunomorphology of PARP-1 in melanoma and itsprognostic importance. We studied PARP-1 expression by immunohistochemistry in a selected series of 54 primary cutaneous malignantmelanoma (CMM). The findings of the present study suggestthat the neoplastic progression toward the invasive (bothhorizontal and vertical) growth phase of CMM cells ischaracterized by the loss of cleavage of PARP-1, probablysignaling an imbalance of the apoptotic process in these cellsand leading to further gain to aggression. Overexpression offull-length PARP-1 was correlated with recurrence andprogression of the disease and so acts as a promising newbiological marker of CMM. Our study represents the evidence of a direct correlation between the PARP-1-mediated apoptotic process and thebiological behavior of Factor (VEGF) represents a key regulator factor on angiogenesis occurring in a variety ofmalignancies, including breast cancer (1). Similarly,LGALS3BP, a lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 bindingprotein, has emerged as a novel feature that may favour breastcancer progression and metastasis, since its high expressionlevels in patients significantly correlates with poor prognosis(2-3). So far, how LGALS3BP overexpression intervenes intumor progression and metastasis remains still to beelucidated, but a link between LGALS3BP and tumorangiogenesis has been recently suggested (4). With theaforementioned, we sought to study the possible interplaybetween LGALS3BP and the proangiogenic molecule, VEGFin breast cancer. To this end, we initially performedimmunohistochemical studies on the tissue specimensobtained by biopsies of a group of 40 patients affected bybreast carcinomas, indicating that LGALS3BP expression intumor tissues was directly correlated with VEGF expressionin 72.5% of cases. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that LGALS3BP treatment could increase VEGF mRNA levels inMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, but not in non tumorigenic HBL-100 cells. This evidence suggested that LGALS3BPmight represent a new upregulator factor for VEGFexpression/activity in human breast cancer. For a furtherconfirmation, a stable down-regulation of LGALS3BP inMDA-MB-231 cells was obtained by using siRNA expressionplasmids: the protein level found in the Conditioned Medium(CM) of LGALS3BP-silenced cells was 80% less whencompared to the CM-derived from oligo control cells. Veryinterestingly, Real Time PCR studies demonstrated that thelevel of VEGF mRNA expression in LGALS3BP-silencedMDA-MB-231 was significantly lower in respect to thatexpressed by oligo control cells (55%, p=0.011). Similar results were obtained also by measuring VEGF protein levelas indicated by using either confocal microscopy orimmunoprecipitation studies. Because VEGF is a principalregulator factor for endothelial cells, we also studied theexogenous LGALS3BP-induced effects on human umbilicalvein endothelial show thatLGALS3BP specifically upregulated VEGF mRNAexpression, but did not affect the expression level of otherimportant growth factors for HUVEC. In addition,LGALS3BP, but not the denaturated protein, could activate theVEGF-promoter transfected endothelial cells. Finally,supernatants collected from LGALS3BP-silenced or oligocontrol MDA-MB-231 cells, were tested for their capability toinduce in vitro HUVEC tubulogenesis. Our data indicated an evident decrease of the number of tubuli found onto Matrigelwhen HUVEC were incubated with the supernatant of cellsthat lack LGALS3BP, thus signifying a promoting role of thisprotein on angiogenesis in vitro . Taken together, these results lead to the conclusion that LGALS3BP might be depicted as anovel candidate that promotes angiogenesis. Further studiesare in progress for investigating any potential effect ofantibodies directed against human LGALS3BP on the in vivo growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell xenografts and onthe related tumor-angiogenesis.

PAPILLOMA VIRUS (HPV) INFECTIONACCOUNTS FOR AN INCREASE IN THEINCIDENCE AND THE BETTER PROGNOSIS INTONSILLAR CANCER IN SWEDEN Tina DalianisDepartment of Center Karolinska, Karolinska University HospitalR8:01, S-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden We previously reported a parallel three-fold increase in the incidence of tonsillar cancer and in the proportion of humanpapilloma virus (HPV)-positive tumours in the Stockholmarea, between 1970-2002. Notably, while only 23% of thecases were HPV positive in the 1970s, 68% were HPV-positive during 2000-2002, when testing 203 available pre-treatment tonsillar cancer biopsies with both general and type-specific HPV and sequencing. Moreover, 87% of HPV type 16. These resultssuggested that HPV infection, with a dominance of HPV 16,was responsible for the increase in the incidence of tonsillarcancer, a disease also more common in men than women inSweden. In continuation, we analysed the clinical outcome in these 203 patients and reported that overall disease-free survival waslonger in patients with HPV-positive tumours as compared topatients with HPV-negative tonsillar cancer. However, acorrelation between prognosis and high viral load, previouslyreported in a pilot study, could not be confirmed. Nonetheless,94% of all tested HPV 16-positive tumours expressed E7mRNA and the majority of these also expressed E6 mRNA,indeed supporting the oncogenic role of HPV in tonsillarcancer. In parallel, we conducted a smaller study in collaboration with colleagues from the Metaxas Cancer Hospital in Piraeus,Greece, where we analysed an additional 103 pre-treatmentsamples from 115 patients with head neck cancer, and of these28 were diagnosed with tonsillar cancer between 1992-2007.Again, we see a tendency for an increase in the proportion ofHPV-positive tumours from 17% during the years 1992-1998as compared to 50% between 2000-2007, althoughunfortunately the numbers of tumours were too few to allowfor a statistical significance. Since these studies, the incidence in tonsillar cancer seems to have increased further in Sweden and particularly in theStockholm area. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine the proportion of HPV-positive tonsillar cancer casesbetween 2003-2007 within the Stockholm area. During thisperiod, 150 pre-treatment tonsillar cancer biopsies werecollected and the samples were analyzed in a similar way tothe samples of the 203 patients above. In this study, we foundthat the proportion of HPV-positive tumours between 2003-2007 was around 80%, with the proportion of HPV-positivetumours being 86% during 2006-2007. In summary, the data support that the continued increase in incidence of tonsillar cancer seems to be due to a continuedincrease in the proportion of HPV-positive tumours, at least inSweden. Based on recent data, that patients with HPV-positivetonsillar cancer do better than patients with HPV-negativetonsillar cancer, we suggest that the presence or absence ofHPV in tonsillar cancer should be considered when tailoringtreatment. Finally, the more recent, very strong association ofHPV with tonsillar cancer should also possibly pave the wayfor the development of preventative strategies, such as possiblevaccination against HPV infection in both young women andmen. 133 REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS) COMPRISE AMOLECULAR TARGET IN PREVENTION OF ORALCELL CANCER Steven D'Ambrosio , Chunhua Han and Haiming Ding Department of Radiology, Division of Radiobiology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA Redox is a normal physiological process balancing the intracellular levels of endogenously and exogenously producedoxidants and antioxidants. The levels of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) are often maintained in a narrow range andperturbing the balance between pro- and antioxidants in cellscan lead to apoptosis. Due to high levels of metabolism andother factors, cancer cells often exhibit high levels of ROS.This may contribute to their high proliferation rates, genomicinstability and promote invasion by killing adjacent normalcells. To survive, cancer cells maintain a delicate balancebetween pro- and antioxidants and perturbing this balance mayoffer an opportunity for cancer prevention. A number ofstudies indicate that many cancer preventative and therapeuticagents induce apoptosis via ROS. It is thought that ROS act as signals to initiate apoptosis via either the intrinsic and/or extrinsic pathways. We have been investigating the cancer protective affects of phytochemicals extracted from a number of fruits. In thepresent study, we used organic extracts prepared from avocadosto determine ROS mechanisms involved in prevention using ahuman oral cancer cell culture model. Phytochemicalsextracted from avocado chloroform (D003 extract)ANTICANCER RESEARCH inhibit the growth and induce apoptosis in premalignant and malignant, but not normal, human oralepithelial cell lines. A number of cellular and molecularapproaches were used to determine mechanisms responsible forthe selective activity of avocado extracts. The premalignant andmalignant oral cell lines contained significantly higher basallevels of ROS than did the normal oral cell lines. Upontreatment of the cancer cell lines with the D003 extract, ROSlevels increased 3-fold and induced apoptosis. ROS levels onlyincreased 1.3-fold in the apoptosis-resistant normal oral cellline. The increased levels of ROS induced by D003 in thecancer cell lines appeared to be mediated via mitochondrial complex I in the electron transport chain. The involvement ofROS in the selective killing of the cancer cell lines was furthersubstantiated when these cell lines became resistant to D003-induced apoptosis upon reduction of cellular ROS levels by N- acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). NAC also delayed the induction ofapoptosis in dominant negative FADD-expressing cancer celllines, suggesting the role of ROS in this signaling pathway. Tofurther confirm the role of ROS in extract induced apoptosis,we transformed the resistant normal oral epithelial cell linewith HPV16 E6 or E7. These cell lines exhibited characteristicsof the oral cancer cell lines, including increased levels of ROS,and sensitivity to apoptosis induced by the D003 extract. In summary, the data suggest that: i) ROS may be regulatory molecules activated by the phytochemicals inavocado; and ii) perturbing the ROS levels in human oral andother cancer cells may be a key factor in selective apoptosisand molecular targeting for chemoprevention byphytochemicals. 134 DEVELOPMENT OF APTAMERS AS TARGETEDRADIOPHARMACEUTICALS FOR THEDIAGNOSTIC IMAGING AND RADIOTHERAPY OF BREAST CANCER C. Da Pieve 1, A. Perkins2and S. Missailidis1 1Chemistry Department, The Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA; 2Department of Medical Physics, Medical School, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK Aptamers have shown great potential as novel targeted radiopharmaceutical entities for the diagnosis and medicalimaging of disease. They offer reduced immunogenicity, goodtumour penetration, rapid uptake and clearance compared totheir monoclonal antibody counterparts. In previous work, wehave reported on the labelling of such aptamers against breastcancer related biomarkers with radionuclide ligands. We have successfully conjugated selected aptamers against the protein core or the tumour glycosylated MUC1glycoprotein to MAG2 and labelled them with 99mTc, for thediagnostic imaging of breast cancer. The conjugation is achieved using standard peptide coupling reactions betweenan amino modification on the aptamer and the carboxylicgroup on the ligands. An efficient and convenient labelling ofthe aptamer with short half-life radioisotopes was achieved asthe last step of the synthesis. Both conjugation and labellingreactions were monitored by HPLC. The labelled aptamerswere separated from free 99mTc using ultrafiltration, before injection and imaging for analysis of their tumour localisingpotential and pharmacokinetic properties. For the analysis ofthe pharmacokinetic properties of the aptamer-radionucleotideconjugate, we have used gamma-camera imaging in MCF-7breast cancer tumour model systems. Stability tests showed that the aptamer-chelator conjugates have strong 99mTc binding properties and the resulting complexes are highly stable in vivo , both in terms of nuclease degradation and leaching of the metal. We analysed the uptakeof two different radiolabelled aptamers, selected against thenaked MUC1 tandem repeat sequence and the tumourglycosylated Tn antigen respectively, in the tumour at 3, 5, 16,and 24 hours after the injection. It has been previously shownthat conjugation of aptamers to high molecular weightpolyethylene glycol (PEG) modifies the pharmacokineticproperties of the radiolabeled product, allowing the complexlonger circulation times and thus offering improved tumourimaging properties. This approach gave us further possibilitiesfor development of efficient targeted radiopharmaceuticals forbreast cancer imaging and therapy.

DarbreSchool of Biological Sciences, University of Reading, Reading RG6 6AJ, UK The established role of oestrogen in the development, progression and treatment of breast cancer raises questionsconcerning a potential contribution from the many chemicalsin the environment which enter the human breast and whichpossess oestrogenic activity. This may include the plant-derived phytoestrogens, oestrogensof oral contraceptives/hormone replacement therapy, range of ubiquitousenvironmental contaminants (organochlorine pesticides andpolychlorinated biphenyls) and diphenyl ethers) in human breast adipose tissue and/orin human milk. However, an extensive array of cosmeticAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3251chemicals are applied to the human breast area on a daily basis and are left on the skin allowing for accumulation in theunderarm and upper outer breast area. Our work is showingthat an increasing number of these cosmetic chemicals possessoestrogenic activity and are measurable in human breastincluding parabens, aluminium salts, triclosan, phthalates,sunscreens, polycyclic musks and other compounds.The disproportionate number of breast cancers in the upperouter quadrant of the breast, just the local area to which thesechemicals are applied, remains strong supportive evidence ofa causal link (Darbre, Anticancer Res 25: 2543, 2005). This lecture will review evidence for a functional role of thecombined actions of environmental oestrogens in the risingincidence of breast cancer. 136 A MULTI-TARGETED THERAPY FOR CANCER: AN \"AGE-OLD\" REMEDY FOR AN Immunology, Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, USA; 3National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India Cancer is a multifactorial disease that requires modulation of multiple pathways and multiple targets. In the recent past,dietary plant polyphenols, e.g., theaflavins and curcumin, have provided opportunities to develop strategies for curing cancerby directly or indirectly altering specific cellular targets. Weattempted to develop a multiple signal modulation therapy ofcancer by targeting signalling pathways leading to (i)apoptosis and (ii) metastasis. Our approaches centred aroundtumour suppressor protein p53. Using human cancer cells ofvarying p53 status, we found a definitive co-relation betweenp53 status and the signalling pathways targeted by thesepolyphenols. Apoptosis was induced in wild-type p53-expressing cancer cells by p53-mediated Bax trans-activationand stimulation of intrinsic death pathway, while in cancercells containing mutant p53, activation of death receptor-dependent extrinsic apoptotic pathway and inhibition ofsurvival pathway In HPV-infected cancer cells, these polyphenolsresisted E6-dependent p53 degradation not only by down-regulating E6 via activation of the transcription repressor Cux/CDP, but up-regulating MAR-binding proteinSMAR1. SMAR1 Mdm2-mediated p53-degradation and p53 through phosphorylation at itsSer15 residue with simultaneous deacetylation of this tumoursuppressor. Moreover, these plant polyphenols were found toretard the migration of wild-type p53-expressing cancer cellsmore efficiently than those with mutant p53. A search for the underlying mechanism revealed disruption of the membranelipid raft-associated integrin-signalling pathway. The outcomeof this study might expand our knowledge in developing a\"new\" strategy of multi-targeted therapy of the \"age-old\"disease cancer utilizing the \"age-old\" remedies. 137 DNA REPAIR ENZYME POLYMORPHISM AND ARIAN Nikbahkt DastjerdiDepartment of University Sciences, Isfahan, Iran Aims: The ERCC2 gene encodes a DNA repair enzyme that has multiple regulatory cellular functions. The ERCC2 polymorphism Lys751Gln may alter the capacity for DNArepair, which could affect the risk of certain types of cancer.Methods: We examined whether the Lys751Gln polymorphism was associated with the risk of ovarian cancer in Isfahanianwomen by analysing the genotype frequencies in 86 patientswith ovarian and 120 cancer-free controls. Results: The Gln /Gln genotype was associated with a 53% increased riskof ovarian cancer. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that ERCC2 polymorphisms might be potential risk markers for ovarian cancer in Isfahan. 138 PTEN AND BCL-2 EXPRESSION IN Nikbahkt of Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted onchromosome 10) and bcl-2 protein expression to microsatelliteinstability, as well as to other clinicopathological variables incolorectal adenocarcinomas. Materials and Methods: We evaluated the expression patterns of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 andPTEN proteins, as potential prognostic wereevaluated. Results: Increased expression of bcl-2 (>50% cells) was seen in 17 specimens (17%) and loss of PTEN was seen in14 specimens (14%). No significant correlation was observedbetween the proteins or with clinicopathological factors. Lossof PTEN was more frequent in MSI-positive tumors (8/24ANTICANCER RESEARCH Conclusion: Our data demonstrate a subset of colorectal carcinomas, while loss ofPTEN often was associated with the MSI phenotype. 139 TP53 CODON 72 POLYMORPHISM Mehdi Nikbahkt DastjerdiDepartment of Anatomical Sciences, Isfahan Isfahan, Iran Aim: The polymorphic variants at codon 72 of the p53gene, encoding either proline or arginine at residue 72, producesmarked change in the structure of p53. From the evidence thatthe DNA mismatch repair system and p53 interact to maintaingenomic integrity, we hypothesized that the codon 72 variationmay influence the prevalence of microsatellite instability, afeature of malignancies associated with mismatch repairdeficiency in sporadic colorectal cancer. Materials and Methods: We investigated the frequency of microsatellite instability in three genotypes of P53 codon 72 using genomic DNAs from 190 paraffin blocks of the sporadic colorectaladenocarcinomas by testing the BAT-26 marker. Results: MSI analysis revealed that 27.6% of the tumors were MSI-positiveand 72.4% showed no change (MSI-negative). The frequencyof arginine/arginine,arginine/proline and proline/proline were 17.9%,66.1% and 16% respectively. A significant difference indistribution of MSI was found for the arginine/prolinegenotype as compared with (grouped) arginine/arginine andproline/proline codon 72 heterozygosity prone to microsatelliteinstability more than other ANNEXIN A1 EXPRESSION IN COLORECTAL CANCER Mehdi Nikbahkt DastjerdiDepartment of Anatomical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran Aim: The role of annexin A1 (ANXA1) in tumor development and progression is controversial. We investigated ANXA1expression and determined its clinical significance incolorectal cancer. Methods: Blocks containing primary colorectal cancer, lymph node metastases, and adjacent normalmucosa specimens were obtained from 120 Isfahanianpatients. Expression of ANXA1 in these specimens was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. Results: Complete loss of ANXA1 expression was observed in 63% of the 120primary tumors and 85% of the nodal metastases. Loss ofANXA1 expression was significantly associated lymph nodemetastasis and poor histological differentiation. Conclusion: ANXA1 expression decreased significantly as colorectalcancer progressed and metastasized, suggesting the importanceof ANXA1 as a negative biomarker for colorectal cancerdevelopment and progression. 141 DETECTION OF LYMPH NODEMICROMETASTASES IN EARLY BREAST CANCER Mehdi Nikbahkt DastjerdiDepartment of Anatomical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran Aim: The purpose of this study was to examine the usefulness of the biopsy of the lymph nodes for effective detection of lymphnode micrometastasis in early breast cancer and to clarify thespread of lymph node micrometastasis. Methods: One hundred local and regional lymph nodes from 30 patients with earlybreast cancer were evaluated by staining with haematoxylin andeosin tests detected occult micrometastases in16% of the nodes that were negative haematoxylinand eosin staining. Conclusion: Routine systematic lymphadenectomy with node micrometastasis contributes to identification of alarger population at risk of early breast cancer. 142 A NEW NEGATIVE BIOMARKER FOR BREAST CANCER DEVELOPMENT Mehdi Nikbahkt DastjerdiDepartment of Anatomical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran Aim: The role of annexin A1 (ANXA1) in tumor development and progression is controversial. We investigated ANXA1expression and determined its clinical significance in breastcancer. Methods: Blocks containing primary breast cancer, lymph node metastases, and adjacent normal mucosaspecimens were obtained from 100 Isfahanian patients.Expression of ANXA1 in these specimens was analyzed usingimmunohistochemistry. Results: Complete loss of ANXA1 expression was observed in 59% of the 100 primary tumorsand 75% of the nodal metastases.

B.C. Davidson 1, G. Cliff2, W. Prinz1and D. Rottanburg1 1School of Physiology, University of the Witwatersrand Medical School, Johannesburg, Gauteng; 2Natal Sharks Board, Umhlanga Rocks, KwaZuluNatal, South Africa Several reports have indicated an extremely low incidence of cancer in sharks, although other reports indicate carcinogenesisin some shark species. Many authors have published reports ofpolyunsaturated fatty acids exerting growth inhibitory effectson transformed cells but not normal cells in culture. It has thusbeen hypothesised that n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, presentin high concentrations in many marine oils, especially sharkliver oils, may exert anticarcinogenic effects, and these n3polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to haveanticarcinogenic effects on mammalian carcinomas. The aimof this study was to assess whether shark liver oil, from fourIndian Ocean shark species, exerted antiproliferative effects oncertain transformed and normal mammalian cells in culture,and to assess whether the ratio of n3 to n6 polyunsaturatesinfluenced the results. Although certain concentrations of theoils did induce growth inhibition, this was not consistentbetween the oils nor did they show a concentration dependencewith either transformed or normal cells. Moreover, the ratio ofn3 to n6 did not seem to be a significant factor. Fatty acidmixtures mimicking the composition of the shark liver oils alsodid not induce any significant profiles of growth inhibition. Itwould seem unlikely for the liver oils from these four speciesof shark to be of use in anticancer therapy. 144 RUNX1 TRANSLOCATIONS IN MALIGNANT HEMOPATHIES Etienne De Claude F\u00e9rec and Marc De Braekeleer Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine et des Sciences de la Sant\u00e9 INSERMU-613, 22 avenue Camille Desmoulins, CS 93837, F-29238Brest cedex 3, France The and RUNX3 ) encodingtranscription factors involved in cell lineage differentiation during development and various forms of cancer. The RUNX1 gene, located in chromosome 21q22, is crucial for theestablishment of definite hematopoiesis and the generation ofhematopoietic stem cells in the embryo. It contains a \"Runthomology domain\" (RHD) and a transactivation domain.RUNX1 can act as activator or repressor of target geneexpression depending upon the large number of transcriptionfactors, coactivators and corepressors that interact with it. Three modes of leukemogenesis due to acquired alterations of the RUNX1 gene have been recognized: point mutations, amplification and translocations. Some translocations havebeen shown to be recurrent, whereas others have been onlyreported in a few cases or in a sole case. At present, 32 partner chromosomes have been described but the partner gene has solely been identified in 17translocations at the molecular level. Most of thetranslocations involving RUNX1 lead to the formation of a fusion transcript made of the 5' region of RUNX1 , including the RHD, fused to the 3' region of a partner gene, with theexception of RUNX1-ETV6 in which the 3' sequences of RUNX1 , including the RHD, is fused the 5' of ETV6 , including its promotor. Three RUNX1 translocations (retaining RHD) that are fused out of frame to partner genes are alsoknown. All the translocations that retain RHD but remove thetranscription activation domain have a leukemogenic effect byacting as dominant negative inhibitors of wildtype RUNX1b in transcription activation. 145 DELTANp63 EXPRESSION IS ACTIV CNRS UMR TP53 and TP73 , a member of the TP53 family. It may encode both long (TAp63) and truncated(DeltaNp63) isoforms, by the use of promoters P1 and P2,respectively. TAp63 isoforms act as transcription factors. Theyactivate genes involved in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.DeltaNp63 isoforms lack the main transactivation domain butretain the DNA-binding domain. Thereby, they are able to bindANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3254p53 responsive elements (p53RE) and to prevent both p53 and TA isoforms from binding on p53RE. This latter propertycould be a mechanism of tumour initiation and/or progressionin some tumour types. When deregulated in tumours, as squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), TP63 expression mainly results in the accumulation of DeltaNp63 variant. The amplification of TP63 gene, observed in about 30% of SCC, cannot explain all the cases ofaccumulation observed. Therefore, we hypothesized thatDeltaNp63 overexpression could also result from P2 promoterderegulation. Several sites were already identified in the P2 promoter, among them a p53RE, suggesting a regulation of P2 promoterby p53. Actually, it has been demonstrated that p53 repressesP2 promoter independently from the p53RE, but throughCAAT boxes present near the TATA box. By in silico analysis, we identified two sites for TCF/LEF transcription factors in the P2 promoter. Therefore, we testedthe modulation of P2 by beta-catenin (the co-activator ofTCF/LEF), but also by p53 and DeltaNp63 itself. Weconfirmed the repression of P2 by p53 and its activation byDeltaNp63alpha, both independently of the p53RE. Moreover,we showed an activation of P2 by beta-catenin. All theseeffects are through a direct binding of p53, DeltaNp63 andbeta-catenin on P2 promoter. We are currently mapping theTCF/LEF binding sites involved in the activation ofDeltaNp63 by beta- catenin. Since stabilization and delocalization of beta-catenin is frequently observed in tumours, we searched oesophageal SCC. Beta-catenin delocalizationwas in 13 out of the 16 samples tested (81%).Furthermore, 11 of these 13 tumours also exhibited DeltaNp63accumulation (84%). Our results suggest overexpression in SCC. Thefunctional cross-talk between these two proteins is currentlyunder investigation, in order to determine if they are able topromote together abnormal cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. 146 NARRATIONS OF \"INQUIRING AND CONFUSED\"CANCER PATIENTS Sandra Degli Esposti ElisiResearcher and Professor of Cultural Anthropology, Department of Sciences of Education \"Giovanni MariaBertin\", Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Italy Contemporary anthropological and sociological literature on health places attention frequently on patients' everyday lifenarrations; through these, they make sense of their pathology,their recovery, to the necessity to share their own experiences,their own convictions and expectations.In particular in our modern time often these narrations are mediated via new technologies, I would point out how these become patient's genuine diary of life in which he tells aboutthe daily challenge of cancer and the suffering, but also of thesearch for information, advice and aid. Narrations that areimportant to outline the figure of a \"inquiring\" but at the sametime \"confused\" patient in the face of the multiplicity of inputshe receives. In this context research has investigated some telematic 'spaces' (born at the border of magazines on health andwellness), from discussion forums to chat-lines, from sitesdedicated to different pathologies to blogs to outline thepatient's universe, that the health professionals and of weavingof consequent relations.Member of: AISEA, Italian Association of EthnoanthropologicalSciences; SSE/SGE, Societ\u00e9 Suisse d'Ethnologie;PARACELSUS, Centre of Social Studies on Health, Care andQuality of Life, University of Ferrara, Italy. 147 SINGLET OXYGEN ( 1O2) FORMED Fotiou, Stelios Fotiou and George Deliconstantinos Department of Experimental Physiology, University of Athens Medical School, Athens 11527, Greece Resveratrol (3,4,5-trihydroxystilbene), a natural phytoalexin found in the grape skin and wine, expresses a wide range ofpharmacological properties including antioxidant activity. Ourpresent experiments showed that resveratrol as a stable radicalgives a chemiluminescence theright at ~4\u00d710 5cpm, clearly showing its scavenging activity. In chemiluminescence studies, in the presence of a stableamount of nitrosoglutathione (~10 -6M), low concentrations singlet oxygen (1O2) that originating nitrosoglutathione peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Beta-carotene acts as an acceptor of 1O2 formed by resveratrol as tested in fluorometric studies (a) by inhibition ofhydroxylation of terepthalic acid and (b) by an increase of theoxidation rate of resveratrol shown by the decrease of itsfluorescence spectrum Ex 330, Em 374). Synaptosomes isolated from rabbit brain release nitric oxide (NO) and resveratrol increases NO synthase (NOS) activitywhile NO was converted to ONOO -verifying the formation of singlet oxygen (NO + 1O2\u00a1ONOO-). Similar results were also obtained with xanthine oxidase (XO) Fluorescencepolarization studies using diphenyl-hexatriene (TMA-DPH)Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3255showed a decrease in the fluorescence polarization of TMA- DPH incorporated in the synaptosomal membranes fromr=0.205 to r=0.157, consistent with an increase in membranefluidity thus relieving the physical constrain imposed by thelipids on enzymes, pumps, channels etc. The oxidative damage to biomolecules induced by 1O2and the protective effects of beta-carotene were evaluated by the enhanced peakchemiluminescence response of resveratrol in the presence ofDNA and/or beta carotene. The concentration-dependentenhancement of resveratrol-DNA complex peakchemiluminescence observed was decreased in the presenceof beta-carotene clearly showing the damaging effects ofresveratrol due to the formation of 1O2. In conclusion we showed that at low concentrations, resveratrol acts as a prooxidant while at high concentrationsas an antioxidant and that damages of biomolecules byresveratrol could result from the formation of singlet oxygenthat may act alone and/or in combination with nitric oxide toform the cytotoxic ONOO -. 148 OXIDATIVE STRESS CAUSED BY ULTRA VIOLET CIN RAT SKIN MICROVESSELS AND MICROSOMESWITH RESPECT TO Fotiou and George Deliconstantinos Department of Experimental Physiology, University of Athens Medical School, Athens 11527, Greece The aim of the present study was to investigate whether UVC irradiation of the skin could result in the formation of oxygenand/or nitrogen free radicals. When heme-iron is present in theskin it can act both as a strong oxidative agent itself and as asource of continuous free radical production having thereforethe potential to cause skin damages. In our experiments UVC irradiated microvessels isolated from rat skin produce NO and ONOO -. When irradiation takes place ONOO-is attached to OH group in the Fe3+of hematin to form the stable radical hematin-Fe-[(OH)ONOO]2-as follows: Hematin-Fe-NO + O2-\u00a1Hematin-Fe-(OH)ONOO2- The stable radical hematin-Fe-(OH)ONOO2-was detected by UV diode array spectroscopy at 420 nm. ONOO-was determined either oxidation and emission at 528 nm. Microsomes isolated from rat skin released nitric oxide (NO), which was enhanced by arginine and reduced by nitro-arginine. UVC irradiation activated both NO synthase andxanthine oxidase activities leading to the formation ofONOO -. Fluorescence polarization studies using diphenyl- hexatriene (TMA-DPH) for the estimation of the membranefluidity, showed an increase in the fluorescence polarization of TMA-DPH incorporated in the microsomal membranesfrom r=0.179 to r=0.600 consistent with a decrease inmembrane lipid fluidity suggesting a constrain imposed by thelipid bilayer on the function of enzymes, pumps and/orchannels. As shown herein UVC exposure causes the generation of the free radical Fe-[(OH)ONOO-] 2-and NO and oxygen free radicals in the skin microcirculation and skin layers. The vastmajority of people daily spent some time in the daylight andbecause it is not the conventional \"sun bathing\", it would nothave been expected that daily, suberythemal exposure to thesun causes photodamage and possibly cancer as a result, inpart, of UV-mediated increase of skin oxidative stress.Therefore, our studies are broadly viewed as refocusing theconcept of preventing photoaging and skin cancer using atopical application of a composition having a Fenton reactionblocker. 149 CANCER CELLS PHAGOCYTOSIS BY MAST CELLS Filippo Messina, Italy The data in the literature confirm the hypothesis that incidence of cancer disease is lower in allergic individuals. In a previousstudy, we too confirmed that histamine plays a role inprotecting against cancer. Briefly, Sprague-Dawley rats werefirst inoculated with of Yoshida ascites sarcoma. In 80% of the rats treated in thisway, no cancer disease onset was reported. In a different study,histamine and selenium were assayed in subjects with lungcancer. In tumor subjects, significant decreases in bothhistamine and selenium were reported ( p<0.0001) as compared with healthy control subjects. Our present study focused on mast cell activity in breast carcinoma. We found that mast cell numbers were higher inhigh hormone receptive cancer, and we focused mainly oncytolysis of neoplastic cells that help the body to protect itselffrom oncogenic aggression. It was demonstrated that cancercells are first surrounded by the mast cell pseudopodium; theyare then engulfed in the mast cell cytoplasm, where toxicgranulations trigger the cytolytic process. The phagocytosedcell progressively loses its chromatic and volumetriccharacteristics until complete achromia and almost completereduction of its volume and consistency occur. The cellnucleus soon degenerates to pyknosis, and is no moredetectable. The phagocytosis can occur simultaneously Romano DemicheliIstituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy The review analyzes the recent evolution of two paradigms related to the development of breast cancer metastases. Thecontinuous growth model is required to yield to an interruptedgrowth model, the tantamount of which are episodes of\"tumour dormancy\". Primary tumour removal, usuallyconsidered as intrinsically beneficial, proves to be able toperturb metastatic homeostasis and to result, for some patients,in the acceleration of metastatic cancer spread. Paradigmevolution is supported by a growing body of findings fromexperimental models and is required to explain breast cancerrecurrence dynamics for patients undergoing surgery withoutor with adjuvant chemotherapy. Classical models that were proposed to explain breast cancer metastasis dynamics after primary tumour removalassumed the implicit hypothesis that tumours must alwaysgrow. The concept of uninterrupted growth failed to explainfindings from both local and local plus distant recurrences. Inparticular, the bimodal recurrence pattern, which presents anearly peak at the second year after surgery, a second peak atabout 5 years and a tapered plateau-like tail extending up to15 years, should be explained. This pattern is independent ofthe seeded organ, and may be observed in all metastatic sites.On the contrary, a new dormancy-based model of metastasisdevelopment was found to better fit clinical data. Accordingto this model, metastatic tumour may either continuously growor even sojourn in two dormant states, i.e. single cells and avascular micrometastases, with orderly transitions betweenthese two dormant states eventually resulting in progressiveappearance of clinical metastases. Moreover, someprecipitating event at the time of primary tumour surgicalremoval may have a triggering effect. In spite of a century ofinvestigations, the effects of primary tumour surgical removalon metastases have practically been ignored by clinicians.Single cells may be induced to proliferate via the conversion of non-cycling G0 cells or by switching avascular micro-metastatic foci to active angiogenesis. These processes occurto different extent in pre- and post-menopausal patients. Themodel found confirmation by the analysis of the recurrencerisk for patients receiving adjuvant CMF, where the recurrencereduction occurred at specific, temporally separate recurrenceclusters at the first and third year, for both menopausalstatuses. The proposed dormancy-based metastasis development model implies some kind of control on tumour growth fromthe microenvironment, some kind of homeostatic effect upondistant metastases. These concepts are poorly understandablewithin the classical frame, where cancer is a genome-drivendisease, i.e. a cell-autonomous irreversible process and where the tumour microenvironment is an idle bystander, sometimesforced to provide factors tumour progression.However, all somatic phenotype,insignificant role of the microenvironment) have beenchallenged by experimental evidence both in vitro and in vivo . A new image of breast cancer is emerging. Cells that we label\"cancer cells\" go on with their peculiar ability to have cross-talk with the environment. This trait accounts for theneoplastic behaviour, ranging from quiescence to open growth,in different sites and/or at different times. Tumour dormancyand the counterintuitive consequence of primary tumourremoval have a logical place in this context. The traditionalimage of breast cancer is changing. 151 PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS OF TELOMERASEINHIBITION BY TELOMERE complexes and repeated 'TTAGGG' double strand DNA sequences ended by a 3'single strand DNA of the same sequence. Progressive telomereshortening is observed in vitro upon cell divisions and with ageing in vivo . At a critical telomere length, shortened telomeres trigger a permanent growth arrest known asreplicative senescence. Telomerase is an RNA-dependent DNApolymerase that extends telomeres by adding 'TTAGGG'repeats. It consists of a functional RNA component (hTR)which serves as template and a catalytic protein (hTERT) withreverse transcriptase activity. The expression of hTERT aloneis sufficient for the immortalisation of cells. Telomerase ishighly expressed in tumor cells but at very low level in mostsomatic cells. These observations make the telomerase anattractive target for anticancer strategies. One of thesestrategies relies on the use of drug candidates able to stabilizethe particular telomere G-quadruplex DNA structures. Thestabilization of these structures makes the telomereinaccessible for telomerase and thus inhibits telomeraseactivity. The effect of the hTERT transfection was first studied on the proteome of human WI38 fibroblast cells (1). Then, theproteome alteration response of hTERT transfected WI38 cellsAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3257induced by the treatment of two G-quadruplexes ligands, telomestatin and TMPyP4, was analyzed. Both have different selectivity for thedifferent G-quadruplexes structures. Proteome analysis of the treated cells reveals that TMPyP4 induces much more protein expression alterations thantelomestatin probably due to its poor selectivity. TMPyP4induces especially a drastic down expression of the hnRNPs, amodulation of the proteasome pathway, an apparent decreaseof the translation and an over expression of several molecularchaperones. Telomestatin induces in particular an overexpression of the protein BCL2A1 which is involved in drug-resistance of cancer cells and a probable increase of thetranslation. Both treatments have a common effect particularlyon the molecular chaperone CCT (down expression), HSP90alpha (over expression) and hnRNP D (down expression). Theprotein HSP90 alpha is also over expressed in hTERTtransfected cells compared to parental cells. This protein isalready a promising anticancer target protein due to its centralrole in oncogenesis and in telomerase activity regulation. 1 Mazzucchelli et al: Proteome Science 6: 2008. CANCER IMAGING WITHBIOLOGICALLY FUNCTIONALIZED GOLDNANOPARTICLES IN 2D AND Fl\u00e9ron1, Greisch1, major challenge in oncology is to develop more accurate imaging assessments. The ADONIS Project intends to provethe concept of using optoacoustic imaging with biologicallyfunctionalized nanoparticles as an integrated biosensor basedimaging system for the production of specific and sensitivedata for accurate diagnosis of prostate cancer. This conceptinvolves using contrast agents which upon photoactivationinduce the local heating of their environment, generatingpressure waves that are detectable by piezoelectric transducers. One of the main objectives of this project is to produce and validate a versatile lab system composed of functionalizednanoparticles for diagnosis of different superficial andaccessible cancers, e.g. prostate cancer. Gold nanorods have been synthesized and functionalized with antibodies targetingspecific antigens on cancer cell lines. The challengeconsists in synthesizing rod-like nanoparticles absorbing about 1064 nm, the spectral range where biological tissues absorb theleast. A wet chemical approach in solution, using surfactantsas dynamic template and silver nitrate as growth inhibitor, isused for synthesis. Once the particles have been synthesized,the surfactant is replaced by a biocompatible polymer for use inin vitro tests. The polymer-coated nanoparticles are then coupled with an antibody directed against the cancer cells toguarantee the selective detection of the particles. Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), a transmembrane protein considered as a suitable biomarker forprostate cancer, was selected as the primary target.Recognition and successful binding of the biosensor to PSMAis demonstrated by various techniques using cell monolayersand 3D cell cultures. PSMA localization on the LNCaP that the biosensor isbound to the viable and fixed cells expressing PSMA. Gold particles attached to cancer cells serve as contrast agents for optoacoustic detection. The concept of detectingPSMA-expressing tumours using this integrated optoacousticbiosensor system was confirmed on spheroids (cellaggregates) in gelatine phantoms. This on in vivo human tumour xenograft animal models and in the future will be tested on human tumour biopsies.6th Framework Programme of the European Commission,STREP n NMP4-CT-2005-016880. 153 CLINICAL AND Italy Background: Diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (DMPM) is a rare and rapidly lethal neoplasm. In recent years,the combination of cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermicintraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS+HIPEC) has resulted in asignificant survival improvement, as compared to historicalcontrols. Little is known about DMPM genetic and molecularfeatures. In the present study, we assessed new prognosticindicators and therapeutic targets in a large series of DMPMundergoing CRS+HIPEC. Methods: From a prospective data- base of 86 cases, we selected 66 DMPM. Cases with well-ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3258differentiated histology or second malignancies excluded. patients peritonectomyprocedures and closed-abdomen HIPEC with cisplatin anddoxorubicin. The extension, completeness of cytoreduction (CC)and HIPEC drug schedule was tested by multivariate analysis.We evaluated the expression of members of Protein (IAP) family (survivin, maintenance mechanisms(telomerase activity and alternative lengthening of telomeres[ALT]). In 1-118), 40 and 17 months. OS and age to PFS. IAPs weresimultaneously up-regulated in a high percentage of DMPMs(survivin was present in >90% of cases). Survivin geneknockdown in mesothelioma cells resulted in a significant andtime-dependent decline of in vitro growth and enhanced rate of spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis. At least onetelomere maintenance mechanism was present in 86% ofDMPMs. Telomerase activity correlated to poor OS and PFS,whereas ALT failed to significantly affect clinical outcome.Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses showedEGFR, PDGFRA and PDGFRB expression and activation inmost cases. Autocrine loop activation of these receptors wassuggested in all cases by the expression of the related cognateligands, in absence of receptor gain of function mutations. NoPI3KCA mutations were found, while all DMPMs showedexpression of expression/activation of AKT, ERK,mTOR and S6. Conclusion: CRS+HIPEC associated to encouraging survival results. Both telomere maintenancemechanisms, telomerase activity and ALT are present inDMPM and differentially affect prognosis. EGFR, PDGFRAand PDGFRB are promising molecular targets tailoredtreatments. Nazionale Tumori, Milano, Italy Peritoneal surface malignancies (PSM) represent the end-stage of many intrabdominal tumors. Better knowledge of biology,natural history and pattern of dissemination (PSM remain confined within the peritoneal cavity for most of their clinicalcourse), makes a locoregional approach combiningCytoreductive Surgery (CRS) and Hyperthermic Chemotherapy Theintraperitoneal maximizes the simultaneously minimizes systemic toxicity. Hyperthermiaincreases tumor cell chemosensitivity. Due to the limitedHIPEC penetration into tumor tissue, peritonectomyprocedures and multi-visceral resections are required forcytoreduction down to microscopic/minimal residual disease. Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death, with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) occurringin 50% of patients. Median survival in PC patients is about 6months. A prospective randomized study has shown thesuperiority of CRS+HIPEC over standard treatment. Ovarian cancer accounts for the greatest number of deaths from gynecological malignancy. 75% of cases are diagnosed atstage III/IVwith a median survival of 36 months. According to several phase II studies the treatment of ovarian cancer PC with CRS+IPHP has provided 5-yearsurvival rates of 15-63%. Peritoneal mesothelioma is an uncommon tumor with a median survival of less than 1 year. CRS and HIPEC havereportedly resulted into a survival improvement to 32-94months. Pseudomyxoma peritonei is a rare conditionoriginating from an appendiceal mucinous tumor. Thisminimally invasive disease is associated to poor long termprognosis, due to its tendency of locoregional relapse. CRSand HIPEC have been advocated as the treatment of choice. 155 BRAIN TUMOURS EX VIVO AND THEIR CLINICAL APPLICATION Leo De Ridder Department of Histology, Ghent University, Belgium Introduction: Several special features are specific for brain tumours: poor definition followed by infiltrative growth,richin various cell types,progression towards malignancy, nearlycomplete absence of metastasis and finally brain tumour killat the site of origin. These characteristics can be analysed ex vivo especially infiltration and progression. Although morphological as well as other observations on biopsies give aframework for research, investigations outside the body are notonly useful but mandatory. Materials and Methods: Several model systems are available. Animal and human brain tumourscan be propagated over varying periods in cell, tissue andorganotypical cultures. However since the development ofculture techniques, it is clear that the closer the modelresembles the in vivo situation the more reliable the results are With this in mind, it is essential to select a given ex vivoAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3259method to answer a given question. Results: Monolayers of primary cultures and cell lines, spheroidal aggregates,organotypical and confronting cultures will answer differentquestions concerning the biological behaviour of brain tumourderived cells. Monolayer cultures of cell lines answer generalmetabolic problems, primary monolayer cultures will giveanswers for the individual tumour cells and pharmacologicalsubstances can be tested but are not applicable for infiltrationstudies. Tumour cell aggregates, formed by reassociation oftumour derived cells, consist of viable cells including nontransformed normal brain cells. They are tridimensional andspheroidal. These aggregates can be used for testingantimitotic and radioprotective substances at the individuallevel and every single tumour can be evaluated for itsproliferation characteristics. Organotypical cultures are tumourfragments freshly collected from the surgical amphitheatre.They are difficult to keep in vitro as they are contaminated by necrotic material. On the other hand, confrontations betweentumour derived aggregates and host tissue aggregates seem toanswer the problems of infiltration and proliferation. Differentvariations in confrontation cultures are available. Heterologousand autologous confrontations are at hand. The mostpromising technique might be the confrontation of braintumour aggregates with aggregates of normal cells of thepatient the tumour is derived from (called: homologousconfrontation). The optimal condition is not yet realised.Conclusion: The actual ex vivo techniques allow to evaluate the effects of therapy at the individual level, to distinguish theradioprotective capacity of substances, to analyse theinfiltrative and proliferative capacity of the individual braintumour and to study basic mechanisms of infiltration. 156 DYNAMIC REGULATION OF LOW MOLECULARWEIGHT PROTEIN TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE(LMW-PTP) TRANSIENT NATURE OF . Ferreira and Maikel P. Peppelenbosch Department of Cell Biology, University of Groningen Antonius Deusinglaan, Groningen, the Netherlands LMW-PTP (Low Molecular Protein Phosphatase) is frequently overexpressed in various human cancers. LMW-PTPlocalizes predominantly to the cytoplasm and functions asphosphatase, but its function in cellular signaling remainsunknown. In this work we investigated the role of LMWPTPin JAK/STAT pathway in GMCSF modulated byGMSCF. of GM-CSF for 2 h and stimulatedwith GM-CSF for 5 min show a 5-fold decrease in LMWPTPactivity, coinciding with binding of the inactive phosphatase to STAT5. This initial phase is followed by a 2-fold up-regulationof LMWPTP activity after 20 min of GM-CSF stimulation, anda release of STAT5 binding. Interestingly, we demonstrate forthe first time that LMW-PTP is present in the nucleus in aninactive state, and shuttles to the cytosol upon GM-CSFstimulation. These results suggest a dual role for LMW-PTP,in which an inactive form of the protein binds to STAT5 in thecytosol followed by activation of the phosphatase enzymaticactivity and STAT5 dephosphorylation. Hence LMW-PTPseems a cardinal mediator of GM-CSF-dependent STAT5activation, ensuring the transient nature of the response. 157 CISPLATIN OTOTOXICITY - FROM DOSE TOMOLECULAR BIOLOGY Dirk DeusterDepartment of Pediatric of Muenster, Kardinal-von-Galen-Ring10, D-48149 Muenster, Germany Cisplatin is effectively used for the treatment of several childhood malignancies, but its use is limited by itsototoxicity. It includes a usually permanent sensory hearingloss, tinnitus, and alterations in vestibular function. The riskestimates for ototoxicity after cisplatin range from 23 to 53%depending on the criteria used and the diligence of the search.To answer specific questions, such as individual tolerance, ahearing loss classification relating to intensity and the affectedfrequencies are required. We developed our own classificationsystem based on pure tone audiometry, which detects hearingloss earlier and maps progression of hearing loss moreprecisely than the existing high frequency classifications. Thisclassification system is now used in all our research. In animals, damage of various structures of the inner ear like hair cells, stria vascularis, and spiral ganglion could beobserved. The mechanisms of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity arepoorly understood so far. High rates of cisplatin delivery,cumulative dosage, pre-existing sensorineural hearing loss, age<5 were identified as risk factors for ototoxicity, but apartfrom these factors interindividual susceptibility to theototoxicity was observed in clinical studies and animal tests.So genetic predispositions could be possible causes forototoxocity: i) Oxidative stress has been implicated in cisplatinototoxicity. Therefore, differences in protection mechanismsagainst oxidative stress may be one possible reason for theindividual susceptibility. We found significant inter-groupdifference of glutathione S-transferase, an enzyme, whichplays an important role in protecting cells from the deleteriouseffects of oxidative stress. ii) Moreover, genetic variants intransporters for platinum uptake may be responsible for theindividual platin tolerance. We found differences in a (2008) 3260synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the gene as another possible risk factor for ototoxicity. Atpresent, we search specific transporters and their inhibition. Prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss needs both more knowledge about the mechanisms of ototoxicity andearly detection with professional audiological examinations.We will decide in favour of an interdisciplinary team toinvestigate further aspects of cisplatin-induces ototoxicity.Lanvers-Kaminsky C, Krefeld B, Dinnesen AG et al : Continuous or repeated prolonged cisplatin infusion inchildren: a prospective study in ototoxicity, serum PediatricBlood HebeisenA et al: S- transferase genetic polymorphisms and individual Lanvers C, Deuster D et al : Megalin genetic polymorphisms and individual sensitivity to the ototoxic The Otolaryngology Surgery 15: 364-369, 2007. Schmidt CM, Bartholomaeus E, Deuster D et al : The \"Muenster hearing lossfollowing Hamburg, Germany Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The failure of clinical staging in prediction of thecourse of disease in many patients shows the need to consideradditional predictive factors. Several chromosomal regions areamplified or deleted in lung tumors, but little is known aboutthe underlying genes, which could be important mediators intumor formation or progression. Patients and Methods: High- level amplifications were screened by array-CGH and verifiedby fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and the protein expression of two amplified genes, FOXA1 and NKX2-1 , was studied on a TMA containing 613 tumor samples. Results: 40% of the lung adenocarcinomas showed narrow high high-level amplicon at 14q13.3-q21.1containing FOXA1 and NKX2-1 , two important genes for lung morphogenesis, was found in two cases by array-CGH. FISHanalysis showed high-level amplifications of FOXA1 and NKX2-1 and 27%/35% of all tumors were positive for NKX2-1 and FOXA1 protein expression.Patients with distant metastases showed significantly higherexpression of FOXA1 than patients without distant spread(p=0.003). Time to metastasis was significantly shorter in patients with high level expression of NKX2-1 than in patientswith low level or no expression ( p=0.032), especially in LCLC ( p=0.008). Conclusion: The results of our study of a large series of lung tumors indicate a negativeprognostic function of FOXA1 and NKX2-1 in lung cancer,especially in LCLC. NKX2-1 could be a useful marker forselection of patients who should undergo systemic treatmentfor prevention of early systemic spread. 159 HUMAN ANTIBODY AND KUNITZ DOMAIN-BASEDPROTEASE INHIBITORS FOR CANCER THERAPY Laetitia Devy 1, Art Robert C. Ladner1, Shafaat Clive R. Wood1 and Daniel T. Dransfield1 1Dyax Corp., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, USA; 2Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada We have used phage display libraries of both fully human antibodies and variants of a Kunitz domain derived fromhuman tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) to select potentand selective inhibitors of proteases. These have allowed us toassess the contributions of a number of proteases to cancerprogression in preclinical models. The success of thisapproach and the therapeutic potential of these proteaseinhibitors will be illustrated by our work with plasmin andmatrix metalloproteinase-14. Plasmin is a serine protease predominantly body in its inactive zymogen form (plasminogen). Itsactivation mainly occurs locally, at the tumor site by urokinaseoverproduced by cancer or stromal cells. Using phage display,we have identified DX-1000, a variant Kunitz domain derivedfrom TFPI which is a specific and high affinity inhibitor ofplasmin (Ki 99 pM). We increased the molecular mass of DX-1000 by chemically coupling four 5 kDa polyethylene glycol(PEG) moieties in order to improve its pharmacokineticproperties. 4PEG-DX-1000 efficiently blocks plasmin-mediated proMMP-9 activation on cells while not significantlyaffecting haemostasis and coagulation in vitro . In a human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 xenograft model, 4PEG-DX-1000 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of primarytumor growth and a decreased incidence of metastases.Together, our results demonstrate the potential of plasmininhibitors for blocking cancer growth and metastases.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3261MMP-14 is a membrane-bound zinc endopeptidase that has been proposed to play a central role in tumor growth, invasionand neovascularization. Besides cleaving activity. examine the contributionof MMP-14 to tumor growth and angiogenesis, we used DX-2400, a highly selective MMP-14 inhibitory antibody. DX-2400 blocked proMMP-2 processing on tumor and endothelialcells, inhibited angiogenesis and slowed tumor progressionand formation of metastatic lesions. This combination ofpotency, selectivity and in vivo activity demonstrate the potential of a selective MMP-14 inhibitor for the treatment ofsolid tumors. INV ASIVECANCER GROWTH Olivier De WeverLaboratory of Experimental Cancer Research, Department of Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine, Ghent UniversityHospital, 9000 Gent, Belgium Tumor-associated myofibroblasts drive tissue invasion, a hallmark of malignancy (4). The origin of myofibroblasts atthe tumor invasion front remains controversial althoughfibroblasts and bone marrow-derived precursors are consideredto be the main progenitor cells. To better understand themechanisms underlying such effects, we established aheterotypic model of human colon tumor-derivedmyofibroblasts in co-culture with human colon cancer cells(HCT8/E11), matrices. We two convergent proinvasive agentssecreted matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C (TNC), each ofwhich is necessary though not sufficient for invasion.Myofibroblast-stimulated invasion into collagen type I ischaracterized by a change from a round, nonmigratorymorphotype with high RhoA and low Rac activity to anelongated, migratory morphotype with low RhoA and highRac activity (2). The myofibroblasts are themselves invasiveand this activity is stimulated by TGF-. N-cadherin isimplicated in the invasion response of myofibroblasts (3). Inconclusion, the mutual interaction between cancer cells andmyofibroblasts is dependent on multiple invasive growthpromoting factors (through direct cell-cell contacts andparacrine signals) (1). Our data predict that inhibitors directedat this reciprocal molecular and cellular crosstalk will havetherapeutic applications for targeting the invasive growth ofhuman primary tumors and their metastatic spread (5). 1 Denys H, Derycke L, Hendrix A, Westbroek W, Gheldof A, Narine K, Pauwels P, Gespach C, Bracke M and De WeverO: Differential impact of TGF- and EGF on fibroblastdifferentiation and reciprocally promotes coloncancer invasion.

Oncogene 5615-5625, 2007. 161 CARCINOGENESIS ( IN VIVO procumbens leaves has been evidenced in various types of cells either related with itsantiproliferative effect or apoptotic induction. Proliferativeinhibition is one of mechanisms to inhibit malignancy. Thep53gene can activate the transcription of downstream effector genes such as p21 WAF1to induce cell cycle arrest. The aim of this study was to elucidate the anticarcinogenic potency of G. procumbens leaves through the induction of p21WAF1and p53 expressions in chemical carcinogen induced-oralcarcinogenesis. Ninety-two male Sprague Dawley rats weredivided into 11 groups consisting of control groups and groupstreated with the chemical carcinogen, 4 nitroquinoline 1-oxide,and by ethanolic extract of G. procumbens leaves. Chemical carcinogen was administered thrice weekly for 8, 16 or 24weeks, whereas the extract was given twice weekly in certainperiods commencing either before or after the carcinogenadministration. At the end of the 36th week, histopathologicalexamination (H&E) and immunohistochemical analysis usinglabeled expression RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3262P21WAF1and P53 were conducted. Histopathological analysis showed that the ethanolic extract of G. procumbens leaves had an oral anticarcinogenic effect in initiation phase eitherthrough its preventative (Group II) or prophylactic effect(Group III). Inhibitory mechanism of the ethanolic extract ofG. leaves in oral carcinogenesis occurred by inducing P21 WAF1expression. This mechanism was demonstrated by the expression of P21WAF1 in tissues which P53 expression was not found. From these results, it isapparent that the ethanolic extract of G. procumbens leaves could inhibit oral carcinogenenesis through its preventive andprophylactic effects in initiation phase by inducing P21 WAF1 expression independently of wt P53. 162 P90 POTENTIAL PROMISING ANTICANCER THERAPIES? C. DimasLaboratory of Pharmacology-Pharmacotechnology, Basic Sciences Center, Biomedical Research Foundation ofAcademy of Athens (BRFAA), Athens, Greece The p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) of the MAPK (mitogen-activatedprotein kinase) pathway. The family is constituted of four genesin humans and other mammals (RSK1, 2, 3 and 4). Thoseenzymes are composed of two distinct and functional kinasedomains, located in the carboxy-terminal (CTKD) and anotherone located at the amino-terminal domain areactivated by a series of sequential events.RSKs function as mediators of ERK signal transduction andhave been found so far to be expressed in all cell lines andtissues studied. Numerous substrates have been reported suchas GSK3 (proliferation and metabolism), p27kip1 inhibitor), bad (pro-apoptotic protein), I B and p65 (NFB-pathway). Thus, studies so far suggest that RSKs may promote cell survival by inactivating apoptotic effectors andmediating cell growth and proliferation by regulating factorsinvolved in transcription and mRNA translation. Among RSK isoforms, rsk2 mutations and dysfunction have been linked in humans to Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS, X-linked mental retardation syndrome) that is often accompaniedby dysmorphisms in face and digits and by progressiveskeletal deformations. Recent studies point towards a linkbetween RSK activity and cancer as they demonstrate thatRSK1 and 2 are overexpressed among different types ofcancer. The recent identification of specific RSK inhibitors,such as small molecule inhibitors and RNAi, may help to shedlight on the role of these enzymes in oncogenesis and theirpotential usefulness as targets for the development of novelanticancer drugs.163 VISUALIZATION OF ANGIOGENESIS IN BRAIN Medical of Neuro-Surgery, Medical University of Vienna; 3Department University of Vienna; 4Austrian Research Center, Seibersdorf; 5Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria Aim: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major angiogenic factor. VEGF receptors have been shown to beover-expressed in a variety of tumor vessels includingglioblastoma, which may provide the molecular basis for asuccessful use of radiolabeled VEGF as tumor angiogenesistracer. In this study we investigated the use of 123I-VEGF as angiogenesis tracer for imaging brain tumors in vivo. Methods and Results: SPECT examinations were performed 10 minutes after intravenous administration of123I-VEGF (191\u00b115 MBq) and 18 hours post injection in 20 patientswith brain tumor. Glioblastomas were visualized in 7 of 8patients (88%) shortly after application of 123I-VEGF and were still clearly shown 18 hours post injection. Negativescan results were obtained in one patient with a smallglioblastoma size (diameter <2.0 cm) and in 3 patients withbenign glioma as well as in 5 patients with glioblastoma afterreceiving radiotherapy and /or chemotherapy. Weak positiveresults were obtained in 3 patients with brain lymphoma orother tumors. No side-effects were observed in patients afteri.v.administration of 123I-VEGF. Conclusion: Our results indicate that 123I-VEGF scintigraphy may be useful to visualize the angiogenesis of brain tumors and to monitor thetreatment response.This study was partly supported by the Jubil\u00e4umsfonds ofAustrian Nationalbank (Project No: Annalisa Lorenzato and Maria Flavia Di Renzo Laboratory of Cancer Genetics, Department of OncologicalSciences at the Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment(IRCC), University of Torino Medical School, SP 142, Km.95, 10060 Candiolo, TO, ItalyAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3263Cancer is a genetic disease, due to the accumulation of mutations in genes (oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes)that control the balance between cell birth and cell death. Insome cases these are germline and inherited, while the largemajority are somatic mutations. Interestingly, in most cases,such as in inherited kidney cancer syndromes, the same genescause both inherited and sporadic (non-inherited) forms ofcancer. As the molecular basis of disease continues to be elucidated, familial cancer syndromes, which consist of arange of neoplastic and non-neoplastic features, are emerging.The usual pathway of referral to a genetics clinic or familialcancer centre is via either a surgeon or an oncologist, when high-risk features that suggest a possible hereditary basis forthe presenting cancer are recognized. Traditionally, these high-risk features include more than two family members withsimilar types of cancer over two or more generations, a youngage of onset, and more than one synchronous or metachronoustumour. These features are effective in ascertaining asubstantial proportion of families with hereditary cancer.However, there are a range of familial cancer syndromes thatare not easily detected and can remain undiagnosed whenhistory and examination are not extended to include cancer inother sites and non-malignant features. Identification of predisposition to develop cancer is particularly important in the case of inherited kidney cancersyndromes, as it provides individuals and their families withthe opportunity to undertake early surveillance for malignantcomplications that might in time be shown to undertakenephron-sparing surgery and to improve outcomes. Kidneycancer with diverse aggressiveness has been associated withgermline mutations of one of the following genes: VHL, MET, FH, BHD orTSC. The genetic mechanism, histopathology and clinical history of kidney cancer associated with each of theabove gene mutation will be discussed. 165 NOVEL ROLES OF ETS1 IN CANCERPROGRESSION J\u00fcrgen Dittmer Clinic for Gynaecology, University of Halle, Halle (Saale), Germany Etstranscription factors, such as Ets1, play an important role in cancer progression. Ras-responsive Ets1 promotes invasionof tumor cells by orchestrating the expression of ECM-degradating proteases. Ets1 is also involved in tumor-inducedneo-angiogenesis. A search for additional targets for Ets1revealed a link between Ets1 and Rho-GTPases. Ets1 up-regulates the expression of Rho-GDI, an In primary breast cancer, Ets1 and Rho-GDI arecoexpressed. An analysis of Rho-GDI function in breastcancer cells revealed that Rho-GDI has a dual effect. By inhibiting cellular migration, Rho-GDI acts tumor-suppressively; by inducing the expression of the oncogeneCox-2 Rho-GDI likely promotes tumor progression. Rho-GDI regulates Cox-2, by cooperating with the Rho-GTPase guanine exchange factor Vav1, which is coexpressed withRho-GDI in primary breast cancer. Despite its positive effecton Cox-2, Rho-GDI was not found to negatively affect thesurvival of breast cancer patients, rather, patients with Rho-GDI-positive breast cancer tend to have a better outcome.This tendency was more pronounced when breast tumors werenegative for Rho-GDI, a ubiquitously expressed closerelative of Rho-GDI. In contrast to Rho-GDI, Rho-GDIsignificantly increased survival of breast cancer patients. Thiseffect, however, was absent when Rho-GDI was expressed.It seems that both the Ets1-regulated Rho-GDI and Rho-GDI are capable of slowing down cancer progression.However, the effect of Rho-GDI is compromised by itsability to induce Cox-2 expression. 166 TUMOR RECOVERY BY ANGIOGENIC SWITCHFROM SPROUTING TO AFTER University of University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland Background: Inhibitors of angiogenesis and radiation induce compensatory changes in the tumor vasculature not onlyduring treatment, but also after its cessation. Methods: To assess the response to the treatment, the tumors wereanalyzed immediately after cessation of therapy and duringthe recovery phase. Mammary carcinoma allografts wereinvestigated by vascular casting, electron, light, confocalmicroscopy, inhibitor, PTK787/ZK222854. Results: Irradiation and antiangiogenic therapy had similar effects on the tumorvasculature in the recovery phase. Both treatments reducedthe tumor vascularization, particularly in the tumor medulla.After cessation of therapy, the tumor vasculature expandedpredominantly by 3264of sinusoidal-like vessels multiple transluminal tissue pillars. Tumor revascularizationoriginated from preserved SMA-positive vessels in tumorcortex. Quantification revealed that recovery wascharacterized by an angiogenic switch from sprouting tointussusception. The up-regulated duringthe recovery reflected the recruitment of cellsfor intussusception as a part of the angioadaptive mechanism.Tumor recovery was associated with a dramatic decrease (by30-40%) in the intratumoral microvascular density, probablyas result of intussusceptive pruning, surprisingly with only aminimal reduction of the total microvascular (exchange)area. Therefore, the vascular supply to the tumor was notseverely compromised as demonstrated by HIF-1-alphaexpression. Conclusion: Irradiation and antiangiogenic therapy causes a switch from sprouting to intussusceptiveangiogenesis as part of a compensatory response to preserveand restore perfusion. Intussusceptive angiogenesis, with anassociated low endothelial proliferation rate andpermeability, may represent an escape mechanism andaccount for the development of resistance to therapy, as wellas the rapid recovery of tumor vasculature after cessation oftherapy. 167 CHEMOSENSITIVITY TESTING: PREDICTING THEUNPREDICTABLE Ralph DollnerDepartment Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Rikshospitalet University Clinic Oslo, N-0027 Oslo, Norway Objective: According to a recent assessment of the working group for technology assessment by the American Society ofClinical Oncology (ASCO), a reliable assay for detectingchemosensitivity in tumour and selectingchemotherapeutic agents for individual patients is stillmissing (Schrag et al. 2004, JCO). Therefore, it seems advisable to reassess the major issues for a reliable testsystem. Particularly for testing solid tumours, three basicconsiderations should be addressed: (i) how to provide\"reproducibility\" in performing chemosensibility tests withunique biopsy specimens, (ii) whether inevitable non-malignant cells present in processed biopsies affect theanalysis of the malignant cells, and (iii) whether single biopsyanalyses allow us to draw conclusions valid for a presumablycellular very heterogeneous tumour mass. Materials and Methods: The introduction of flavin-protecting cell culture methods was a breakthrough, since for the first time it waspossible to perform chemosensitivity tests that are notaffected by photochemical \"chaotropic\" artefacts (Granzowet al. 1995, Cancer Res). Subsequently an ex vivo test has been developed to address the above mentioned issues(Dollner et al. 2004, Anticancer Res). This new assay was performed on 60 tumour biopsy specimens of necksquamous a number of436 tests. The assay allows for the selective evaluation ofchemoreactivity of both epithelial and stromal cells from agiven biopsy specimen. Results: Reproducibility of single tests was demonstrated by parallel chemosensitivity tests withestablished cell lines performing under the same conditionsas used for testing the biopsies. The selective analysis ofepithelial and stromal cells revealed that stromal cells wereequally or less sensitive to cytostatic drugs compared to theepithelial tumour cells in almost 90% of the tests. Forcomparative chemosensitivity tests, three separate biopsiesfrom the same tumour were tested in parallel (n=10). Here,we consistently found the same chemosensitivities forepithelial cells from within one tumour. The chemosensitivityof stromal cells, however, varied widely among biopsies takenfrom different locations within the same tumour. Conclusion: Beside flavin-protecting culture conditions, a robust and celltype-specific evaluation of malignant cells from tumourtissues is required for reliable and meaningfulchemosensitivity testing. According to our data, the cell type-specific chemosensitivity testing of a single tumour biopsyprovides representative results for the epithelial cellpopulation of a tumour. 168 THE ROLE OF LYMPHANGIOGENESIS IN HUMANNON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER Balazs DomeDepartment of Tumor Biology, National Koranyi Institute of Pulmonology, Piheno u. 1., Budapest, H-1529, Hungary Although N status is a major determinant for the clinical management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), currentstrategies for lymph node (LN) staging is not sensitive enough,many cases are understaged, and we are unable to identifythose patients who will ultimately have poor outcome.Consequently, there is a need for clinically useful approachesto better stratify patients with respect to the risk of LNmetastasis and recurrence after surgery. Unfortunately, becauseno specific markers for lymphatic endothelium were availableuntil recently, our knowledge of the lymphatic system ofmalignant tumors lags far behind that of the vascular system.However, the recent discovery of LYVE-1 and M2A antigen(D2-40) as specific markers for lymphatics has now providedtools for a detailed analysis of lymphangiogenesis. In a recentstudy, our group analyzed how NSCLC acquires its lymphaticnetwork and investigated whether the extent oflymphangiogenesis might be related to the angiogenicphenotype (angiogenic versus nonangiogenic) and/or to the risk of lymph node metastasis and to patient survival, using Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3265tumor samples obtained from NSCLC patients. For the first time in the literature, we demonstrated that lymphangiogenesisoccurs exclusively in the angiogenic growth type of humanNSCLCs, and that lymph vessel density is correlated toclinical behavior and to lymph node status only in this growthtype of NSCLCs. However, this study also provided the firstevidence that the risk of lymph node metastasis as well as ashorter survival is more likely to occur in the patientpopulation with nonangiogenic tumors, and that these tumorsmainly co-opt host tissue lymphatics during their growth, incontrast to most of the angiogenic ones, which expand withconcomitant lymphangiogenesis. The current presentationprovides an update on the biology of lymph vessels in humanNSCLC, and explores the utility of lymphangiogenesis forpulmonary oncology. 169 HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE: THE PARADIGM OF V ACUUM-ASSISTED BREAST BIOPSY Philip J. Domeyer1st Department of surgery, School of Medicine, Athens University, Greece Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important parameter in cancer care and assessment of noveltherapeutic strategies, as reflected upon numerous ongoingtrials. Nevertheless, there is a relative scarcity of dataregarding HRQoL in bioptical procedures, which are anindispensable part of early cancer diagnosis and subsequentmanagement. In this presentation the main point of focus is HRQoL in breast biopsy; vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (V ABB) has beenchosen as a recent, minimally invasive and reliable paradigm.V ABB (11G needle) is capable of obtaining tissue forhistopathological diagnosis of non-palpable mammographiclesions, so as to ensure early breast cancer diagnosis. Althoughits role is already well established, the impact of V ABB onHRQoL has never been investigated. The herein summarized research project has adopted two independent tools for the optimal assessment of HRQoL,namely SF-36 and EQ-5D. SF-36 comprises 36 items coveringeight health dimensions. The EQ-5D is a short questionnairewhich evaluates the patient's quality of life according to fivedimensions, each one with three levels. EQ-5D also contains avisual analogue scale (V AS) on which patients rate their ownhealth between 0 and 100. These questionnaires werecompleted by 128 patients, both in the morning of the V ABBprocedure and four days after V ABB. In the morning of V ABB patients reported worse HRQoL scores in EQ-5D anxiety/depression and SF-36 general healthsubscales; a significant decline in EQ-5D usual activities andSF-36 role functioning-physical was observed four days after V ABB. The results clearly indicate for the first time a significant effect of V ABB on HRQoL. Breast biopsy represents asignificant event in a woman's life, with multidimensionalphysical, psychological and health care-related implications.Although the minimally invasive character of modern breastbiopsy techniques might lead some health care providers tooverlook its effect on HRQoL, measurement of the lattershould be integrated in the global clinical assessment ofpatients. 170 INFLUENCE OF GROWTH FACTORS ON THEFORMATION OF CD133-POSITIVE STEM CELLSFROM CD133-NEGATIVE POPULATIONS AND LOW PASSAGE HIGH-GRADEGLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME Laura Donovan and Geoffrey J Pilkington Cellular and Molecular Neuro-Oncology Research Group, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, School of Pharmacy andBiomedical Sciences, University of Portsmouth, St Michael'sBuilding, White Swan Road, Portsmouth PO1 2DT, UK Background: A small subset of cells displaying stem-like properties, with the ability to self-renew and sustain thegrowth of tumours has been identified in brain tumours.CD133 has been identified as a marker for a subpopulationof neural stem cells and facilitates an active role in local braintumour cell invasion. Growth factors play a vital role in themodulation and behaviour of stem cells, in particular Humantransforming growth factor 1 (TGF1), Epidermal growthfactor (EGF) and basic-Fibroblast growth factor (bFGF/FGF-2). Initial research into the dependency of CD133-negativecells and low passage high-grade glioblastoma multiformeupon these particular growth factors will help to assess theformation and properties of CD133-positive stem cells. Aim: To isolate CD133-positive stem cell populations fromglioblastoma multifoprme biopsies and to assess the role ofgrowth controlly CD133 positivity and immunocytochemistry will be used to characterise thevarying levels of growth factor concentrations, using theappropriate immuno-markers CD133/1 and Ki-67. Materials and Methods: CD133-positive populations bead low-passage high-grade biopsy-derivedglioblastoma and into neurospheres by using stemcell defined growth media supplemented with the appropriategrowth factors concentrations. The positive and negativeisolated stem cell populations were characterised using flowANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: (2008) 3266cytometry and immunocytochemistry the The influence of 10 ng/ml of TGF1, FGF- 2 and EGF on CD133-positive stem cells was seen to effectcell proliferation rates, cell migration and CD133-positiveexpression. Discussion: The in vitro microenvironment dictates the behaviour of cultured neoplastic glia as well asinfluencing CD133 expression. Furthermore, studies areaimed at elucidating the precise role of multiple drugresistance of CD133-positive stem cells on the behaviour ofglioma.

Rigas, Marc Johnstone, William Wendye M. DiSalvo, Sara Simeone and Ethan Dmitrovsky Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH 03756; Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03755, USA G1 cyclins are often aberrantly expressed in bronchial preneoplasia and lung cancer. This implicates these species asnovel molecular pharmacological targets of several anticanceragents for lung cancer therapy and chemoprevention. Wepreviously reported a targeted combination regimen thatcooperatively affected D-type phase I kinase and the aerodigestive tractcancer showed minimal toxicities and preliminary evidence ofclinical activity. Combining erlotinib with bexarotene alsoinduced at least additive suppression of growth and cyclin D1expression in human bronchial epithelial cells and in somelung cancer cell lines. A phase II trial of erlotinib and bexarotene was conducted in patients with stage IV NSCLC. The primary objective wasradiographic response rate; secondary objectives weresurvival, time to progression, toxicities, and correlation ofearly metabolic response by PET at 8-12 days and 2 months.Dosing was erlotinib 150 mg and bexarotene 400 mg/m 2daily orally. Forty-two patients were enrolled including 52% women and 62% with adenocarcinoma; the median age was 67 (46-77) years, 12% were current smokers and 17% were neversmokers. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range0-5), 21% had had prior anti-EGFR therapy. Commontoxicities were hypertriglyceridemia and skin rash. Grade 3pulmonary hemorrhage (1), rash/mouth sores (1), cough (1),hypereosinophilic syndrome (1), and abdominal pain (1) ledto treatment discontinuation. There were 2 objective partial responses; 7 patients had stable disease including one patientwith prior gefitinib (35 weeks on study). Median time toprogression was 7 weeks and median overall survival was 21weeks (intent-to-treat). Decreased metabolic activity on PETimaging at 10 days was associated with radiographic responseat 2 months. Correlation between the severity of hypertrigly-ceridemia and clinical outcome will be presented. The effectof this combined regimen on the levels of EGFR and/orcyclin D1 expression will be assessed in a proof-of-principlepilot study. The combination of erlotinib and bexarotene is well tolerated and shows evidence of activity in heavily pretreatedpatients with NSCLC. These results implicate clinical benefitof dual targeting of EGFR and cyclin D1 in NSCLC. Futurework should assess the effects of combinations of anticanceragents targeting cell cycle progression at G1. 172 DNA-PKcs-PIDDOSOME: A NOVEL NUCLEARCASPASE-2-ACTIV ATING PROTEIN COMPLEXTHAT FUNCTIONS IN DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE Mingan J. Chen2, Michael P. Washburn1, Laurence Florens1and Chunying Du1 1Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, Missouri 64110; 2Division of Molecular Radiation Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, 75390,USA Caspase-2 plays an apoptotic role in apoptosis. The identification of the protein complex PIDDosome hasaccelerated our understanding of caspase-2 activation.Caspase-2 is unique among all the mammalian caspases inthat it is the only caspase that is present constitutively in thecell nucleus, in addition to other cellular compartments.However, the functional significance of this nuclearlocalization is unknown. We have found that DNA damageinduced by -radiation triggers the phosphorylation ofnuclear caspase-2, leading to its cleavage and activation.This carried out by the nuclearserine/threonine kinase DNA-PKcs and is promotedby the death-domain protein large nuclearprotein complex consisting of DNA-PKcs, PIDD, andcaspase-2, which we have named DNA-PKcs-PIDDosome.Characterization of this DNA-PKcs-PIDDosome hasrevealed unexpected novel functions of it in DNA damageresponse pathway. Data will be presented to show theAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3267molecular mechanism of this protein complex in the cellular response to DNA damage. In conclusion, our data reveal a new role and a new activation mechanism of caspase-2. The ability of caspase-2to participate in both pro-apoptotic and pro-survival processesmeans that caspase-2 may stand at the crossroads of a DNA-damage response network, coordinating apoptosis and cellsurvival to determine cell fate. 173 THE ROLE OF THE RETINOBLASTOMA TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE IN CELLPROLIFERATION, DIFFERENTIATION, AND APOPTOSIS DURING NORMALDEVELOPMENT AND IMPLICATIONS FOR TARGETED CANCER THERAPY Wei Du The University of Chicago, USA The retinoblastoma gene ( Rb) is a prototype tumor suppressor gene often mutated or inactivated in cancer. TheRb protein (pRb) regulates a variety of normal cellularprocesses including cell proliferation, differentiation, as wellas apoptosis. Extensive studies have shown that pRb exertsits diverse functions by forming complexes with otherproteins. Of the large number of proteins that can bind topRb, the best studied are the E2F transcription factors,which are heterodimers composed of a subunit of the E2Ffamily and a subunit of the DP family. In mammaliansystems, there are eight E2F and three DP family members.While it is well established that E2F proteins mediate most,if not all, of the effects of Rbloss on cell proliferation and apoptosis, the mechanism by which Rbregulates cell differentiation is less clear. In addition to E2F, pRb alsobinds to a large number of other proteins including anumber of transcription factors involved in thedifferentiation of specific cell types such as MyoD andC/EBP . In vitro studies using cell culture systems have suggested that pRb directly interacted with and enhancedthe activities of these differentiation promoting transcriptionfactors to promote differentiation. However, the significanceof these observations has not been demonstrated in vivo in animal models. The presence of large numbers of E2Fproteins also makes it difficult to evaluate the contributionof E2F to the differentiation defects of Rb loss in mammalian systems. The function and regulation of the Rb/E2F proteins are highly conserved and much simpler in Drosophila . We have used this model system to characterize the in vivo role of Rbf (fly Rb) in cell proliferation, differentiation, andapoptosis. Our analysis of developing fly tissues with rbf mutant clones revealed that the consequences of Rbf loss aredistinct in different cell types, suggesting that additional signaling pathways or cell-intrinsic factors modulate theeffect of Rbf removal. To identify genes that canpreferentially affect the differentiation or death of rbf mutant cells, we carried out a genetic screen by generatingdouble mutant clones. We found that mutation of rnoleads to synergistic differentiation defects in conjunction with lossof Rbf. Further characterization revealed that thedifferentiation role of Rbf and Rno are mediated by theircooperative regulation of the Notch and EGFR signaling,and that this differentiation role of Rbf is E2F dependent.Characterization of the mutations that affected the apoptosisof rbfmutant cells revealed that hid, which is directly repressed by the Rbf/E2F repression complex, is a keyplayer that mediates the apoptosis effect of rbfmutant cells. Genes and pathways that can modulate the activities of Hidcan also modulate the apoptosis of rbfmutant cells. The conservation of these genes and pathways between flies andmammals suggest potential new approaches against cancerwith Rbmutations. 174 T-LYMPHOCYTE CYTOKINE PRODUCTION PATTERN OF THYROID CARCINOMA VERSUS NODULAR THYROID DISEASE H. D uan, E. Maldonado-Gonzalez, M. Schuetz, K. Kaserer, B. Niederle, R. Dudczak, M. Willheim and G. Karanikas Departments of Nuclear Medicine, Pathology, Surgery - Section of Endocrine Surgery and Pathophysiology, MedicalUniversity of Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria Aim: The balance of efficiency of immune reactions against transformed cells and impairment of the immune systemcaused by malignant cells plays a decisive role for theoutcome of tumour disease. We evaluated of T-lymphocytecytokine production pattern in patients with verified thyroidcarcinomas and nodular thyroid diesease. Materials and Methods: Twenty-six patients (19 females, 7 male, aged 28- 80 years) with nodular thyroid disease assigned forthyroidectomy were included in the present study. They weredivided into two groups: Group I: 13 patients withhistologically verified thyroid carcinoma (8 papillary, 2papillary/follicular, 3 medullary carcinomas) and Group II:13 patients with benign nodular thyroid. The control group(Group III) consisted of thirteen age-matched healthyvolunteers free of thyroid disease. All patients underwentmeasurement of intracellular cytokine detection in CD4 +and blood cells (PBMC) by flow cytometry before undergoing surgery. Results: No significant differences were found in the cytokine productionpattern between thyorid cancer and nodular thyroid diseaseANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3268or the control group. On the other hand, benign nodular disease, in comparison to the control group, showed asignificant increase of CD8 +cells producing TNF-, IFN- and IL2/IFN-. Conclusion: According to our data, no change in the cytokine production pattern can be detected inblood lymphocytes of patients with thyroid carcinoma.Remarkably, benign nodular disease showed increasedproduction of cytokines associated with cellular immunity bycytotoxic T-cells. This suggests that the immune systemresponds to benign transformation of thyroid cells, aresponse that may be impaired by malignant cells. 175 11-HYDROXYLASE-INHIBITOR [ 18F]FETO FOR VISUALIZATION/ VERIFICATION OF ADRENOCORTICAL TUMOUR MASSES IN POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY H. D uan, M. Schuetz, W. Wadsak, M. Mitterhauser, L. Key Mien, B. Niederle, A. Gessl, R. Dudczak, K. Kletter and G. Karanikas Departments of Nuclear Medicine and Surgery - Section of Endocrine Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, A-1090Vienna, Austria We aimed to investigate the novel PET radiopharmaceutical [ 18F]FETO, an 11-hydroxylase-inhibitor, in patients with adrenocortical masses. Twenty-five patients (14 females and11 males, aged 15-72 years) with adrenocortical lesions (n=22,verified by CT and/or MRI) or as follow-up afteradrenocortical carcinoma (ACC, n=3) were included in thepresent study. Dynamic and whole body images wereperformed after administration of 370 MBq [ 18F]FETO. Visual interpretation, as well as semi-quantitative analysis usingstandardised uptake values (SUVs) was conducted. In 19 out of 25 patients, [ 18F]FETO uptake was massive in adrenal lesions, pronounced in contralateral adrenals andmoderate in liver. In patients, FETO showed intensebilateral accumulation (CT/MRI negative), one withadrenogenital syndrome, the other with bilateral hyperplasia(histologically verified). In follow-up of the three patientswith ACC, FETO revealed one liver metastasis of ACC(inconclusive verified histology). verified CT/MRI in the FETO PET scan (rhabdomyosarcoma,verified by histology). The median SUV 8.3-41.1), of contralateral of liver 2.9 (range 2.0-4.1). Nosignificant difference was found between the median SUVof biochemically (n=10, median SUV 21.0) and non-active adrenocortical lesions (n=11, median SUV 23.1). Due to the intense uptake of [ 18F]FETO in the adrenalmasses, a clear tumour visualization was achieved. FETO is an excellent imaging tool for the visualization of benignadrenocortical diseases, as it visualizes adrenal adenomas aswell as hyperplasia. 176 18F-FLUOROAZOMYCINARABINOSIDE (FAZA) IN PATIENTS WITH CERVICAL CANCER FOR DETECTION OF HYPOXIA AREAS IN POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY - A PILOT STUDY H. D uan, M. Schuetz, S. Kommata, D. Lukic, E. Maldonado-Gonzalez, K. Kletter, B. Bachtiary and G. Karanikas Departments of Nuclear Medicine and Radiotherapy/Radiobiology, Medical University of Vienna,and Austrian Research Centers Seibersdorf, Austria Background: Hypoxia has emerged as an important factor in tumour biology and response to cancer treatment. 18F- fluoroazomycinarabinoside (18FAZA) was recently introduced as a novel hypoxia tracer. The aim of our study was toevaluate the potential value of FAZA in visualisation oftumour hypoxia and in the individual treatment planning ofpatients with cervical cancer. Materials and Methods: Twelve patients (mean age, 53 years) with cervical carcinoma (T2Nxor TxN1) were included in our study. In addition to theirroutine pre-therapeutical staging, 18FAZA PET was performed before, during (short before brachytherapy) andthree months after radio-chemotherapy. The patients werescanned subsequently by the administration of 370 MBq 18FAZA (dynamic scan) and 1, and 2 hours afterwards (static scan). Any tumour visualisations by FAZA were judged ashypoxic area. Standardized uptake values (SUV) and ratios tonormal tissue (muscle) were calculated. Results: In the initial static scan (before therapy), 5 out of 12 patients showedhypoxic areas in the tumour side (SUV range: 1.6-2.6; 1.2-3.6). No hypoxic areas were found in theremaining 7 patients nor in the initial nor in the follow-upscans. Four out of the 5 positive patients showed a decreasedFAZA uptake during the therapy (short before brachytherapy)(SUV range: 1.4-1.9; T/M ratio One patient showedno in hypoxic areas neither during the therapy nor inthe follow up scan. In contrast to the other patients, thispatient was a non-responder to radio-chemotherapy.Discussion: According to our preliminary results, 18FAZA PET is able to visualise hypoxic tissue in cervical cancer.Following the time course of tumour oxygenation by FAZAscans as in our study could be a potential tool in treatmentplanning.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3269177 ALKALINE SPHINGOMYELINASE (NPP7) AND ITS IMPLICATIONS IN INTESTINAL TUMORIGENESIS AND INFLAMMATION Rui-Dong DuanBiomedical Centre B11, Institution of Clinical Sciences, University of Lund, S-221 84 Lund, Sweden Alkaline sphingomyelinase (Alk-SMase) is an enzyme expressed in the intestinal mucosa and human liver. It is anectoenzyme localized on the surface of the cell plasmamembrane and is released into the intestinal lumen and bileby both bile phospholipase D and reduces the formation oflysophosphatidic acid. Expression of the enzyme is inhibitedby a high fat diet and stimulated by water-soluble fiberpsyllium and also by some anti-inflammatory drugs such as5-ASA and ursodeoxycholic acid. The levels of the enzymein the intestinal mucosa are positively correlated with caspase3, the key enzyme responsible for apoptosis. In vitro studies showed that alk-SMase inhibits cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner accompanied by a reduction ofsphingomyelin and formation of ceramide. Development ofhuman colonic adenocarcinoma is associated with aprogressive reduction of alk-SMase activity. Such reductionshave also been identified in human hepatic diseases such asprimary sclerosing cholangitis and steatosis, which increasethe risk of liver cancer. The results above indicate that alk-SMase may serve as a tumour suppressor in both colon andliver. By analysing alk-SMase in cancer cell lines and biopsy samples, we identified two aberrant forms of alk-SMasemRNA in human colon and liver cancer. The formation of theaberrant forms are caused by a skipping of one exon at thesplicing level, resulting in destruction of the substrate bindingsites and total inactivation of the enzyme. The findings providea molecular background for the reduced enzyme activity foundpreviously in cancer tissues. We have developed a method to express the recombinant alk-SMase with full activity in yeast cells. We are also ableto increase alk-SMase activity 2- to 4-fold through a singlesite mutation based on a 3-D structure predicted by molecularmodulation. In studies with a rat ulcerative colitis modelinduced by dextran sulfate sodium, we found that injection ofthe yeast-expressed human alk-SMase in the colonsignificantly reduced the and theexpression of TNF-alpha. Histological examination showedthat alk-SMase protected the colonic membrane from inflammatory destruction. In conclusion, alk-SMase may play important roles in protecting both colon and liver from tumorigenesis. Therecombinant enzyme may be used as a protein therapeutic toolto replace the mutant enzyme in cancer and inflammatoryconditions. 178 BLOOD OUTGROWTH ENDOTHELIAL CELL-BASED DELIVERY OF CANCER GENE THERAPY Arkadiusz Z. DudekDivision of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA Angiogenesis and postnatal vasculogenesis are two processes involved in the formation of new vessels, an essentialrequirement for tumor growth and metastasis. We isolatedendothelial cells from human blood mononuclear cells byselective culture. These blood outgrowth cells expressendothelial cell markers and respond correctly to functionalassays. To evaluate the potential of blood outgrowthendothelial cells to construct functional vessels in vivo , NOD- SCID mice were implanted with Lewis lung carcinoma cellssubcutaneously. Blood outgrowth endothelial cells were theninjected through the tail vein. Initial distribution of these cellsoccurred throughout the lung, liver, spleen, and tumor vessels,but 48 hours after injection they were only found in liver andtumor tissue. By day 24, they could mostly be found in tumorvasculature and this tumor selectivity correlated with anincrease in tumor vessel counts as compared with controlinjections. We engineered blood outgrowth endothelial cells todeliver an angiogenic inhibitor directly to tumor endotheliumby transducing these cells with the gene for human endostatin,and the soluble receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor.These cells maintained an endothelial vascularization and tumor volume in asubcutaneous murine tumor model, as well as in spontaneousorthotopic breast cancer and glioma models. We conclude thatblood outgrowth endothelial cells have the potential for tumor-specific delivery of cancer gene therapy. 179 LARGE of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA Metastatic melanoma is an incurable malignancy with a median survival of 6-8 months. While melanoma is refractory to most ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3270chemotherapy drugs, its growth may be regulated by immune mechanisms as shown by the rare occurrence of spontaneousremissions, the presence of cytotoxic tumor infiltratinglymphocytes (TIL) in resected tumors, and the demonstrationof TIL cytotoxicity toward autologous tumor cells in vitro . Notably, interferon (IFN)-2b and interleukin (IL)-2 havedemonstrated modest efficacy in the treatment of advancedmelanoma. Phase II studies using biochemotherapy for thetreatment of metastatic melanoma resulted in response rates of~50%, median time to disease progression of 5 months and anextended median survival of approximately 12 months. Theseresults are consistent with the notion that progression ofmelanoma can be affected by immune stimulation. Therapeutic benefit has also been demonstrated recently for vaccines in metastatic melanoma. There are various strategiesfor development and administration of tumor vaccinesincluding those generated from tumor-derived peptides,irradiated autologous tumor cells, allogeneic lysates,dendritic cells, cell-sized (5-m diameter) latex or silicamicrospheres that function as a solid support for tumor antigenpresentation. These artificial antigen-presenting cells aretermed large multivalent immunogen (LMI). A phase II study of autologous LMI vaccine for the treatment of stage IV melanoma has been completed.Vaccine production involved isolating tumor cell membranesobtained from melanoma specimens which were thenattached to microspheres. Eligible patients were randomlyassigned to one of three treatment groups, in cohorts of threeto ensure balanced samples between treatment groups in eachstratum. Group 1 received LMI; Group 2 receivedcyclophosphamide and LMI; and Group 3 receivedcyclophosphamide, LMI, and IL-2. LMI were coated withautologous tumor cell membrane. Patients received LMI(1\u00d710 7, 5-m silica spheres) vaccination by intradermal injection beginning on day 1 and continuing at 4-weekintervals until the supply of tissue for producing additionaldoses of LMI vaccine was depleted. Cyclophosphamideinfusions at 300 mg/m 2/d were given intravenously 7 days before vaccine. IL-2 infusions at 1.75\u00d7106IU/m2/d were given subcutaneously 5 days after LMI administrationfor 1 week ( i.e., days 6-12, 34- 40, etc.). This trial evaluated the safety of LMI. No grade 4 toxicities (by NCI CTCAE v3.0) were observed in any arm. Patients with malignantmelanoma had median overall survival time of 15.4 months(95%; CI>7.99) and median overall time to diseaseprogression of 2.8 months (95% CI: 1.87, 6.25). One patientwith melanoma had documented partial response (byRECIST criteria). Multiple regression analysis showed thatthe number of LMI doses was inversely correlated with riskof death. Based on our results that demonstrate the safetyand tolerability of LMI vaccine, further development of this therapy in the allogeneic setting is now being performed in arandomized placebo-controlled study. 180 EARLY PREDICTION OF OSTEOSARCOMAHISTOLOGIC RESPONSE BY F-87000, France*Both authors contributed equally to this work The assessment of osteosarcoma response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is performed after surgical resection of theprimary tumor by histological analysis according to a methoddescribed by Huvos. The purpose of this study was to evaluatewhether 18F-FDG PET could be a non-invasive surrogate ofhistopathological analysis and enable an early identification ofresponse to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in osteosarcoma. Rat orthototopic osteosarcoma model was used. Animals with well-established tumors were examined using 18F-FDGPET before being divided into a control and ifosfamide-treatedgroup (n=10 animals/group). After two cycles ofchemotherapy, all the animals were submitted to a second18F-FDG PET exam. Tumors were then submitted tohistological analysis. Image reconstructions of FDG PET wereanalysed semiquantitatively by using a volume of interest(VOI)-based method. Metabolic and histological responses tochemotherapy were compared. Histological analysis classifiedthe rats from the control group as non-reponders, whereasanimals from the ifosfamide-treated group were classified aspartial (n=5) and good responders (n=5). Data analysis showedthat the SUV Max value of the 18F-FDG PET performed aftertwo cycles of chemotherapy correlated to the histologicalclassification ( p<0.01). We showed that an SUV Max <15 to a good responder, 15<SUV Max<20 to apartial responder and SUV Max>20 corresponded to non-responder. Moreover, analysis established that a 40%diminution of SUV Max between PET 1 and 2 is the cut-offvalue to distinguish a partial response from a good responseto chemotherapy, with a specificity and sensitivity of 100%.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3271Semi-quantitative 18F-FDG PET using the SUV parameters seems to be able to predict the response to chemotherapyearlier than histological analysis. 181 ROLE OF COLLAGEN- AND LAMININ-BINDINGINTEGRINS IN LIVER METASTASIS Johannes A. EbleCenter for Molecular Medicine, Department of Vascular Matrix Biology, Excellence Cluster Cardio-PulmonarySystem, Frankfurt University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany Integrins, a versatile family of cell adhesion molecules, not only mediate the anchorage of cells within their surroundingextracellular matrix (ECM) but also act as important signaltransduction molecules. Thus, they trigger a variety ofmatrix-induced cell functions, such as adhesion, forcetransmission, migration, differentiation, survival andapoptosis. In a physiological context, these integrin-mediatedcell functions are vital. However, tumor cells also useintegrins, albeit in an altered expression pattern, todisseminate from the primary tumor node through theinterstitial stromal tissue and to penetrate the basementmembrane, thus intra- and extravasating, and eventuallycolonizing distant organs. The interstitial stroma tissue is rich in fibril-forming collagens, among them collagen I. The network-formingcollagen IV and laminins are abundant constituents of thebasement membrane. Hence, interactions of tumor cells withthese matrix components via collagen- and laminin-binding integrins is of major importance in metastasis and may be atarget for anticancer therapy. The use of novel RGD-independent inhibitors of collagen- and laminin-binding integrins from snake venoms were testedfor their ability to prevent tumor cells from extravasating liversinusoids in an in vivo model. By comparison with in vivo models, the role of collagen- and laminin-binding integrins inthe metastatic cascade could be defined. This may lead to newways to curb metastasis. 182 CYTOTOXICITY, DNA-BINDING Alexandra Karaliota1 1Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty Chemistry, National University of Athens, PanepistimioupoliZographou, Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, P.O. Box 135, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece Quinolones or quinolonecarboxylic acids are a group of synthetic antibacterial agents that effectively inhibit DNAreplication and are commonly used as treatment for manyinfections (1). Sparfloxacin (=Hsf), a third-generation quinoloneantimicrobial drug, is mainly used for the treatment of acuteexacerbations of chronic bronchitis and community-acquiredpneumonia (2). Sparfloxacin presents increased againstGram-positive species such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococci . It good bioavailability and its long half-life permits once-daily dosing, which may contribute to improvedadherence to therapy and cost-effectiveness. DNA gyrase(topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV are targets ofsparfloxacin against Str. pneumoniae and Staph. aureus (3, 4). We present the structural and biological properties of the copper-sparfloxacinato complexes in the absence or presenceof the N-donor heterocyclic ligands 2,2'-bipyridine or 1,10-phenanthroline as well as of the binary sparfloxacinatocomplexes with diverse transition metal ions. The antibacterialactivity of the complexes against three microorganisms ispresented and their DNA-binding behavior is evaluated.Additionally, some complexes have been tested as potentialanticancer agents against human leukemia cell line HL-60(peripheral blood human promyelocytic leukemia) and thecytotoxic effects are reported.This work was supported by the ELKE Kapodistrias.1 I. 4033-4037, 2008. AGENTS FOR resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive clinical imaging technique, which relies on the detection of NMRsignals emitted by hydrogen protons in the body placed in amagnetic field. MRI contrast agent (CA) is a unique class ofpharmaceuticals that enhances the image contrast betweennormal and diseased tissue, and indicates the status of organfunction or blood flow after administration, by increasing therelaxation rates of water protons in the tissue, in which theagent accumulates. Contrast agents are being used in MRIsince 1983 when the first injection of gadolinium (Gd) DTPAwas performed in men (1). Since then CA have gained greatacceptance. They function by shortening of T1-relaxationtime, thereby increasing signal intensity (SI) (positive contrastenhancement). Conceptually, antibodies or other tissue-specific molecules may be combined with paramagnetic centers to providedisease-specific MRI agents. The challenge with regard todelivering sufficient quantity of paramagnetic label issubstantial. On that front, we have synthesized a series ofgadolinium conjugates with Colchicine, Taxol and Thyroxin(Figure), known for their tubulin- and hormone receptor-binding properties respectively, targeting the discovery ofnovel, cancer specific CA. Cytotoxicity and relaxation timemeasurements have been performed for all these newcomplexes.1 Caravan P, Ellison JJ, McMurry TJ and Lauffer Chelates Chem Rev 99: 2293-2352, 1999. 184 MELANOMA CELLS REMEMBER THEIR ORIGINS Ossia M. Eichhoff 1, Keith S. Hoek1, Hospital of Zurich,Zurich; 2Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland Human primary and metastatic melanoma lesions frequently show heterogeneous staining pattern for melanocytic markergenes ( e.g. Tyr, Melan-A). Cell cultures derived from metastases also show variable expression for these markers,and microarray analyses reveal two major expressionsignatures present in melanoma cell line libraries. Onesignature (proliferative) shows up-regulation of genesinvolved in melanocytic differentiation, while other(invasive) shows up-regulation of factors involved inmodifying the expressionprofiles correlate with phenotypic characteristics ofproliferation, motility and growth factor sensitivity. Webelieve that expression of the melanocytic master-regulatorMitf is critical to the phenotype. Indeed, interruption of Mitfexpression via siRNA reduced growth factor susceptibility by 60%, a characteristic of the invasive phenotype. We havederived a model in which melanoma cells may switchbetween proliferation and invasion to drive diseaseprogression. Here we interpret a clinical case (thick primaryand metastasis to the gall bladder) in the context of ourphenotype switching model. Both primary and metastaticlesions show heterogeneity of staining for melanocyticmarkers, an aspect explained by our model. However, wealso show evidence for microenvironment-dependentbehaviour in the metastasis which demonstrates thatprograms reminiscent of healthy melanocytes may yet berecalled by melanoma cells. Melanoma cells encounteringbasal membrane structures in distal locations seek isolationfrom peers and re-express dendritic structures. Theseare in vivo behaviours which are often reported to be lost during progression. 185 CONCURRENT VERSUS SEQUENTIAL CHEMORADIOTHERAPY IN LIMITED-DISEASESMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER: A RETROSPECTIVE COMPARATIVE STUDY Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece Radiotherapy, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden; 3Department Pulmonary Diseases, St Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein, the Introduction: Patients with treatment withchemotherapy (CT) or chemotherapy combined withradiotherapy. The treatment schemes with intentionwere sequential and concurrent chemoradiotherapy, bothcombined with prophylactic patients received 4-5 cycles ofcyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and etoposide. In cases ofno complete response, either radiotherapy was given in 13fractions of 3 Gy (CT-RT group) or no RT (CT group).After complete remission, radiotherapy was given in 16fractions of 2.5 Gy, concurrently with PCI in 15 fractionsof 2 Gy (SCT-RT group). From 2001, patients received 4-5cycles of cisplatin and etoposide concurrently withradiotherapy in 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy. PCI was applied topatients with complete remission (CCT-RT group). Primaryendpoints were median survival time (MST) and overallsurvival (OS); secondary endpoints included causes ofdeath and times CT-RT, SCT-RT and CCT-RT schemeswere 8.1, 12.5, 14.0 and 21.8 months, and the 5-year OSwas 3.5, 4.8, 10.5 and 26.9%, respectively. The cause ofdeath of SCT-RT and CCT-RT patients was tumor relatedin 76.3% and 89.3% of the patients, respectively. Brainmetastasis frequencies after PCI in SCT-RT and in CCT-RTpatients were 16.4% and 8.7%, respectively. Conclusion: CCT-RT results in MST and higher OS than SCT-RT, CT or CT-RT. 186 EFFECT OF NANO-FRUIT-CAFE ON Medicine, P\u00e9cs University of Sciences, P\u00e9cs, HungaryFruit Caf\u00e9 is a ground mixture of dried fruits and fruit seeds, intended for use in regular coffe-maker, to produce a high-flavonoid containing drink - a healthy alternative for coffee.Our earlier animal experiments demonstrated the cancerpreventive effect of Fruit Caf\u00e9 by using gene expressions asearly biomarkers, and also in experiments with transplantedtumors. The Fruit Caf\u00e9 has been further developed by applying a nano-grinding technology, in order to reach a smaller particlesize. This lead to an increased flavonoid content, andpreparation of the drink became easier. In the present study we examined the effect of this new Nano-Fruit-Caf\u00e9 on the expression of oncogenes and tumorsuppressor genes, in order to make a first evaluation of itspossible cancer preventive characteristic. Male CBA/Ca mice were intraperitoneally treated with Nano-Fruit-Caf\u00e9, with the body weight equivalent of thesuggested human doses for everyday consumption. At differenttime points (5, 10, 15, 30 minutes, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24hours) after the ip. injection the animals were overnarcotized,and RNA was isolated from their liver, spleen, kidneys, lung,thymus, bone marrow and lymph nodes. The RNA was blottedonto Hybond N+ membranes and p53, Ha-ras,Ki-ras and Bcl-2 genes. The expression pattern of the studied oncogenes and suppressor genes indicated a potential cancer chemopreventiveeffect for the new flavonoid containing drink. If theseanticarcinogenic characteristics will be confirmed by usingtransplanted and chemically induced models, its widespreadproduction and consumption might contribute to thechemopreventive strategies against cancer. 187 CAN WE INCREASE CD34+ STEM CELL NUMBERSIN CIRCULATING PERIPHERAL BLOOD USINGNATURAL COMPOUNDS IN ANIMALS?

In every group, 6 male and female 4-6 week old mice were treated intraperitoneally with themixture. After 1, 2, 3, 6, 18 and 24 h, CD34+ cells inperipheral blood were measured by flow cytometry and theANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3274expression of several marker genes was also determined (p53, bcl-2, Ha- and K-ras, c-myc), in the various tissues. It wasobserved that stem cells from fat tissue and possibly fromother sources may be activated. 188 P38 MAP KINASE of Public Health, P\u00e9cs, Hungary; 2Department of International Medicine Division of Nephrology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,Markham Little Rock, AR, USA; 3Quintiles Magyarorsz\u00e1g, Budapest, Hungary Health risk prediction and prevention of environmental diseases are highlighted topics of modern age. MAP kinasesplay a role in mitogenic and stress responses. In this manner,they could be appropriate candidates as biomarkers in the fieldof chemical carcinogenesis research. Polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (PAHs) are potent and abundant environmentalcarcinogens. Elevated expression of MAP (mitogen-activatedprotein) kinases may indicate tumour initiation, but alsocarcinogenic exposure. Some of them have also proven to bemutagenic. DMBA (7,12-dimethylbenz(alpha)anthracene) and1-NP (1-nitropyrene) are important members of potential. Since the family of MAP kinases playa role in diverse cellular events as proliferation and apoptosis,genes from that group could be candidates as biomarkers ofexposure to chemical carcinogenes. In the family of MAP kinases we focused on the activity of P38 protein. Rats, which are sensitive to chemical carcinogens,were administered with DMBA and 1-NP and the activity ofP38 was detected in white blood cells by flow cytometry. Ourresults do not preclude that the activity of P38 could be apossible biomarker of exposure to chemical carcinogens, butfurther research is needed for verifying this aspect. 189 THE CO-EXPRESSION OF JNK INTERACTINGPROTEIN JIP-1 AND INSULIN LINES BUTNOT IN PRIMARY WILMS TUMOURS Wilhelm Engstr\u00f6mDivision of Pathology, Department of Biomedical Sciences and Veterinary Public Health, Faculty of VeterinaryMedicine, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, POBox 7028, 75007 Uppsala, SwedenJNK interacting Protein 1 (JIP-1) is an important scaffolding protein in the JNK signalling pathway. It is also believed toplay a role in the mediation of mitogenic messages from theplasma membrane to the cell interior. Previous studies suggestthat the JIP-gene is co-regulated with the insulin like growthfactor II (IGF II) gene, thereby contributing to the growthstimulatory effects of this potent growth factor. The strikingco-expression of these two genes was found in murine fetusesas well as in primary human embryonic tumours. When tenprimary Wilms Tumours were examined, the two genesshowed a high degree of co-variation in the sense that highexpression of IGF II was followed by high expression of JIP-1 and vice versa . However when the human Wilms Tumour cell line WCCS-1 was examined, a very modest intrinsicexpression of IGF II was accompanied by a high expressionof JIP-1. When exogenous IGF I was added, (which haspreviously been shown to induce apoptosis in this cell line),the JIP-expressiowas reduced to barely measureable levels.This data suggests that JIP-1 has a more complex role in theregulation of proliferation as well as programmed cell death. 190 QUANTITATIVE MEMBRANE PROTEOMICSAPPLYING NARROW RANGE PEPTIDEISOELECTRIC FOCUSING FOR STUDIES OFSMALL CELL LUNG of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, S-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden Drug resistance is often associated with up-regulation of membrane-associated drug efflux systems, and thus globalmembrane proteomics methods are valuable tools in the searchfor novel components of drug resistance phenotypes. Hereinwe have compared the microsomal proteome from the line H69 and its Doxorubicin-resistantsub-cell line H69AR. The method used includes microsomepreparation, iTRAQ labeling followed by narrow range peptideisoelectric focusing in an immobilized pH-gradient (IPG-IEF)and LC-MS/MS analysis. We demonstrate that the microsomalAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3275preparation and iTRAQ labeling is reproducible regarding protein content and composition. The rationale using narrowrange peptide IPG-IEF separation is demonstrated by itsability to: i) lowering the complexity of the sample by 2/3while keeping high proteome coverage (96%), ii) providinghigh separation efficiency and iii) allowing for peptidevalidation and possibly identifications of post transcriptionalmodifications. After analyzing 1/5 of the IEF fractions(effective pH range 4.0-4.5), a total of 3704 proteins wereidentified, among which 527 were predicted to be membraneproteins. One of the proteins found to be differentiallyexpressed was Serca 2, a calcium pump located in the ERmembrane that potentially could result in changes of apoptoticresponse towards Doxorubicin. 191 CURRENT STATUS OF FECAL TUMOR M2PYRUV ATE KINASE IN COLORECTAL 2Herz-Jesu Hospital, Hospital, UK; 4Adelaide & Meath Hospital and Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland Introduction: Colorectal cancer is a disease with major impact on public health and public health costs. Colonoscopy iscurrently supposed to be the best screening tool for colorectalcancer. However, the acceptance of this method is very poor,although it has been included in screening programs in theGerman health system since 2002. Thus, evaluation ofadditional screening tools seems to be of great interest.Recently, testing for fecal occult blood, genetic alterations oralterations in tumor metabolism ( e.g.Tumor M2-PK) is under investigation. Tumor M2 Pyruvate Kinase: The use of M2-PK measurement in the feces has been reported in several studiesto date. The data of these studies were analysed and criticallyreviewed. All available studies demonstrated a goodperformance of Tumor M2-PK in CRC screening, with anoverall sensitivity ranging from 68.8% to 91.0%, and anoverall specificity ranging from 71.9% to 100%. It might evenbe of some use in detection of larger adenomas, yet itssensitivity for adenomas is far lower (25.8-61.5%, dependingon size). It should not be used for CRC screening in patientswith inflammatory bowel disease since false-positive resultscan be expected in up to 90% (due to proliferation of epithelialcells and leucocytes in the inflammatory area). Since IBDpatients, however, are subject to endoscopic surveillanceanyway, they are not part of the population to be included in general CRC screening programs. Furthermore, a clearcorrelation between Tumor M2-PK levels in the feces and thestage of the tumor according to the Dukes' classification wasdemonstrated. Additionally it was noted that Tumor M2-PKlevel reduction is associated with successful surgicalintervention. Other non-invasive screening tests: At the present time, the fecal occult blood test is still most commonly used asa non-invasive screening parameter for colorectal carcinoma.Yet fecal occult blood testing seems to be inferior, with areported sensitivity of 40% for CRC and <20% for largeradenomas. Despite the improvement of diagnosticperformance of FOBT obtained by immunological methods(iFOBT), one major limitation remains the fact that manycarcinomas do not bleed at all or bleed only intermittently.Another available non-invasive screening method for CRC istesting for genetic alterations. Yet, the major shortcomings ofthis screening tool are its high costs, time consuming andtedious sample preparation, and the very limited handling andshipping time of the feces. Conclusion: Concerning handling, effectiveness and costs, fecal M2-PK therefore seems to begood for large-scale screening of colorectal carcinoma andshould be recommended for inclusion in large-scale screeningprograms. 192 THE RESPONSE OF THE CENTRAL Physics, University of Pavia; 2INFN Pavia; 3Department of Animal Biology, University of Pavia, Italy Ionizing radiation remains a major treatment modality for primary and metastatic tumours of the central nervous system(CNS) however the potential for injury to normal, non-targetedcritical CNS structures limits the dose used in radiotherapy.Although the sequential histological changes associated withradiation injury have been well characterized, the cellular andbiochemical processes responsible for the expression ofradiation-induced CNS injury remain poorly defined,particularly at low doses. Much of the radiobiology efforts hasbeen focused on the radiation response of the vascularendothelial cells and on cells of the oligodendrocyte lineagewhich remain the major cell type candidate for radiationinduced demyelination and necrosis. However, not only thevasculature and glial progenitors are irradiated but alsoastrocytes, microglia, neurons and neural stem cells. Indeedthe CNS is comprised of a number of disparate phenotypesnetworking to form a highly integrate system. Thus, theANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3276implication of this nature of the CNS and its reliance on cell- cell interaction is that endocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine andcontact-mediated processes should play a key role in thetransmission of signals after irradiation and in the developmentof late effects. The purpose of this talk is to criticallysummarize the available information on the mechanismsresponsible for the development of radiation-induced CNSinjury and to suggest a framework for future research in thisfield. In addition, some experimental results on cellcommunication with normal and tumoural cells will bepresented.This work was partially supported by the NOTE IP 036465(FI6R), Euratom specific programme for research and trainingon nuclear energy, 6th FP of the EC. 193 ROLE OF CHROMATIN Biology, Faculty of Science,Masaryk University. CZ-62500 Brno; 2Institute of Biophysics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Kr\u00e1lovopolsk\u00e1 135, CZ-61265 Brno, Czech Republic Nucleoprotein structures at chromosome ends, telomeres, protect chromosomes from degradation and fusions, andprevent natural chromosome ends from being recognized aschromosome breaks by repair mechanisms. The protectivefunction of telomeres depends on maintenance of a certainminimum length of their DNA composed of (TTAGGG)nrepeats (in vertebrates) and on telomere-associated proteins,which together constitute protective (capping) structures ontelomeric DNA. Replicative shortening of telomeres ordysfunction of associated proteins results in genomeinstability. In human cells, telomere maintenance is typically achieved by telomerase, a nucleoprotein enzyme complex elongatingtelomeres by reverse-transcription mechanism. In the absenceof telomerase, an alternative mechanism associated withhomologous recombination can be activated, which is calledALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres). Since the major part of the telomere is folded in nucleosomes, forming a specific heterochromatin structure,epigenetic mechanisms can be involved in maintenance oftelomere length homeostasis. Indeed, recent experimentalstudies have shown telomere length changes induced bychanged levels marks (including DNAmethylation, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3). functionis thus apparently tightly linked to chromatin architecture, andanalysis of the contribution of other factors involved inchromatin dynamics is of special interest to current telomere biology. Many of the chromatin structural changes are mediated by the large and diverse superfamily of HMG (high mobilitygroup) proteins, including the HMGB-type proteins. In ourstudy, we analyze the effect of a deficiency of HMGB1 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from mice. We report a significantly lower telomerase activity, changes in telomere lengths, and increasedoccurrence of cytogenetic abnormalities in HMGB1 -/-MEFs relative to the parental cell lines. Analyses of molecular causesof these effects identified HMGB1 as a telomerase-interactingfactor.This research was supported by the Grant Agency of theCzech Republic (project no. 204/08/1530), the Czech Ministryof Education (MSM0021622415) and the Czech Academy ofSciences (A V0Z50040507 and A V0Z50040702). 194 GASTRITIS OLGA STAGING 1Department of Medical Diagnostic Sciences and Special Therapies (Pathology Section), University of Padova; 2Department of Gastroenterology, Rovereto Hospital, Italy; 3Digestive Disease Division, Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA; 4IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy Atrophic gastritis (mainly resulting from long- standing Helicobacter pylori infection) is a major risk factor for (intestinal-type) gastric cancer development. Theextent/topography of atrophic changes significantly correlatewith the degree of cancer risk. We previously proposed a newsystem for reporting gastritis in terms of staging (the OLGAstaging system). Gastritis staging arranges the histologicalphenotypes of gastritis along a scale of progressivelyincreasing gastric cancer risk, from the lowest (stage 0) to thehighest (stage IV). In this study, we first tested the OLGAstaging system in populations with different cancer risk.Secondly, we validated the staging system in a prospectivecross-sectional study considering a large series of Italianpatients. Materials and Methods: Mapped gastric biopsies were obtained from 755 dyspeptic adults, from 8 worldwidegeographic areas (484 Italian) with different gastric cancerrisk. Gastric atrophy was assessed according to internationallyvalidated criteria. Gastric stage was established according tothe OLGA staging system. Results were presented as stage(including antral and corpus atrophy scores) and Helicobacter pilory status. Results: The most prevalent gastritis stages were 0 to II. In populations at different cancer risk, the gastritisAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3277OLGA stage mirrored the gastric cancer incidence. Helicobacter pilory infection was associated with a higher gastritis stage incidence. In the Italian series, benignconditions (including duodenal ulcers) consistently clusteredin stages 0-II, whereas all neoplastic (invasive and non-invasive) lesions clustered in stages III-IV . Conclusion: OLGA gastritis staging, combined with Helicobacter pilory status, provided clinically relevant information on the overall statusof the gastric mucosa with implications for prognosis, therapyand management. 195 EVOLUTIONARY CONSERV ATION OFMETALLOPANSTIMULIN-1 (S27E RIBOSOMALPROTEIN) ARCHEA AND CARCINOGENESISIN EUKARYOTIC CELLS J. Alberto Fernandez-PolMetalloproteomics, Chesterfield, MO, USA When the function of a protein serves a survival purpose, evolutionary laws of nature, conserves such protein, inphylogenetically related genus and species.Metallopanstimulin-1(MPS-1; S27E) Ribosomal Protein (RP),is involved in growth regulation, and carcinogenesis andconserved through evolution. Berthon et al. (2008) have shown in Archaea by genomic context analysis, a conserved clusterof genes coding for proteins involved in translation andribosome biogenesis. These cluster of RP are S27E (MPS-1), L44E, aIF-2 alpha and Nop10 , and are systematically contiguous to the group of genes coding for PCNA, PriS, and Gins15 , which are involved in DNA replication. The two distinct sets of genes are involved in translation and ribosomebiogenesis (Ribosomal cluster) and DNA replication(Replication cluster). Fernandez-Pol et al. (J Biol Chem & Mol Biol, 1993) was first to describe the gene encoding MPS-1 (S27E) and subsequently have shown that MPS-1 isoverexpressed in many human cancer tissues. MPS-1 is beingused as a target for some novel cancer therapies; aim to ejectthe zinc from the zinc finger motif of the MPS-1 protein, thusyielding it inactive. These and other therapies have shownpromise for the treatment of cancer in humans, for examplegastric cancer (Wang et al. 2006) and in lymphomas (Fernandez-Pol, 2001). Revenkova et al. (1999) found unexpected functions of MPS-1 RP in genotoxic stressresponses in plants. These results indicate that an isoform S27E (mutant MPS-1/ARS27E) is dispensable for thefunction but is required for the elimination ofdamaged mRNA transcripts after exposure to chemicalcarcinogens or UV irradiation. MPS-1 is a RP with extra-ribosomal functions such as DNA repair and transcription. Theresults obtained with archaea (Berthon et al. , 2008) and thefunctions of MPS-1 and other RP proteins studied in this laboratory indicate a previously unrecognized regulatorynetwork coupling DNA replication, DNA repair, DNAtranscription, translation and biogenesis ribosomes that existin both Archaea and Eukarya . Overexpression of RP genes observed in cancer is the result of increased translation ofindividual mRNAs rather than in up-regulation of globalprotein synthesis. We show that in association with increasesin MPS-1 after growth factor stimulation, there is an increaseof numerous ribosomal proteins as well as initiation factors(IF). Elimination of MPS-1 in cancer cells in eukaryoticanimal and plant cells by novel and specific therapies mayresult in the cure or control of most cancers in animals,humans and plants. 196 Mario Fabi\u00e1n Castillo 2902, \u00d1u\u00f1oa-Santiago, Chile The clinical utility of several chemotherapeutic agents often limited by development of drug resistance, which is found inthe multidrug-resistance (MDR) phenotype. It is frequentlyassociated with overexpression ATP-bindingcassette transporters which operate as drug-efflux pumps inMDR cells. The identification of agents able to synergisticallymodulate antineoplastic activity may be useful in overcomingresistance at non-toxic doses, especially those capable ofcircumventing cross-resistance to a large number of unrelatedantineoplastic agents. Among these chemosensitizers, NDGAand its derivatives may be a class of great interest. BothNDGA and NDGATA can modulate the MDR TA3 and TA3-MTX-R cell they also stronglyenhanced the toxicity of doxorubicin, cisplatin andmethotrexate in a dose-dependent manner, with a more evidenteffect in the TA3-MTX-R cells than in the parental cells.NDGATA was more effective than NDGA. Analysis of thedata by the isobole method showed that the combination of achemotherapeutic agent with 3278produced synergistic antiproliferative activities in both cell lines. The combination of NDGATA and DOX stronglyreduced the tumor growth rate in mice and was the besttreatment against the sensitive TA3 cell line and the resistantvariant TA3-MTX-R. The inhibitory activity of thiscombination on the rates of solid tumor growth appeared to besynergistic. The combination of NDGATA and DOX did notprolong median survival time of mice with TA3 or TA3-MTX-R cells, but it rendered 30% of the mice with TA3 or TA3-MTX-R cells tumor free. On the other hand, NDGA andNDGATA inhibited primarily mitochondrial electron flow;therefore, transmembrane potential decreased andmitochondrial ATP synthesis was interrupted. They alsoincreased the accumulation of doxorubicin and inhibited theefflux of rhodamine 123 from both the parental TA3 cell line,and from the resistant, TA3-MTX-R cell line. In addition,mitochondrial permeability transition pore was opened,cytochrome cwas released and an increase of caspase 3 activity was detected. Consequently, cell viability and growthrate also decreased. In conclusion, NDGA and NDGATA areselective cytotoxic compounds to tumour cells. They inhibitedthe production of energy necessary for ATP-dependenttransporter function, representing a new class of compoundsthat could be exploited for use in malignancies that display thephenomenon of MDR.

However, the emergence of resistance toanticancer drugs (MDR) has made many of the availableanticancer drugs ineffective. The most significant mechanismof MDR is that resulting from the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a member of ABC transporters thatdecreases the intracellular concentration of chemotherapeutics.Therefore, when used in combination, MDR modulators orinhibitors may restore the cytotoxicity of the anticancer drugs against MDR tumour cells. In our search for anticancer agents from Euphorbia species, traditionally used to treat cancer, we have isolated andcharacterized, by spectroscopic methods, several macrocycliclathyrane and jatrophane diterpenes, which were evaluated asPgp modulators. The ability of compounds to reduce the transport activity of Pgp on the L5178 mouse lymphoma cell line containing thehuman MDR1 gene was studied by flow-cytometry. Thereversal of MDR was investigated by measuring therhodamine-123 accumulation, a fluorescent substrate analogueof doxorubicin, in cancer cells. Verapamil was applied as apositive control. In order to obtain evidence for synergistic interactions, the in vitro antiproliferative effects of some resistance modifiers were studied in combination with doxorubicine/epirubicine,on human MDR1 gene-transfected mouse lymphoma cells, using the checkerboard microplate method. The majority of the macrocyclic diterpenes tested showed to be very strong modulators of Pgp. The results obtainedhighlighted the importance of the involvement of ring A oflathyranes and jatrophanes in the modulation of Pgp. Theimportance of general requirements, such as lipophilicity andthe potential ability to form H-bonds, was also corroboratedby these results. All the diterpenes assayed for theirantiproliferative effects in combination withdoxorubicine/epirubicine, have shown synergistic interactionwith the antitumour drug. According to these results, macrocyclic diterpenes may be valuable as lead compounds for the development of Pgpinhibitors in different multidrug-resistant cancer cells. 198 ANTINEOPLASIC ACTIVITY OF PHENOLICCOMPOUNDS AGAINST SENSITIVE ANDRESISTANT HUMAN CANCER CELLS No\u00e9lia Duarte 1, Hermann Lage2and Maria-Jos\u00e9 U. Ferreira1 1Institute for Medicines and Pharmaceutical Sciences (iMed.UL), Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Lisbon,Lisbon, Portugal; 2Charit\u00e9 Campus Mitte, Institute of Pathology, Berlin, Germany Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the major problems in clinical oncology. This phenomenon is due to variousbiochemical mechanisms including overexpression of thewell-known ABC transporter MDR1/P-gp. One possibleapproach to overcome MDR is to find out new anticancerdrugs without cross resistance in cancer cells exhibiting amultidrug-resistant phenotype. The aim of this work was toanalyze the antineoplasic activity of several phenolicAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3279compounds isolated from Euphorbia species. The tested compounds, including stilbenes, flavanoids and coumarins,were investigated for their potential antiproliferative activityin several human cancer cell lines derived from threedifferent tumour entities: gastric (EPG85-257), pancreatic(EPP85-181) and colon each case, two different multidrug-resistant variants ofthese cells were also investigated: cell lines with a classicalMDR phenotype (associated with the overexpression ofMDR1/P-gp) and cell lines with an atypical MDRphenotype (no enhanced expression of MDR1/P-gp). Forassessment of cytotoxicity of the tested compounds, the IC 50 values of each agent were determined by proliferationassays in each of the different cell variants. The etoposide-specific IC 50values were measured as positive control for maintenance of the drug-resistant phenotype. Relativeresistance (RR) values were also determined as the relationbetween the IC 50of the resistant cell line and the IC50of the parental drug-sensitive cell line. In parental drug sensitivecell lines, all the tested compounds showed a weakantiproliferative effect. However, most of the multidrug-resistant cancer sublines showed increased sensitivities tothe studied compounds when compared to the parentalsublines. One flavanoid was found to be highly effectiveagainst the atypical MDR subline of gastric carcinoma, inwhich the flavanoid was 15-fold more effective than inparental \"drug-sensitive\" cells. The results obtained indicatethat some of the phenolic compounds tested may beinteresting for the development of new drugs againstresistant human cancer cells. 199 INVESTIGATION OF CHROMOSOMAL GAINS ANDLOSSES do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil; 2Medicine/Medical Colorado, Aurora, 3Hospital Base/FAMERP - Medicine School, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Preto, SP, Brazil Chagasic megaesophagus is a dilation of the esophagus caused by the impact of the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi in the mioenteric plexus. One of the most serious complicationsof megaesophagus is the increased risk (3%-8%) to developesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, ESCC. Whilenumerous genetic alterations have been reported in the initialand advanced steps of esophageal carcinogenesis, studies inchagasic megaesophagus are scarce, and this investigationaimed to use FISH technology to identify the genomic status in chagasic megaesophagus of genes showing recurrentimbalances in ESCC. This study cohort included 40 patientswith diagnosis of chagasic megaesophagus. FISH probeswere paraffin-embedded tissue sectioned at 4 um.The analyses were carried out using single and dual bandpass interference filters. For each specimen, signals werescored in 100 epithelial nuclei (50 in superficial layer - S,and 50 in basal layer - B). Descriptive statistics werecalculated and the range of the mean copy number per cellwas 1.58-1.94 (S) and 1.60-2.22 (B) 1.30-1.64 and 1.60-1.84 (B) for MYC . The scoring was performed in both histological layers to checkfor differences between proliferative activity, since the basalcells have higher level of proliferative activity; however nodifference was observed. Despite the involvement ofgenomic imbalances in esophageal carcinogenesis, none ofthe above genes were found unbalanced in chagasicmegaesophagus. 200 MOLECULAR CYTOGENETICS, MUTATIONS ANDIMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil; 2Medicine/Medical Colorado, Aurora, 3Hospital Base/FAMERP - Medicine School, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Preto, SP, Brazil Chagasic megaesophagus is a dilation of the esophagus caused Trypanosoma cruzi , etiological agent most seriouscomplications of megaesophagus is the increased risk (3%-8%) to develop esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, ESCC.While numerous genetic alterations have been reported in theinitial and advanced steps of esophageal carcinogenesis,studies in chagasic megaesophagus are scarce. So, thisinvestigation aimed to use FISH, PCR-SSCP/sequencing ofDNA and immunohistochemistry technologies to identify theANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: (2008) 3280genomic protein status of P16 and FHIT in chagasic megaesophagus. This study cohort included 20 esophagealbiopsies of patients with diagnosis of chagasic megaesophagusand 10 normal esophageal mucosa biopsies. For FISH, signalswere scored in 100 epithelial nuclei (50 in superficial layer -S, and 50 in basal layer - B). Descriptive statistics werecalculated and the range of the mean copy number per cellwas 1.28-1.74 (S) and 1.30-1.82 (B) (S) and 1.60-1.92 (B) for FHIT . The analysis of mutation in the exons 1 and 2 of P16 and 5 and 7 of FHIT shown a silent mutation (polymorphism) at codon 88 (exon 7) in the FHIT gene in a sample of megaesophagus. Immunostaining and cytoplasmic staining) staining) proteins was graded by intensity ofstaining as negative i.e. (-) absence brown staining, or (+) weakly stained; or as positive i.e. (++) moderately stained and (+++) strongly stained. Positive scores (++/+++) correspondto normal protein expression, while negative immunostaining(-/+) is associated with loss of protein expression. Descriptivestatistics, Kruskall-Wallis test with Dunn post-test was used todetermined statistical significance. Despite the progressive lossof expression of p16 protein, none statistical difference wasobserved. The absence of stain was not observed for Fhitprotein: the immunostaining was diffuse, ranging from weakto strongly stained. However, statistical significance was notfound for Fhit expression. We can concluded the threetechniques showed similar results, indicating that geneticalterations in P16 and FHIT are not common events in chagasic megaesophagus, although they are related to ESCCdevelopment. 201 DETERMINANTS OF HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS INCOLORECTAL AND BREAST CANCER PATIENTS P. Ferroni 1, R. Palmirotta1, F. Martini1, F. M. San Raffaele, Rome; 2Medical Oncology, Department of of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy Background: Methylation abnormalities appear to be important for the pathogenesis of many cancer types.Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a andregulates the intracellular of DNA. MTHFR 677TT variantincreases Hcy concentration and reduces DNA methylationin cancer patients. However, Hcy metabolism is dependentnot only on genetic, but also on acquired factors. TargetingTNF pathway can significantly decrease total Hcy (tHcy),suggesting a role for this cytokine in Hcy metabolism. Therefore, we analyzed the possible associations betweentHcy levels and MTHFR polymorphisms or inflammatorymarkers in patients with breast or colorectal cancer.Methods: Forty-seven patients (15 males, mean age 59\u00b114 (n=35) or relapsing (n=12) breast the Oncologyof \"Tor Vergata\" Clinical Center, were enrolled into thestudy. All patients were followed up for a median period of14 months. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.MTHFR 677C \u00a1T and were all significantly higher in patients compared to healthy controls. Nodifferences were observed between breast and colorectalcancer patients for all laboratory variables. THcy levelssignificantly correlated with both IL-6 and by Anova test showed thatserum tHcy levels were not associated to either MTHFR677C\u00a1T or 1298A \u00a1C. Multiple regression analysis including tHcy as sex, age,diagnosis, metastasis, fibrinogen, hsCRP, (beta=0.50, and TNF independent of elevated tHcy levels. TNF, in turn, was significantlyassociated to the presence of lymph node involvement(beta=0.54, p<0.005). Conclusion: Our data indicate that the MTHFR polymorphisms do not significantly contribute totHcy levels in breast and colorectal cancer, while we showsome evidence that cancer-related inflammation may beassociated with elevated tHcy levels, possibly involving aTNF-alpha mediated pathway.

Many experiments suggested that cell membranes mightbe one of the relevant targets of the radiation and studies onmodels showed that the water balance around the membrane isaltered by exposing samples to low power millimetre waves(4). When we deal with the study of the interaction betweenmillimeter wave and biological systems, one of the mainchallenges is to monitor relevant biological processes thatcharacterize a system during its exposure to the aboveelectromagnetic radiation. This condition should allow one toobserve, in real-time, any significant variation of thoseproperties and then to evaluate the biological effects inducedby the radiation and its dependence on various exposureparameters such as frequency, power density and irradiationtime, that might affect the response of the system. Nuclearmagnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a very versatiletechnique for investigating, at a molecular level, severalfunctional properties of various biological systems. Here wedescribe the experimental set-up used for the exposure ofvarious biosystems to millimeter waves contextually to theacquisition of NMR spectra. The enormous potentiality of ourmethod is underlined by showing some noticeable examplesof its application, such as in the study of the metabolism ofperfused living cells, or for the characterization of thestructural and kinetic properties of bilayer membrane models.A brief discussion De Rose A and Chidichimo G: Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Biological Effects ofEMFs, 2006, V ol.

Methods: A retrospective study of all cases of BROJ treated in four Belgian institutions wasperformed, aimed to compare medical to surgical treatmentand find pronostic factors. Results: 34 cases were retrieved, of whom 88.5% were treated for disseminated cancers and 11.5%for osteoporosis. In our study, the most frequently usedbisphosphonate was zoledronic acid (83%), either alone or incombination with pamidronate or ibandronate. 57% of patientswere cured with only medical treatment, which wassignificantly different from the 20% obtained with surgicalmanagement ( p=0.02). This study also revealed that lesions smaller than 1 cm had a better prognosis ( p=0.0009). Discussion: Although limited and retrospective, this study indicates that current surgical procedures are not beneficial inmanagement of BROJ. Further studies, especially prospective,will have to be conducted to propose better approaches. In oursearch for epidemiological and clinical data on this disease,we are conducting an exhaustive review of all described casesof BROJ, hoping this will lead to new enlightments on thepathophysiology and treatment of this condition. This studyhas already reached nearly 2000 cases. 204 TAp63 IS A KEY REGULATOR OF DNA DAMAGE,GENOMIC STABILITY AND STEM CELLMAINTENANCE STEM CELL MAINTENANCE Xiaohua Su 1, Min Soon Cho1,2, Young Jin Gi1, Yu-Li Lin1, Wei X. Zhang1and Elsa R. Flores1,2 1The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology and 2The University of Texas Graduate School of 77030, TX, USAANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3282p63 is critical for the maintenance of epidermal stem cell proliferation, differentiation, and also plays a role in thesuppression of tumorigenesis and metastasis. The existence ofmultiple isoforms (TA and N) of p63 with apparently opposing functions has complicated the study of p63. To begin to decipher the roles of these isoforms in vivo , we have generated TAp63 conditional knockout ( TAp63 fl/fl) using the cre-loxP system and intercrossed them with zp3-cre transgenic mice to generate TAp63-/-mice. Interestingly, some of the TAp63-/-mice have an early embryonic lethal phenotype at E6.5. The mice that survive to birth developsevere ulcerated wounds by the age of 1 to 3 months. Thesemice also exhibit signs of premature aging, increased DNAdamage, and genomic instability in dermal and epidermalcells. These defects result from a hyperproliferation andsubsequent premature depletion of stem cells involved inwound healing. We also found that levels of TAp63 areinduced in the wound healing process. In addition to thestriking role that TAp63 plays in epidermal repair, we have found that mice deficient for this isoform are tumor prone.TAp63 deletion in combination with p53 results in a highly metastatic tumor phenotype. These studies have unveiledpreviously unrecognized roles for TAp63 in DNA damage, epithelial wound repair, and in cancer. 205 ASSOCIATION OF PROSTATE-SPECIFIC ANTIGENAND PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES INPATHOLOGICAL HUMAN M. and Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Bizerte7021 Zarzouna, Tunisia Aim: Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is more reflective of the presence of benign prostatic hyperplasia(BPH) than of the extent of cancer and, therefore, does notprovide additional information. At present, several researchgroups are focusing on the search for new biochemicalmarkers capable of predicting prostate cancer and prognosis.In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines are related to theproduction of PSA and progression of prostate cancer The aimof this study was to relate the serum PSA levels with theexpression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6and TNF-) and their receptors in normal and pathological(hyperplasia and cancer) prostatic tissue to elucidate theirpossible role in tumor progression. We also discuss thepossible use of these cytokines as potential therapeutics. Methods: The study was carried out in 5 normal, 25 benign prostatic hyperplastic (BPH) and 18 PSA were assayedby IMMULITE autoanalyser. Results: The results most relevant BPH, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF were onlyexpressed in the patients included in the groups with PSAserum levels of 0-4 ng/ml PSA or 4-20 ng/ml PSA, but not inthe with PSA >20 ngml. In PC, these cytoines wereonly expressed in the patients included in the groups with PSAserum levels >4 ng/ml, increasing the expression when thesepatients were included in the group with most elevated PSAlevel (>20 ng/ml). Conclusion: In PC there was an association the high expression of TNF, IL-6, IL-1, elevatedPSA serum levels and tumor progression. A betterunderstanding of the biological mechanism and role played bythe elevation of circulating PSA related with the tissueexpression of these cytokines may possibly improve clinicalmanagement and provide new targets for therapy in thesepatients.Supported by grants from the \"Ministerio OF XIAP IN NORMAL AND PATHOLOGICAL(BENIGN R.

Madrid, Spain Aim: Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) is a gene family that plays an essential role in the negative regulation ofapoptosis. The IAP inhibit apoptosis by a variety of stimuli(Deveraux, 1999). XIAP and survivin have been identified asthe most potent inhibitors of caspases and apoptosis. The aimof this study was to elucidate the possible involvement of theseIAPs in prostate cancer development and their role in thebreakdown of the apoptosis-proliferation equilibrium.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3283Methods : Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses were performed in 20 samples of normal prostate (NP), 35samples of benign hyperplasia (BPH), and 93 samples ofprostate cancer (PC) diagnosed with low (grades 1 to 6, 21men), medium (grades 7-8, 51 men) and high (grades >8, 21men) Gleason grades. prostates. Cytoplasmic immunoreactionto survivin in epithelial cells was observed in 9.1% of BPHpatients and 19.35% of PC patients (optic density wasincreased with Gleason grade). Immunoreaction to XIAP wasobserved in cells 20% of normalprostates, 27.27% of BPH patients and 32% of PC patients.Optical density was higher in BPH than in normal prostates,and even higher in PC, but no differences between Gleasongroups were found. Conclusion: Survivin in several malignances has been associated with higher tumor grade,advanced disease stage, and as an unfavourable marker ofdisease progression. XIAP overexpression in tumor cells hasbeen shown to cause an inhibitory effect on cell death. In thisway, inhibition of these IAPs might be a possible target for PCtreatment.Supported by grants from the \"Ministerio de PREVENTSTUMORIGENESIS Aleksandra Franovic and Stephen Lee Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada,K1H 8M5 The ability of cancer cells to proliferate autonomously is perhaps the most critical hallmark of malignancies. Anexample of how a genetic mutation can confer this oncogenictrait is the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha(HIF-2) and its activation of the TGF/EGFR growth circuitthat drives VHL-loss clear cell renal carcinoma (VHL -/-RCC) tumor formation. HIF-2 is similarly expressed in the core ofmost solid tumors as a consequence of microenvironmentalstressors such as hypoxia. This raises the possibility that thetumor microenvironment can promote the persistentproliferation of tumor cells under otherwise non-permissiveconditions by stabilizing HIF-2 in a manner analogous toVHL-loss. Here, we show that silencing HIF-2, but not thepredominantly pro-angiogenic HIF-1 isoform, prevents in vivo proliferation and tumorigenesis of a panel of genetically diverse human cancers. Furthermore, treatment of xenografttumors by intratumoral injection of siRNA against HIF-2results in their regression, highlighting its importance in tumormaintenance. These results suggest that HIF-2 activation, as a result of genetic alterations or physiological stimuli,represents a common oncogenic event that is required for theestablishment of an overt carcinoma. As such, we propose thattargeting HIF-2 may be of broad clinical interest in thetreatment of human cancer. 208 ALLEVIATION OF SIDE-EFFECTS OFANTICANCER THERAPEUTICS HMG-COAREDUCTASE INHIBITORS (STATINS) Tobias also impact various genotoxic stress-induced signaling mechanims by inhibiting the function ofregulatory proteins, in particular Ras and Rho GTPases. Bythis means, statins sensitize tumor cells to killing by anticancerdrugs. Here we address the question whether statins arebeneficial in anticancer therapy by alleviating side-effects ofradiotherapy and the anticancer drug doxorubicin on normaltissue. To this end, we investigated the effect of lovastatin onionizing radiation (IR)- and doxorubicin-induced signaling andapoptosis in primary human endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. Moreover, initial in vivo studies were performed. Low-dose pre-treatment with lovastatin protected HUVECs from IR- and doxorubicin-induced asmeasured by cell viability, cell proliferation and IR- and doxorubicin-provoked increase inCD95L and CD95R Activation of executor was notdetected 48-72 h yet pan-caspase inhibitor Z-V found radioprotection bylovastatin to be independent of the formation and repair ofDNA damage. In contrast, doxorubicin-triggered DNA strandbreak induction was attenuated by lovastatin, which was to doxorubicin uptake or efflux.Doxorubicin and IR-inducible DNA damage-related stressresponses, including accumulation of p53 and p21 aswell activation of checkpoint kinase (Chk-1), IR-induced NF- up- lovastatin.

Therefore, we suggest that lovastatin might be clinically useful in alleviatingside-effects of IR and doxorubicin on normal tissue duringtumor therapy. 209 DEVELOPMENT OF A THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D)ALL-HUMAN, IN VITRO MODEL OF THE BLOOD- BRAIN BARRIER FOR CANCER METASTASISSTUDIES USING ELECTRIC CELL-SUBSTRATEIMPEDANCE SENSING SYSTEM (ECIS) ANDTRANSWELLS K.E. Fry and G.J. Pilkington Cellular and Molecular Neuro-oncology Research Group, Institute of Biomedical and Biomolecular Sciences, Schoolof Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University ofPortsmouth, St Michael's Building, White Swan Road,Portsmouth PO1 2DT, UK Background: Around 25% of cancers will spread to the brain by passing through the physical blood-brain barrier (B-BB)and thereby worsen prognosis. Melanoma, breast and lungcancer are among the most frequent primary tumours whichmetastasise to the brain. In vitro models of the B-BB generally utilise murine or porcine brain endothelium and rat astrocytes.In addition, these models are grown in foetal calf serumsupplemented conditions which modify growth rates and celladhesive properties. Aim: To develop a 3D in vitro model from human brain-derived cells under human supplementation forthe study of the passage of cancer cells across the cellular B-BB using different techniques such as ECIS, Transwells andFlocel. Materials and Methods: The B-BB model Non-small lung cancer, breast cancer andmelanoma cells have been chosen to add to the model. Allcells have been characterised with appropriate immunomarkers using flow cytometry and immunocytochemistrywhile growth curves and adhesion properties have beenestablished for the B-BB components. Electric cell-substrateimpedance sensing system (ECIS) has been investigated alongwith co-culturing on Transwells. Results: Growth curves, antigenic expression, adhesive properties and growth onTranswells have been established. ECIS has demonstrated thepotential of hCMEC/D3 to form a tight barrier and thedifference extracellular matrices and conditioned media has onthe impedance values. Cancer cells have also been assessedwhen added to the hCMEC/D3 monolayer. Discussion: We are currently assessing the model using a combination of live cellimaging, TIRF microscopy and confocal microscopy. Themodel has experiments of co-culturing with CC-2565 will beexplored. Flocel will be the next technique to be studied. Weaim to identify discrete pathways underlying entry of variousmetastatic somatic cancer cells into the brain.

Among non-B-DNAstructures, tetraplex or quadruplex configurations of guanine-rich sequences are of growing interest. Tetrahelical structuresin promoter sequences were implicated in the regulation ofexpression of multiple genes such as those that encode insulin,c-MYC, c-kit, bcl-2, VEGF and PDF-A. We investigated the potential role of quadruplex structures of upstream sequences of muscle-specific genes in modulatingthe action of a family of myogenic factors (MRFs).These master transcription factors; MyoD, Myf5, toconserved E-box elements, d(CANN TG), in their regulatory regions. We report that promoter and enhancer tracts of severalmuscle-specific genes contain, beside E-boxes, a highfrequency of clusters of structures of muscle-specificregulatory sequences much more tightly than their target E-box. By contrast, heterodimers of MyoD or MRF4 with anE47 protein form tighter complexes with E-box than with thetetraplex DNA structures. Although myogenin-E47heterodimers also bind bind and non-preferentially. Structure-function analysis identified the E-boxAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3285and quadruplex DNA-binding sites in MyoD and Myogenin and established that the different basic domains of the twohomodimeric proteins are the sole determinants of theirdifferent affinities for quadruplex DNA. Based on our results, we offer models for the involvement of promoter quadruplex structures in the regulation of muscle-specific gene transcription. 211 NOVEL STRATEGY OF ANTI-ANGIOGENICTHERAPY FOR UTERINE CERVICAL CANCER Jiro FujimotoDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Graduate School of Gifu University School of Medicine, 1-1 Yanagido, GifuCity 501-1194, Japan Angiogenesis is essential for development, growth and advancement of the primary tumor and especially itsmetastatic lesions. Angiogenic activity in tumors is related tothe prognosis of most patients. Suppression of angiogenicpotential in the tumors leads to inhibition of the primary tumorand its metastatic lesions. These facts prompted us to studythe behaviour of overexpressed angiogenic factors andstrategies for suppressing angiogenic potential. The elevation of VEGF contributes to the relatively late advancement via angiogenic activity in advanced adenocarcinomas of the cervix (Brit J Cancer, 1999).Furthermore, VEGF associated with COX-2 works onadvancement of uterine cervical cancer via angiogenesis, and long-term administration of COX-2 inhibitors might beeffective on the suppression of regrowth or recurrence afterintensive treatment for advanced uterine cervical cancer. IL-8levels correlate with microvessel and infiltrated macrophagecounts, and the localization of IL-8 is similar to that of CD68specific to macrophages. The prognosis of patients with highIL-8 was extremely poor. Consequently, IL-8 can be regardedas a prognostic indicator as an angiogenic factor supplied frommacrophages in uterine cervical cancer (Cancer Res, 2000).Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) has a wide range of expressionand is highly expressed in uterine cervical cancer regardlessof clinical stage. The prognosis of patients with high TP inprimary tumors is worse than in those with low TP. Hence, itis apparent that TP in uterine cervical cancer plays a role ofbasic angiogenesis in all processes of advancement of uterinecervical cancer (Brit J Cancer, 1999). Furthermore, TPremarkably increased in 8 of 40 metastatic lymph node lesionsof uterine cervical cancer, and the prognosis of the patientswith high TP in metastatic lymph node lesions was extremelypoor. Therefore, TP expressed in stromal cells appears tocontribute to the advancement of metastatic lymph nodes afterthe establishment of metastasis, and is recognized as aprognostic indicator (Cancer Res, 1999). Incidentally, VEGF-C and osteopontin expressed in cancer cells directly contributes to lymph node metastasis in uterine cervical cancer(Brit J Cancer, 2004, Cancer Lett, 2007). In addition, serumTP is recognized as a novel tumor marker regardless ofhistopathological type of the uterine cervical cancer (CancerRes, 2000). On the other hand, E 26 transcription-specific(ETS)-1 levels correlate with microvessel counts, and thelocalization of ETS-1 is similar to that of vascular endothelialcells in uterine cervical cancers. ETS-1 levels correlate withIL-8 and TP levels associated with ETS-1might work on angiogenesis as an angiogenic transcriptionfactor and be a prognostic indicator in uterine cervical cancer.To avoid inducing alternative angiogenic pathways as a sort oftolerance to an angiogenic inhibitor, the simultaneoussuppression of the main target angiogenic factors IL-8 and TP,and the transcription factor ETS-1 might be highly effective(Ann Oncol, 2002, Cancer Sci 2006). Furthermore, interferon--inducible protein (IP)-10 inversely-correlates withmicrovessel density associated with VEGF, and might affectthe suppression of angiogenesis in advancement. Therefore,IP-10 activation might be effective on the suppression ofadvanced uterine cervical cancers (Brit J Cancer, 2007). Weare looking forward to proceeding with clinical trials ofantiangiogenic agents in advansed-stage patients and aftercurative resection for uterine cervical cancer. 212 THE FIRST IN VIVO EXPERIMENTS WITH THE COMBINATION OF TAXOL AND SILA-421, A Szeged, Faculty of Medicine, H-6720 Szeged,D\u00f3m t\u00e9r 10.; 21st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Faculty of Medicine, H-1085 Budapest, \u00dclli \u00fat 26., Hungary Cancer chemotherapy is one of the most important tools of the treatment of malignancies. The efficiency of chemotherapy isoften reduced by the appearance of multidrug resistant cellsin the tumour and during the treatment course these multidrugresistant cells overgrow sensitive cells due to a selectivepressure of chemotherapy. One of the most frequent forms ofMDR is an ABC transporter, the P-glycoprotein mediatedresistance. This efflux pump extrudes chemotherapeutic agentsfrom the cells, which is the major limitation of chemotherapy.Since inhibitors of MDR drug efflux can be promising agentsto reverse the multidrug resistance, the effects of disiloxanswere studied in vivo , as resistance modifiers in mice. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3286In this work we showed that the combination of the vivo . After that we compared the results with the earlier experiments (with SILA-409). SILA-421 was more effective than SILA-409. For the in vivo tests we used immunosuppressed CBA mice with s.c. implanted pancreatic carcinomas. These animals were treated with acombination of SILA-421 (10 mg/kg) and Taxol (7 mg/kgb.w./twice a week) for 4 weeks. Every week, tumours weremeasured and the actual tumour volume was calculated. At theend of the 4th week the mice were sacrificed and the tumourswere removed. The removed tumours were fixed in formalinand embedded in paraplast. Slides were created from everytumour and an immunohistochemical method was applied withKi-67 and p170 antibodies. Digital photos were made from theslides after the rates of the Ki-67 positive cells were measuredwith an image analysing software (IMAN). The continuous measure of the tumour volume brought an interesting result: there was a tumour volume decrease bymore than 50% on the 2nd week and this volume was stableuntil the end of the experiment. SILA-421 has a better inhibiting potential than its predecessor, SILA-409, and the results show that SILA-421has also an apoptotic effect, too. The results indicate that theSILA mdr inhibitor compounds are promising agents in thefuture cancer therapy. 213 SITE-SPECIFIC MUTATION IN THE CATALYTICDOMAIN OF TOPOISOMERASE II ALTERSENZYMATIC ACTIVITY DNA Dale R. Grabowski, H. Andersen *, Ram Ganapathi and Mahrukh K. Ganapathi Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA; *Aarhus The DNA topoisomerase (topo) catalyzes topological transformations of DNA and regulates DNAmetabolic events, such as DNA replication andrecombination, chromosome condensation and segregationand transcription. Two related topo II isozymes, topo II andtopo II, are present in mammals. Although both enzymescatalyze similar enzymatic reactions in vitro , they exhibit differential patterns of expression and discrete physiologicfunctions in vivo , suggesting that these isozymes are distinctly regulated. Since, both enzymes are phosphorylated andphosphorylation, of at least the topo II isozyme, regulatesenzyme activity and function, in this study we initiated massspectrometry experiments to identify relevant phosphorylationsites in topo II. During the course of these studies, we serendipitously identified an essential tyrosine (Y661),located in the catalytic domain, which when mutated tophenylalanine (F) significantly reduced the decatenationactivity of topo II and yeast also less sensitive to ionizing radiationthan those expressing WT protein. Although Y661, along sites, serine (S) 1400, threonine (T) 1431 andS1550, was initially identified by mass spectrometry apotential phosphorylation site (+80 Da modification), themodification determined to be dueto oxidative bromination (+80 which cyanogen bromide and trypsin.Nevertheless, this reactive site, which plays a critical role intopo II function, was the only site found to influence topoII activity. Interestingly, mutation of the equivalent tyrosine,Y640, in topo II, minimally (~2-fold less) influenced thedecatenation activity of this topo II and did not alter drugsensitivity to topo II-targeted drugs. These data suggest thattopo II is regulated by a novel mechanism, involvingoxidation at Y661. This mechanism may be important formodulating biological functions that respond to DNA damageand oxidative stress, wherein an oxidative environment ispresent. 214 NOVEL IN Mahrukh K. Ganapathi and Ram Ganapathi Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA The high incidence and mortality of ovarian cancer coupled with the difficulty in detecting the disease in the early-stagesposes a major clinical challenge. Among the 75-80% of thepatients who present with stage III or stage IV ovarian cancerat the time of diagnosis, 70-80% of the women respond to thestandard treatment protocol, which involves surgery followedby 6-8 courses of chemotherapy with platinum, e.g. carboplatin, and a taxane, e.g. paclitaxel. However, ~30% of patients that exhibit disease progression either duringtreatment or within 6 months after the last course ofchemotherapy, also do poorly with second-line treatment. Thisremains a major problem in the management of ovarian cancerAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3287since no markers predicting early relapse or genes functionally linked to chemo-sensitivity to platinum and/or taxane therapyhave been validated. Our gene expression profiling studies of stage III ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma using cDNA microarray technologyhave identified a set of three genes that are independentpredictors of response to chemotherapy and clinical outcome.Two over-expressedprotein (PSMA3 ) are significantly up-regulated in ovarian tumors of patients who have undergone primary surgical cytoreductionand who respond poorly to first-line therapy, whereas CCL2 ), is significantly down-regulated in this same patient cohort. In ovarian cancer cell lines the A(-2518)G polymorphism in the promoter region of the CCL2 gene, which has beenpreviously reported to affect expression of the CCL2 gene, led to reduced expression of CCL2 mRNA and protein. Testing the function of CCL2 in ovarian cancer cell lines demonstrated that reduced expression was correlated with resistance tocisplatin and paclitaxel. Ectopic overexpression of CCL2 in anovarian cancer cell line led to enhanced sensitivity topaclitaxel but not cisplatin and also reduced tumor cellinvasion in a Biocoat \u00aeMatrigel invasion assay. The overexpression and PSMA3 was also correlated withresistance to cisplatin in several cell culture models of ovariancancer. Cisplatin treatment in a dose-dependent manner led toa 2- to 3-fold increase in accumulation of cells in G 2+M phase (indicative of enhanced DNA damage) in CROP siRNA- transfected cells in which CROP mRNA was down-regulated >70% compared to similar cells transfected with a scrambledsiRNA. In the long-term, establishing the functional role of CCL2, CROP or PSMA3 as predictors of response to chemotherapy and outcome in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancerwill allow for the development of novel strategies for detectionand treatment. 215 ROLE OF CASEIN KINASE I ISOZYMES Andersen *, Mahrukh K. Ganapathi and Ram Ganapathi Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA; *Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark Human topoisomerase (topo) II is an essential enzyme that regulates DNA topology. In human leukemia HL-60, cellsresistance to topoisomerase (topo) II targeting drugs, such asetoposide, was found to be associated with site-specifichypophosphorylation of topo II. Resistance to etoposide was found to be calcium dependent, since resistance to etoposidecould be mimicked in sensitive cells treated with theintracellular Ca 2+chelator, 1,2- (Ser-1106) in the catalytic domain oftopo II as a major phosphorylation site, phosphorylation ofwhich regulated activity of topo II. wasfound to be hypophosphorylated in sensitive cells treated withBAPTA-AM or in etoposide-resistant cells. The observedcorrelation of Ser-1106 hypophosphorylation with etoposideresistance in cell culture model systems was confirmed in blastcells from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, whereinhypophosphorylation of Ser-1106 was correlated with reducedetoposide-induced apoptosis. Since Ser-1106 kinases, casein kinase (CK) I and CKII we these enzymes to phosphorylate this sitein vivo using HL-60 and colon cancer HCT-116 cells. The CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 and IC-261, reduced phosphorylation Ser-1106 and decreased formation specifically targets the Ca 2+-regulated isozymes, CKI and CKI, we examined the effect of down-regulating these enzymes on Ser-1106 phosphorylation.Down-regulation of these in S. cerevisiae cells transformed with human topo II, was enhanced following re-expression of human CKI. Down-regulation of CKI andCKI also led to significantly reduced formation of etoposide-stabilized topo II-DNA cleavable complex. These results provide strong support for an essential role of CKI/ in phosphorylating Ser-1106 in human topo II andin Alan Garen 1and Xu Song2 1Yale University School of 333 Cedar St., New Haven, CT 06520, USA; 2Sichuan University, 29 Wangjiang Road, Chengdu, Sichuan 610064, P.R. China We present a model for generating tumor cells from differentiated cells and stem cells, based on a mechanism ofgene regulation involving the tumor-suppressor protein PSFANTICANCER a DNA-binding domain (DBD) that binds to the promoter of agene and represses transcription, and two RNA-bindingdomains (RBDs) that bind a ncRNA, releasing PSF andactivating transcription. The model has six postulates. (i)Proliferation of stem cells and tumor cells is driven bymultiple proto-oncogenes, some of which which are repressedby PSF and activated by PSF-binding RNAs. (ii) The level ofPSF-binding RNAs is high in stem cells and tumor cells,preventing repression of proto-oncogenes by PSF andpromoting proliferation. (iii) PSF-binding RNAs disappear inmost the end of embryogensis, enabling PSF torepress proto-oncogenes and initiate differentiation. (iv)Somatic mutations in a stem cell or differentiated cell canresult in a high level of PSF-binding RNAs, generating a cloneof tumor cells. (vi) The level PSF-binding RNAs is miRNAs that degrade PSF-binding rasoncogenes that induce synthesis of PSF-binding RNAs. Thus, the model predicts that PSF and miRNAs that degradePSF-binding RNAs act as tumor-suppressors, and PSF-bindingRNAs and ras oncogenes act as tumor-promoters. The evidence for the model will be discussed. 217 NEW APPROACHES IN COLORECTAL CANCERGENETICS Maria GazouliDepartment of Biology, School of Medicine, University of Athens, Michalakopoulou 176, 11527 Athens, Greece Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and fourth-leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Lifetime riskin Western European and North American populations isaround 5%. Both genetic and environmental factors contributeto disease etiology, with about one-third of disease varianceattributed to inherited genetic factors. For complex diseases,such as CRC, genetics research in human populations,remarkable progress has been made in recent times with thepublication of a number of genome-wide association scans(GWAS) and subsequent statistical replications. These studieshave identified new genes and pathways implicated in disease,many of which were not known before. Until very recently,the defined genetic contribution to CRC comprised rare, high-penetrance variants in a few BMPR1A and MUTYH ). In a study to identify loci associated with CRC,555,510 single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped indifferent populations including 747 Greek CRC cases and 850controls. The GWAS studies revealed to CRC risk. As well as providing risk estimates for population groups,identification of CRC risk loci provides new insights into disease causation. Studies of the mechanisms by which thesegenetic associations impact CRC risk could lead to thedevelopment of small molecule interventions forchemoprevention and chemotherapy. 218 CYTOTOXIC AND ANTIPROLIFERATIVEACTIVITIES OF COBALT (II) COMPLEXES WITHDIFFERENT LIGANDS ON CULTURED TUMORCELLS R.

Street7; 4Institute Pecs, Szigeti str 12, H-7624 Pecs, Hungary We studied promising antineoplastic activity wouldextend to anticarcinogenic properties, the effects of thesemolecules on the DMBA (7,12- dimethylbenz[]anthracene)-induced expression of H-ras and p53 in isolated RNA fromliver, lung, kidney, thymus and bone marrow of CBA/Cainbred mice was investigated. Elevated expression ofoncogenes after treatment with DMBA has been reportedpreviously. Administration of these molecules simultaneously with DMBA, 24 h prior to or 24 h after the DMBA treatmentcharacteristically modified the DMBA-induced expression ofthe genes \"short-term\" of DMBA and agent72, a styrylacrylonitrile compound, resulted in a significantdecrease of the DMBA induced expression of H-ras in allorgans; p53 expression decreased in liver, lung and bonemarrow, increased in kidney and thymus. Administration ofagent 72 24 h after the DMBA treatment reduced the DMBA-induced H-ras expression in all examined organs. The p53expression decreased in all organs except the kidney.Administration of agent 72 24 h prior to the DMBA treatmentreduced the DMBA-induced expression of H-ras in all organs. The expression of p53 induced by DMBA was elevated inkidney, in the bone marrow and lung, but decreased in thymus.Agent 72 alone decreased the expression of H-ras in allorgans. The p53 expression increased significantly in liver andkidney but decreased in the lung and remained almost thesame in the thymus and in the bone marrow. As previouslydescribed, this method is capable of screening promising anti-neoplastic molecules. 220 NOVEL ROLE OF NEURONAL CALCIUM SENSOR-1(NCS-1) AS PROGNOSTIC FACTOR ANDTHERAPEUTIC TARGET IN BREAST CANCER S. Germano 1, M. Clynes1, S. Kennedy2, J.P. Mehta1, Ryan1, S. Glynn1and L. O'Driscoll1 1National Institute for Cellular Biotechnology, Dublin City University, Dublin 9; 2St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin 4, Ireland Neuronal calcium formerly known as Frequenin, is a calmodulin-related EF-hand Ca2+binding protein expressed mainly, but andneuroendocrine cells. NCS-1 modulates synaptic transmissionand plasticity and has a regulatorof neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival. Notwithstandingthe diverse and well characterised biological functions of thisprotein in neurons, its involvement in cancer has never beenstudied. Here, the functional and clinical relevance of NCS-1in breast cancer was investigated. In a microarray analysis of103 invasive breast tumours and non-cancerous breastbiopsies, we identified NCS-1 to be expressed in a sub-groupof tumours (approximately 12% of cases), but to beundetectable in normal breast tissue. Multivariate andunivariate analyses revealed NCS-1 expression to and death ( p=0.0032) from time of diagnosis. To investigate the possible role ofNCS-1 in breast tumour cell biology, we characterised thebiological effects of this gene in vitro using breast cancer cell lines. To achieve this, NCS-1 expression was analysed in apanel of breast cancer cell lines using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and,following initial screening, two highly invasive triple negative(ER-, PR-, HER-2-) cell lines, Hs578T and HCC1143, as wellas the weakly invasive MCF7 cell line, were selected for gainof function experiments. NCS-1 cDNA was introduced intothese cells and associated effects on cell proliferation, motilityand invasiveness were evaluated, compared to empty-vectortransfected control cells. While monolayer cell growth rateANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3290was not affected, anchorage-independent growth was significant enhanced by NCS-1, with a remarkable tendencyfor NCS-1 transfected cells to form larger colonies comparedto the control cells. Motility of NCS-1 transfected cells wasalso significantly enhanced. Interestingly, the invasive ability,measured by monitoring invasion through matrigel in aBoyden Chamber assay, was also markedly increased. Ourresults suggest that NCS-1 may contribute to the malignantphenotype of breast cancer cells and may represent a newprognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for asub-group of breast cancer patients.Supported by the from Ireland's Health Research Board. 221 SURGERY IN BYZANTIUM S. GeroulanosOnassis Cardiac Surgery Center, Athens, Greece Surgery in Byzantium with respect to the research and results achieved in many other medical fields remained more or lessimpenetrable, despite its major contribution in conservation,development and transfer of ancient knowledge. There aredescriptions of ordinary or even of severe operations, thusmaking their study a fascinating subject. At least three of themost important physicians/authors of Byzantium, likeOreibassios, Aetios from Amida Aeginitisdescribed A selection ofthem is listed below:General Surgery: Strumectomy (with reference to the importance of recurrent nerve), herniotomy and herniorrhaphy,hydro- and varicocele operation, entero- Neurosurgery: Trepanation, craniotomy, elevation of impressed on cranialfractures.Angiology: Ligation of Rib resection, drainage of empyema, siamese twins (the first in the world).Gynaecology: Transvaginal hysterectomy, drainage of uterus empyema, operation of of hymenal, vaginal and uterus atresia, resection ofpudendal, vaginal and cervical condylomas.Obstetrics: Major improvements in irregular birth, use of forceps, embryotomy, support of genitals during birth, manualextraction of placentar rests, manual cleansing of uterus inpostpartal infection, abortion.Urology: Circumcision and phimosis operation, hypospadias operation (building resection anal atresia operation.Traumatology: All possible reductions of simple and complicated bone fractures and repositions of luxation,extractions of arrows, spears etc. including gastro-, duodeno-, jejuno-, colono-, and vesico-rrhaphy. The importance of the Byzantine texts in surgery were recognized in France, where they became by special decreeobligatory texts for the medical students of the Sorbonne fromthe beginning of the 17th century till the end of the 19thcentury. 222 IMMUNOMODULATION OF 2Department of Biochemistry, Ghent University, Faculty and Health Sciences, Albert Baertsoenkaai 3, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium Invasion and metastasis of cancer cells relies on dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton which is the drivingforce for cellular motility. Actin-associated or actin-bindingproteins aid in this process by virtue of their ability to interactAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3291reversibly with actin and actin filaments. The expression level of quite a few actin binding proteins is up-regulated in cancercells, and many studies have demonstrated a correlationbetween the expression of selected actin-binding proteins andcancer cell motility and/or invasion in vitro and in vivo . Instead of modulating the expression level of actin- associated proteins, we developed small recombinantantibodies (so-called nanobodies) raised against cell motilityfactors and use these as intrabodies. Obviously theseantibodies do not affect the expression of their target antigenbut inhibit biological functions. Nanobodies (~15 kDa) againstgelsolin and other actin-associated proteins were raised inllamas or alpacas which have the unique property ofexpressing heavy chain antibodies that are devoid of lightchains. The antigen-binding region of these antibodies (VHH)can be cloned, thus raising the possibility of developing smallprotein inhibitors against structural intracellular polypeptides.In addition, nanobodies can be used for tracing their target inliving cells, thereby circumventing protein overexpression.They are also suitable for immunoprecipitation and Westernblotting. We show that selected nanobodies bind their target with nanomolar affinity. Moreover, epitope mapping selective interaction ( of biochemicalactivities of L-plastin, an actin-bundling protein, bynanobodies. Moreover, this was associated with inhibition offilopodia formation in PC-3 cells. Importantly, expression of nanobodies against L-plastin or gelsolin in cancer cells reduced motility and in vitro invasion of these cells to the same extent as siRNA. This approachallows one to study the role of (actin-associated) proteins intumorigenesis at the level of the protein. Nanobodies could befurther developed into bona fide therapeutic molecules. 223 G-QUADRUPLEX STRUCTURES IN ANTICANCERAND ANTIVIRAL THERAPY C. GiancolaDepartment of Chemistry \"P. Corradini\", University of Naples Federico II, Via Cintia 80126, Naples, Italy Guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences can adopt quadruplex structures (G-quadruplexes) stabilized by quartet layers ofHoogsteen paired residues (1). G-quadruplexes are furtherstabilized by monovalent cations as sodium and potassium. G-rich sequences are found at the ends of chromosomes astelomeric protein complexes, and in a number of biologicallysignificant regions of the genome, such as gene promoterregions and sequences associated with human diseases. Thebiomedical relevance of quadruplexes is essentially due to twopotential applications: in anticancer therapy and in the design of novel aptameric nucleic acids. The first application comesfrom the observation that G-quadruplexes formation at the 3'-end of telomeres may inhibit the telomerase enzyme, an eventwhich can induce cancer cells to escape senescence (2, 3). Thesecond application is due to the ability of aptamers based onthe quadruplex motif to specifically bind selected proteins (4).A specific quadruplex has been found to bind and inhibit -thrombin, an important protein with multiple function inhomeostasis, and some quadruplexes have resulted to bepotent antiviral inhibitors against HIV . Many structural andbiophysical methods are devoted to study native quadruplexesand their interactions with both proteins and small molecules(5). The energetic aspects of both quadruplex assembly andquadruplex-ligand interactions are discussed here.

Materials and pancreatic by immunohistochemistry.Stromal and evaluated separately.Moreover, sections stained immunohistochemically with anti-CD34 antibody were evaluated by image analysis for theANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 adenocarcinoma, lower levels of glandularTIMP-2 were found in poorly differentiated tumors, whilehigh glandular TIMP-2 expression was significantly associatedwith better survival. The age of the patients and the degree ofdifferentiation of the tumor were identified as independentprognostic parameters. No relation was found between theexpression of MMPs, TIMP or angiogenesis and theparameters under consideration. expression of glandular MMP-2 was associated withhigher MVD values. Moreover, lymph vessel Oncology Laboratory, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Patras,Patras Medical School, Greece Aim: Sunitinib and Lapatinib are currently used for the treatment of solid tumors. The efficacy of these agents is notwidely tested neither in experimental models nor in clinicaltrials of malignant gliomas and therefore we studied the effectof these agents, applied either alone or combined, on U87glioma cells. Methods: Sunitinib and lapatinib were applied, either separately or in combination, in the U87 cells at dosesof 10 nM, 100 nM and 1 M. To determine whether theseagents affect the proliferation of U87 glioma cell lines, the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 dimethyltetrazolium bromideassay MMP-2levels were measured by zymography. Results: Both agents, administered either alone or combined, decreased cellproliferation in a dose-dependent manner 48h after theirapplication. The inhibition of agent's different than the inhibition of each agent alone.We also found that apoptosis was increased and invasion ofU87 cells was inhibited either by each agent alone or theircombination. Finally, the application of both agents did notresult in alteration of MMP-2 levels. Conclusion: Our results showed that the application of sunitinib and/or lapatinibappears to exhibit effects on proliferation, apoptosis andinvasion of U87 cell line. When applied alone, sunitinib appears to be a more potent inhibitor than lapatinib. 226 DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION OFMETALLOPROTEINASE BETWEEN NORMALMUCOSA OF PATIENTS WITH SPORADICCOLORECTAL CANCER AND OF NORMALSUBJECTS: MAY PLAY A ROLE FOR Coco,Giovanni Gasbarrini and Antonio Gasbarrini Internal Medicine, Department of Surgical Sciences, Catholic University of Rome, Italy The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family of enzymes represents a group of about 20 proteins which have beeninvolved in promoting of human malignancies, includingcolorectal cancer (CRC). We hypothesized that a geneticimpairment of MMP and/or their inhibitors in the normalcolonic mucosa may create a favorable environment forneoplastic transformation. Therefore, we designed a studyaimed at assessing the gene expression profile of MMP andtheir inhibitors in samples of sporadic CRC tissue, normalcolonic mucosa of patients with sporadic CRC and normalmucosa of healthy subjects. Methods: Ten patients with sporadic CRC and 10 healthy sex and age matched subjectswere enrolled. Samples of CRC, normal mucosa of patientswith CRC and normal mucosa of healthy subjects werecollected. Total RNA was extracted from all samples; cRNAwas hybridized with the human U133A array set (22.000genes), which also include 20 MMP genes and their inhibitors.Gene expression profile was compared among groups. Theexpression level of MMP and their inhibitors found to beincreased or decreased in gene chip analyses was furtherstudied by real-time PCR to validate normal mucosa of CRC patients: overall, a differential expression in 7 MMP genes has beenobserved by both microarray analysis and MMP-20 was found in CRC specimens compared to the normal mucosaof the same patients. Concerning TIMPs, only TIMP-1 wasincreased in CRC tissues. Normal mucosa of CRC patients normal mucosa of healthy subjects: overall, 6 MMP geneswere differently expressed between groups by both microarrayanalysis and RT-PCR. In particular, MMP-11, MMP-12,MMP-15 and MMP-20 patients, while MMP-14 and MMP-19 wereAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3293down-regulated in the same samples. Concerning TIMPs, TIMP-3 was decreased in the normal mucosa of CRC patients.Conclusion: Several MMP genes are differentially expressed in CRC tissue, normal mucosa of patients with sporadic CRCcompared to healthy subjects. Interestingly, some of thosegenes, such as MMP-11 and MMP-12, which were up-regulated in the normal mucosa of CRC patients, have alsobeen described to play a role in CRC, while MMP-15 andMMP-20 have been reported to be associated to other kind ofcancers. Furthermore, MMP-19, a protein involved in colonicepithelial cell proliferation, and TIMP-3, which were down-regulated in the normal mucosa of patients with CRC, areknown to decrease during malignant transformation. Based onthese findings, we hypothesize that the pattern of expression ofthose genes seen in the normal mucosa of patients withsporadic CRC may create a favorable environment forneoplastic transformation and progression. 227 ANTIMUTAGENIC AND ANTICANCER EFFECTS OFBLACK Sibabrata Mukhopadhyay and Ashok Giri Molecular and Human Genetics Division, Indian Institute ofChemical Biology, 4, Raja S.C. Mullick Road, Jadavpur,Kolkata- 700 032, India Tea is a highly consumed and popular beverage throughout the world. During fermentation tea catechins are polymerized bypolyphenols oxidase to form theaflavins (TF) TR are the most exclusive polyphenols of blacktea that account for 3-6% and 12-18% of dry weight of blacktea. We have observed significant antimutagenic effects of TFand TR in multiple test systems. A statistically significantinhibition of chromosomal aberration and micronucleiformation was found in vitro in human lymphocyte cultures. Tea polyphenols exert their potent anticancer activity andappear to be the ideal agents for chemoprevention. Eventhough few previous reports show the anticancer effects of TFthrough apoptosis, nevertheless the potential effect of TR hasnot been appraised. This study investigated the induction ofapoptosis in human skin cancer cells after treatment of TR andTF. We report that both TF and TR could exert inhibition ofhuman A431 (epidermoid carcinoma) human epidermal keratinocytes) Growthinhibition of A375 cells occurred through apoptosis, as evidentfrom cell cycle arrest at G 0/G1phase, increase in early apoptotic cells, externalization of phosphatidyl serine andDNA fragmentation. In our pursuit to dissect the molecularmechanism of TF and TR induced apoptosis in A375 cells, weinvestigated whether cancer cell death is being mediated by mitochondria. In our system, Bax translocation tomitochondria persuaded and induced as as PARP (poly(ADP-ribose) on apoptosis, and Bax/Bcl2 and upregulated the expression ofp53 and p21. The TF and TR also inhibited phosphorylationof the cell survival protein Akt. Furthermore, we have foundthat TF and TR can also upregulate A375 cells. These that TF as well as TR might exertchemopreventive effect through cell cycle arrest and inductionof apoptogenic signals via mitochondrial death cascade andstress activated MAPKinase pathways may also be involvedin inducing apoptosis in human skin cancer cells. 228 CHLOROQUIN CONVERTS MOLECULAR of Biomedical Magnetic Resonance, 2Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, 3Electron Microscopy Facility, Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India Autophagic mechanism is known to provide survival advantage and chemoresistance in various types of cancer.Molecular iodine (I 2) has been shown to cause apoptotic cell death independent of estrogen receptor and p53 status in breastcancer cell MDA-MB-453, has beenshown to be independent of caspase activity and is mediatedthrough AIF. Non-evident apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 inresponse to I 2treatment led us to investigate its cell death mechanism in detail. Electron microscopic observations andimmunofluorescence performed in molecular iodine-treatedMDA-MB-231 cells showed an increase in acidic vacuolesand autophagosome formation, and subsequent autolysosomeformation confirmed the stagesof indicating autophagy providessurvival advantage to MDA-MB-231 cells. The evidence ofANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3294autophagy is further supported by enhanced expression of Beclin, reduced Bcl-2, and increased LC-3 cleavage seen onWestern blot. chloroquin inhibits regimen-induced autophagy Toknow whether the chloroquin-mediated increased therapeuticefficacy is drug/system-specific or is a more generalizedphenomenon, we investigated its effect in I 2-treated MDA- MB-231 cells. Co-treatment with accumulation of sub-G1 cellfraction, nuclear fragmentation with enhanced caspase-9activation and reduced pro-caspase-3, indicating thatchloroquin redirects the cells undergoing autophagy under theinfluence of molecular iodine to dominant apoptoticmechanism of cell death. The evidence provided so farindicates that the chloroquin probably increases thetherapeutic efficacy of the drug regimen in a ubiquitousmanner. This switch over ability from autophagy to apoptosisprovided by chloroquin makes it a potential adjuvant toovercome the survival advantage conferred by moleculariodine on MDA-MB-231 cells.Supported by Department of Science and Technology,Government of India, Grant No SR/SO/HS/017/2003. 229 A COMPLEX KARYOTYPE IS AN INDEPENDENTPROGNOSTIC FACTOR FOR CHILDREN WITH MDS- DATA FROM THE EUROPEAN WORKING GROUPOF MDS Charlotte M. Niemeyer12 1Institute of Cell and Molecular Pathology, Medical School Hannover, Germany; 2Center of Tumor Cytogenetics, Charles University, General Faculty Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic; 3Department of Clinical Genetics and Sophia Children's Hospital, Czech Republic; of Pediatrics, University of Pavia, Italy; 12Department for Pediatric of Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital, Freiburg, Germany To study the clinical significance of recurrent chromosome aberrations in childhood MDS, cytogenetic centers and registered in theprospective study EWOG-MDS 98 between 1998 and 2005were evaluated. At diagnosis, a karyotype could be defined in279/394 patients (pts) (71%). No karyotype was obtained in16% of pts with RC RAEB andRAEB-t ( p<0.001). Clonal chromosome MDS (RAEB andRAEB-T, 61%) compared to RC compared to primary MDS (36%)(p<0.001). Monosomy 7 was the most frequent aberration occurring with similar frequency in RC (47% of abnormalkaryotypes) as compared to advanced to or 3q, adult MDS such as isolateddel(5q), del(20q) and -Y were very uncommon, indicating adifferent pathogenesis of these cases. In pts with advancedMDS, there was no significant difference in overall survival(OS) of pts with normal karyotype (44%\u00b118) as compared topts with monosomy 7 (58%\u00b119) and with otherkaryotypes (61%\u00b122). However, pts with advanced MDS anda complex karyotype (defined by 3 chromosome aberrations,presence of structural aberrations and excluding clonalevolution of monosomy 7) had a lower OS (16% \u00b115,p<0.01). OS and event-free survival after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in pts with complex karyotypeswas inferior compared to that of pts with other cytogeneticaberrations ( p=0.012 and 0.039, respectively). Within the group of pts with secondary MDS, complex karyotypes werefound in MDS evolving from inherited bone marrow failuredisorders or after radiochemotherapy, but absent in familialMDS and cases evolving from acquired aplastic anemia. Asshown in a multivariate Cox analysis, advanced MDS,secondary MDS, the presence of a complex karyotype andHSCT were identified as independent prognostic factors forOS. Thus, this study demonstrates the prognostic significanceof cytogenetic findings in advanced childhood MDSindependent of HSCT. Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3295230 THE EFFECT IN VITRO AND IN VIVO OF HUMAN GALECTIN-8 V ARIANTS; A POSSIBLE NEWTHERAPY AND CANCERDISEASES Golan Swansea, Wales; 2Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, Imperial College, London, UK In our recent publication (Eshkar-Sebban et al. , J Immunol 179: 1225-1235, 2007) we described a study shows by affinity chromatography, surface plasmon resonance and flowcytometry, that galectin-8 is a novel ligand of CD44. Wefurther demonstrated that synovial fluid cells from rheumatoidarthritis patients (RA) contain new variants of human galectin-8 proteins and cell surface CD44. Both CD44 and galectin-8proteins, possibly released from the inflammatory cells, weredetected also in the joint fluid of the patients. We furtherrevealed that at least part of galectin-8 and soluble CD44 formcomplexes in the RA synovial fluid that reduce the ability ofthe lectin to induce apoptosis in the inflammatory joint cells. Hence, the RA model not only confirmed the receptor- ligand relationships between CD44 and galectin-8, but alsounveiled the biological significance of this interaction in theregulation of the inflammatory cascade. Knowing that the interaction between galectin-8 and integrins is mediated by the sugar moieties of the adhesionreceptors and that this interaction can subsequently lead toapoptotic signaling, we predicted that galectin-8 can also beligated to CD44. This assumption was based on the fact that,like integrins, CD44 is a glycosylated cell surface receptor thatcan deliver death signals. Challenging this predictionexperimentally, we not only confirmed the receptor- ligandrelationship between CD44 and galectin-8, but also showedthat this interaction reduced the anti-inflammatory activity ofthe lectin. In the present study, we are reporting our recent findings on new pro apoptotic agents, human galectin-8 variants, whichcan provide a novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeuticapproach for joint chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer. 231 EFFECTS OF ISOFLURANE ON NFKB1, GADD45JNK1 EXPRESSIONS IN THE County Teaching Hospital, Miskolc;2University of P\u00e9cs, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Public Health, P\u00e9cs; 3Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of P\u00e9cs, Hungary Background: Isoflurane is one of the most widely used volatile anaesthetics. It is administered to patients during generalanaesthesia with the aim of minimizing the effect of externalstimuli, such as surgical invasions. It was also found to bebeneficial to patients undergoing operation with coronary heartdisease by reducing myocardial stunning and infarct size. Onthe other hand isoflurane has also been reported to havegenotoxic effects in humans, male Sprague-Dawley rats and incell lines exposed to isoflurane. This genotoxic effectmanifested as an increase in DNA single strand breaks byalkaline comet assay. In our present study we evaluated theexpression of GADD45, JNK1 (MAPK8) and NFKB1.GADD45 is a gene that is induced by DNA damage andstrongly linked to the c-jun-N terminal kinase cascade and tothe NFKB pathway, both playing important role in theregulation of apoptosis and cell survival. Materials and Methods: 5-week-old male CBA/CA mice were exposed to 2% isoflurane anaesthesia for 1 hour. Control animals wereexposed to 90% Oxygen. Lungs, liver and kidneys of theanimals were removed 3 and 6 hours after isoflurane exposure.Gene expressions were measured by quantitative real-time PCRon total RNA from the organs. For internal control we usedHPRT. Results: Significant expression alterations of the three genes were seen 3 hours after the isoflurane exposure in thelungs and the kidneys. GADD45 and JNK1 showed paralellcorrelation in changes of expression, while NFKB1 had inverseactivation compared to the other two genes. Conclusion: By inducing DNA damage and activating GADD45, isofluraneexposure evokes the activation of JNK1 and NFKB1 throughwhich can have an effect on the cell death program. 232 ANALYSIS OF THE CONNECTIONS BETWEENSIGNAL TRANSDUCTION MECHANISMS Szigeti \u00fat 12.

Analysis and comparison of thesemolecular snapshots makes possible to identify characteristicsteps of deregulation and dedifferentiation in tumorigenesis.This genomewide screening can reflect a momentary picture ofglobal network of all transcriptional events in tumoursproviding wide insight into the connections of the signallingmechanisms driven in tumour cells. Patients and Methods: cDNA microarray with 20.000 human gene specificoligonucleotide was used thyroid tissue (n=20).Results: We compared microarray patterns of early-stage thyroid tumours looking particularly not for significantlymodulated candidate genes, but a set of genes acting on similarantiapoptotic and signalling pathway, and the ones showingoverlaps between the early-stage epithelial thyroid tumourtypes. We identified significant expression differences of 258genes- underexpression of 233 and overexpression of 25 genesand focused on the overlapping genes between the differenthistological types. Among these genes we found a limited setacting on similar transcriptional pathways: through NF- B and PPAR pathway. Conclusion: The role of overlapping genes inhistologically different tumours has not been clarified, butmight represent early or pivotal steps of carcinogenesis. Allinvestigated histiotypes of tumours contained significantlymodulated genes acting on NF- B regulatory pathway. Our findings suggest that modulation of NF- B signalling plays crucial role in early thyroid carcinogenesis. 233 FEEDING PURIFIED GLYCEROL FROM Health, P\u00e9cs; 2KUKK, K+F Kft., Budapest, Hungary Background: In the European Union the turn towards renewable energy sources has increased the production ofbiodiesel from rapseed oil (rapseed oil methyl ester) leavingglycerol as a valuable by-product. Glycerol is a natural liquidsubstance registered in the European Union as a feed additiveE422. Glycerol could become attractive for ruminants if theamount of the by-product exceeds the capacities of thepharmaceutical and chemical industries to process glycerol. Inthe present situation glycerol purification is costy and it isnecessary to evaluate the final glycerol by-product of different techniques and levels of purification. In our study we aimedto evaluate a promising, neutralized, filtered and distilledglycerol with acceptably high purity and with a methanolcontent lower than 0.1% called SZME2. We investigated theeffect of this glycerol product on the expressions of DNAdamage inducible genes GADD45 and NFKB, in case it wasadded to standard diet of CBA/CA mice, sensitive tocarcinogen exposure. Materials and Methods: 5-week-old CBA/CA mice were administered SZME2 in the standardchaw with a glycerol concentration of 10% of diet drymatter. Animals were given SZME2 fortified diet and tapwater ad libitum for 3, 6 and 24 hours. Control animalsconsumed the standard chaw pellet and tap water. Liver, spleenand bone-marrow of the animals were removed duringautopsy. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out onisolated total RNA. Gene expression alterations of GADD45and NFKB were calculated in HPRT percentage. Results: No significant changes were seen in gene expressions ofGADD45 and NFKB in the liver and spleen at the threetimepoints of administration of SZME2 in the diet. However aconsequent and significant down-regulation of the two geneswas observed in the bone marrow in both gender. Conclusion: Based upon our data we can not declare that methanol contentunder 0.1% of purified glycerol byproducts of biodieselproduction have no effect on the homeostatic regulation atmolecular level. Our investigation underline the necessity ofanimal carcinogenicity bioassay on large laboratory animalpopulation before introducing purified glycerol byproducts onthe market. 234 A PERSONALIZED APPROACH TO DETERMINEPROGNOSTIC AND PREDICTIVE INDICATORS INBREAST CANCER WITH GENE EXPRESSIONPROFILING MICROARRAYS Y . Gong 1, de Enfermedades Neopl\u00e1sicas, Lima, Peru; Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 32978Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico Background: Despite a considerable decline in the mortality from breast cancer following systemic therapy, the biology ofbreast cancer remains poorly understood. This is because thatthe routinely-used clinicopathologic variables fail to fullycapture the may provide more sophisticate information thanconventional biomarkers in predicting disease outcome andresponse to a specific systemic therapy on an individual basis.However, whether ER and HER2 status, two importantbiomakers, can be reliably measured from the comprehensivemicroarray data is unclear. Methods: we used gene expression data of 495 breast carcinomas to assess the correlationbetween ER and HER-2 mRNA levels and clinical status ofthese genes (as determined by immunohistochemical and/orfluorescence in situ hybridization). Data from 195 fine-needle aspiration (FNA) samples was used to define mRNA cutoffvalues and the accuracy of these cutoffs was assessed in twoindependent data sets: 123 FNA 177 tissuespecimens (ie, resected or core-needle biopsied tissues).Profiling was conducted institutions Affymetrix U133A GeneChip). All HER-2 mRNA levels correlated closely with routine receptorstatus measurements in all three data sets. Spearman'scorrelation coefficients ranged from 0.62 to 0.77. The definedER identified ER-positive status and the defined HER-2 mRNA cutoffidentified HER-2-positive with the overall accuracy of89-93%. Conclusion: ER and HER2 gene expression can be reliably measured from the comprehensive microarray data.Integration of ER and HER2 mRNA expression withmultigene signatures from the same microarray data mayrefine and improve their predictive power. These findings mayrepresent an important step towards personalized treatment. 235 XRCC3 GENE POLYMORPHISM IN Department of Molecular Medicine, stanbul; 2Istanbul Bilim University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry, stanbul, Turkey Smoking is known to be one of the most important factors that increases the risk of bladder cancer and it is thought todamage DNA viafree oxygen radicals. In this case, the repair capacity of the DNA is important to protect from cancer.XRCC3 has roles in double-strand breaks repair of DNA, and plays a role in maintaining chromosome stability. We aimedto investigate XRCC3 gene polymorphism that cause Thr241Met change in bladder cancer. There were 55 bladdercancer patients and 39 control cases in our study. Thepolymorphism analysis was performed by PCR-RFLP. It wasfound that there was a significant difference in carrying Tallele of XRCC3 gene between patient and control groups. We found that the T allele has 4.87 times protective capacityagainst bladder cancer risk. Detailed investigations usinglarger study groups, may allow the prognosis of patients to bedetermined. 236 SERUM Department of Molecular Medicine, stanbul; 2stanbul Bilim University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry, stanbul, Turkey Endometrial cancer is one of the most frequent types of cancer of the female genital system. Increasing age, obesity,hypertension and diabetes mellitus are known to be riskfactors in creating this cancer. It is also thought that freeradicals can activate inflamatory responses and with thecontribution of hypoxia, they can cause DNA damage.Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is found in neutrophils andmonocytes and catalyses reactions to produce hypochlorousacid, which is toxic to bacteria and is also a long-livedoxidant that can lead to activation of some procarcinogenscausing damage to DNA. We aimed to investigate the levelsof MPO activity in endometrial cancer patients while alsodetermining whether the MPO gene polymorphism can increase the tendency to create endometrial cancer or not.There were 39 endometrial cancer patients and 39 controlcases. Serum MPO levels were measured by enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) and MPO gene -463G/A polymorphisms were determined by PCR-RFLP. MPO levelswere not significantly different between control and patientgroups. A allele carriers were significantly more frequent inthe patient group than in the control group ( p=0.037) but no difference existed in G allele carriers. MPO levels werehigher in the AA genotype patient group than othergenotypes, but there was no such significance in the controlgroup. Serum MPO levels were higher in the homozygote AAgenotype group. As MPO is an enzyme that causesproduction of hypochlorous acid, our results show that thisactivity increment in the AA genotype might contribute to theincreased for endometrial cancer.ANTICANCER 3157-3556 (2008) 3298237 STEM CELLS DERIVED FROMNON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER AND NORMALLUNG TISSUE DIFFER IN THEIR GENETICSTABILITY, GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES, ANDFUNCTIONAL Meister1 for Heidelberg, Amalienstr. 5, 69126 Heidelberg; 2Insitute for Human 366, 69120 Heidelberg; 3Division of Molecular Genome Research Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, Heidelberg; 4Department Medicine V , University 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany Background: The stromal microenvironment plays a vital role in induction and maintencance of solid tumors (1). Variousstudies in prostate, breast, and ovarian cancer showed geneticand functional alterations in the peritumoral stroma. However,corresponding data in lung cancer are lacking (2). Here weprovide a systematic and comparative analysis of genetic andfunctional properties of autologous non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) and normal lung tissue (NLT) withspecial respect to mesenchymal stem Stromal cells derived from NSCLC specimens andmicroscopically normal lung tissue of newly diagnosed lungcancer patients were isolated and propagated in culture. Cellswere analyzed for their mesenchymal character by flowcytometry and their osteogenic and adipogenic differentiationpotential. Genetic analyses were performed by multicolorFISH. Gene expression was analyzed by Affymetrix HG U133Plus 2.0-based The most growth cisplatin was stain, and colony formingassays. Results: Compared to NLT, cell preparations derived from NSCLC specimens were four-fold enriched in fibroblastcolony-forming units (CFU- f). In pure NSCLC-MSC cultures, about twice as many CFU- f(5.5\u00b11.2% vs. 2.8\u00b10.8%) were present than in NLT-MSC cultures. CFU- fin NLT-MSC cultures declined significantly from passage 8 on whereasCFU- fyield in NSCLC-MSC cultures remained stable over several passages. This was in line with faster growth kineticsand an up to 27-fold vs. 12-fold expansion of NSCLC-MSC after 10 passages. NSCLC-MSC displayed a significantlyreduced cisplatin sensitivity, with a delayed onset of apoptosisand a higher survival of CFU- f. M-FISH analyses of 5 pairedMSC preparations at passage 5 demonstrated polyploidy and unbalanced translocations in NSCLC-MSC whereas NLT-MSC showed either no genetic alterations or at best balancedtranslocations, indicating a higher genetic stability. In line withthe functional differences, NSCLC-MSC showed a higherexpression of genes such ENDOD1 ANGPT- 1(angiogenesis), MTP18 (antiapoptotic), and CD109 (primitive enriched in genetically unstable primitivemesenchymal cells with increased proliferative capacity andreduced chemosensitivity to cisplatin. These cells mightmodulate and process and affect theresponse to chemotherapy.1 Karnoub AE, Dash AB, V o AP et al : Mesenchymal stem cells within tumour stroma promote breast cancermetastasis.

Morphologically, LCIS and ILC are characterized bya proliferation of uniform, loosely cohesive cells with mildnuclear atypia. Cytogenetic studies have shown that LCIS andILC have relatively low numbers of changes compared withductal breast cancer. Moreover, the molecular genetic profilesof LCIS and ILC are similar, suggesting the common clonalityof the lesions and the precursor role of LCIS. The main features of lobular malignancies are gain of 1q, loss of 16q or down-regulation of E-cadherin. Lossor down-regulation of E-cadherin occurs by a combination ofloss of heterozygosity, gene mutation or promoter silencingAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3299leading to inactivation of the gene and it is manifested in routine histology practice by immunonegativity for E-cadherin. The E-cadherin negativity has been used as adiagnostic feature of lobular carcinomas. Since some ductalcarcinomas may also be E-cadherin negative, either totally orpartially, E-cadherin immunonegativity must be interpretedwith caution, taking into account the overall morphologicalcontext. Loss of E-cadherin function is thought to contribute tothe histological appearance of lobular breast cancer, i.e. lack ofcohesive architecture with single cells invading through thestroma, ability of metastatic spread to serosal cavities. Otherdistinctive but unique HER2/neu and cyclin D1 negativity amplification of the above genes as well asER and PR positivity. Recently, a pleomorphic variant of lobular carcinoma (PLC) has been described. In pleomorphic LCIS and ILC, neoplasticcells display several of the histological molecular featuresassociated with classic lobular carcinomas but exhibit moreconspicuous nuclear atypia pleomorphism and in addition,they frequently show apocrine differentiation. Althoughmolecular data are limited, it is apparent up to now that PLChave overlapping genetic characteristics with those of classiclobular carcinomas (1q+/16q-/11q-, E-cadherin negative, E-cadherin mutation) stabilization, overexpression, (HER2/TOPO2A) Therefore, PLC seem to evolve along a similarmolecular pathway to the classic lobular carcinoma, butmoreover, have a high grade phenotype through molecularchanges associated with high grade ductal carcinoma.Molecular alterations found in PLC, that are typical of highgrade tumors, are likely to drive the more aggressive biologyof PLC. 239 TARGETING THE EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATIONINITIATION FACTOR 4E (EIF4E) FOR CANCERTHERAPY Jeremy R. GraffEli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, 46285, USA Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4E (eIF4E) plays a pivotal role in cellular mRNA translation, binding the capstructure at the 5' end of cellular mRNAs and delivering thesemRNAs to the eIF4F translation initiation complex. Asubstantial body of evidence has accumulated in the past 18years implicating enhanced eIF4E activity in cellulartransformation, tumorigenesis and metastatic progression. Inhuman cancers, eIF4E expression is commonly elevated withdisease progression in many tumor types includinglymphomas as well as cancers of the head and neck, breast, colon, bladder and lung. We now show that eIF4E activation isuniversally and significantly increased in human andexperimental prostate cancers. In human cancers, elevatedeIF4E activation is significantly associated with reducedpatient survival. In experimental models, eIF4E overexpression can drive cellular transformation, tumorigenesis, invasiveness andmetastases by selectively and disproportionately enhancing thetranslation of select mRNAs that code for the critical proteinsthat promote and sustain the phenotypes growth and survival viaactivation of both the ras and AKT signaling pathways. Reduction of eIF4Eexpression in highly metastatic, ras-transformed experimentalcancer models effectively blocks tumor growth andinvasiveness as well as spontaneous and experimentalmetastasis, suppressing the expression of MMP-9, CD44v6and ODC and restoring expression of the metastasissuppressor nm-23. These data clearly implicate eIF4E as anattractive anticancer therapeutic target. Exploiting advances in antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) chemistry, we have developed eIF4E-specific ASOs with thetissue stability and nuclease resistance necessary for systemic,anticancer therapy. These ASOs specifically target the eIF4EmRNA for RNAse-H mediated destruction, repressingexpression Bcl-2. humancancer cell lines, the 4EASO robustly induces apoptosisindependent of cell cycle phase and, in endothelial cells,directly blocks the formation of vessel-like structures. Mostimportantly, intravenous administration selectively andsignificantly reduces eIF4E expression in human tumorxenografts, significantly suppressing tumor growth. As incultured cells, systemic 4EASO administration significantlyinduced apoptosis in xenograft vs. control) reduced the number of Ki-67 + cells within thexenograft tumors as well. Because these ASOs also targetmurine eIF4E, we assessed the impact of eIF4E reduction innormal tissues. Despite reducing eIF4E levels by 80% inmouse liver, eIF4E-ASO administration did not affect bodyweight, organ weight or liver transaminase levels.Collectively, these data therefore provide the first direct, in vivo evidence that tumor tissues would be more sensitive to the effects of eIF4E inhibition than normal tissues, adifferential effect consistent with the conceptualunderstanding that eIF4E activity is elevated in, and requiredby, tumor tissue to sustain the expression of key growth andsurvival factors that contribute to malignancy. These data havenow prompted eIF4E-ASO clinical trials for the treatment ofhuman cancers. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3300240 TEMOZOLOMIDE in patients with glioblastomamultiforme (GBM). The objective of the study was todetermine if the combined strategy of temozolomide andthalidomide with radiotherapy is associated with animproved median survival. The efficacy and tolerability oftemozolomide alone and in combination with thalidomidewere explored in a single-institution 13 years experience.Methods: From April 1993 to May 2006, one hundred and seventy patients with GBM underwent microsurgical tumorextirpation and radioterapy: 82 (48.2%) patients received noadditional treatment (C), in 42 (24.7%) patientstemozolomide was given alone (T) and 46 (27.1%) patientshad a combined chemotherapy of temozolomide andthalidomide (TT). Radiotherapy were a dose in 2.5-3 Gy fractions over 3-4 weeks,followed by a boost dose of 20 Gy delivered in 4-5 Gyfractions in 1 week. Temozolamide was administered startingat the end of radiotherapy with a dose of 200 mg/m 2daily for 5 days, every 4 weeks. Thalidomide was started at theend of radiotherapy with a dose of 20 mg and escalated by20 mg every week depending on patient tolerance, to amaximum of 100 mg daily. Results: Median survival, starting from the first radiotherapy, was 54 weeks (95% CI, 50-58weeks) in C-patients, 83 weeks (95% CI, 36-130 weeks) inT-patients and 86 weeks (95% CI, 65-106 weeks) in TT-patients. Compared to the C-patients, the median survival ofthose who received temozolomide alone or in combinationwith thalidomide was 86 weeks (95% CI, 70-102 weeks),with a significant improvement in survival outcome (log-rank=6.613, p=0.010) (Figure). Temozolamide and thalidomide were well tolerated and only mild to moderatetoxicities were observed. Conclusion: The strategy of combining temozolomide, thalidomide and radiotherapy inthe treatment of GBM appears to be well tolerated and withfavourable survival outcome. The addition of thalidomide inassociation with temozolamide does not offer a significantadvantage over temozolamide alone.Figure.

The basic approach to treatmentinvolves a combination of surgery, radiotherapy andchemotherapy. Among chemotherapeutic and astrocytomas. Recently, TMZ wasdemonstrated to be well tolerated and active as a single agentor in combination with radiotherapy. The median survivaltime for high grade gliomas is 10-12 months and theprognosis is dismal. New therapeutic approaches are justified.Several studies in vitro on glioblastomas have demonstrated that hyperthermia plus chemotherapy has a highercytotoxicity than chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, heat hasa cytotoxic effect by itself and an anti-vascular effect. This Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3301last effect is of outmost importance due to the high neoangiogenesis present in these tumors. Patients and Methods: Between January 2001 and April 2008, 29 patients with aggressive brain tumors [11 glioblastomas (GBM), 14astrocytomas with hyperthermia 14 astrocytoma) (9F, 16M; median age44.6\u00b19.85) been treated with the CFRT + TMZ + HTand were eligible to be compared with a group of 27 patientswith 18 GBM and 9 astrocytomas (12F, 15 M median age50.93\u00b113.9y) treated with CFRT and TMZ alone. All thepatients of the two groups have been resected and later treatedwith CRT + developed \u00ae, Vigevano, Italy. It the following components: 1) a RF generator (13.56 MHz) 2) a pair ofmobile plates or electrodes with independent superficialcooling system, 3) a heat exchanger, 4) a computerizedcontrol console. A thermal profiles to obtain a probabledeposition of the energy were obtained by heating patternsproduced in a static phantom under various conditions. The25 patients were treated combining chemotherapy,radiotherapy and hyperthermia with the following sequence.HT was applied 2 h after CRT administration, and the patientsused orally 120 mg of CCNU two hs prior HT or a mediandose of 200 mg of temozolomide (TMZ). BCNU or TMZ wasadministered once per HT cycle, generally at the firstapplication. A complete cycle of HT consisted of fiveapplications, applied every 48 hs. Four mg of e.v.dexamethasone was started 1/2h before HT administered inthe hypertonic solution of glucose that lasted forall the treatment period (60'). Results: The group of patients treated with CFRT+TMZ+HT showed a significant increasein life survival ( p<0.001) (Figure 1) and patients in follow- up of HT group were also over the median life survival versus 17.89\u00b110.56 months of patients treated only with CRT +TMZ ( p<0.01). 60% of the patients treated with CFRT+TMZ+HT were alive at 20 months. 36% of them hada life survival of more than 27 months. Comparing the entiregroup treated with HT versus CRT+TMZ the survival curve is even better (Figure 2). Conclusion: The life prolongation is clinically significant and these results suggest that effectiveHT may soon become a standard therapy associated tochemotherapy and radiotherapy for glioblastomas andastrocytomas. Notwithstanding these positive results we thinknecessary to increase the number of patients treated withhyperthermia, to produce a randomized study and to verifythe possible side-effects of hyperthermia. Furthermore, wethink useful to use a predictive method to verify the heatdeposition since normally heat is not easily detected insidethe brain like in other structures. Figure 1. Comparison of survival curves between patients treated with conformal radiotherapy plus CCNU/ TMZ Figure of survival curves between patients treated with Conformal radiotherapy plus CCNU/ TMZ (CRT+CCNU/TMZ) and acting as molecularswitch between DG- and PA-mediated signalling. Wepreviously showed that activation of Dgk is required forgrowth factor-induced cell migration and proliferation througha mechanism involving formation of a complex with Src and(Cutrupi et al. , EMBO J 2000; al. Blood 2005; Baldanzi et al. , Oncogene 2008). Moreover we showed that in epithelial cells, Dgk isrequired for HGF-induced membrane ruffling, and regulatesmembrane targeting and activation of Rac (Chianale et al. Mol Biol Cell, 2007). These data suggest that DGK may play a role in the acquisition of an invasive phenotype. In order to set up anexperimental system to investigate the role of DGK intumor progression in vitro and in vivo , we MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells results in the 60-70%reduction of serum-sustained cell proliferation, as well asinhibition of EGF-induced DNA synthesis. Expression ofmurine DGK, resistant to human shRNA, rescues cellproliferation of MDA-MB-231, demonstrating that theproliferative defect is specifically dependent on DGKaexpression. In addition, shRNA-mediated knock-down of DGK strongly impairs HGF- and SDF-1- induced cell invasion ina 3D matrix and secretion of matrix gelatinases. Thespecificity of this effect is confirmed by the full rescue ofinvasive response to HGF and SDF-1 upon expression ofshRNA-resistant murine DGK. Furthermore, the signallingpathways by which DGKa regulates cancer cell invasivebehaviour have been also investigated. These data strongly suggest that DGK plays a previously unrecognized pivotal role in tumor progression of breastcarcinomas in vitro . 243 ANTIPROLIFERATIVE EFFECT OF D-GLUCURONYL C5-EPIMERASE HUMANBREAST CANCER Russia; 2Karolinska Institute, MTC, Stockholm, Sweden; 3Institute of Molecular Biology, Moscow, Russia; 4Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Kiev, Ukraine; 5Institute of Regional Pathology and Pathomorphology SD RAMS, Novosibirsk, RussiaIntroduction: D-glucuronyl C5-epimerase (GLCE) is biosynthesis of heparan sulfates - thepolysaccharide part of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG)located on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix.HSPGs play important roles in cell adhesion, differentiation,and growth and alterations in their structure/composition mayhave important consequences on tumour invasion andmetastasis. Thus, GLCE could be involved in any processeswhere appropriate heparan sulfate structure is important.Materials and Methods: D-glucuronyl C5-epimeraseexpression in different human normal tissues and breasttumours was estimated by multiplex and qreal-time RT-PCR.For a functional study, GLCE was cloned into the vectors pETE/Bsd and pCEP4 for expression in mammalian cells. Theeffect of the restoration of GLCE expression on cell proliferation in vitro was investigated for breast cancer cell line MCF7 using CyQUANT NF Proliferation Assay. Results: It was shown that GLCE gene was expressed mainly in human breast and lung tissues, with less expression in thyroid, thymusand kidney. The significant down-regulation of epimeraseexpression was detected in human breast tumours. Arestoration of D-glucuronyl C5-epimerase expression in thebreast cancer cells suppressed their proliferation in vitro . Conclusion: The obtained results represent the first data about the possible antimitotic activity of D-glycuronyl C5-epimerase in breast cancer cells. A decrease of the epimerase expressionin different types of cancer and its ability to suppress theproliferation of tumour cells reveal D-glycuronyl C5-epimerase as a potential new marker and target for cancerdiagnosis and treatment.This work has been supported by a Russian Foundation forBasic Research (08-04-00866a); Karolinska Institute; UICCInternational Cancer Technology Transfer Fellowship FEBS Fellowship (TE). 244 PROSPECTIVE COHORT COMPARISON OFFLA VONOID TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH RESECTED COLORECTALCANCER TO PREVENT RECURRENCE Harald Hoensch Faculty, Technical University Dresden, Fiedlerstr. 27, Dresden D-01307; 3German Cancer Research Center, Division of Biostatistics, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, Heidelberg D-69120, Germany Aim: To investigate biological cancer prevention with flavonoids. The recurrence risk of neoplasia was studied inAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3303patients cancer and after adenoma polypectomy. Methods: Eighty-seven patients, 36 patients with resected colon cancer and 51 patients after polypectomy, weredivided into 2 groups. One group was treated with a flavonoidmixture (daily standard dose 20 mg apigenin and 20 mgepigallocatechin-gallate, n=31) and compared with a matchedcontrol group (n=56) without flavonoid intervention. Bothgroups were observed for 3-4 years by surveillancecolonoscopy and by questionnaires. Results: Of 87 patients enrolled in this study, 36 had resected colon cancer and 29 ofthese patients had surveillance colonoscopy. Among theflavonoid-treated patients with resected colon cancer (n=14),there was no cancer recurrence and only one tubular adenomadeveloped. In contrast, the cancer recurrence rate of the 15matched untreated controls was 20% (3 out of 15), andadenomas (including 2 advanced adenomas) evolved in 4 ofthose patients (27%). The combined recurrence rate forneoplasia was 7% (1 out of 14) in the treated patients and 47%(7 out of 15) in the controls ( p=0.027). Among the 51 polypectomized adenoma patients, 17 had surveillancecolonoscopies (8 treated and 9 controls) and their adenomarecurrence rate was 50% in the treated and 30% in the controlgroup. However, 2 incident adenomas with advanced histologywere found in the untreated patients. Conclusion: Sustained long-term treatment with a flavonoid-mixture could reduce therecurrence rate of colon neoplasia in patients with resectedcolon cancer. 245 SERUM LEPTIN LEVELS IN COLORECTALCANCER PATIENTS F. 1, Pisana, Rome; 2Medical University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy Background: Recent studies have indicated that some adipokines may significantly influence the growth andproliferation of tumor stroma and malignant cells within.Leptin, a product of the ob gene involved in the control of foodintake and energy expenditure, may act as a potent mitogen andanti-apoptotic cytokine in colon cancer. Epidemiologicalstudies have suggested that leptin is correlated with the risk ofcolorectal cancer (CRC) associated with obesity, theassociation being independent of body mass index (BMI), waistcircumference and physical activity. Hence, increased leptinplasma levels were found in CRC patients. It is well knownthat tumor cells and/or tumor-associated leukocytes mayproduce inflammatory cytokines, in particular TNF-alpha.Circulating levels of this cytokine have been associated with the disease status of CRC patients. Recently, it has beendemonstrated that TNF-alpha administration induced a promptand dose-dependent increase in serum leptin levels. Thus, aimof this study was to evaluate the possible associations betweenleptin, TNF-alpha and clinicopathological variables of CRCpatients at time of diagnosis of primary tumor. Moreover, afollow-up study was performed to analyze the possibleprognostic value of pre-surgical leptin levels TNF-alpha (R&D Systems) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, AbbottLabs.) levels were analyzed in 90 patients with histologicallydiagnosed primary (Stages A: 7, B: 34, C: 19 and D: 13, witha resectable liver metastasis) or metastatic (liver: 8,peritoneum: multiple: 3) CRC treated at \"TorVergata\" Clinical Centre and followed for a median period of 3years. As control group, in a 3:1 ratio, 30 control subjects (13males, 17 females; mean age 59\u00b112, ranging from 37 to 80years) were also evaluated. The study was performed under theappropriate ethics approvals, and informed consent wasobtained from each patient. Results: Serum leptin levels levels were than than those of primary CRC patients (7.7 Of interest, 47% of non metastatic CRC had leptin levels above the compared metastaticpatients ( p=0.07). Median follow-up of metastatic CRC patients was shorter (12.6 months) in patients with high leptinlevels compared to those with normal levels (21.7 months,p=0.07). Cox proportional hazard regression model including age, sex, leptin, TNF and CEA levels showed that leptin wasan independent predictor for overall survival in metastatic CRC(Cox-Mantel 2.03, p=0.042). Conclusion: These results suggest that serum leptin levels might have a role in thebiology of CRC and may be regarded as a useful prognosticindicator in patients with metastatic disease.Partially supported by Grant \"Alleanza contro il Cancro\" bythe Italian Ministry of Health 246 PRL-3 EXPRESSION AND TUMOR BUDDING INCOLORECTAL CANCER Katarzyna Poland Background: Colorectal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in Western countries including Poland. TheANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3304mortality from colorectal cancer is ranked as the second in Western countries, and third in Poland, amongst all types ofcancer. Recent studies concerning the prognostic factors incolorectal cancer have paid attention to tumor budding as apotential prognostic factor. Morodomi et al. defined tumor budding as either bundles of five or more cancer cellsoccurring in a well-differentiated region (mainly the activelyinvasive area), showing tubular structures, which wereclassified as microtubular cancer nests, or isolated cancer cellswithout a distinct structure, which were classified asundifferentiated cells (1). Several published studies haveindicated that tumor budding is associated with metastasis incolorectal cancers (2-4). PRL-3 is a newly discovered proteintyrosine phosphatase which would also degrade theextracellular matrix and was expressed in liver metastasesderived from colorectal cancer. In this study, we investigatedthe relationship between tumor budding at the invasion front ofcolorectal cancer and expression of PRL-3 in the main mass oftumor, buds, lymph nodes and liver metastases. Patients and Methods: The samples were obtained from 49 selected patients with colorectal cancer, 20 adjacent normal epithelial(at least 5 cm distant from the tumor edge), 24 lymph nodemetastases, and 10 liver metastases were obtained from theDepartment of Medical University ofBialystok. Monoclonal antibody, Clone PRL-3(Attogen Biomedical Research, USA) was used forimmunohistochemistry. Results: Statistical analysis showed a correlation between tumor budding and lymph nodemetastasis. PRL-3 protein expression was observed in 1 out of20 (5%) normal colorectal epithelia, 9 out of 49 (18.3%)primary colorectal cancer, 22 out of 24 (91.6%) lymph nodemetastasis and 9 out of 10 (90%) liver metastases, respectively.Conclusion: These results suggest that high PRL-3 expression may participate in the progression and metastasis of colorectalcancer.1 Morodomi T, Isomoto H, Shirouzu K et al : An index for estimating the probability of lymph node matastasis in rectalcancers.

TOXICITY Solveig HanssenDepartment of Oncology, Section of Radiotherapy, University Hospital of North Norway, Troms\u00f8, Norway The aim of this study was to examine the toxicity of two external radiotherapy regimens employed in early-stageprostate cancer at the University Hospital of North Norway(UNN). During the last decade, the incidence of prostatecancer in Norway has been rising steadily, and a trend fromsurgery to radiotherapy in early-stage disease has beenobserved. In 1997, a new technique was developed in Swedenaiming to reduce the side-effects of radiotherapy. Thistechnique utilises a special catheter, BeamCath \u00ae, to achieve a more accurate determination of the position of the prostate,and allow an increase in dosage. All ninety men who hadundergone radiotherapy for early-stage prostate cancer at theDepartment of Oncology, UNN, in the time period February2002 to March 2005, were included in a retrospectivequestionnaire based study. Eighty patients responded, andwere divided into two treatment regimens. The \"treatmentgroup\" (23 patients) had received 76 Gy with BeamCath \u00ae regimen and the \"control group\" (57 patients) had received 70Gy employing a conformal technique. The patients wereinterviewed by telephone and six selected questions fromvalidated questionnaires were used to clarify bladder, intestinaland sexual function. The BeamCath \u00aetechnique was found to be associated with a lower median rectal ( p=0.004, 50.6 Gy versus 56.2 Gy) p=0.017, 48.5 Gy versus 61.5 Gy). There were no difference in scores on masculinityand sexuality function. In conclusion, this retrospective studyindicates that dose escalation up to 76 Gy employing theBeamCath \u00aecatheter technique does not influence either rectal or bladder toxicity, compared with conformal technique of 70Gy. 248 SPECIFIC NUTRIENT SYNERGY IN THETREATMENT OF LEUKEMIA S. 1,2, Baydoun1, A. Niedzwiecki2and American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon; 2Dr. Rath Research Institute, Santa Clara, CA, USA The effects of a specific nutrient synergy (SNS), consisting of a combination of antioxidants, vitamins and amino-acids(three of its major components being ascorbic acid (AA),epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and L-lysine) wereinvestigated on proliferation and induction of apoptosisAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3305using non-cytotoxic concentrations against HTLV-I-positive and -negative malignant T-cells. In addition, the effects ofSNS, AA, EGCG and L-lysine were evaluated on -9, as wellas on the NF- B pathway and Tax production in HTLV-I- positive cell lines. The results indicated that the SNS had amore potent anti-proliferative effect than its individualingredients down-regulating MMP-2 and -9 activity, production andexpression as was shown by zymography, Western blottingand RT-PCR. Moreover, the SNS inhibited the translocationof the p65/p50 subunits to the nucleus in a dose-dependentmanner as well as Tax production in HTLV-I-positivemalignant T-cell lines. In conclusion, the results indicate that the SNS could constitute a potential anti-invasive treatment in adult T-cellleukemia and related diseases. Based on the effectiveness ofthe SNS in targeting common critical mechanisms involved incancer and its minimal cell toxicity, as compared topharmaceutical drugs, clinical investigations are highlyrecommended. 249 THE ANTIOXIDANT AND OF ORIGANUM Fares1, E. Baydoun2 of Biology, University of Balamand, Al-Koura; 2Department of Biology, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon; 3Dr. Rath Research Institute, Santa Clara, CA 95050, USA Plant extracts from Origanum majorana and Olea europea were evaluated for their antiproliferative using human T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines(CEM and Jurkat). Cytotoxicity of various concentrations ofplant extracts were examined using non-radioactivecytotoxicity assay and the IC 50 was calculated. Olive leaves were found to be more cytotoxic than majoram since they havelower IC 50. At noncytotoxic concentrations, the viability of cells decreased with the increase in concentration of plantextract as determined by the WST-1 proliferation kit. Theantiproliferative effect was further analyzed using the [ 3H]- thymidine incorporation method and was dose dependent. Toinvestigate whether cell death was due to apoptosis, cells werestained with annexin V-FITC and PI. Flow majoram and olive leaves extracts induced apoptosis. Theantioxidant activity of plant extracts was studied using the DPPH scavenging method. Majoram (IC 50=0.03 mg dry weight) exhibited a stronger scavenging activity than oliveleaves (IC 50=0.1 mg dry weight). The conclusions from this study suggest that majoram and olive leave extracts exhibit antiproliferative effect onmalignant T-cells and have a high antioxidant activity. For thatthey merit further investigation as a potential therapeuticagent. 250 ANGIOGENESIS VERSUS LYMPHANGIOGENESIS IN LUNG CANCER; A CRASH TEST DEFINING THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA Georgia Hardavella School, of Pneumonology, University of School, of Anatomy, and Embryology, University of Ioannina, Medical School, Ioannina; 4Respiratory Medicine Department, Medical School, Athens University, Athens, Greece Introduction: Tumor angiogenesis is a highly regulated process influenced by the host microenvironment andmediators. VEGF and its receptors (VEGF-R1-Flt-1, VEGF-R2-KDR/Flk-1) are good markers of vascular proliferationbut their expression and relevance to tumor spread and theircorrelation with lymphangiogenesis and patient outcome inlung carcinomas is yet to be defined. Aim: To investigate the expression of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in lungcarcinomas (non small cell-NSCLC and small cell-SCLC),to study their interrelationship and prognostic influence andto compare it with other carcinomas studied in the literature.Materials and Methods: One hundred and forty six patients with lung carcinoma (96 NSCLC and 50 SCLC) wererectospectively reviewed. Tumor inpatient medical records followed.Results: VEGF and CD105 expression were significantly associated with the basic histological type of lung neoplasms(df=2, p=0.002 and p=0.04 for NSCLC the stage ( p=0.026, p=0.005) and the latter was also ( p=0.021).ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3306Significant association was found between CD105 and the stage of disease (NSCLC x2=19,5, p=0.003 and SCLC x2=8,4, p=0.004). CD105 expression was the in both NSCLC ( p=0.003) and SCLCs ( p=0.05). In contrast, no significant correlation was assessed between VEGF and the clinical parametersmentioned above in both SCLC and NSCLC. Conclusion: There is a direct association andlymphangiogenesis NSCLC. SCLCs present acomparatively lower increasedlymphangiogenesis, thus displaying a different behavioralpattern. CD105 expression is strongly associated with theclinical parameters studied and could be capable ofconstituting a significant prognostic role in the overall aspectof lung cancer prognosis. 251 TUMOR M2 PYRUV ATE KINASE: CLINICALAPPLICATIONS IN GASTRIC CANCER P.D. HardtThird Medical Department, Giessen and Marburg University Hospital, Giessen, In tumor cells, a dimeric isoenzyme of termed Tumor specific antibodies, histological studiesshowed that this particular isoenzyme can be detected in hugeamounts in almost every malignant tissue. Several years ago,an ELISA was developed to measure Tumor M2PK levels inEDTA plasma. Later the ELISA was slightly modified to beused in stool samples. While a lot of attention has been paid to the possible role of fecal Tumor M2PK measurements in the screening forcolorectal cancer recently, only a very few studies dealt withother cancer entities of the gastrointestinal tract. In gastriccancer, which is one of the most frequent cancer diseases inthe world, no reliable tumor markers have been established asyet. If any, CEA, Ca19-9 and Ca 72-4 have been discussed;however, the reported sensitivities were only about 40%. Incontrast to this, Tumor M2PK measurements reported asensitivity of about 60% at 95% specificity. Thus,determination of this marker in EDTA does provide aninstrument to be used in the follow-up and therapy control ofgastric cancer cases which is superior to the markerspreviously used. Furthermore, gastric cancer patients do alsoshow elevated levels of Tumor M2PK in the feces. This is truefor the \"classical\" assay that has been developed for screeningpurposes in colorectal cancer but also for another essay usinga different marker combination that appears to be morespecific for gastric cancer. In populations with a highprevalence of gastric cancer, fecal Tumor M2PK testing mightbe a means for screening. 252 THE PROLIFERATIVE CELL NUCLEAR of and Experimental Cancer Research, 21st Department of Surgery, 3Second Institute of Pathology, Semmelweis University, Faculty of Medicine,Budapest, Hungary Introduction: The role of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to colorectal tumorigenesis has not yet been settled;in fact, while some authors reported a relevant role for PCNAtumor expression as a direct indicator of poor survival, othershave not confirmed this association. Aim: Examination of the shift through the adenoma-carcinoma progression sequence ofhuman colon and rectum in context with the expressiondifference of proliferating cell nuclear antigen betweenadenoma-carcinoma and the adjacent normal mucosa (PCNA-ED). Materials and Methods: patients with carcinoma underwentendoscopic polypectomy or epithelialpolyps, 82 neoplastic adenomatous polyps showing differentdegrees of dysplasia, in situ carcinomas, 6 malignant polyps, 66 colorectal adenocarcinomas and their adjacentmucosa specimens. The PCNA protein levels were determinedby immunoblot analysis quantified by densitometry. Logisticregression was used to examine the predictive role of PCNAon adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Results: The PCNA expression was detectable in the visibly normal mucosa of 69%of patients with polyps. This alone is a proliferative zone, butdoes not mean bad prognosis. Moving further in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence the PCNA-ED was more frequent. Thiskind of difference was never found hyperplastic andhamartomatous polyps or inflammatory pseudopolyps. Lowdifference was found in 2% of tubular and in 6% of tubulo-villous adenomas, and further 6% of the latter had highdifference. In case of villous adenomas the degree of dysplasiawell correlated with the frequency of difference. In milddysplasia the expression difference was found in 3% of thecases, in moderate it was in 21% and in severe dysplasia thedifference was found in 55% of the cases. The adenoma sizeand the increase of PCNA-ED among the patients were linearlycorrelated (R 2=0.96 for tubular and tubulovillous and 0.99 for villous adenomas by linear regression). The increasing severityof the dysplasia, the increasing size of the polyp and the morefrequent detection of PCNA-ED among the patients werestrongly correlated values. The distribution of PCNA-ED alongwith the recurrence was highly statistically significantAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3307(p<<0.005). In all patients with high PCNA-ED recurrence was developed within the first year. In development of the one- tothree-year recurrence the low PCNA-ED played the dominantrole, while in development of the one-year recurrence the highPCNA-ED was more dominant. PCNA-ED has been found in57% of in situ carcinomas grown on base of a polyp, and in 69% of the malignant polyps. In adenocarcinomas, the Dukesclassification paralleled well with PCNA-ED, in contrast withthe only in tumor measured PCNA expression. Conclusion: These results indicate that PCNA expression differencebetween normal and altered tissue progressively increasedalong the sequence from normal mucosa via low grade, middlegrade, and high grade dysplasia, adenoma to advanced cancer.The PCNA-ED is one parameter that contributes to thedefinition of the degenerative risk and allows selection ofpatients with high expression difference for constantmonitoring. 253 PUTATIVE FORANTIMIGRATORY First Institute of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Faculty of Medicine,Budapest, Hungary Background: Metastasis - the spread of tumor cells from the primary site to distant organs - represents a majorpathobiological event in tumor progression, and decides theoutcome of the malignant disease. Although paramountprogress has currently been witnessed in the control of theprimary tumors, it is a great challenge to develop drugs,showing specific action against tumor progression.Metastasis is a multistep process involving shedding oftumor cells from the primary site, migration and attachmentin a novel microenvironment, where they could settle downand form a viable growing cell population. Antimetastaticagents not necessarily act on cell proliferation; rather one ofthe above mentioned pathobiological events must beaffected. Purpose: For the identification of chemical compounds with predominant action on migration relativeto proliferation, we decided to recognize certain moleculesas promising targets, specific to metastatic process. To thisend appropriate in vitro biological assay has been elaborated. Materials and Methods: As our previous studies provided further evidence for the contribution of matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs), proteoglycans and integrins inthe invasive growth, compounds inhibiting these moleculeswere selected as promising antimetastatic agents. Toinvestigate tumor cell migration, three dimensional cultureof human osteosarcoma cells (OSCORT) and human fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080) cellsgrown in monolayer were overlaid with matrigel. Afterseparating the cells in the monolayer from thecells migrating into the matrigel, the invasive behavior ofthe tumor cell population could be assessed. In addition,tumor cell migration in certain cases was measured inBoyden chamber. Results: Invasive growth of osteosarcoma cells was stimulated in the presence of heparan sulfateproteoglycan both in three-dimensional culture and Boydenchamber. Hexyldeoxyuridine a potent inhibitor of heparansulfate proteoglycan reduced the invasive growth of tumorcells. MMP-9 showed high activity in slow-growing HT-1080 culture with elevated migratory behavior. Antisenseoligonucleotide against MMP-9 inhibited both MMP-9 andtumor cell migration. Borrelidin analogs showed a selectiveantimigratory activity as well, which may be related to theremarkable reduced expression of v3 integrin.Conclusion: MMP-9, heparan sulfate proteoglycan integrins the migratory potencyof OSCORT and HT-1080 cell cultures. Chemicalcompounds inhibiting one of these molecules were able toreduce tumor cell migration. The present reportsummarizing preclinical studies indicates that targetedtherapy against tumor metastasis could be planned againstthese molecules. 254 A MECHANISTIC INVESTIGATION INTO THEANTI-INV ASIVE EFFECTS OF OLIVE OILPHENOLICS Gill6 Institute of Food and Health, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland; 2Department of Food Biosciences, University of Reading, Whiteknights, PO Box 226 Reading RG6 Metabolism and Microbiology, Food & Textiles Group, AgResearch Limited, Grasslands Research Centre,Tennent Drive, Private Bag 11008, Palmerston North, NewZealand; 5System Biology Research Group, Centre for Molecular Biosciences, School of Biomedical Sciences and 6Northern Ireland Centre for Food and Health (NICHE), University of Ulster (Coleraine), Cromore Road, Coleraine,Northern Ireland, UK BT52 1SA Recently, certain major phenolics from virgin olive oil have been shown to modulate cellular pathways involved inANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3308carcinogenesis, such as cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis. Invasion is an important feature of metastasisand it comprises adhesion, degradation of basementmembrane via proteolytic enzyme activity; and cell migration/motility. In this in vitro study, we focused on the anticancer effects of phenolics from virgin olive oil at theinvasion level using HT115, a metastatic adenocarcinomacell line. Olive oil extract (OVP) cellinvasion in the Matrigel invasion assay but not migrationthrough polyethylene membrane devoid of the reconstitutedbasement membrane. OVP also inhibited or reducedadhesion on collagen type IV and spreading on fibronectin.Interestingly, OVP was observed to inhibit adhesion and/orcause detachment of adhering cells in the assays performed.This anti-adhesion effect is proposed to be a genuine effectsince OVP was not cytotoxic at the range tested (0-25g/ml) and we observed that OVP caused differential effectson HT115 cell surface integrin expression. Based on theclustering and pathway/functional genomics analysis ongene expression data, we propose that OVP interferes withthe pathways that lead to detachment of cells from substrate.In conclusion, results from this study suggest that OVPinhibited integrin-regulated adhesion, spreading andinvasion but not migration of HT115 These studiesrevealed novel anticancer targets of phenolics from virginolive oil, which may aid understanding in prognosis,prevention, as well as therapy of cancer at the invasion andmetastasis level. 255 REFINEMENT AND ANIMAL WELFARE IN CANCERMODELS Jann HauDepartment of Experimental Medicine, University and University Hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark Laboratory animal models have been essential for understanding tumour biology, for development and testingof drug therapies, and for risk assessments of potentialcarcinogens. Animal models remain pivotal for studies ofbiological mechanisms involved in the development ofcancer and for studies of tumours growing in vivo . Scientists have moral and legal obligations for the welfare of theanimals in their care during experimentation, and properconsideration should always be given to the 'three R's'(replacement, reduction, and refinement). When animals arenecessary to address a particular question in oncology, painand distress must be minimised, and avoidable pain isunacceptable. Studies of experimentally induced neoplasiapresent particular problems, and scientists should make everyeffort for implementation of the earliest humane endpointspossible to minimise the adverse effects on the animals.Death as an endpoint should obviously no longer be accepted, and researchers should be encouraged to introducethe earliest possible endpoints and to disseminate theinformation by publishing improvements with respect torefinement and animal welfare score sheets in experimentalprotocols. Continuous refinement of experimental protocols resulting in the introduction of the earliest achievable endpoints requirescompetence, commitment and collaboration of scientists andall staff associated with animal care and animalexperimentation. All staff should understand their individualresponsibilities, and an unambiguous chain of communicationand accountability should be established. This allowsimmediate action to address animal welfare issues that mayarise as a consequence of experimental protocols. 256 THE EXPRESSION OF EIF3, Linz, 3Division of Hematology and (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumour associated with poor prognosis. Despite radio- andchemotherapy, survival is short. EIF3 is a multi-subunitcomplex that plays a central role in the translation initiationpathway. The large subunit of eIF3 that includes p150 isregarded as a key player in translation initiation and mediatesmost of its activities. We investigated the expression of p150by immunohistochemistry in 46 patients with glioblastoma.Moreover primary cell lines were analysed for p150 proteinexpression by Western blot techniques. P150 expression wasmostly localised in the cytoplasm with strongest expression intumour giant cells. Overexpression of p150 was found in 34tumour samples. Modern therapeutic approaches, for exampleRapamycin or its analogues, may target elongation andinitiation factors of protein synthesis, and thus could lead to aglobal cellular down-regulation, including p150 as shown forthe mTor pathway.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3309257 P150 - EIF3 LARGE SUBUNIT - PROTEINOVEREXPRESSION IN BREAST J.

P150 belongsto the elongation initiation factor 3 complex, which consistsof 10 subunits. It was shown to be part of the large subunitcomplex, described as being a 160 to 180 kDa proteincomplex. It is supposed to be a molecular parameter inpredicting disease progression in cervical and oesophagealcancer. We describe the distribution of P150 in normal andneoplastic breast tissue and try to elucidate the role of theeIF3 complex during tumorigenesis. Therefore 43 breasttissue samples were examined, including benign andneoplastic tissues and compared with each other by the useof immunohistochemistry and Western blotting using apolyclonal chicken anti-p150-antibody. Strongoverexpression in breast cancer was found in nearly all cases.Exceptionally, in one case of squamous cell carcinoma, aninverse reaction was found. In contrast to neoplastic tissues,the adjacent normal one revealed a slight inhomogenouspositivity. The role of p150 as part of the eIF3 complexduring tumorigenesis is strictly related to a selective proteinsynthesis in tumor cells. It mainly participates in thederegulation of the translation process by interaction witheIF4E, eIF2 and with hPrt1, and also with of Pathology, Institutes of Neuropathology and 2Clinicial Pathology, University Hospital Zurich; 3Department of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Aarau;4Functional Genomics Centre Zurich, University Zurich; 5Institute of Integrative Biology, Biomedicine,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH),CH-8952 Zurich, Switzerland; 6University of California, San Diego and University of California, Los Angeles, USA*These authors contributed equally to this work. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common liver cancer, is mainly induced by chronic hepatitis. Lymphotoxin(LT) was recently demonstrated to be up-regulated in liversof patients suffering from virus-induced hepatitis and HCC.We generated transgenic mice with liver-specific expressionof LT (AlbLT). Characteristic morphological features ofchronic portal and lobular hepatitis were detected in liversfrom transgenic mice at the age of 6-9 months, preceded byhepatocyte-specific expression of chemokines CCL2). Elevated serum levels of aminotransferasesstarting from 8 weeks of age indicated liver damage inAlbLT mice. Remarkably, at an age of 300 days, 30% oftransgenic mice developed HCCs.

For example, in glioblastoma multiforme theepidermal growth factor receptor- (EGFR-) gene isfrequently amplified and mutated to yield high levels ofconstitutively active receptors with prolonged half-lives. Ina search for endogenous inhibitors of EGFR signaling, weidentified the integral membrane protein, leucine-rich repeatsand immunoglobulin-like domains 1 Subsequently,we down-regulated in various neoplasms, including cervical and renal cell carcinoma. We alsoidentified two human LRIG1 paralogs, LRIG2 and differential pathological which seems to haveclinical implications. Perinuclear LRIG protein associated with good astrocytoma cytoplasmic LRIG2 was LRIG1 issubject to proteolytic processing and the resulting fragmentsseemed to have biological activities. Taken together, theLRIG proteins seem to be important regulators of growthfactor signaling with implications for patient survival invarious malignancies. 260 A MOUSE MODEL OF NEUROFIBROMATOSIS-1OPTIC Departments of 1Neurology, 2Radiology, Division of 3Neuropathology and 4Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA Individuals affected with the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) are prone to develop tumors of the nervous system, includingoptic pathway gliomas (OPG). These tumors are classified asgrade I pilocytic astrocytomas, characterized by lowcellularity and rare mitotic figures. Despite their benignbehavior in general, these gliomas often exhibit increasedangiogenesis. Importantly, the development of prechiasmaticand chiasmatic optic gliomas has been observed in agenetically engineered mouse (GEM) model with inactivationof the neurofibromatosis-1 ( Nf1) tumor suppressor gene in glial cells. Interestingly, the natural history and morphologyof these GEM tumors was similar to their humancounterparts. Furthermore, increased angiogenesis has beenfound during OPG development as evidenced by an increasedblood vessel density. We validated this Nf1 optic gliomamodel using conventional chemotherapy (temozolomide)currently used for children with low-grade glioma andshowed that treatment resulted in reduced proliferation andincreased apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo as well as reduced tumor volume. Collectively, these findings indicate that thisunique Nf1 GEM optic glioma model might be a potent toolfor preclinical assessment of novel anti-angiogenic therapies. 261 ROLE OF HYALURONAN-CD44 COMPLEXES INREGULATION OF GROWTH Cancer Research, Uppsala University, Biomedical Center, Box 595, S-751 24 Uppsala, Sweden Introduction: The interactions between cells and the host microenviroment influences cellular behavior. Hyaluronanlevels are determined by synthesizing (HAS) and degrading(HYAL) enzymes in response to growth factors. Thehyaluronan receptor CD44 affects cell-cell and cell-matrixinteractions. Methods and Results: HAS activity has been shown to be important for the maintenance of the malignantand invasive phenotype of the Hs578T breast cancer cellsusing specific siRNAs, we showed that HAS interacts withHYAL and the hyaluronan receptor CD44 to promote theaggressive character of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, usinga 3D collagen matrix assay we studied in the early adhesion of tumor cells to endothelialcells. Recently, we investigated the downstream signalingpathways through which PDGF-BB stimulates hyaluronansynthesis using inhibitors of different signaling pathways, the Erk MAP kinase and PI3 kinase signalingpathways are necessary for the regulation of hyaluronansynthesis by PDGF-BB and that hyaluronan affects themitogenic response to PDGF-BB. Recent data revealed thattissue hyaluronan content can be modulated throughubiquitinylation and possibly oligomerization of HASenzymes. In another line of research, we demonstrated thatCD44 forms a complex with both the malignanciesand modulates tyrosine kinase activity. 262 SINGLE OR COMBINATIONS OF TUMORMARKERS IN CERVICAL CANCER -CORRELATION TO PROGNOSIS, SERUMPROGESTERONE AND ESTRADIOL, SMOKING ANDORAL CONTRACEPTIVE USE Dan HellbergCenter for Clinical Research, Falun, Sweden Background: Expression of a single tumor marker is rarely clinically useful in any cancer type. There is an increasinginterest in using panels of tumor markers to increase prognosisprediction, differential diagnosis and choice of therapy.Materials and Methods: One hundred and thirty women withAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3311squamous epithelial cervical cancer had pre-treatment progesterone and estradiol, and a complete history includingsmoking habits and previous oral contraceptive use. A panelof 13 novel and traditional tumor markers were selected andanalysed by immunohistochemistry. Follow-up was at least 10years. Results: Expression of six tumor markers was significantly associated with 10-year survival, after adjustmentfor clinical cancer stage, these were LRIG1, p53, and CD4 +, (favourable prognosis). LRIG2, COX-2 poor prognosis. LRIG1 and LRIG2 willbe discussed elsewhere at the conference. With Coxregression, none of the other tumor markers were significantlyassociated with prognosis. When combinations of tumormarkers with different functions in carcinogenesis werecombined with Cox regression and adjusted for stage, fourcombinations significantly predicted prognosis, while anotherfour combinations were of borderline significance ( p=0.05). Expression of p53 was strongly reduced in smokers. C-mycexpression was correlated to increased serum progesteronelevels, while p53 expression was reduced. Conclusion: Combinations of tumor marker expression were more reliablein predicting prognosis than a single marker. Our results alsoprovide biological explanations behind the role of risk factorsin cervical cancer. The results of some other studies will bediscussed. 263 THE ROLE OF GENISTEIN DERIV ATIVESSTRUCTURE AND SOME MOLECULARPROPERTIES IN THEIR Silesian Technical University, ul.Krzywoustego 4, 44-100 Gliwice, Poland Many of the biological effects exerted by flavonoids, e.g. antitumoral, anti-inflammatory, anti-ischemic,cardioprotective, are believed to come from the antioxidantactivity of these compounds. As was shown in numerousexperiments, the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids dependsmostly on their structure ( i.e.number and positions of hydroxyl groups) but also on some other factors such as typeof oxidative stress inducer used or ability of certain flavonoidto intercalate into lipid bilayers (in the case of lipidperoxidation). According to present knowledge, flavonoidmolecules present in the membrane could directly scavenge ROS (reactive oxygen species) but also, due to the modulationof membrane properties, they can reduce the rate of ROSdiffusion in membrane and thus reduce lipid oxidation. In present work, we studied the interactions of newly synthesized benzyl and glycosylated genistein derivatives withlipid membranes. Using microcalorimetry, we that allstudied compounds interact with lipids and alter thethermotropic properties of bilayers by decreasing the mainphase transition temperature and enthalpy. For glycosylatedderivatives, calorimetry also showed that increase of the spacer separating genistein moiety and added sugarsincreases the perturbation induced by these compounds. ATR-IR spectroscopy allowed us to conclude that genistein and itsderivatives interact with lipid polar heads by hydrogenbonding. An increase of the number of gauche conformers in lipid acyl chains induced by the presence of studiedpolyphenols was also recorded. Both calorimetric and infraredspectroscopic experiments confirmed that polar head region aswell as the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer are affected bythe presence of flavonoids. Studying the influence of genisteinderivatives on the calcein efflux from liposomes, we foundthat all compounds are more active than parent genistein butglycosylated derivatives permeabilize membranes to a greaterextent than benzyl ones. Analyzing the properties of studiedmolecules calculated by computer-aided modeling, we noticedthat among coefficient,polarizability, E HOMO , ELUMO and dipole moment, only the latter property correlates with the order of permeabilizingpotency of benzyl genistein derivatives. Further analysis ofcomputer modeling results revealed that in fact the dipolemoment of an added benzyl ring together with its substitutions(fluorine, cyanine and the factordetermining the liposome changes induced bygenistein derivatives. Finally, we studied the antioxidantactivity of these compounds (against lipid peroxidation) andthe relation between the effects exerted by the studiedderivatives on lipid membranes and their antioxidant potencyis discussed. 264 TUMOR STEM CELLS IN GLIOMAS: CLINICALIMPACT OF THE STEM CELL MARKER CD133 ANDTHERAPEUTICAL STRATEGIES Herold-Mende 1, B. Radlwimmer2 1Department of Neurosurgery, University of Heidelberg, 2DKFZ Heidelberg, Germany A considerable amount of evidence has been gathered supporting the existence of tumor stem cells in a variety ofANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3312cancers. Glioma-derived tumor stem cells (GTSC) can be enriched by the stem cell surface antigen CD133. Conversely,a controlled, drug-induced depletion of the CD133-positiveGTSC pool could have profound therapeutic implications.Retinoids such as all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) have been shown to induce differentiation of GTSCs in vitro . However, it remains unknown whether tumor growth-relevant features ofthese cells are affected. We analyzed expression of CD133 in 95 gliomas of various grade and histology by immunohistochemistry. Staining datawere correlated with patient outcome. Furthermore, lines with high CD133 content were established toinvestigate ATRA-induced differentiation and potential effectson BrDU-incorporation Impact of of GTSCs was measured by quantification ofangiogenic cytokines and assessed in HUVEC-based tubeformation on GTSC invasiveness werestudied in a 3D-collagen invasion model. Finally, we studiedwhether in vitro effects could be confirmed in vivo using a NOD/SCID-mouse xenograft model. By multivariate survival analysis, both the proportion of CD133-positive cells and their topological organization inclusters were significant ( p<0.001) prognostic factors for adverse progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Furthermore the proportion of CD133-positive cells was anindependent risk factor for tumor regrowth and time tomalignant progression in WHO II and III tumors. Supportingthese clinical data, we present functional evidence that GTSCsexposed to ATRA lower the expression of CD133 in favor ofincremented expression of lineage markers. This is accompaniedby a significantly reduced secretion of VEGF and bFGF, as wellas a significantly lowered angiogenic activity followingdifferentiation. Additionally, we show that differentiation elicitsstrong anti-invasive effects, reducing invasion of GTSCsaccompanied by a down-regulation of invasion-related MMP2protein. Finally, we report that xenografted tumors GTSCs smaller and less invasivethan undifferentiated GTSC xenografts. Correspondingly,animals bearing differentiated cells show significantlybetter PFS and OS than mice with GTSC xenografts. These findings constitute the first conclusive evidence that CD133 expression correlates with patient survival in gliomas,lending support to the current cancer stem cell hypothesis.Additionally, we present functional evidence thatdifferentiation treatment targets the tumor-drivingcompartment in glioblastoma and constitutes a potentialtherapeutic approach in the eradication of GTSCs. 265 SULFORAPHANGE ERADICATES of Ulm, Ulm; 3University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany Emerging evidence suggests that cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a central role in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.We identified CSCs in pancreatic with a CD44 +/CD24-, CD44+/CD24+, or CD44+/CD133+phenotype and their presence correlated to high therapy resistance. Mechanistically, we observed specificbinding of transactivation potent c-Rel containing NF- B complexes in but in non-CSCs. A compound foundin broccoli, sulforaphane, prevented NF- B binding and induced IBa along with strong induction of apoptosis and prevention of clonogenicity. Other chemopreventive agents,gemcitabine or the death ligand TRAIL were less effective. Ina xenograft model, sulforaphane strongly blocked tumorgrowth and combination with TRAIL, had an additive effectwithout obvious cytotoxicity to normal cells and stem cells.Ex vivo , sulforaphane abrogated resistance of primary patient tumor cells harboring CSCs. Our data suggest combination ofsulforaphane with TRAIL as promising strategy for targetingof pancreatic CSCs. 266 AP-1-DEPENDENT GENETIC , Szabowski and Peter Angel Deutsches and Growth Control, Im Neuenheimer Feld280, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany The transcription factor AP-1, which is mainly composed of members of the Fos and Jun protein families, participates inphysiological and pathophysiological processes due to itscentral role as a cellular switch of genetic programs in responseto extracellular signals. AP-1 subunits and their specific targetgenes exhibit distinct expression patterns in epidermalkeratinocytes as well as mesenchymal cells. Together withimpaired skin regeneration and carcinogenesis in AP-1compromised mouse models these findings indicate that AP-1-dependent genetic programs play a pivotal role in epidermalorganization, skin homeostasis and tumourigenesis. Employinggenome-wide expression analysis on samples of geneticallymodified mouse and cell culture model systems, we arestudying the function of AP-1 and its target genes within acomplex dynamic network of signalling pathways implicatedin the well-coordinated intercellular communication betweenkeratinocytes, fibroblasts and immune cells. We found trans-Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3313regulatory functions of Jun family members in the epithelial- mesenchymal crosstalk and could fibroblasts including cytokines, chemokinesand growth factors. Additionally, we could identify a signallingpathway triggered by the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts RAGE that activates AP-1 in epithelial tumour cellsand is initiated by ligands that are expressed in epithelial aswell as mesenchymal cells under pro-inflammatory conditions.In the context of tumour cell invasion and malignantprogression, we identified the mucine-like glycoproteinPodoplanin as a novel AP-1 target gene in epithelial tumourcells and fibroblasts. 267 IN VITRO MATURATION OF HUMAN MONOCYTE- DERIVED DENDRITIC CELLS UNDER SERUM-FREE CONDITIONS IN THE PRESENCE ACID-TREATED BACTERIA LOADEDWITH ANTIGEN F. Michael adjuvants in vivo and have been shown to enhance impaired immune functions in patients (1-4). As they expose lipid A on their surface they are expected tomature dendritic cells most efficiently viaToll-like receptor 4. Moreover, as they are non-infectious, they should serve asoptimal carriers for different antigens suitable as anticancervaccines. In this work we tested acid-treated gram-negativemutant (R-form) Salmonella minnesota bacteria loaded with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or PSA-peptides (PSAP)for their capacity to induce maturation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) under serum-free serum-free medium supplemented with GM-CSF and IL-4 for 5 days and maturedfor 24 h with ATB (either with R-or S-(wild-type) form)loaded loaded with PSA or PSAP induced phenotypic characteristics MoDCs CD83 on MoDCs as well as theircytokine production, was higher after stimulation with ATBloaded with PSAP compared to ATB loaded with PSA. Bothapproaches led to higher levels of IL-12p70 and lowered IL-10levels when IFN- was added to the maturation protocol. Thehighest ratio of IL-12p70 against IL-10 levels was observed inthe presence of IFN- using ATB preparations on theirown or loaded with PSAP. Conclusion: ATB preparations represent suitable agents for the ex vivo maturation and antigen-loading of human MoDCs under serum-freeconditions as exemplified for PSA and PSAP. In combinationwith IFN- all ATB preparations tested led to an enhancedT H1-polarisation, establishing an adjuvant strategy, which should improve and facilitate future clinical protocols forcellular anticancer immunotherapy.1 Miragliotta G, Di Vagno E and Galanos C: Evaluation of procoagulant activityproduction and other coagulative functions in cancer patientsreceiving acid treated Salmonella minnesota R 595 (Re).

Wepresent useful serum markers in vivo for drug-induced carcinoma cell death and/or tissue toxicity. The presence ofliver metastases and liver injury prior to treatment mayenhance the CK18 biomarker signal strength and inductionpattern. Furthermore the optimal time window for serumsampling for this type of cell death biomarker analysis wasevaluated. Methods: M30 and M65 antigen levels were measured by ELISA (4) in serum samples from 11 patientssuffering from carcinomas of the breast, ovaries, oesophagusand larynx, that were taken shortly before, during and aftertreatment with paclitaxel as part of a pharmacodynamicclinical study. Results: Significant increases of serum tumor cell death biomarkers were found over pre-treatment values in10/11 patients, which peaked or reached plateau after approx.24 h post drug infusion. Most patients showing an increase inM65 (total CK18) serum levels also had a of the apoptotic M30 (caspase-cleavedCK18/CK18F) serum biomarker. No effect of the presence ofliver metastases or elevated liver enzymes on baseline or theextent of treatment-induced increases in M30 or M65 serumlevels were observed. The data obtained suggest that baselineM30/M65 serum values could have diagnostic potential asprognostic cancer biomarkers reflecting overall disease activityand as a predictive clinical response marker. Conclusion: Monitoring of serum CK18 and CK18F/M30 levels by ELISAprior, during and after chemotherapy therapy may provide asimple and minimally-invasive method for the quantitativeassessment of therapy-induced antitumour activity in differentcarcinoma types and/or for prognostic purposes. Furthervalidation of the prognostic and predictive value of thesebiomarkers is necessary.1 Cummings J, Ward TH, Greystoke A, 2 Olofsson MH, Ueno T, Pan Y , Xu R, Cai F, van der Kuip H, Muerdter TE, Sonnenberg M, Aulitzky WE, Schwarz Havelka is a useful serum biomarker for earlydetermination breast carcinomas Cancer Res 13(11) : 3198-3206, 2007.

In this study, we investigatedwhether R-OH could serve as a potential inhibitor of DC-mediated inflammatory processes by analyzing its influenceon the maturation and/or cytokine production of humanmonocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) stimulated withlipopolysaccharides (LPS) in presence or absence ofInterferon-gamma (IFN-). Methods: Immature human MoDCs were generated in serum-free medium supplementedwith GM-CSF and IL-4 for 5 days and matured for additional24 hours with LPS \u00b1 IFN-. R-OH or LPC (as a control) wasadded 24 hours before or simultaneously with LPS. MaturedMoDCs were phenotypically characterised a period of more than 24 hoursin serum-free medium. However, compared to LPC, pre-Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3315incubation of immature MoDCs with R-OH followed by maturation with LPS \u00b1 IFN- led to twice as high an up-regulation of CD83, which was associated with a stronginhibition of cytokine production. Interestingly, whereas LPCenhanced TH 2-polarisation after maturation by LPS, even in the presence of IFN-, pre-incubation of MoDCs with R-OHstill enhanced the TH 2-polarisation when matured with LPS alone, however, it did not alter the strong TH1-polarisation seen previously after maturation with LPS in the presence ofIFN- (3). Conclusion: Pre-incubation of immature MoDCs changing IL-10/IL-12p70 ratio orT H1-polarisation. Moreover, R-OH enhanced the up-regulation of both co-stimulatory cell surface molecules and thematuration marker CD83, which, in addition to its immuneregulatory functions, may potentiate antitumor immuneresponses. In conclusion, these results may form the basis toexplain not only the anti-inflammatory role of R-OH, but alsoits properties. 1 Coutant F, Laure T, Andre P and Lotteau cell promoted INJECTION TECHNIQUE E. Hiltbrand and S. Humbert University Hospital Geneva and CERMA, Geneva, Switzerland Targeted MULTI Therapy (TMT) primarily developed as a new thermoablative technique for cancer, is currently beingextended to phlebological applications. As animalinvestigations have shown the safety and the efficacy of thetreatment, the technique was applied successfully to humans.Besides thermoablative procedures, taking advantage of theMULTI capability of the technique, investigations areconducted in several therapeutic areas of oncology: deliveryof drugs and radioactive particles under pressure directly intotargeted tumours.In this context, an experiment in which a new apoptogenic molecule with proven efficacy on cells in culture, and with theremarkable property of being irreversibly cytotoxic to humanprostate epithelial cancer cells but reversibly cytostatic tohuman prostate epithelial normal cells (Quash G. Eur. J. Med.Chem. (2007), was successfully carried out on an animalmodel. Additionally, the injection of radioactive particles with the same technique is currently being investigated on rats(European project: INBARCA). The delivery of the activeagent directly into the lesion minimizes side-effects, enhancesefficacy and reduces doses. The high pressure ensures an evenbetter diffusion of the agent. 271 TARGETING NITROSATIVE STRESS FOR CANCERTHERAPY David G. Hirst , Helen O. McCarthy, Jonathan Coulter, Natalie Page and Tracy Robson Experimental Therapeutics Research Group, School of Pharmacy, Queen's University Belfast, 97 Lisburn Road,Belfast BT9 7BL, UK Nitric oxide (NO ) exhibits many of the desirable properties of an anticancer molecule. It is highly diffusible throughtissues and demonstrates specificity for the tumourmicroenvironment. It is likely that this characteristic resultsfrom the differential production of reactive nitrogen species,particularly peroxynitrite, in tumours compared with theirnormal counterpart and in the downstream consequences oftheir generation. The effects of NO are highly concentration- dependent, but at high therapeutic levels it is strongly pro-apoptotic, anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic. In addition, ithas been shown to be one of the most potent radiationsensitizers known and can also enhance the cytotoxicity ofsome chemotherapeutic agents. However, these properties canbe fully exploited only if effective strategies for delivery canbe developed. At present, both NO donor drugs and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene therapy have shownimpressive efficacy in experimental animal models of humancancer. We have used gene promoters that are inducible byhypoxia, radiation and the tumour microenvironment to targetthe expression of iNOS and hence generation of highconcentrations of NO to the tumour volume. Twice weekly administration of this therapy in a mouse model of prostatecancer inhibited tumour growth for several months. Thus,NO therapy shows considerable promise as an anticancer strategy. 272 AKT INHIBITOR INHIBITS CELL Nakamura, Youji and plays an important role in various cellular processesincluding cell growth, survival, and motility. Recently,accumulating evidence indicated that PI3K/Akt pathway playsa crucial role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression bypromoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (1). Inaddition, abnormal function of the PI3K/Akt pathway has beenreported in many human tumors and this signaling pathwayhas been suggested to be a potential target for cancerchemotherapy (2). We examined the expression of Akt and theexistence of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in human malignantfibrous histiocytoma (MFH) cell lines, and the inhibitoryeffect of Akt inhibitor on the cell proliferation. Materials and Methods: Cell lines and reagent. Three human MFH cell lines (Nara-H, GBS-1, TNMY1) were used in this study. TNMY1was previously established in our laboratory. All cell lineswere grown in culture medium consisting of Dulbecco'smodified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich, fetal bovine serum (FBS;Sigma-Aldrich). The cell lines were routinely maintained at37C in a humidified 5% CO 2atmosphere. Akt inhibitor X, a specific Akt kinase inhibitor was purchased from Calbiochem(San Diego, CA, USA). The inhibitory effect of Akt inhibitor. The cell proliferation was assayed using the MTS assay(CellTiter 96 \u00aeAqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Cells were seeded in 96-wellcell culture plates in culture medium with 10% FBS. After 24hours (h), the medium was refreshed with 1% FBS containingAKT inhibitor in the indicated concentrations. After 24 and 48h, the medium was removed and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, then refreshed with fresh medium containingMTS reagent. The optical density was measured at 490 nmusing an automatic microplate reader after 2 h of furtherincubation. The percent age viability of each well wascalculated. At least three independent cultures were performedfor each study. The data were analyzed statistically usingANOV A with Fisher's PLSD post hoc test. Western blotting. Cells were pretreated for 60 min with 1% FBS containingAKT inhibitor at different concentrations. Whole cell lysateswere collected for protein content, and cell lysates wereseparated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis underreducing electrophoreticallytransferred to PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-AKT1/2/3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA)and anti-phospho-AKT1/2/3 antibody (Ser 473, Thr 308; SantaCruz Biotechnology). Bound antibodies were detected usingthe ECL plus Western blotting detection system (GEHealthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ). Results: The effect of the Akt inhibitor: Akt inhibitor inhibited the cell proliferation of all 3 cell lines in a dose- and time-dependentmanner; 10 M AKT inhibitor inhibited the cell proliferationof Nara-H and GBS-1 at the percent viability of 50% or less;25 M AKT inhibitor inhibited the cell proliferation ofTNMY1 at viability of 50% or less. Expression of Akt and phospho-Akt: Western blotting analysis revealed that not only Akt but phospho-Akt were expressed in all cell lines under thenormal condition, so it was suggested that Akt signalingpathway was always activated in all 3 cell lines under thenormal condition. Phosphorylation of Akt was reduced by 25M Akt inhibitor in all cell lines. Discussion: The PI3K/Akt pathway is very important as a target of the moleculartargeting therapy. In our study, Akt inhibitor showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the cell proliferation of humanMFH cells. Akt inhibitor reduced the phosphorylation of Akt.These results suggest that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathwayexists and plays an important role in cell proliferation in MFHcells. Although further studies are needed to explore themechanisms of cell proliferation, Akt inhibitor will be a potentchemotherapeutic agent for human MFH.1 Jin S, Pang RP, Shen JN, Huang G, Wang J and Zhou JG: Grifolin induces apoptosis viainhibition of PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in human osteosarcoma cells.

In this study, we tested DADS for induction ofAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3317apoptosis in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. DADS induced morphological changes and reduced the percentage ofviable HeLa cells in a dose- and time-dependent manners.Flow staining showed morphologicalfeatures of apoptosis in HeLa treated with 50 M DADSfor 24 h. ApopTag assay demonstrated DNA fragmentation inapoptotic cells. DADS induced apoptosis through theproduction of reactive oxygen species and Ca 2+, and induced the abrogation of changes in mitochondrial membranepotential (m) and cleavage of Bid protein (t-Bid). DADSalso promoted the activities of caspase-3 leading that DADS-induced apoptosisis caspase-3-dependent. apoptosis in HeLa cells. Activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 indicated involvement of the intrinsic pathwayof apoptosis. Results strongly suggested that the garliccompound DADS suppressed antiapoptotic factors andactivated intrinsic caspase cascade for apoptosis in HeLa cells. 274 PHENOTYPE SWITCHING, A NEW PARADIGM FORMETASTATIC PROGRESSION Keith S. Hoek , Natalie Dummer Department University Hospital of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland Metastatic melanoma is a complex and heterogeneous cancer for which, despite more than 100 clinical trials and over thirtyyears of dedicated molecular research, no effective therapy hasyet been realised. Such failure demands we revisit the basictenets which underly our assumptions about this disease andreappraise them in the light of recent findings. Transcriptionprofiling of cell lines and short-term cultures by our group hasuncovered among melanoma cells a previously unrecognizedmolecular taxonomy. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that this taxonomy is comprised of cells which are eitherprogrammed for proliferation, or programmed for invasion.Our interpretation of the data and subsequent experimentationhas led us to conclude that the dominating paradigm fordisease progression in melanoma, where weakly metastaticprecursors evolve viathe linear accumulation of changes into strongly metastatic cells, is in error. Instead, we hypothesizethat once transformation has been achieved, melanoma cellsexpress transcription programs (phenotypes) according tomicroenvironmentally derived signals, which in turn allowsthem to drive disease progression by switching betweenproliferative and invasive programs. This new phenotype-switching model answers several criticisms leveled at thepresent linear accumulation model, offers an explanation forhow gene expression markers for early primary lesions frequently persist in metastases, and supplies a plausiblereason for therapy escape. 275 IMAGING THE TOTALITY OF CANCERPROGRESSION IN REAL TIME Robert M. HoffmanAntiCancer, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA The development of GFP for imaging in the live animal has revolutionized in vivo biology, in particular, the study of metastasis (Nature Reviews Cancer 5, 796-806, 2005). Thetotality of cancer progression can now be followed in real timein the live animal, with many of the steps imageable non-invasively. GFP-expressing transgenic mice transplanted withthe RFP-expressing cancer cells enable the distinction ofcancer and host cells. This is particularly useful for imagingthe tumor microenvironment, including tumor angiogenesis.Cancer-cell trafficking through the cardiovascular andlymphatic systems is the critical means of spread of cancer.The use of fluorescent proteins to differentially label cancercalls in the nucleus and cytoplasm and high-powered imagingtechnology are used to visualize the nuclear-cytoplasmicdynamics of cancer-cell trafficking and extravasation in bothblood vessels and lymphatic vessels in the live animal.Proliferating and dormant cancer cells are readilydistinguished in the live animal. This technology has furtheredour understanding of the spread of cancer at the cellular andsubcellular level in the live mouse. Fluorescent proteins thusenable both macro and micro imaging technology and therebyprovide the basis for the new field of in vivo cell biology. 276 ETS-1 ONCOGENIC ACTIVITY IS Aleksandra Franovic, Josianne Payette and Stephen Lee Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario CanadaK1H 8M5 Overt expression of the Ets-1 oncogene has been demonstrated in a variety of tumors and has been correlated with poor patientprognosis and clinical outcome. While studies have establisheda role for Ets-1 in regulating the expression of genes involvedin extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis, relativelylittle is known regarding the mechanisms through which Ets-1promotes primary tumor establishment. We previouslyelucidated a critical role for the TGF/EGFR autocrinepathway in establishment of renal clear cell carcinoma (RCC).ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3318Examination of the proximal TGF promoter region revealed the presence of multiple Ets-1 binding sites. Through the use ofreporter assays and quantitative PCR we demonstrate that theTGF promoter is responsive to Ets-1 and that inhibiting Ets- 1 activity viadominant negative Ets-1 or siRNA silencing of Ets-1 is sufficient to block both reporter activity andendogenous TGF expression in 786-0 VHL -/-RCC cells. To confirm the physical interaction of Ets-1 with the TGF promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation. In vitro silencing of Ets-1 blocked autonomous growth of 786-0 cells in a TGF-dependent manner. Importantly, tumorxenograft assays demonstrate that silencing of Ets-1 preventstumor formation in a manner that is rescuable by re-establishment of TGF expression. We believe these results tobe the first to clearly establish a role for Ets-1 in primary tumorformation through its ability to regulate TGF expression. 277 HORMONE-REFRACTORY PROSTATE CANCER-NEW OPTIONS FOR ITS MANAGEMENT L. Holubec Topolcan, J. Finek and M. Hora Faculty Hospital and Medical School in Pilsen, E. Benese 13, 305 99 Plzen, Czech Republic Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men. Although many patients whose cancer has beendiagnosed and treated at early stage can be cured, the yearlydeath toll of prostate is one of the leading causes of deathamong males. For the past 60 years, androgen deprivation hasbeen the mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer.Whether obtained by orchiectomy or by administration of anLHRH agonist, castration produces subjective and/or objectiveresponse in more than 80% of patients. Further androgendeprivation can still be obtained by combined therapy with ananti-androgen, in order to obtain \"maximal androgenblockade\". In spite of hormone therapy, all patients willprogress and eventually become hormone-refractory. Thesepatients retain hormonal sensitivity in that they may respond tosecondary hormonal therapy. They belong to the androgen-independent and hormone-sensitive group according to theclassification proposed by Scher. However \"hormone refractoryprostate cancer\" (HRPC) is the term commonly used todescribe prostate cancer that has progressed in spite of primaryandrogen deprivation or maximal androgen blockade. Thestandard of care of hormone-refractory prostate cancer issecond-line hormone therapy consists of antiandrogenwithdrawal, corticosteroids, oestrogens or adrenal enzymeinhibitors. Second-line hormone therapy has poor activitywhich led to the use of chemotherapy. A number of cytotoxicagents have been tested against HRCP over the years. The aimof this overview lecture is to compare the efficacy of differentchemotherapeutical regimens in patients with failure of the second-line hormonal supression and a probable hormonallyindependent cancer. Mitoxantrone plus prednisone reduces painand improves the quality of life in men with advanced,hormone-refractory prostate cancer, but it does not improvesurvival. A number of clinical studies with a variety ofprotocols were initiated to evaluate the potential usefulness ofNavelbine in HRPC. When used alone in a series of phase IIclinical studies, Navelbine demonstrated its efficacy in termsof relief of bone pain, the major complaint of HRPC patients,and in terms of PSA response. Significant reductions of serumPSA levels, by 50% or more, were obtained in a number ofpatients. When used in combination with low dose ofcorticosteroids, as shown in a large phase III pivotal study,NA VELBINE appeared significantly more efficacious thanhormone-therapy alone in terms of progression-free survival,PSA response and clinical benefit (pain intensity, analgesicsconsumption and performance status). When given withprednisone, treatment with docetaxel every three weeks led tosuperior survival and improved rates of response in terms ofpain, serum PSA level, and quality of life, as compared withmitoxantrone plus prednisone. The literature overview and ourpersonal experience from routine clinical practice provideevidence that cytotoxic chemotherapy can significantly prolongsurvival among men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.The obtained data suggest that docetaxel plus prednisone is thepreferred option for most patients with hormone-refractoryprostate cancer. Also Navelbine appeard as a good candidatefor clinical development in the chemotherapy of HRPC. Inconclusion, chemotherapy open new perspectives in thetreatment of HRPC.

Kashihara 634-8521; 2Department of Life Technology, KinkiUniversity, 3-4-1 Kowakae, Hiagshi-Osaka 577-8502, Japan The presence of cancer stem cells, in both solid and hematopoietic malignancies, has been recently linked to theirpathogenesis. Sarcomas are rare, and diversely characterizedby degrees of mesenchymal differentiation. The aim of thecurrent study was to demonstrate whether the sarcoma celllines possess the stem-like properties, using humanAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece by 4-hydroxy (amino) quinoline 1-oxide in F344 rats. All cell lines possessed an ability to form spherical, clonal expanding colonies ('sarcospheres') in anchorage-independent, serum-starved of0.2-0.8%. Sarcospheres showed stem-like properties withthe ability of self-renewing, and stem cell-related genes including Nanog, Oct3/4 and STAT3. Ratsarcospheres rats. and rat sarcoma cell lines remarkablyreduced INK4a-ARF gene expression which is originally expressed in adherent cells. Finally, human sarcosphere cellsshowed chemoresistance to doxorubicin and cisplatincompared to adherent monolayered These spheresshowed increased expression of DNA repair enzyme genes,MLH1 and MSH2 , suggesting that the chemoresistance in stem-like sphere cells is partly due to the increased DNArepair ability after DNA damage induced bychemotherapeutic agents. These results suggest that the stem-like cell populations exist in various kinds of sarcomas, and could be involved inchemoresistance, which leads to disease relapse, metastasis,and pathogenesis as well, and these may possibly providenovel targets in future sarcoma treatments. 279 MEDICINAL ELECTRONOMICS BRICOLAGE:DESIGN HYPOXIA-TARGETINGANTINEOPLASTIC and Hideko Nagasawa2 1Department of Life System, Institute of Technology and Science, Graduate School, The University of Tokushima,Tokushima 770-8506; 2Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Gifu 502-8585, Japan The hypoxic tumor microenvironment is now considered as a major factor that influences not only the response toantineoplastic therapies but also the potential for malignantprogression and metastasis. We present here our progress inthe development hypoxia-targeting First, chiral 2-aminomethylene-4-cyclopentene-1,3-dionemoiety as antiangiogenic hypoxic The2-aminomethylene-4-cyclopentene-1,3-dione moiety is 2-methylene-4-cyclopentene-1,3-dione to hypoxic cell radiosensitizer by in vitro radiosensitizing assay, assay, and protein (PTK)inhibition assay. Our these chiral having the 2-aminomethlene-4-cyclopentene-1,3-dione moiety as a potent antiangiogenicpharmacophoric descriptor might be promising leadcandidates for the development of antiangiogenic hypoxiccell radiosensitizers. As a second strategy, we designed sugar-hybrid hypoxic cell radiosensitizers targeting for enhanced tumor glycolysis,namely Warburg's effect, which was well characterized inhypoxic tumor cells. In all eight compounds, their LUMOcoefficients were localized on the 2-nitroimidazole ring.Among these, fully acetylated-glucose containing hypoxic cellradiosensitizer TX-2244 was the most active radiosensitizerhaving both a higher in vitro radiosensitizing activity and lower hydrophobicity compared to misonidazole, known as aclassical hypoxic cell radiosensitizer. We also present here our development of an in vivo model using developing chick embryo to evaluate the radiosensitizingactivity against solid tumor. Boron neutron capture therapy(BNCT) is a targeted radiation therapy that significantlyincreases the therapeutic ratio relative to conventionalradiotherapeutic modalities and then the development ofefficient tumor-selective 10B delivery agents (boron-10 carriers) is of pivotal importance for the purpose. As a thirdstrategy, we designed hypoxia-targeting 2-nitroimidazole-BSH conjugatestested, TX-2060 maintained high 10B concentrations in solid tumors more effectively than any other compound tested, andshowed a significantly stronger in vitro radiosensitizing activity in the treatment of TX-2060 than that of BSH withneutron beam irradiation. Among these conjugates tested, TX-2100 had the most favorable characteristics for its sufficientconcentration of 10B in tumors and during irradiation. TX- 2100 also showed significantly stronger in vitro radiosensitizing effect than BSH when irradiated with neutronbeam. We suggest our hypoxia-targeting hybrid boron-10carriers might be useful and promising boron-10 the autocrine loops for PDGF factor that are a pervasivefeature of malignant astrocytoma. In this study we examinedthe influence of tyrosine kinase STI571 immunocytochemistry and flow-cytometry, weprovided evidence of PDGF / receptor RNA presence andits cell surface expression in three human glioblastomamultiforme (GBM) cell lines and one fibrillary astrocytomacell line. Migration rate (MR) was examined by the time-lapse individual cell migration assay (TIM-Assay), allowingcontinuous observation of cell features up to single cell levelunder defined conditions. STI571 was applied inconcentrations corresponding to the drug level incerebrospinal fluid and plasma in vivo . Migratory behavior was examined in a time-frame of 24 hours. One cell line wasanalyzed in a cycle conditioned treatment and a period of 8days. TIM-Assay was performed at day 1, 3, 6 and 8. Results: All glioma cell lines showed PDGF / receptor expression.In most tested cell lines, MR decreased after treatment withSTI571. The cells showed variable migratory characteristics.Cells of one glioblastoma multiforme showed an inherentlylow MR without STI571 treatment. In the other three celllines migration decreased after incubation with the tyrosinekinase inhibitor, already at the lowest STI571 concentration.The cyclical treatment with STI571 resulted in a constantlyreduction of the migratory behavior. Conclusion: STI571 affects migratory properties whereas PDGF / receptorexpression could be relevant. Targeting of PDGF signalingpathway by tyrosine kinase inhibitors represents a promisingstrategy to interfere with the migration activity of gliomacells. 281 EFFECTS OF PA-42 ON THE MOLECULARMECHANISMS OF APOPTOSIS AND METASTASISIN Medical Science, 3School of Pharmacy and 4Department of Microbiology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity is the sixth most frequent cancer in the world. Physalis angulata is a traditional Chinese annual herb which has been reported to exhibitanticancer effect on several types of human cancer. In thisstudy, we isolated the active compound PA-42 from Physalis angulata and found PA-42 caused cell cycle arrest in G 2/M phase, with decreasing cyclin A, cyclin B1 and cdc2 activity,but increasing wee1, p27 and p53 activity in HSC-3 cells. Itinduced DNA fragmentation, formation of DNA ladders inagarose gel electrophoresis and increased the levels of AIF,Bax, Bid, cleaved caspase-3, Fas, but reduced Bcl-2 in In assay of cancer by transwell (mesenchymal marker) PA-42 also caused a decrease in MMP-3 andGRB2. From these results, we found that PA-42 arrests HSC-3 cells at the G 2/M phase by decreased several cyclins, but increasing p27 and p53 activity. It induced apoptosis viaboth extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in HSC-3 cells. It also suppressedmetastasis including migration and invasion viareversed cell skeleton in HSC-3 cells. We conclude that PA-42 was able toinhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis and inhibit cellmetastasis in HSC-3 cells. 282 EXPRESSION OF CASPASE 14 IN HUMANEPITHELIAL CANCER CELLS AND ITS POTENTIALTHERAPEUTIC Lewis and Stephen Hsu Department of Oral Biology, School of Dentistry, AD1443Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA, 30912, USA Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma is a devastating malignancy with mortality rate consistently at 50%. Treatmentof such oral cancer is often associated with disfigurement,which can have a traumatic impact patients. Exploration ofnovel approaches and innovative therapies is needed to combatoral cancer. We previously reported that caspase-14 , a green tea polyphenol-activated gene that is expressed during terminaldifferentiation of certain epithelial cells, is able to induce celldeath and reduce tumorigenicity in skin cancer cells A431 andsalivary gland cancer cells HSG. However, the underlyingmechanism is unknown and whether adenovirus-deliveredAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3321transient caspase-14 expression induces similar effects in human oral cancer cells is not known. To express exogenoushuman caspase 14 in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells(OSC2) by adenovirus vector, and determine the effects ofcaspase-14 expression on cell growth, cell death andtumorigenicity. Methods: The human oral cancer cell line OSC2 was infected by adenovirus-expressing GFP or caspase14 cDNA. Expression of caspase 14 was confirmed byWestern blotting. Cell morphology was monitored bymicroscopic photography, cell growth was measured by cellcounting and BrdU assay, and cell viability was determinedby MTT assay. In addition, the cancer cells were xenograftedinto athymic mice to determine the tumorigenicity. Results: Expression of caspase-14 induced an undefined cell death inOSC2 cells compared to the control cells. Cell growth and cellviability were inhibited significantly by caspase-14 expression.Xenograft of caspase-14-expressing OSC2 cells into athymicmice resulted in reduced tumorigenicity. This effect could bedue to an inhibitory influence of caspase 14 on tumorvascularization. Conclusion: Oral cancer cells underwent growth inhibition and cell death when exogenous caspase-14was expressed in these undifferentiated tumor cells. Caspase-14 expression in OSC2 cells also reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. Further effort is warranted to explore if caspase 14- expressing adenovirus could be used as a potential therapeuticapproach to treat human epithelial cancer. This study was supported in part by the Dental ResearchFoundation of the Medical College of Georgia. 283 ENHANCEMENT OF ANTITUMOR PROPERTIES OFTRAIL BY TARGETED DELIVERY TO THE TUMORNEOV ASCULATURE Lin Cao, Pan Du, Shu-Han Jiang, Guang-Hui Jin, Qi-Lai Huang and Zi-Chun Hua The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnologyand Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences,Nanjing University, 22 Hankou Road, Nanjing 210093,Jiangsu, P.R. China Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising anticancer agent with tumor-selectiveapoptotic activity. TRAIL plays a role in the innate andadaptive immune response, autoimmune disease, and may alsobe involved in hepatic cell death and inflammation. For thesereasons, chronic exposure to TRAIL may have deleteriousside-effects in patients as a cancer therapeutic. In this study,we have improved the antitumor activity of TRAIL by targeteddelivery to the tumor vasculature, leading to dramaticenhancement of its therapeutic properties. TRAIL was the ACDCRGDCFC (named RGD-L-TRAIL), aligand activity in vitro and antitumor efficacy was investigated in vivo as a single agent and in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11). The fusion protein RGD-L-TRAIL,but not TRAIL or RGE-L-TRAIL, specifically bound tomicrovascular endothelial cells a dose-dependent (caspase-3and caspase-8 activation) in V3and V5integrin positive cancer cells. In addition, RGD-L-TRAIL was more effectivein suppressing tumor growth of COLO-205 tumor-bearingmice than an equivalent dose of TRAIL. The antitumor effectof RGD-L-TRAIL was further enhanced by combination TRAIL-sensitive COLO-205 and TRAIL-resistive HT-29 tumor xenograft models. Our novel fusion protein RGD-L-TRAIL can directly targettumor endothelial cells as well as V3and V5integrin- positive tumor cells. The tumor-targeted delivery of TRAILderivatives, such as RGD-L-TRAIL, may prove to be apromising lead candidate for cancer therapy. 284 KAEMPFEROL INDUCES APOPTOSIS VIA MITOCHONDRIAL- AND CASPASE-DEPENDENTCASPASE Pharmacy, 5Department of Biochemistry, 6School of Medicine and 7Department of Microbiology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; 3Department of Radiation Oncology, Chimei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; 4Department of Bioresources, Dayeh University, Changhua, Taiwan ROC It is well known that flavonoids can block or suppress multistage carcinogenesis and also exert anti-neoplasticactivites through the inhibition of cell growth and induction ofapoptosis. Kaempferol is one of the flavonoids that usuallyexist in many plants. Recently, antioxidant activity has beenused for cyto-protection. Kaempferol seems not only toprevent cells from free radical damage viaantioxidant activity but also induce apoptosis viaprooxidant activity in cancer cell lines. Kaempferol induced anti-proliferative activity in manytransformed cancer cell types, such as rat H4IE cells, humanHT29 colon cancer cells, acute leukemia cells, lung non-smallcarcinoma H460 cells. In this study, we examined theapoptotic effect and molecular mechanism of kaemperol inU2OS osteosarcoma cells. Kaempferol induced dose-dependent suppression of cell by MTT assay inU2OS cells. We used comet assay and RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3322electrophoresis to confirm kaempferol induced DNA damage and apoptosis. Flow cytometry was used to detect kaempferol-increased Ca +2production and reduced levels of MMP. Kaempferol induced the release of cytochrome c, Apaf-1, AIF from mitochondria accompanied by activation of caspase-9,caspase-3 by Western blotting and caspase activity assay andreal-time PCR. Specific inhibitors of caspases-9 and caspase-3 prevented caspase-9 and -3 activation and led to a decreasein the percentage of apoptosis. Kaempferol also promoted theexpression IAP. Our results suggestedthat kaempferol is able to induce ER stress and apoptosisthrough the mitochondrial- and caspase-dependent signalpathways in U2OS cells. CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THEETIOLOGY OF COLORECTAL TUMORS: ONGOINGRESEARCH FINDINGS FROM THE PLCO TRIAL Wen-Yi Huang and Richard B. Hayes for the PLCO research team Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetic, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department ofHealth and Human Services, Bethesda, MD20892, USA Cancer of the colon and rectum (colorectal) ranks second in both incidence and mortality in developed countries, and theincidence is rising in developing countries. Adenomatouspolyps are considered the key premalignant lesion leading tocolorectal cancer, hence risk factors for adenoma are animportant research topic. We have carried out investigations of colorectal adenoma in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) CancerScreening Trial, including about 75,000 screened participantsand 75,000 non-screened controls, at ten centers in the UnitedStates recruited between 1993 and 2001. Our studies relatedreduced adenoma risks to dietary fiber, dietary calcium, a genevariant in the calcium-sensing recent hormone replacement therapy. Werelated increased risks to carbohydrate intake and glycemicload, meat cooking practices, particularly PhIP exposure, andhigh body mass index. Tobacco use was strongly related toadenoma risk, with evidence of risk modification in relationto genes involved in the metabolism of tobacco CYP1A1, adenoma risk in relation to genetic variants in transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGFB1 ), nucleotide and base excision repair 128.54. In ongoing work, we areexpanding the questionnaire-based studies to include riskanalysis for colorectal cancer, incident adenoma, and recurrentadenoma. We are expanding genotyping studies to includelarger numbers of cases and controls and to deepen thepathway and gene region-specific SNP coverage. Withrecently acquired pathology samples, studies are planned toassess colorectal tumor risk in relation to tumor molecularsub-types and in relation to epigenetic and genome instabilityprofiles. 286 PROSTATE CANCER STEM CELLS Elaine M. HurtNational Cancer Institute-Frederick, Center for Cancer Research, Laboratory of Cancer Prevention, Cancer StemCells Section, Frederick, MD 21702, USA Recently there have been several reports of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in hematological malignancies as well as in solidtumors, such as breast, colon, glioblastoma, and prostatecancer. CSCs are the tumor-initiating cells that give rise to themultiple cell types present within a heterogeneous tumor.Moreover, CSCs are resistant to many conventionalchemotherapies, resulting in recurrence of the tumor.Therefore, the targeting of these cells is central to any therapythat is to be successful in eradicating cancer. However,successful targeting of these cells requires an understandingof the biology governing the CSC's unique properties ofcontinued self-renewal, multipotent differentiation, and tumorinitiation. Using prostate CSCs as a model, we are elucidatingthe molecular mechanisms underlying these properties. 287 BIOLOGICAL INDICATORS OF PROGNOSIS INHUMAN CANCER: AN EMERGING ROLE FORLECTIN GALACTOSIDE-BINDING Mac-2-binding is a secreted glycoprotein that binds galectins, beta-1Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3323integrins, collagens, and fibronectin, and has relevance in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion. Previousstudies have shown that elevated tissue and serum expressionlevels of LGALS3BP correlate with a poor prognosis inseveral malignancies, including breast cancer, non-small celllung cancer, prostate cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Ina search for a molecular signature of potential prognosticvalue in Ewing's sarcoma (EWS), we identified andvalidated eight genes, representative of three differentnetworks, in 56 EWS High LGALS3BP , STOML2 and c-MYC were associated reduced risk of death and lower risk ofdeveloping metastasis. On multivariate analysis, LGALS3BPwas the most important predictor of event-free and overallsurvival. The association between LGALS3BP mRNA and prognosis was confirmed at the protein level whenexpression of the molecule was determined in tumor tissues,but not in serum, indicating a role for the protein in the localtumor microenvironment. Engineered enhancement ofLGALS3BP expression in EWS cells resulted in aninhibition of cell adhesion to basal lamina and reduction ofcell migration and in vivo metastasis. Thus, we propose LGALS3BP as a novel, reliable cancer biomarker which maybe associated with prognosis. 288 INTERACTIONS BETWEEN NORMAL HUMANFIBROBLASTS AND HUMAN PROSTATE CANCER(CaP) CELLS IN A COCULTURE SYSTEM F. Iacopino , C. Angelucci, S. Stroma affects the development of many organs and plays an important role in regulating epithelial malignancies, suchas prostate cancer. Fibroblasts represent the major cell typeof the stromal compartment. With the aim of clarifying therelationships between fibroblasts and epithelial cancer cells,we utilized a coculture system including CaP cell lines bothandrogen-sensitive and -insensitive DU-145) and a human gingival fibroblast cell line (FG).Morphological aspects were analyzed under a phase contrastinverted microscope, proliferation in conditioned media(CM) was assessed by cell counts, and E-cadherin (E-cad)expression by immunocytochemistry. In the cocultures,androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells grew in a network on thetop of the monolayer formed by the FG, while colonies ofandrogen-insensitive PC-3 and DU-145 cells After LNCaP cell number wasapparently lower in the cocultures than in plates where theygrew alone. Both cell lines underwent morphologicalchanges. After six days, the growth of PC-3 and DU-145 overcame that of FG which were almost evanished. The CMof FG inhibited the of LNCaP cells, after threedays by 33% ( p<0.01) and after six days up to 82% (p<0.01), but had no effect on PC-3 and DU-145 cell growth. The CM of all three CaP lines reduced the growthof FG, being that of DU-145 cells the most effective (50%inhibition after three days, p<0.01, and 55% after six days, p<0.01). The FG did not express E-cad, while a strong staining was detected in LNCaP cells. PC-3 cells showed anuclear staining while a sporadic membrane expression ofE-cad was observed in DU-145 cells. In the cocultures, areduction in the nuclear reactivity of PC-3 cells was found.The data obtained confirm the existence of a dialoguebetween FG and CaP cells, which results in both a peculiarmodality of growth and a regulation of proliferationprobably due to growth factors secreted in the culturemedium. 289 VERIFICATION BIAS OF OCCULT CANCER INCASE-CONTROL STUDIES ON THE ASSOCIATIONOF OXIDATIVE STRESS AND PROSTATE CANCER Taro Iguchi 1,3, Ching Y . Wang1, Nicolas B. Haas1and Tatsuya Nakatani3 Department of 1Urology Syracuse, NY , USA; 3Department of Urology, Osaka City University School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan; 4Department of Urology, University of Paris, Paris, France Introduction and Objective: Epidemiological studies have correlated prostate cancer (PCa) with oxidative stress relatedgene polymorphism. carcinogenesis. superoxide dismutase(MnSOD) plays an important role in protection fromreactive oxygen species-mediated DNA damage. Recentstudies have suggested that MnSOD gene polymorphism is associated with PCa. However, some studies reportednegative association. Many case-control studies on themolecular epidemiology of PCa do not take intoconsideration that the control group may include asignificant proportion of occult PCa. In this study, weinvestigated the association of MnSOD genotypes and PCa in prostates obtained from deceased men, whose cancerstatus could be verified by complete histological evaluation.Methods: A total of 186 prostate glands from deceased men (age range 45-92 years) who had no known history ofprostate cancer were eligible for analysis. An 18-core needlebiopsy regimen and whole mount section of the prostatewere performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from thenormal portion of the prostate and MnSOD genotyping wasANTICANCER RESEARCH 3157-3556 polymorphism analysis. Results: When autopsied prostates evaluated on antigen(PSA) <4 ng/ml, negative biopsy or 15% or 12%, respectively. Theproportion of MnSOD AA genotype was significantly greater in the PCa than in non-PCa group. However, theinclusion of occult PCa in the non-PCa group reduced theodds ratio and increased the p-value. Conclusion: Because MnSOD AA genotype is associated with occult cancer, oxidative stress may result in the carcinogenesis of theprostate. However, this association may be masked instudies where the \"cancer-free\" control group contains casesof occult PCA. It is important to recognize thatcontamination of the control population by occult cancerreduces the reliability of the results. Rigorouscharacterization of the experimental and control groups isneeded in order to preserve the integrity of the conclusions. 290 IDENTIFICATION OF NOVEL GENES INVOLVED IN THE SYNERGISTICANTITUMOR EFFECT OF CAFFEINE INOSTEOSARCOMA Medical Science, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi,Kanazawa, Ishikawa 920-8641; 2Department of Pathology, Kanazawa Medical University, Japan Background: Caffeine enhances the cytocidal effects of DNA- damaging agents. This study investigated genes involved in thesynergistic effect of caffeine on osteosarcoma cells usinggene-profiling analysis. Materials and Methods: Sensitivity to cisplatin and the synergistic effect of caffeine were evaluatedin five osteosarcoma cell lines. Gene expression profilingswere analyzed using cDNA macroarray and verified by real-time RT-PCR. Results: The cell lines were grouped into three types with different cytotoxic patterns. Comparison ofprofiling data from these groups identified twelve novel genesassociated with the synergistic effect of caffeine. Real-timeRT-PCR analyses verified up-regulation of two apoptosis-enhancing genes and down-regulation of two interferon-inducible genes related to the synergy of caffeine. Conclusion: These findings provide new insights into the molecularmechanisms of the synergistic effect of caffeine inosteosarcoma, providing candidates for an assay ofresponsiveness to caffeine-potentiated chemotherapy for osteosarcoma. 291 DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW 3-D CO-CULTURE SYSTEM FOR HUMAN BREAST CANCER PROGRESSION S. Ashraf ImamMolecular Pathology Program, Huntington Medical Research Institutes, Pasadena, CA, 91101, USA Background: Patients with cancer receive therapies that tend to be directed at cancer cells, while sparing the surroundingnon-cancerous cells which are collectively called stromalcells. One of the major types of stromal cells in tumorlesions, referred to as myofibroblast or cancer-associatedfibroblast (CAF), is now recognized as a key factorinfluencing cancer progression. Moreover, it is alsorecognized that the present strategy of therapies of primarycancer are inadequate for eradication of every last viablecancer cell, hence the existence of residual viable cancer cellsthat are likely to cause treatment failure and recurrence. Yet,the CAF-derived contributing mediators of cancer progressionhave been overlooked as the potential targets for treatment ofcancer patients. The progress in this newly recognized criticalfield of tumor microenvironment has been slow, mainly dueto the technical difficulties of studying the significance ofheterotypic cellular interaction in tumor progression in thepresently available in vitro co-culture system. Methods: We recently developed a 3-dimensional microgravity co-culturesystem by overcoming the major difficulties of the presentlyavailable co-culture system. Using our newly developedsystem, breast cancer cell and breast CAF were successfullyco-cultured. The co-cultured preparation, termed breastcancer histoid (BCH), was m-thickness andimmunohistochemically (IHC) stained. Results: The sections of BCH showed invasion of the core CAF by the cancer cellswhich were positive for the expression of cytokeratins and C-erbB-2, where as the CAFs were negative. Conversely, CAFsexhibited the expression of -smooth muscle actin, whereasthe cancer cells were negative. The stroma was positive forthe expression of collagen IV . Conclusion: The system facilitated generation of BCH in a simulated tissue-likemicroenvironment, thereby allowing heterotypic interaction,invasion of CAF core by the cancer cells and their growth inthe endogeneously produced extracellular matrix. The BCHhas a potential to be used as a basis for the identification ofmolecular mediators of breast cancer progression which couldbe therapeutically targeted in not only the cancer cells butalso the stromal cells, as a new approach to therapy ofpatients with primary breast cancer.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3325292 UNMETHYLATED E-CADHERIN GENE AND OVEREXPRESSION OF E-CADHERINPROTEIN ARE ASSOCIATED WITH METASTATIC HUMAN PROSTATE CANCER CELLS IN BONE B. Saha 1, Research Insts., Pasadena, CA, 91101; 2Departments of Preventive Medicine, and 3Pathology, USC Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, USA Background: The hypermethylation of E-cadherin gene and a reduction and/or loss of E-cadherin protein expression havebeen shown to be associated with the poorly differentiatedprimary prostate cancer cells. However, the status of theirexpression remains elusive in metastatic cancer cells in bone,the most prevalent site for metastatic growth. Aim: The study was undertaken to ascertain the methylation status of E- cadherin gene, a most frequent and known epigenetic mechanism of its regulation, and E-cadherin proteinexpression in biopsy prostate tissue specimens. Methods: Themethylation status E-cadherin gene E-cadherin protein expression of E-cadherin proteinin 10 out of 11 (91%) cases, whereas the methylated gene andheterogeneous protein expression of the protein wereconcurrently detected in the remaining case. The primaryprostate cancer cells exhibited methylated gene andheterogeneous expression of the protein in 14 out of 20 (70%),where as the unmethylated gene and heterogeneous expressionof the protein was detected in 3 out of 20 (15%) of cases. Ascompared to the BPH cells, a statistically significant increasein methylation of E-cadherin gene and reduction of E-cadherin protein expression was detected in the primary prostate cancercells ( p>0.001). In contrast to the primary cancer, a significantly increased frequency of metastatic prostate cancercells in bone exhibited unmethylated E-cadherin gene and homogeneous expression of E-cadherin protein in 13 out of 15(87%) of cases, and unmethylated gene with heterogeneousexpression of the protein in the remaining 2 cases (McNemarp<0.001). Conclusion: This new observation demonstrated that the unmethylated E-cadherin gene and E-cadherin protein expression are significantly associated with distant metastaticprostate cancer cells in bone and that the high frequency of itsexpression may have a intercellular adhesion function in theformation of of metastatic cancer cells in bone.293 HPV 16-ASSOCIATED TUMOURS: IN VITRO RESPONSES OF IMMUNE MICE AND MICE CUREDWITH CHEMOTHERAPY AND SUBSEQUENT IL-12IMMUNOTHERAPY Marie Indrov\u00e1 , Jana Bieblov\u00e1, Jan Buben\u00edk and Milan Reini Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v. v. i., V\u00eddesk\u00e1 1083, Prague 4, CzechRepublic We have used an animal model for HPV16-associated tumours with distinct levels of MHC class I expression, TC-1 (MHC class I +) and TC-1/A9 (MHC class I-) to examine the immune responses and production of cytokines afterimmunotherapy with irradiated cellular vaccine producingIL-12 (TC-1-IL-12) of tumour diseaseinduced by ifosfamide derivative CBM-4A.

While the majority of genetic changes aresomatic, a minority are in germline. About 10-20% of breastcancer is thought to be due to a germline mutation in high-penetrance genes, where the major focus has been on BRCA1 and BRCA2 . Hereditary differs from sporadic breast cancer with respect to phenotype, chromosomal gains and losses,somatic mutations and expression pattern. TP53 pathways arealtered in carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, and BRCA1 carcinomas frequently carry TP53 mutations. There is strong evidence that genomic instability has a role in breastcancer pathogenesis, particularly in hereditary breast cancer,and possibly a role in sensitivity and resistance to therapy.Some germline mutations are defined as founder mutations.Founder mutations permit analysis of a large number of cases,and provide more accurate information on penetrance,expression, and genetic and environmental modifiers of risk.Population studies are also valuable due to the possibilities forevaluating clinicopathological data in a group of patients whohave the same mutation. In Iceland a rare founder mutationhas been detected in BRCA1 , and a frequent one in BRCA2. In addition to population-based studies on genetics andclinicopathology, an extensive analysis of somatic changes intumours of BRCA2 founder mutation carriers has been made. As the Icelandic carriers of BRCA mutations all have the same alteration, this can be considered an ideal model population toanalyze the influences of somatic mutations acquired duringcarcinogenesis and tumor progression and effects of low-penetrance modifier genes. This information can be useful inunderstanding the role played by these genes in the incidenceof breast cancer, in order to target genetic testing, provideindividual risk assessment, and design better therapeuticstrategies. The evidence of differences in susceptibility and inage of onset among carriers of a specific mutation makes iteasier to define the role and importance of risk-modifyingfactors, leading to improved disease management. 295 BEE VENOM-INDUCED G 0/G1PHASE ARREST AND APOPTOSIS IN HUMAN BLADDER CANCER TSGH-8301 CELLS VIA REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES AND MITOCHONDRIA-DEPENDENT PATHWAY Jing-Gung Chung2 Departments of 1Nutrition 2Biological Science Technology, China Medical University, No.91 Hsueh-ShihRoad, Taichung, Taiwan 40402, ROC Bee venom (BV) has been shown present biological activities including inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in human cancercells. However, there are no reports to address the molecular mechanisms involved in BV-induced apoptosis in humanbladder cancer TSGH-8301 cells. In this study, we showed thatBV reduced the percentage of viable TSGH-8301 cells and theIC 50is 10 g/ml in the BV-induced cell death. Flow cytometer also demonstrated that BV induced G0/G1arrest, increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+production and reduced the change in mitochondrial membrane potential(m ) in TSGH-8301 gel induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in dose-dependentmanners. It is suggested that BV inhibits the proliferation ofhuman bladder cancer TSGH-8301 cells and induced apoptosisthrough induction of ROS. Consequently, BV can be used forclinical treatment in bladder cancer patients in future. 296 EGFR AMPLIFICATIONS AND MUTATIONS IN 1Oncology, and 3Thoracic Surgery at Lund University Hospital, Sweden Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of four members of the HER family of cell surface receptors. Theseare involved in the intracellular signaling which results inaltered gene expression and stimulation of cell proliferation.EGFR is expressed or overexpressed in a wide variety of solidhuman tumors, including lung cancer of the non-small celltype (NSCLC), which constitutes eighty percent of all lungcancer. Some patients with advanced NSCLC may expression, EGFR gene copy numbers, EGFR mutation status, and alterations in molecules acting downstream of EGFR, have all been suggested to beimportant in predicting response to these drugs, but noconsensus regarding the preferred choice of predictivebiomarkers has yet been achieved. We analyzed the spectra of EGFR mutations and amplifications in 62 freshly frozen biopsies of early-stageprimary NSCLC tumors (48 adenocarcinomas and 14squamous cell carcinomas) direct sequencing of exons 18-21. Furthermore, westudied the genetic profiles of the tumors in relation to EGFRstatus by array-based comparative (qPCR 1.5) was demonstrated in 3/48 adenocarcinomas and in 4/14Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3327squamous cell carcinomas. Mutation (substitution, insertion or deletion) was found in 7 adenocarcinomas. Two of theseharbored both mutation and amplification. Seven EGFR amplifications (at a level corresponding to at least 4 genecopies) were detected by aCGH, and all of these could beconfirmed by qPCR, and vice versa . The gene copy number profiles of the EGFR -altered tumors, as revealed by aCGH, were complex and harbored frequent alterations in regionscontaining known or presumed oncogenes and tumorsuppressor University-Sofia,2 Dunav Str., 1000 Sofia; 2Institute of Str, bl. 21, 1113 Sofia; University-Sofia, 2 Dunav Str., 1000 Sofia, Bulgaria; 4Unit of Toxicology and Chemotherapy, German Cancer Research Center, 69 120 Heidelberg, Germany A detailed pharmacological evaluation of a novel ruthenium (III) coordination compound with dichloro-bis(ethyl 2-amino-4-phenyl-5-thiazolecarboxylate) ruthenium (III) chloride ( L) was carried out. The cytotoxic activity of Lwas tested using the MTT-dye reduction assay against a broad spectrum ofhuman tumor cell lines. The tested ruthenium complexexhibited significant concentration-dependent cytotoxic effectscomparable or even superior to that of cisplatin.

University of Munich, Grosshadern Campus,Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munich, Germany Most patients with colorectal, breast, lung, hepatocellular and pancreatic cancer are at risk for recurrence from metastaticdisease in the liver after potentially curative treatment. Whenthe liver harbors metastatic or primary cancer, treatmentoptions are reduced and patient survival rates rapidly decline.Unfortunately, uncontrolled liver disease is the most commonfinal pathway for nearly half of all patients with colorectalcancer and the majority of people diagnosed withhepatocellular cancer. It is a worldwide health issue and aleading cause of premature death. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3328Anticancer Treatment Moves Forward with Microspheres: Today, there is new hope in the push to eradicate cancer fromthe liver through use of cutting-edge imaging technology toassist in delivery of microscopic radioactive spheres. Thesemicrospheres go directly to the tumor site, attacking cancerouscells while sparing healthy tissue. A multimodality approach,which utilizes the skills and expertise of several specialties -including diagnostic radiology, interventional radiology,radiation oncology and nuclear medicine - enables theradiation to be safely administered directly into the livertumors. There are currently two forms of microspheres: SIR-Spheres and currently the only FDA-approved microspheres fortreatment of metastatic liver cancer. Nordion's TheraSpheresare made beads that are irradiated. Though they arenot FDA-approved, TheraSpheres have received \"humanitariandevice use\" in the United States for hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). Due to its FDA-approved status, the data presented inthis presentation predominantly refer to SIR-Spheres.Physicians are encouraged by the early and impressive resultsof microspheres therapy, and patients often cite the minimalside-effects and ease of treatment. Microspheres Background: Each SIR-Spheres microsphere is composed of resin and yttrium-90, a pure beta emitter thatonly penetrates tissues up to 11 mm. The radioactive source 90Y does not come off of the microspheres, so by restricting the spheres to the tumor, the radiation is also localizedexclusively to that area. Therefore, when microspheres are inthe tumor - where they remain permanently - they willdestroy only cancerous cells, and spare the surroundingnormal liver tissue. The infusion of microspheres is performedin the angio suite primarily by an interventional radiologistwho has experience with cheomoembolization. A key featureof delivering microspheres to the tumor is the fact that 80 to100 percent of the blood supply to metastases in the livercomes from the hepatic artery. The latest in microcatheter anddiagnostic interventional radiology C-arm technology allowsfor precise placement of radiation into small, peripheralvessels. During the procedure, the catheter is positioned in theliver with x-ray guidance by an interventional radiologist toallow for targeted infusion of the SIR-Spheres to the livertumors. Since the treatment has to be precise, the role ofimaging cannot be underestimated. The amount of radiationdelivered can be significant, but because the microspheres areonly about 32 microns in diameter, they enter the tumor fromthe hepatic artery supply and preferentially collect in theperiphery of tumor nodules. The capillary beds will only allowpassage of particles that are less than 10 microns, therebytrapping the microspheres within the tumor. Imaging Guiding during SIR-Spheres Microspheres Infusion.Imaging is critical in all phases of internal radiation therapy.The treatment process starts with establishing the location,size and volume of tumors in the liver. At the same time, there also is a search for any extrahepatic tumor deposits.Using a PET-CT System, complementary information isobtained on the location and cellular activity of tumordeposits in three dimensions. High-resolution three-phaseliver imaging is obtained with CT, followed by hepaticarterial system mapping internally with angiography. Next,the hepatic vasculature and potential release point tested with a macro-aggregated albuminscan ( 99mTcMAA), which uses the ubiquitous human serum protein albumin, processed into the same size as theradioactive microspheres, but bound to a gamma-emittingisotope for imaging instead of a beta source that is used fortherapy, which cannot be easily imaged. The albuminparticles lodge in the tumor just like the microspheres do, andthus a 'simulation' of the treatment is performed to detectdeposition of particles in the stomach, small bowel or lungsinstead of the intended target, the liver tumors. Correctivemeasures can then be taken to make microsphere deliverysafer by avoiding extrahepatic spread. Results: In this presentation, we review the results of 90Y radioembolization in patients with non-resectable, otherwisenon-responding, primary or secondary liver cancer. 300 APPLICATION OF A TRANSMISSION LOW-COHERENCE DIGITAL HOLOGRAPHICMICROSCOPE IN CANCER CELL BIOLOGY Hana Janeckova 1, Pavel Vesely2and Radim Chmelik1 1Institute of Physical Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, BUT, Technicka 2, Brno, 616 69; 2Institute of Molecular Genetics, AS CR, Flemingovo namesti 2, Prague 6, 166 37, Czech Republic Initial experiments with the transmission digital holographic microscope (DHM) proved that the system is a usableinstrument for imaging of cells, especially for monitoring offast responses of living cells to external stimuli. Here wedecided to exploit two distinguished properties of the DHMimaging in an in vitro study of cancer cell behaviour. The first application was imaging of living cells attached to a cover slip at the bottom of the imaging chamber andimmersed in an opalescent medium. To simulate theseconditions we made a standard culture medium turbid byadding of polystyrene micro spheres (with a diameter of 356nm). So we obtained a strongly scattering medium whichfilled the whole chamber and covered the cells with a 0.8 mmthick diffusing layer. The simulation showed that due to thecapability of the microscope to shorten the coherence length ofthe illumination, the DHM can offer information about thecondition of cells in situ ations where standard microscopy is failing. Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3329The second application used a computed 3D presentation of cellular activity that is deemed to be more informative aboutfast cellular reactions that involve sudden and transientchanges of the cell height and the distribution of the cell mass.Indeed in an experimental series designed to study theresistance and the type of reaction of various cancer cells toacute nutritional and energy deprivation we found this type ofvisualization advantageous (videos will be demonstrated). Weobtained similar experience with comparative imaging ofapoptosis induced by cisplatinum treatment. The assessmentof DHM imaging of cultured cells performed so far was donein stationary single-use chambers only. Employment of athrough-flow chamber (under development) is expected to beeven more instrumental. The project was supported by GACR (project no.202/08/0590), by application research programmes of theMinistry of Education of the Czech Republic (project no.MSM0021630508) and project no.

BD1373002). 301 RELEASE OF CFSE FROM NSCLC CELLSCULTURED WITH DIFFERENT TYPE OF DC\"V ACCINES\" INFLUENCE TUMOURLYSATE ON of Surgery Medical University of Lublin; 3Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland Immunotherapy is one of the most promising methods of cancer treatment. Vaccines against cancer aim to inducetumour-specific effector T-cells that can change theimmunological system and reduce tumour mass. At present,there is no standardized methodology for preparing vaccines,and many questions concerning the optimal source and typeof antigens as well as DC maturation state and activity stillneed to be answered. The aim of our study was to investigate in vitro efficiency of autologous DCs to destroy NSCLC cells, the state oflymphocyte activation and ability of lymphocytes for cytotoxicreaction in two different types of DC stimuli. After surgical resection, small tumour fragments were placed in culture dishes containing different growth factors.Seven days after operation, peripheral blood mononuclearcells (PBMCs) were cultured in RPMI-1640 mediumsupplemented with 10% autologous plasma in the presence of rhIL-4 and rhGM-CSF to generate immature autologousDCs. Mature DCs were obtained after incubation with TNF- and cytometry, confocal microscopy andfluorometry were used in the investigation. In this study, we found a significant increase in CFSE fluorescence level in supernatant from culture with tumourlysate and without tumour lysate in comparison with the puretumour cell culture ( p=0.03 and p=0.002, respectively). There supernatants fromculture without tumour antigens in comparison with tumourlysate culture. We discovered a significantly positivelycorrelation between expression of CD83 antigen on DCs andCFSE fluorescence level in culture without tumour lysate. Wealso observed a significantly negative correlation between theexpression of CD83 antigen and percentage of CD83+ cells inthe same culture. In our study, we discovered a significantly higher percentage of cells producing IFN- in only TNF- culturesin comparison with tumour cell lysate cultures (10.91\u00b16.53%versus 8.95\u00b14.86%; p=0.01). We also found a statistically significant positive correlation between percentages of CD69+lymphocytes and percentage of cells producing IFN- in onlyTNF- cultures (R=0.61; p=0.01) and (R=0.74; p=0.002) in culture with cell lysate. The present study suggests that autologous DCs stimulated solely by TNF- were fully competent and may phagocytizecancer cells. It seems possible that DCs loaded with tumourantigens become too mature and lose phagocytolytic qualities.Such a vaccine may serve as a novel immunotherapy methodin lung cancer treatment. Our research showed that matureDCs have the ability for cancer antigen presentation and couldbe able to activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes in both types ofcultures. The significantly lower percentages of CD69+lymphocytes and cells producing IFN- in cultures withtumour cell lysate confirmed the reduction (depletion) of DCfunction. This result suggests that tumour lysate may containdifferent compounds, responsible for cell inhibition. 302 ROLE OF LOW PENETRANCE GENES IN FAMILIALBREAST CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY Lilian JaraHuman Genetics Program, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Chile, Chile Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women in the world. It has been estimated that one out of every ninewomen will develop BC during their lives. Hereditary BCANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3330accounts for around 5-10% of all BC cases. Germline mutations in the two major susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2 ) account for aproximately 20% of the familial BC cases. Thus, it was possible to infer the potentialinvolvement of additional susceptibility genes that wouldaccount for low to moderate breast cancer risk. This is inaccordance with the most widely accepted model whichproposes that familial BC susceptibility is a consequence of asmall number of mutations in BRCA1/2 and a much higher proportion of mutations in ethnic-specific genes of moderateand/or low penetrance. Several studies have reported that mutations in genes involved in DNA repair and in the maintenance of genomeintegrity may be responsible in the increase of cancer risk,including RAD51, CHEK2, XRCC3 and ATM . Human RAD51 is known to function in DNA repair and interacts with a number of proteins implicated in BC, such asBRCA1/2 . Using a case-control design, we have studied the RAD51 135G>C polymorphism (c.-98G>C, rs1801320) to evaluate its possible association with BC susceptibility. Ourresults showed an association of RAD51 135C genotypes (G/C and C/C) with an increased BC risk only among women with:a) a family history of BC, b) BRCA1/2 -negative tumors and c) with age ( p=0.020, OR=2.17 [95%CI 1.11- 4.24]). allow us to propose that RAD51135G>C polymorphism increases the risk of familial BC inwomen, with age of diagnosis <50 years, and thispolymorphism may be a BC risk variant. With respect to CHEK2, we analyzed the 1100delC mutation in 1320 individuals (196 breast cancer patients, 500healthy Chilean females, and 624 healthy Chilean females butwith at least two first or second degree relatives with BC).None of the analyzed samples carried the CHEK2 1100delC mutation. This finding suggests that this mutation is not eitherpresent or is present at an extremely low frequency in Chileanfamilies with familial BC. Therefore, this variant has nopractical importance for the clinicians in our population. Wealso raise the hypothesis that the 1100delC mutation is notpresent in some of those contemporary South Americanpopulations that stem from the admixture of Amerindianpeoples with the Spanish settlers. The ATM gene has been frequently implicated in hereditary BC as a low-penetrance susceptibility gene. The ATM kinasehas an essential role in maintaining genomic integrity. Wecarried out a full mutation analysis of the ATM gene. We detected two missense variants and eight intronicpolymorphisms. We also perform a case-control studybetween a subgroup of BRCA1/2 -negative cases and controls the 5557G>A missense variant and the IVS38-8T>C andthe IVS24-9delT polymorphisms. Carriers of the IVS24-9delT/IVS38-8T>C/5557G>A composite triheterozygousgenotype showed an increase in BC risk (OR=3.09 [95%CI1.11-8.59], p=0.024). This composite genotype alone, or incombination with certain genetic background and/or environmental factors, could modify cancer risk by increasinggenetic instability or by altering the effect of the normal DNAdamage response. Our results show that genetic tests are relevant in defining individual risks for hereditary BC. Partially supported by Grants: FONDECYT 1060094; DI-UCHILE MULT MOLECULES Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its closest homologue HER2 have beenassociated with aggressive tumour progression and reducedsensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. theprogression of EGFR, wedeveloped a novel strategy termed \"combi-targeting\" design molecules capable of not only blockingEGFR tyrosine kinase but also damaging DNA. Thesemolecules, termed combi-molecules (CMs), in addition tobeing EGFR inhibitors on their own, were shown to releaseunder physiological conditions another inhibitor of EGFR,and to be potent against EGFR-expressing tumour cells ofvarious origins. These include breast, prostate carcinoma ofthe vulva and brain tumour cells. However, despite theirbinary targeting mechanism, their growth inhibitory IC 50 values were still in the high micromolar range. In order toaugment the potency of the CMs, we re-designed them to notonly release a quinazoline inhibitor of EGFR, but also bi-functional alkylating moieties prone to induce DNA cross-links. More importantly, molecules termed \"double-armedcombi-molecules\" were further designed to contain twoquinazoline moieties and a central N,N-bis(2- aminoethyl)methylamine spacer which, followingdegradation, yielded higher concentrations of free bifunctional DNA damaging species. Thesemolecules ( e.g. ZRBA4, JDE52) were proven to be more effective than their predecessors and correspondingcombinations of classical alkylators+inhibitors of EGFR. Inthis presentation, the potency of such type of novel combi-molecules against EGFR-overexpressing human tumour cellsand their interactions with EGFR-mediated cell signaling willbe analyzed. Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3331304 ALTERATION OF HEPATIC STELLATE CELLS INASCORBIC ACID Veterinary Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu City 702-701; 2Jinju Bio Food, Jinju City 660-931, Republic of Korea Aging is an extremely complex, multifactorial process and represents the gradual deterioration in function that occurs aftermaturity and leads to disability or death. The examination ofaging in vital organs including the liver is important forunderstanding the aging processes. However, the mechanismof age-dependent change in vital organ is still unclear.Therefore, age-dependent changes of the liver were examinedusing Senescene marker protein-30 knockout (SMP30 -/-) mice as an aging model. SMP30 has been reported as decreasingwith age and functioning as gluconolactonases in L-ascorbicacid synthesis. SMP30 -/-mice were more sensitive to apoptotic reagents and shorter in life span than normal mice. Inmicroscopic findings of the liver from aged SMP30 -/-mice without an ascorbic acid (AA) feeding for 16 weeks, there wasan increased amount of both lipid droplets and glycogen inhepatocytes, than in those fed AA and hepatic stellate cells(HSCs) were hypertrophic with lipid droplets which indicateda hypervitaminosis A condition. Moreover, the level ofperoxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPAR)increased in the liver. Surprisingly, HSC hypertrophy of agedmice was decreased after treatment with ENA Actimineral A(ENA), which is alkaline bioactive water and has antioxidantfunction, as compared to non-treatment group. In conclusion,we propose that AA deficiency in aged SMP30 -/-mice accelerate the hypertrophy of HSCs with vitamin Aaccumulation as well as the accumulation of lipid and glycogenin hepatocytes, and increase the expression of PPAR. 305 EFFECT OF ANGIOTENSIN TYPE 1 RECEPTORBLOCKADE ON SKELETAL MUSCLE INJURY BYTGF-BETA Veterinary Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu City 702-701, Republic of Korea; 2McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine,Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 733 N Broadway, Baltimore, Maryland 21205,USA; 3School of Medicine Kyungpook National University, Daegu City, Republic of Korea Several therapeutic agents have been shown to inhibit fibrosis and improve regeneration after injury in skeletal muscle byantagonizing transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF- 1). Angiotensin receptor blockers have been shown to have asimilar antagonizing effect on TGF- 1in a variety of tissues. In this study we evaluated the effect of Losartan, angiotensin type 1 receptor blockade, on skeletal muscle injury viaelevated TGF- 1produced by CCl4induced liver injury. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups:control, CCl 4-treatment group (CT) and CCl4-treatment group with (CTL). 10% CCl4in olive oil were injected intraperitoneally three times a week with or withoutlosartan (10 mg/kg) in drinking water. At 16 weeks, all micewere sacrificed and analyzed through the biochemistry,histopathology, immunohistochemistry the CT and their level significantly decreasedin the losartan treated group. On immunohistochemistry andimmunoblot (1216.3\u00b1105.5) group compared with CTL (547.3\u00b152.5)group. Pax7, transcription factor of quiescent satellite cell wasincreased in CTL (0.63\u00b10.03) group compared with CT(0.47\u00b10.02) group. Myogenic regulatory factors includingMyoD and Myogenin also showed the same results with pax7.In conclusion we suggest the skeletal muscle myogenesis wasimpaired by producing TGF- 1from CCl4-induced liver injury and, 1 receptor blockade (Losartan) hasprotective effect on TGF- 1-induced skeletal muscle injury via the stimulation of muscle regeneration, indicating potentialtherapeutic effects in myopathies. 306 ENA-ACTIMINERAL A LIFE-SPAN Veterinary Medicine, 2Department of Home Economics Education, Kyungpook National University, Daegu City 702-701; 3Jinju Bio Food, Jinju 660-931, Republic 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3332ENA-Actimineral A (ENA), alkaline mineral water which composed of refined edible cuttlefish ( Sepia esculenta ) and two phymatolithon calcareum and Lithothamnion corallioides , was previously reported to restore bone loss and bone quality inovariectomized rats. To investigate the anti-oxidant effect ofENA, an experiment was performed with Senescence markerprotein-30 knockout (SMP30 KO) mice as an aging model.SMP30 was known to maintain calcium homeostasis and up-regulate synthesis of vitamin C as an antioxidant in previousstudies, therefore, SMP30 KO mice can be regarded as a goodaging model. Present studies were composed of 18 week-oldmice groups (n=24), 26 week-old mice groups (n=12) and 46week-old mice groups (n=20). Each differently aged micegroup was divided into three groups again: control group,5%ENA and 10% ENA treated group. All groups of 18 week-old mice were treated with vitamin C 1.5g/L drinking water.The experiments were performed for 18 weeks. In theexamination of life span, all vitamin C treated groups revealed100% of survival rate. However, in non-vitamin C treatedgroups, only 10% ENA treated groups showed 100% ofsurvival rate, as apposed to control group and 5% ENA treatedgroups, indicating 0% of survival rate. In vitamin C treatedgroups, the concentration of vitamin C in serum was dose-dependently. In proteinexpression, the expression level of Cu, Zn-SOD was increasedby ENA dose-dependently. These data strongly suggested thatintake of ENA plays a critical role in the anti-agingmechanism and it can act as a powerful anti-oxidant agent. 307 NEUTRALIZING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CYTOTOXIC DRUGS H. Helmholtz polychemotherapy protocols, cytotoxic drugs are applied in combinations in order to overcome drug resistanceand to enhance treatment efficiency. For this purpose,anthracyclines are frequently given on the same day as vinca-alkaloids, e.g.during induction therapy of acute lymphatic leukemia treatment. Here we found that anthracyclines inhibited the antitumor activity of vinca-alkaloids both on tumor cell lines as well ason primary tumor cells of children with acute lymphaticleukemia. The inhibitory function of anthracyclines stronglydepended on the activation of defined intracellular signalingsteps and inhibited mitochondrial depolarization and activation Of great clinical importance,the anthracycline-induced inhibition of vinca-alkaloid-mediated tumor cell death was absent if both drugs were givenat certain intervals. Our data show for the first time that cytotoxic drugs exert adverse, antiapoptotic effects on tumor cells which might beavoided in future polychemotherapy protocols using favorableapplication schedules. 308 PHASE III RANDOMIZED STUDY COMPARING ORAL PILOCARPINE VS. SUBMANDIBULAR SALIV ARY GLAND TRANSFER PROTOCOL FOR INDUCED XEROSTOMIA Naresh Jha , Hadi Sultanum, Michael Hier, Sunita Ghosh, Martin Black, James Butler, Donna Sutherland, Paul Kerr and Pam Barnaby Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada Objective and Methods: We report results (median follow up 21 months) of a prospective phase III multicenter study comparingPilocarpine with submandibular salivary gland transferprocedure for management of radiation xerostomia.Eligibility criteria included squamous cell carcinoma of Larynx,Hypopharynx, Oropharynx and unknown primaries with necknodes. Patients with carcinoma of the Nasopharynx, Oral cavity,N3 disease, bilateral neck nodes, level 1 nodes or pre-epiglotticinvolvement were ineligible. Treatment strategies included eithersurgery as prime modality of treatment followed bychemoradiation treatment or Chemoradiation treatment as primemodality with or without planned neck dissection. Patients inPilocarpine arm received Pilocarpine 5 mg. three times a dayfor 3 months. Salivary functions were evaluated by measuringsalivary flows (baseline and stimulated) and quality of life usingUniv. of Washington Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire,preoperatively, 1,3, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment.Primary end point was the salivary functions (amount andconsistency of saliva) at 6 months follow up. Results: This study was closed as per stopping rules, at interim analysis as the intentto treat analysis of all patients had shown significantly superiorresults in the gland transfer arm. The median follow up of thesepatients now is 21 months and results at 16 months follow upare presented. Significantly superior results are noted in thegland transfer arm as compared to Pilocarpine arm: for themedian baseline and stimulated salivary flow, p=0.021 and 0.004, respectively, and for patients reporting none or minimalxerostomia [ score 10 or 20 as per VII A (amount of saliva) ofUniv. of Washington QOL, p=0.005 and for consistency ofAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3333saliva, p=0.008. Conclusion: Salivary gland transfer remains superior to Pilocarpine in the management of radiation inducedxerostomia. 309 GENETIC ASPECT OF GLIOBLASTOMAMULTIFORME: INVOLVEMENT OF mTORCOMPLEXES Michael A Karsy, Nicholas Gulati, Raj Murali Meena New York 10595, USA Human malignant glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) develops as the result of multiple stepwise genetic alterations, arisingeither de novo (primary GBM) or progressing from low- grade astrocytoma (secondary GBM). The genetic nature ofGBM echoes the clinical dichotomy that exists betweenprimary and secondary GBM. Mutation and/or deletion ofthe tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologdeleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is one of the mostcommon genetic alterations in GBM, with an estimatedfrequency of 70-90%. This suggests that thePTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays a critical role inoncogenesis. Furthermore, PTEN loss increases the pool ofself-renewing neural stem cells and induces loss ofhomeostatic control of proliferation, which is reminiscent ofthe cell-cycle dysregulation that occurs duringgliomagenesis. Activation of the oncogene AKT due toPTEN loss stimulates the downstream kinase mammaliantarget of Rapamycin (mTOR), which has been shown to playa crucial role in cell survival, growth, and motility throughtwo candidates for the treatment of GBM. However,GBM still remains incurable. We hypothesize that thecontributions of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 result inuncontrolled GBM growth and dissemination and thereforeprovide a molecular understanding of GBM. The interplayof mTORC1 and mTORC2 was studied in Immunohistochemical analysisdemonstrated activated AKT (pAKT Ser473) expression in 85% of human tumor samples. GBM cells were treated with eitherRAPA or PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (LY) in the PTEN/PI3K pathway, as well as STAT3 andERK1/2, proteins parallel to the PTEN/PI3K pathway, wereassessed RAPA treatment resulted insustained suppression of pS6K substrate) through a 24h period. Treatment with RAPA noticeablyreduced activation of AKT Ser473 (mTORC2 substrate) by 61% and 72% at 1 and 3 h, respectively, followed by enhancedactivation up to 24 h. This finding suggests a shift betweenmTORC1 and mTORC2 following RAPA treatment. Pre-treatment with diminished PDGF or FNstimulation of p70S6K Thr389. A combined treatment with RAPA and LY completely blocked the activation of S6K.Activation of STAT3 by PDGF or FN was totally RAPA and LY . Silencing ofRictor, a mTOR partner, inhibited activation of pAKT, adownstream component of mTORC2. While both motilityand proliferation were found to be decreased at early timepoints (1-3 h) following RAPA treatment, later time points(6-24 h) showed enhanced motility and proliferation. Bothcellular motility, as assessed by radial monolayer migration,and cellular proliferation, as analyzed by MTT assay,exhibited that the changes in cellular dynamics reflected anenhanced mTORC2 pathway. Treatment with RAPA causedan initial decrease in mTORC1 activity but then shifted toenhanced mTORC2 activity inducing AKT signaling. Thus,deciphering these molecular pathways would provide betterunderstanding of gliomagenesis. 310 MOLECULAR IMAGING University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA; 2Molecular Biology Program, University of Missouri- Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA; 3Department of Chemistry, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA; 4Department of Biochemistry, University of Missouri- Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA; 5Radiopharmaceutical Sciences Institute, Research Service, Harry S Truman Memorial Veterans' Hospital, Columbia,MO, 65201, USA Objective: The investigated for bcl-2- positive and -negative cell lines and xenografts. The human small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) cell lines Mec-1 and Ramos somatostatin receptor subtype 2 nucleic 3334bcl-2 mRNA expression ratio was determined by RT-PCR to be 3821:1. The cell lines were used in cell efflux studies, andthe corresponding xenografts were used for in vivo distribution and imaging studies in SCID mice. DOTA-anti- bcl-2 Tyr bcl-2 - PNA-Ts14-Tyr3-octreotate was labeled with 64Cu (2) for in vivo studies because micro-PET with this agent gave superiorimaging quality. Results: The cell associated radioactivity of conjugate 1was 15% in Ramos cells, as compared with 60% in Mec-1 cells at 4 h of incubation. Biodistributions showed a0.2% ID/g tumor uptake mice and 1.3% ID/g in Mec-1 mice at 48 h post-injection. The conjugate2in Ramos mice showed a 0.7% ID/g tumor uptake and 1.1% ID/g in Mec-1 conjugates could but not cells suggested bcl- 2 mRNA imaging studies for xenografts. 311 YKL-40: A POTENTIAL NEW BIOMARKER IN CANCER PATIENTS Julia S. JohansenHerlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark YKL-40 chitinaseactivity and mammalian chitinase-like proteins.Its gene is known (1q32.1, 7948 base pairs, 10 exons), butYKL-40 gene mutations and polymorphisms in cancer patients are not described. High YKL-40 mRNA and proteinexpressions are found in embryonic stem cells, embryonic andfetal cells, in macrophages, leucocytes and cells in areaswith inflammation, in tumour-associated macrophages, and byseveral types of cancer cells including adenocarcinoma,squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and glioblastoma. Insome, but not all, types of cancer, YKL-40 protein expressionin cancer cells is a biomarker of genetic and histologicalsubtype, therapeutic response, and prognosis. Few studies have evaluated the function of YKL-40 in cancer. It may have a role in proliferation, differentiation,metastatic potential, angiogenesis and response to hypoxia,and protection against apoptosis. YKL-40 may also play a rolein the inflammatory response and extracellular tissueremodelling with development of fibrosis in the areasurrounding the cancer cells. Receptors mediating its effectsare unknown. YKL-40 is regulated by TNF sustained activation of NF-kappaB, initiates MAPkinase and signalling cascades, leading to AKT-mediated signalling cascades. Up-regulated YKL-40expression is found in glioblastoma cells following stress stimuli, e.g.hypoxia, ionizing radiation and chemotherapy. YKL-40 is elevated ( i.e.above the age-adjusted 95th percentile of healthy individuals) and is related to tumour stagein some patients with different types of primary or metastaticsolid cancer (breast, cervical, endometrial, glioblastoma, headand neck, kidney, small and non-small cell lung, melanoma,ovarian, pancreatic, prostate), and in patients with acutemyeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, and Hodgkin lymphoma.Highest plasma YKL-40 is found in patients with metastaticcancer, the shortest recurrence- or progression-free interval, andthe shortest overall survival. YKL-40 is neither organ- nortumour-specific, but plasma YKL-40 may be useful as aprognosticator of survival, and a predictor of treatmentresponse. High plasma YKL-40 is an independent prognosticbiomarker of short survival in patients with local or metastaticcancer, at time of first cancer diagnosis and at relapse, and isindependent of other therapy in patients with firstrecurrence of breast cancer; and 2) second-linechemoresistance in ovarian cancer patients. Some studiessuggest that plasma YKL-40 may be useful for monitoringcancer recurrence or progression after treatment. In the generalpopulation without known cancer, high plasma YKL-40predicts a 3.4-fold increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer. Inpatients referred to endoscopy due to symptoms or other riskfactors for colorectal cancer, plasma YKL-40 independentlypredicts colorectal cancer. This suggests a value for plasmaYKL-40 in screening. Since YKL-40 is not specific for cancer, it is important to consider co-morbidity and repeated measurements whenevaluating plasma YKL-40 as a biomarker for cancer, and anormal plasma YKL-40 cannot rule out cancer. Plasma YKL-40 may have a place as a biomarker in patients with cancerand provides new information compared to rutinely usedbiomarkers, but more studies are needed. However, YKL-40is probably more than a biomarker. A major issue to explore isthe question if YKL-40 could become a target for thedevelopment of new cancer therapeutics. 312 CONNECTIONS BETWEEN G-QUADRUPLEXES,THE WERNER BLOOM SYNDROMES, Li-San of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, 2Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Program, 3Genomics and Computational Biology Graduate Program, 4Vagelos Scholar Program, 5Institute on Aging, Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 33356Penn Center For Bioinformatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA G-quadruplex DNA (G4-DNA) is a family of structures composed of stacked G-quartets, which themselves comprisefour Hoogsteen-bonded guanines in a planar array. They havebeen shown to form in vivo at telomeres in at least one organism, S. lamnae . Several RecQ DNA helicases, including the human WRN and BLM proteins and S. cerevisiae Sgs1, are particularly in unwinding G4-DNA in vitro . WRN and BLM are deficient in the Werner and Bloom syndromes,respectively, which are characterized by elevated rates ofcancer and premature features of aging. The demonstrated rolesfor RecQ helicases in telomere maintenance has led to thehypothesis that these roles might be explained by the resolutionof telomeric G4-DNA by the helicases. New experimentalfindings will be presented that support this idea directly. Outside of telomeres, sequences with intramolecular G- quadruplex forming potential (QFP) are concentrated in thepromoter regions of organisms ranging from bacteria tohumans, raising the possibility that they play roles intranscriptional regulation. Recently we reported highlysignificant correlations in S. cerevisiae between genes having QFP and those with altered expression in cells lacking Sgs1 ortreated with a selective G4-DNA small molecule ligand (NMM), thus supporting directrole for G4-DNA in transcriptional regulation. We have nowextended these findings to human cells, including analyses ofaltered gene expression in cells from individuals with Werneror Bloom syndrome, or in cells treated with NMM or anotherG4-DNA ligand, BRACO19. Similar to our findings in yeast,there are significant correlations between loci possessing QFPand those showing altered regulation under these conditions,each of which is predicted to alter G4-DNA levels or functions. We wondered if there might be connections between G4- DNA at telomeres and that involved in transcriptionalregulation. Cellular senescence can be induced by telomereshortening and dysfunction in both S. cerevisiae mutants lacking telomerase and human cultured cells. We have found,in both yeast and human cells, that there are highly significantcorrelations between genes that are upregulated at senescencecaused by telomere shortening and genes with QFP. Theseassociations are apparently not explained by the binding ofknown transcription factors. We therefore propose that 1) thereis competition between G4-DNA at telomeres and promotersfor transcriptional regulators that bind G4-DNA and 2) alteredG4-DNA levels at the telomeres of senescent cells perturbsthis competition, thus providing a novel mechanism for theregulation of gene expression in senescent cells. Given the connections between cell senescence, telomere function, and RecQ helicases in cancer and age-relateddiseases, it may be possible to use manipulation of G4-DNAas a tool to impact these disorders. 313 IMMUNOMODULATORY CAPACITY CHEMOKINE Innrain 66, A 6020 Innsbruck; 2Institute of Pathology at the Private Medical University Hospital Salzburg, M\u00fcllner Hauptstrasse 48, A 5020Salzburg; 33rd Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and InfectiousDisease at the University Salzburg,M\u00fcllner Hauptstrasse 48, A 5020 Salzburg, Austria Multiple myeloma is still incurable using conventional chemotherapy and considerable efforts are undertaken toestablish new immunotherapeutic strategies to target this B-cell neoplasm. Chemokines have currently been shown to bemajor players in shaping the tumor microenvironment and tocontribute to immune escape of the malignant cells. In order to reveal important actors of the chemokine network in multiple myeloma we analyzed the chemokineprofile of myeloma cell lines. We found CCL27, which hasso far only been correlated with skin diseases such as atopicdermatitis, consistently upregulated in all cell linesinvestigated. In bone marrow supernatants of tumor patientsCCL27 expression correlated with the severity of disease.Additionally, immuno-histochemical analysis of patient bonemarrow showed that CCL27 is expressed by the malignantcells and also highly expressed (or presented) by human bonemarrow endothelial cells, the main barrier of the favouritemyeloma microenvironment, the bone marrow. We furtherinvestigated the impact of CCL27 on immune cells such asT-cells and dendritic cells. Dendritic cells differentiated andmatured in the presence of CCL27 exhibited a reducedcapacity to activate T-cells in allogeneic mixed leukocytereactions. On T-cell side, in this setting, proliferation as wellas cytokine production was impaired. Treated dendritic cellsshowed normal expression of costimulatory molecules butimpaired spontaneous migration as well as cytokineproduction which might explain the impaired T-cell function.In coculture experiments with myeloma cell lines, however,these dendritic cells induced enhanced growth of themalignant plasma cells. Since dendritic cells in our hands didnot express relevant amounts of the cognate receptor forCCL27, i.e.CCR10, we postulate that the ligand is bound by glycosaminoglycans or by a so far unknown receptor. Bindingstudies are currently underway. In summary, we found that the myeloma-derived chemokine CCL27 can modulate dendritic cells resulting in impairedactivation of T-cells and enhanced tumor cell growth thusANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3336contributing to worse prognosis. Targeting CCL27 therefore could constitute an essential additional component in myelomatherapy. 314 BIRTH ORDER EFFECT IN THE (CLL) Viggo J\u00f8nssonDepartment of Hematology, Aker University Hospital, University of Oslo, NO 0514 Oslo, Norway Birth order effect denotes a rank order of affected offspring in a sibship. In CLL, a birth order effect in affected parent-offspring pairs can reflect epigenetic factors in diseasesusceptibility. Thirty-two families CLL and otherlymphoproliferative wereidentified. By means of Haldane Smiths's test and Coxregression it is shown that a paternal-offspring, but not amaternal-offspring birth rank order exists: In matrilinealtransmission, affected offspring occur randomly in the sibshipwhile in patrilineal transmission, mainly sons late in thesibship are affected. Cox regression analysis provided relativerisks (RR) for paternal and maternal transmission of p=0.0005) and 1.64 (95% CI: 0.90-3.01; p=0.096), The significance of paternal and maternal transmission in CLL-CLL pairs employing Haldaneand Smith's test were 0.006 and 0.63 respectively. There wasno evidence of a relationship between parental age and birthorder. Most likely, the birth order effect is a non-Mendeliansegregation of the CLL monoallelic poly-susceptibility genesbased on parental imprinting and pregnancy relatedmicrochimerism, where different combinations of themonoallelic polygenes code for the subtypes oflymphoproliferative disease, such and chroniclymphocytic leukemias and myeloma .CLL The impact on time to treat and intention to treat is discussed. 315 HUMAN CANCER AND GENE MUTATIONS IN O-GLYCOSYLATION PATHWAY Tongzhong Hanigan5,6and Richard D. Cummings1 1Department of Biochemistry, Emory University School Medicine, Atlanta, GA30322; 2Department of OB/GYN, 3Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 4Department of Pathology, 5Department of Cell Biology, 6Cancer Institute, The University ofOklahoma Health Sciences Center, 7Oklahoma School of Sciences and Mathematics, Oklahoma City, OK73104, USA 60~70%of human carcinomas, including breast, colon, cervical,ovarian, and pancreatic cancer. Normally, Tn antigen ismodified by 3GalT (T-synthase), a key enzyme inmucin type O-glycosylation, to form the Core 1 structure,also called T-antigen. The T-antigen can be further elongatedto form complex O-glycans on many cell membraneglycoproteins and secreted glycoproteins. Recently, we haveidentified that re 1 3GalT-s pecific m olecular chaperone, is required for active T-synthase is located on Xq24 and encodes an ER-localized type-IImembrane protein that prevents aggregation/proteasomaldegradation of T-synthase. Although it has been reported thatTn and STn antigen expression in human tumors areassociated with poor prognoses, the genetic basis for theirexpression in human tumors, as well as the benefit for tumorcells expressing Tn/STn antigens are not known. We havenow found that all tumor cell lines expressing the Tn and STnantigens have acquired mutations in Cosmc . The mutations are nucleotide deletions or insertions in the coding region, ordeletions in the promoter sequence. In all cases, the mutationsin the Cosmc gene result in loss-of-function for Cosmc as a chaperone and lead to aggregation and enhanced degradationof the T-synthase. Expression of wild-type Cosmc restores theT-synthase activity and cells lose expression of both the Tnand STn antigens. In addition, human cervical cancerspecimens that showed expression of the Tn/STn antigenswere also found to have mutations in Cosmc and loss-of- heterozygosity for the X-linked Cosmc locus. Importantly, tumor cells with mutated Cosmc sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis than wild-type Cosmc transfectedcells. This is the first example of somatic mutations inmultiple types of cancers that cause global alterations in cellsurface carbohydrate antigen expression. Additionally, this isthe first evidence of an advantage for tumor cells expressingTn antigen on the surface. The understanding of the geneticbasis of the unusual expression of Tn and STn antigens inhuman tumors will shed new light on the development of newdiagnostic, prognostic, and potentially therapeutic methods. 316 COMPLEX MECHANISMS Uppsala University, Box 595, SE-751 24 Uppsala, SwedenAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3337Extracellular signal regulated kinases (Erks) represent a signalling hub in many physiological responses and have criticalfunctions in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival andapoptosis. The physiological outcome of Erk signalling dependson both the magnitude and duration of kinase activation whichare tightly controlled by many factors like the association of Erkwith scaffolding proteins, cross-talk with other signallingpathways and negative regulators such as protein phosphatases.In this study we investigated the mechanisms regulating theErk1/2 activation downstream of platelet-derived growth factorreceptor and . Particularly, we were interested in involvement of MAP kinase phosphatases, SHP2, PLC, Srcand PI3K in the regulation Erk phosphorylation pattern.We found that MAP kinase phosphatase 3 is an importantregulator of the PDGF-induced Erk activation acting in both arapid positive feed-forward and a later negative feed-back loop.In addition, our results suggest an implication of SHP2 and Srcin the modulation of the strength of Erk phosphorylation. As theErk signalling pathway is up-regulated in many cancer cells,understanding of the complex mechanism of its regulation is ofkey importance for therapeutic approaches. 317 ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY University, 8-1 Mihogaoka, Ibaraki, Osaka, 567-0047; 2Institute for Frontier 53 Kawahara-Cho Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507,Japan (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate(EGCG), a major green tea catechin component, has been reported to possess antitumoractivity. We developed a method to increase chemical stabilityand cell membrane affinity of EGCG using lipase-catalyzedtrans-esterification. EGCG-fatty acid monoesters showedmarked inhibition of important group of anticancer drugs is represented by methylating and chloroethylating agents that are being used infirst-line therapy of gliomas and malignant melanomas. Theseagents induce a dozen DNA lesions, some of them have beenidentified to be carcinogenic, genotoxic and cytotoxic. In cellslacking the enzyme 6- methylguanine (O6MeG) and (O6ChlG) are the major triggers of genotoxicity and apoptosis. In thecase of O 6MeG lesions, this requires MSH2/MSH6-dependent mismatch repair. O6MeG triggered cell death is regulated in a cell type specific manner, utilizing both the mitochondrial andthe death receptor pathway. O 6MeG triggered apoptosis is by DNA double-strand break phosphorylation receptorpathway activated. cells, ahallmark of O 6MeG triggered apoptosis is decline of Bcl-2, which is followed by caspase-9, -7 and -3 activation. Theefficiency of O 6MeG in triggering the p53-dependent (Fas) pathway is much higher than the p53-independent endogenousmitochondrial pathway, which explains why p53-wt gliomacells to TMZ than p53-mutated glioma cells are more resistant cells to chloroethylating agents, such as BCNUand ACNU, indicating p53 protects against O 6ChlG-induced apoptosis and necrosis, very likely by up-regulation of repairgenes (notably ddb2 ). O 6MeG and O6ClG are also able to induce apoptosis in malignant melanoma cells, which isaccompanied by the formation of DSBs. Cells defective inXRCC2 or BRCA-2 are hypersensitive to O 6MeG-triggered cell death and chromosomal aberrations while DNA-PKCSmutated cells display only slightly enhanced sensitivity. Thedata supports a role for DSBs as most critical downstreamapoptotic lesions and DSB repair by homologousrecombination as a potential predictor of cellular resistance tomonofunctional alkylating drugs.

J\u00fcrgenliemk-Schulz Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, theNetherlands Purpose: To demonstrate radiation dose-response relationships for cataract induction and late renal dysfunction followingANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3338total body irradiation (TBI) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with haematologicalmalignancies, and for recurrence of keloid and pterygium aftersurgery followed by radiotherapy. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review using Pubmed was performed of articlesreporting dose-response relationships for cataract inductionand late renal dysfunction following TBI and recurrence ofkeloid and pterygium postoperatively following biologically doses (BEDs)were calculated. Results: relationship after TBI and HSCT for acute leukaemia wasfound. A threshold BED of about 45 Gy was indicated. Forlate renal toxicity after TBI and HSCT, the threshold BED isabout 16 Gy. For recurrence after keloidectomyfollowed by radiotherapy either with teletherapy orbrachytherapy, the recurrence rate following a BED >30 Gywas less than 10%. For pterygium recurrence following baresclera surgery and 90Sr beta irradiation, a BED of about 30-40 Gy seems to be sufficient to reduce the recurrence rate to lessthan 10%. Conclusion: Dose-response relationships were identified for cataract induction and late renal toxicity afterTBI, as well as for keloid and pterygium recurrence aftersurgery and radiotherapy. To prevent eyeshielding should be applied for single-dose andhypofractionated TBI. For almost all TBI schemes in use,kidney shielding should be applied. Most radiotherapyschemes used for keloid recurrence prevention after surgeryare not sufficient. A minimal dose with a BED of 30 Gyshould be applied. In contrary, the doses applied in mostregimens to prevent pterygium recurrence are too high. Ascheme with a BED of 30-40 Gy seems to be sufficient. 320 MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF CALCIUM-MEDIATED ANTIMITOGENIC ACTIONS IN COLONCANCER CELLS Enik\u00f6 KallayDepartment for Physiology, Pathophysiology, and Immunology, Medical University ofVienna, Austria Epidemiological, experimental, and animal studies indicate that theoretically, at least 50% of sporadic colorectal cancercould be prevented by modifications in diet. Primaryprevention of cancer is, therefore, rational, timely andimportant, and should be a major priority and responsibilityfor international agencies, governments, industry, non-governmental organizations, medical and health authorities. Inspite of the already significant amount of evidence there is stillreluctance to accept that diet has a fundamental role in colontumourigenesis, due to poor understanding of the mechanismsthat regulate this process. Analysis of gene expression profiles provides important insights into how diets may alter metabolicprofiles and regulatory pathways that influence probability oftumour formation in the normal intestinal mucosa. Evidenceis accumulating for a prophylactic effect of calcium incolorectal cancer development. It has been show that a dietrich in calcium reduces crypt cell hyperproliferation both inhuman and animal studies. Calcium-mediated signaltransduction may play a central role in hyperproliferation,transformation, invasion and metastasis. Effect of extracellularcalcium could involve signal transduction through guaninenucleotide binding proteins, such as the calcium-sensingreceptor (CaR). Analysing the effect of extracellular calcium on colon cancer cell lines showed that calcium had a significant effecton genes implied in several different functional categories:Genes involved in cell cycle regulation and nucleic acidsynthesis were down-regulated by calcium treatment,consistent with the parallel induction of cell cycle arrest.Coordinate down-regulation of genes involved in RNAprocessing, translation, and protein degradation were alsoevident. Conversely, genes involved in xenobiotic and drugdetoxification, were up-regulated by calcium. The earliestchanges due to calcium treatment involved tight junctions,focal adhesion, adherens junctions, with some of theparameters being up- others down-regulated. A series ofknown CaR signalling functions and pathways have beenaffected by calcium treatment, amongst them expression ofgenes coding for G alpha q, PLC, PLA 2. Our data is further proof for the antiproliferative effect of calcium in colonocytes, suggesting that the CaR has a majorrole in colon tumourigenesis.This study was supported by a Marie Curie Inter-EuropeanFellowship. 321 HOW DO TUMOR CELLS of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland Interactions between tumor-infiltrating leukocytes and tumor cells have been of great interest due to the possibility thatimmune cells either interfere with tumor progression oractively promote tumor growth. Microglia (brainmacrophages) are multifunctional, innate immunity cellsexecuting protective functions under physiologicalconditions. Intracellular inflammatory signaling pathwaysAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3339include NF B and MAP kinases, as critical signal transducers. On the other hand, the most invasive anddangerous brain tumors, malignant gliomas, recruitnumerous microglia to the tumor site. Molecularmechanisms underlying accumulation and activation oftumor-associated microglia are unknown. We demonstratedthat soluble factors released by cells convert brainmacrophages (microglia) amoeboid/phagocytic cellswhich , BRAIN 2007; Wesolowska et al. , Oncogene 2007). To identify those factors, we employed a proteomic approach and mass-spectrometry in search for fractions of glioma-conditionedmedium (G-CM) able to induce morphologicaltransformation of microglia. We identified osteopontin andlactadherin, two proteins sharing the RGD motif and integrins. Interference pathways and global geneexpression, we demonstrated that glioma-derived factorsinduce an alternative, non-immune activation of microglia.While lipopolysaccharide-induced andmetalloproteinases and computational analysisrevealed that the most discriminative feature was a lack ofinterferon-responsive genes in glioma-exposed microgliathat may explain a lack of effective antitumor immuneresponse. Our findings suggest that gliomas attract brainmacrophages and employ specific signals, to transform theminto tumor-supportive cells, We show for the first timemolecular signals and mechanisms responsible for \"re-education\" of tumour-associated microglia into tumoursupportive cells.This work was supported by grant S004/P-N/2007/01 from theMinistry of Science and Higher Education (Poland). 322 DOWN-REGULATION OF PLAKOGLOBIN IN SOFT TISSUE SARCOMA IS ASSOCIATED WITH AHIGHER RISK Science, Kanazawa University, 13-1, Takara-machi,Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8641; 2Department of Uchinada-machi, Kahoku-gun, Ishikawa 920-0293, Japan Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) behave with aggressiveness and metastatic potential, which can vary depending on theirlocations. There has been little information on the exactmolecular mechanisms involved in their biologicalaggressiveness. To identify genes involved in the differences,the gene expression profiles were compared between STS-orthotopic and heterotopic implanted models, and theirsignificance in human STS was verified. Human fibrosarcomaHT1080 cells were implanted either in the quadriceps femorismuscles or footpads of nude mice, and the gene expressionprofiles of the tumors were compared by cDNA arrays. ThemRNA and protein levels of the identified genes wereexamined by both real-time RT-PCR andimmunohistochemistry, not only in the tumors of the models,but also in clinical STS. The implanted HT1080 cellsdemonstrated different growth and metastatic potentialsdepending on their implant locations. cDNA array analysesshowed reduced expression of the plakoglobin gene in the intramuscle-implanted which tumor cellsimplanted in the footpads, but not those in the muscle. Real-time RT-PCR assays of clinical STS showed that the meanplakoglobin/G3PDH ratio in primary sarcoma tissues with pulmonary metastases (0.92) was significantly lower than inthose without metastasis (6.58) ( p<0.0001), and that STS cases with high plakoglobin gene expression had an excellent prognosis. These results suggest that plakoglobin gene expression level might be useful as a new biomarker formetastasis and prognosis of human STS. 323 MOLECULAR TARGETS IN BREAST CANCERTHERAPY: A DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH Nikiforos KapranosDepartment of Molecular Pathology, General, Maternity and Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece Targeted therapy is a rapidly evolving field in breast cancer treatment. The most important therapeutic target is the ErbBfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases, especially ErbB2 which widely monoclonal antibodytrastuzumab. Although trastuzumab is successfully used inmetastatic or adjuvant clinical settings, the accurate moleculartesting of ErbB2 is still a major problem in the pathologylaboratory. ErbB2 protein detection by immunohistochemistryis subjective and technically inaccurate, due to the unstablenature of proteins and the nonstandardised procedures in theANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3340routine pathology laboratory. Immunohistochemical detection of ErbB2 remains, however, the basic technique for theselection of patients suitable for an expensive biologicaltherapy and gene testing is reserved only for a small group ofcases with inconclusive results. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing was initially used for thedetection of ErbB2 gene amplification, but this technique has a low discriminative ability in tissues, a temporary signal andrequires special and expensive equipment. Chromogenic in situhybridization (CISH) is a powerful, low cost alternative method for ErbB2 gene analysis which offers a permanent signal and obvious morphological details under the usualbright field microscope. In combination with chromosome 17,ErbB2 CISH analysis provides important informationconcerning the presence of true gene amplification or proteinoverexpression due to chromosomal polysomy. The CISHtechnique, according to a recent international multicenterquality assurance study, was found to have excellent reliabilityand reproducibility. Finally, CISH may be supplemented bytopoisomerase IIa gene analysis and provide further valuable information of prognostic and therapeutic significance. 324 GENETIC PROFILING IN TUMOR XENOGRAFTSFROM PAEDIATRIC GLIOMAS BY Warr1 1Department of Molecular Institute Neurology, University National Hospitalfor Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, UK; 2Departments of Surgery and Duke University Medical Center, Durham, USA; 3Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, London; 4Neural Development Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London, London; 5Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Trust, London; 6National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, UK Gliomas are the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in children, with survival after diagnosis for the most aggressivesubtype, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), being less than 12months in most cases. Improving survival rate in paediatricbrain tumor patients continues to be a challenge, and for this,we still need to understand the molecular pathways involved inthe genesis and progression of these types of cancer. DNA copy number changes represent molecular fingerprints of solidtumours and are as such relevant for better understanding oftumour development and progression. Gliomas arecharacterized by changes in the expression of genes, includingamplification of oncogenes and loss of tumor suppressorgenes, often as a result of genomic copy number alterations. Inorder to identify recurrent chromosomal regions of gain andloss, and thereby novel gene targets of potential importancefor paediatric glioma development and/or progression, wehave analyzed DNA copy number changes in ten tumorxenografts from paediatric gliomas, comprising neuroectodermal tumor mouse ( nu/nu ) by subcutaneous implantation Medical for tumour weregenerated p<0.05) genes in chromosomes with gains of 1, 2, 7, 8 and 20 and regions 12q and 13q.Furthermore, genes with high-level expression (10-fold)showed amplification. Similarly, deleted genes onchromosomes 3, 4, 6, 14 and 18 and regions 9p and 11q wereassociated with reduced expression (2-fold, p<0.05) in the tumour samples when compared to normal, brain controls.However, a number of genes with normal copy numbersshowed reduced expression levels (2-fold, p<0.05). High resolution analysis allowed us to identify changes inexpression of genes located within regions of copy numberalterations in paediatric gliomas that could play an importantrole in tumour pathology or provide potential new therapeutictargets. 325 GENE EXPRESSION AND STRUCTURALMODIFICATIONS OF MATRIX MACROMOLECULESIN SOLID CANCERS - MOLECULAR TARGETS N. Karamanos , O. Kousidou, A. Roussidis, Ch. Malavaki and P. Laboratory of Biochemistry, Department of Chemistry, University of Patras, 261 10 Patars, Greece Altered expression of effective matrix macromolecules by cancer cells is related to tumour growth, invasive propertiesand metastatic potential. The structural alteration anddegradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) by neoplastic cellsis a prerequisite for invasion and the formation of tumourmetastases by the malignant cells. Differential synthesis ofproteoglycans (PGs) in stroma and epithelial cells has beenAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3341related to breast tumourigenesis and proliferation, differentiation and the invasive properties of human epithelialbreast cancer. Tumor cells can release metalloproteinases(MMPs) that degrade the matrix macromolecules and cantherefore invade through tissue barriers, blood vessel andlymph channel walls. Modulation of MMP synthesis bycell-cell contact has been suggested to be a crucial event forenhancing the ability of breast cancer cells to invade the bonemarrow fibroblasts. Conventional chemotherapy regimens forthe treatment of breast cancer have limited efficacy and areassociated with significant toxicity, highlighting the need fornovel targeted therapies. In order to examine whether gene expression of PGs and MMPs is related to growth and functional invasive potential,we performed in vitro studies on a panel of epithelial of breast (ER-positive and -negative) and colon cell lines in thepresence of a series of potential inhibitors. The obtainedresults clearly showed that PI3/Akt and ERK1/2 signallingpathways are activated and that breast cancer is associatedwith significant changes in gene expression of secreted PGsas well as cell surface PGs, the expression of which is relatedto the balance between ER/. Significant changes in gene expression of MMPs and their endogenous tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) were also found. Theexpression of certain types of MMPs can be related to theinvasive properties of the epithelial breast and colon cancercells. Studies to elucidate whether the modified geneexpression of PGs, MMPs and TIMPs are associated withcertain molecular targets and their respective signallingpathways, using specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, that both tyrosine kinase pathways andstatus of ERs are key partners and of crucial importance formodified gene expression of matrix effectors and cancer cellgrowth. 326 INVESTIGATION OF in CRC. We aimedto study the expression of TS and Topo-I in patients withrCRC who received adjuvant chemotherapy and correlate itwith the clinical outcome. Patients and Methods: All patients, who were diagnosed with rCRC between 1989 and 2004 andtreated with adjuvant chemotherapy within HeCOG'sprotocols, were identified from our electronic database.Archival FFPE tissue blocks obtained from surgical resectionspecimens of invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma were arrayedin multiple TMA blocks. IHC was performed on the TMAslides using monoclonal antibodies against antigens TSand Topo-I. The immunocomplex was visualized using apolymer detection system and DAB as a chromogen. Asexternal control of the immunoreaction a known positive andnegative controls was used. In each slide was assigned a scorefor intensity and staining pattern using a 4-tier range system.The results were correlated with survival (OS) and disease freesurvival (DFS) in the view of irinotecan based chemotherapy.Results: A cohort of 498 cases with median age of 61 years, classified as Dukes stage B (49%) and C (51%), fulfilled thecriteria of the study. In 59% of the cases the tumor was locatedin the rectosigmoid area. All patients received adjuvant 5-FUbased chemotherapy and 35% were also treated withirinotecan, which is a target for Topo-I. TS and Topo-Iexpression was found in 43% and 48% of the casesrespectively. Five- years OS was 74% and DFS was 68%.There was no correlation of TS and Topo-I expression withOS and DFS. The subgroup of patients who expressed Topo-Iand treated with irinotecan had a better OS (HR=0.47, 95%CI0.23-0.94, p=0.033). In irinotecan 95%CI Conclusion: Our data indicate that with rCRC with elevated levels of Topo-I protein maybenefit from irinotecan containing adjuvant chemotherapy.However, randomized prospective trials are warranted toconfirm these results. 327 THE ANTITUMOR EFFECT OF LIPOSOME-ENCAPSULATED Katsuro Tomita Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa, Japan Background: Liposomes have been proposed as useful drug carriers in targeted drug delivery system and are underinvestigation in several therapeutic fields. Caffeine has beenidentified as belonging to the group of xanthines that enhancethe action of cisplatin. Materials and Methods: In The action of CDDP-L onrat osteosarcoma and the enhancing action of caffeine on theantitumor effect of CDDP-L were evaluated. Usingosteosarcoma-bearing rats, the retention of CDDP-L in theblood, its intratumor concentration, cytoreductive effect andthe enhancing action of caffeine on its antitumor effect wereexamined. Results: The liposomes were able to remain in the systemic circulation for a long time and to be concentrated inthe osteosarcoma, but that action did not produce an effectcorresponding to the quantity of cisplatin which wasencapsulated reaching the tumor. In rats administered CDDP-L, it was discovered that the antitumor effect was not onlyenhanced by the co-administration of caffeine but also furtherenhanced when the dosing period of caffeine was increased.Conclusion: CDDP-L combined with caffeine can produce better results for osteosarcoma. 328 REGULATION OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA Tel-Aviv, Israel Multiple myeloma is characterized by the malignant growth of immunoglobulin producing plasma cells, predominantly inthe bone marrow. The disease, at large, remains confined tothe bone marrow throughout its progression, pointing toessential interactions between the malignant plasma cells andthe bone marrow microenvironment. We studied the effects ofprimary human mesenchymal stromal cells, theextracellular matrix co-culture myelomacells with mesenchymal stromal cells resulted in significantreduction of the expression of the predominant plasma celldifferentiation markers CD38 and CD138, and cell surfaceimmunoglobulin kappa chain, in the malignant plasma cells.Plasma cell markers were found to be differentially regulatedby adhesive interactions, and stromal-derived soluble factors.While the down-regulation of CD138 by stromal cells wascompletely dependent on their adhesive interactions with themultiple cells, interleukin-6 induced specific down-regulation of CD38. Mesenchymal stromal cells, or theirconditioned media, inhibited the growth of multiple myelomacell line, thereby reducing the overall amounts of secretedlight chains. The expression of plasma cells differentiation-associated genes was regulated by adhesive interactions withfibronectin. Analysis of primary multiple myeloma bonemarrow samples revealed that the expression of CD138, butnot CD38 was affected by adhesive interactions. The ex vivopropagation of primary multiple myeloma cells resulted in significant increase in their differentiation markers. Overall,the data indicate that the bone marrow derivedmicroenvironmental factors can revert multiple myeloma cellsto a less differentiated phenotype by the combined activitiesof adhesive interactions and interleukin-6. Thus, the sustained,yet contained outgrowth of multiple myeloma may be tightlyregulated by the bone marrow microenvironment. 329 EXPLORING THE ROLE OF V A V1, A SIGNALTRANSDUCER PROTEIN THAT FUNCTIONS ONLYIN HEMATOPOIETIC CELLS, Pe'er, V . Schapira and S. Katzav The Hubert H. Humphrey Center for Experimental Medicine and Cancer Research, The Hebrew University-HadassahMedical School, Jerusalem 91120, Israel Aberrant signaling and gene expression is a hallmark of cancer and can occur because of genetic changes in signaling proteinsor in proteins that modify their signaling activities. Newapproaches for the treatment of cancer may become apparentthrough the identification of the genes involved in malignanttransformation. An important example of such genes is Vav1,a cytoplasmic signal transducer protein initially identified asan oncogene. Physiological expression of Vav1 is restricted tothe hematopoietic system, where its best-known function is asa GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange factor for Rho/RacGTPases,an activity strictly controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation.Vav1 regulates cytoskeletal rearrangement during activation ofhematopoietic cells, as well as activation of JNK, ERK, Ras,NF-B, and NFAT pathways. It also associates with numerous adapter proteins. Since its discovery, research on Vav1 hascycled between understanding its physiological function in thehematopoietic system and understanding how it isdysregulated as a truncated oncogene in fibroblasts. We haverecently shown that wild-type Vav1 is involved in humancancers such as lung, breast, ovarian, neuroblastoma, uvealmelanoma and prostate cancer. Stimulation of human lungcancer cells (H358 and H441) with Epidermal Growth Factor(EGF) leads to increased tyrosine phopshorylation of Vav1,suggesting that it participates in signal transduction events inthese cells. Depletion of Vav1 by siRNA leads to a dramaticreduction in the ability of the H358 lung cancer cells to formfoci in agar and develop tumors in mice, indicating that Vav1can play a decisive role in transformation of lung cancer cells.It is conceivable that misexpressed Vav1 in tissues other thanthe hematopoietic system participates in the pathogenesis ofcancer by activating pathways for both cellular proliferationand cell survival and/or may contribute to the onset of thesetumors. Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3343330 MODULATION OF AND HUMAN l'Ecole de M\u00e9decine, 75006 Paris, France Viscum album (V A) is used in cancer as a complimentary therapy. Despite being used for long time, the mode of actionof V A containing therapeutics remains unresolved. Theiractivity has been attributed to immunomodulatory propertiesin addition to their cytotoxic properties. Dendritic cells (DCs)are the professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) which arecrucial in tumor immunosurveillance and in inducing tumorimmunity. The tumor cells have the capacity to evade thesurveillance by inactivating the DCs through tumor factorssuch as VEGF, IL-10 and PGE 2. We examined the aspect that the V A preparations exert an immunomodulatory effect onDCs and favor an effective tumor regression. DCs incubatedwith V A M Spez and V A Qu Spez at 10 g/ml showed expression IL-8 and IL-1. Theability of the DCs treated with to induce proliferation ofallogeneic CD4+ T-cells further substantiates theimmunostimulatory effect of V A preparations. These findingsshould assist in better clarifying the immunomodulatorycharacteristics of V A preparations and in designingameliorated therapeutic strategies. 331 TREATMENT OF MALIGNANT TUMORS WITH A COMBINATION OF INTRATUMORAL 224Ra-LOADED WIRES AND CHEMOTHERAPY: RETARDATION OF PRIMARY TUMOR GROWTH AND OF LUNG METASTASES Y . Keisari 1, T. Cooks1, I. Kelson3,4 1Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, 2Davidoff Center, Rabin Medical Center, 3School of Physics and Astronomy, Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, Tel Aviv University, and 4Althera Medical, Tel Aviv, Israel Objectives: Highly lethal alpha particle radiation has so far not been used in the treatment of solid tumors because of itsshort range. We developed a new intratumoral treatment forsolid cancer utilizing 224Ra-loaded wires that continually release by recoil short-lived daughter atoms that emit alphaparticles. These atoms disperse in the tumor and deliver a lethal dose over a region measuring 3-7 mm in diameter. Themethod was termed Diffusing Alpha-emitters RadiationTherapy (DART). The present study examines the curativeeffects of a combination between the 224Ra-loaded wires and anti-tumor chemotherapy, against tumors of varioushistological types. Methods: Mouse and human tumor cells from pancreatic, squamous cell (SCC), prostate, and coloncarcinomas, were injected subcutaneously to normal andathymic mice, respectively. Mouse and human tumors, 4-10mm in diameter were implanted with stainless steel 224Ra- loaded wire(s) (0.3 mm-diameter and 3-5 mm long).Chemotherapeutic agents were administered concurrentlyonly to mice bearing mouse tumors. Animals were monitoredfor tumor development and survival. Also an in vitro set-up was used to assess killing of cancer cells by alpha particles.Results: Treatment of mouse SCC with two i.v. doses of cisplatin (5 mg/kg) given concomitantly with two 224Ra- loaded wires (11-28 kBq), caused substantial growth arrest of93%, extended survival from 44 to 87 days, and also reducedmetastatic spread to the lungs. Treatment of mouse pancreatictumors with a combination of one 224Ra wire (13-45 kBq) and Gemcitabine (60 mg/kg) achieved significant reduction intumor volume relative to any treatment modality alone. 224Ra- loaded wires (15-17 kBq/wire), inhibited tumor adenocarcinoma tumors (4-6 mm) by 45%, and evenled to complete cure. Injection of 5-FU (75 mg/kg) with the 224Ra wire augmented tumor destruction and growth retardation (35%) compared to 224Ra or 5-FU alone. 224Ra- loaded wires retarded the growth of all human derived tumorsimplanted in athymic mice. In vitro experiments with all tumor cells exposed to alpha particles revealed a dosedependent killing of the tumor cells. The combined treatmentwith alpha particles and chemotherapy achieved the highestkilling rate of tumor cells compared to each cytotoxiccomponent alone. Conclusion: 224Ra-loaded wires can effectively destroy mouse and human derived solid malignanttumors, both by direct destruction of tumor cells and bycausing damage to the tumor microenvironment, mainly thevasculature. The effect can be further potentiated by acombination with chemotherapy. This combined treatmentmodality holds significant potential for the treatment of non-resectable human cancer. 332 SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION THERAPY of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany Signal transduction therapy has become a leading area of modern drug research aiming to inhibit the pathomechanismbased on validated target molecules in cellular signaling.Selective inhibition of these false proliferative signals via targeting receptor tyrosine kinases and other signalingenzymes, resulting in the induction of apoptosis by depletionof the \"survival factors\" is one of the most studied and widelyaccepted concept of modern chemotherapy. Our NestedChemical Library (NCL) technology is based on aknowledge-base approach where focused libraries of kinaseinhibitors around 108 core structures and several hundredsscaffolds are used for hit finding and to generatepharmacophore models. We have established a uniqueproprietary kinase inhibitory chemistry and have developednM lead molecules against a series of kinases. Cancer cells have an ability to resist apoptosis and many tumors are resistant to the apoptosis-inducing effects ofradiation and chemotherapy. In order to overcome treatmentresistance and develop new drugs that target genes and proteinproducts in the apoptosis pathways we have developedmultiple target kinase inhibitors to inhibit certain survivalfactors and induce synthetic lethality in cancer cells. Weperform the discovery and validation of a novel, alternativeclass of inhibitors that target multiple kinase targets and/orprotein-protein interactions along some important survivalfactors. We have investigated synthetic lethal interactions for the identification of new and more powerful classes of drugtargets. The pro-apoptotic effect of the compounds ofVichem's Chemical Validation Library (CVL) was tested ontwo isogenic cell lines by sub-G1 flow cytometric apoptosisassay and lead molecules were selected. Our novel \"TargetFishing\" technology aims for selectivity profiling of leadmolecules. We have employed proteomic methods tocharacterize the cellular targets of kinase inhibitors. In theprocess of drug discovery selectivity profiling of kinaseinhibitors is a very important step, inhibiting more than onerelevant target can be advantageous (without inhibiting the'untouchables' such as insulin receptor kinase). So weperform not only selectivity profiling but also iterative targetre-identification of drug candidates during the early drugdiscovery phase, thus providing tools for pharmacologyprofiling. Using our kinase inhibitor library for the selectedsurvival factor kinase targets, with biochemical kinaseassays we have identified several potent hit and leadcompounds generated joint pharmacophores. Withcellular kinase and proliferation/apoptotic potent Katri Koli Department of The Haartman Institute, University of Helsinki, Haartmaninkatu 8, 00014 Helsinki, Finland Extracellular matrix (ECM) is a structural framework for cells and tissues, and provides signals to modulate cell behaviour.TGF- is targeted into the ECM as latent complexes with itsLAP-propeptide and via an LTBP molecule. Dysregulation ofTGF-beta activity is associated with almost all forms ofcancer. LTBPs-1, -3 and -4 associate with and regulate theavailability of TGF-b:s 1-3 in tissues. ECM targeting isessential since the surrounding structures define thesusceptibility of the complexes to activation processes. Tounderstand these mechanisms we have analyzed LTBP:SL-TGF-beta incorporation into the ECM of normal, malignantand differentiating cells. Using recombinant LTBP fragmentswe identified critical domains for this function. All LTBPs gotassembled into the ECM, but with LTBPs fibroblast ECM indicating specificity. In osteogenic differentiationof mesenchymal stem cells we observed shift from LTBP-3 in association with increased TGF-beta activity andECM and lungmorphogenesis. Fibronectin (FN) is central in the matrix targeting of LTBPs in most cell cultures. FN acts as an organizer for the otherECM proteins including LTBPs and fibrillin-1. FN plays acentral role in the ECM assembly of LTBP-4. EndogenousLTBP-4 was not targeted into the matrix of FN(-/-)fibroblasts. By exogenous FN the LTBP-4 assembly could berescued. To characterize the FN binding region of LTBP-4, N-terminally shortened constructs were analyzed for their ECMassociation by IF-microscopy. When the N-terminal domain(first exon area) of the molecule was deleted ECM depositionof LTBP-4 was reduced and delayed. However, duringextended culture minor quantities of LTBP-4 accumulated intothe alternative protein-protein binding site. This region bindsfibrillin-1 (Fbn-1) directly, suggesting that the observed minorbinding could be Fbn-1 dependent. LTBP-4/Fbn-1 doublestaining profiles support this notion. We identified in LTBP-4heparin binding sites, which may mediate cell attachment.Current analyses revealed a direct interaction between FN andLTBP-4, which evidently plays divergent roles in ECMassembly. The modulation of structures of LTBPs (proteaseAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3345sensitivity, splicing) provides numerous alternatives for dysregulated TGF-beta deposition in the pathogenesis ofmalignant diseases. 334 GENETIC ALTERATIONS THAT DISRUPT SUBCELLULAR TRAFFICKING OF THE VHL TUMOR , Karim Mekhail, Karine Pilon-Larose and Stephen Lee Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada,K1H 8M5 The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein is the substrate recognition component of a Cullin-2-containing E3ubiquitin ligase that recruits the hypoxia-inducible factor(HIF) for oxygen-dependent degradation. The subcellulartrafficking properties of VHL are essential for its ability tomediate efficient degradation of HIF and suppress tumorformation. Interestingly, nuclear export of VHL requiresongoing transcription and is independent of the classicalNES/CRM1 nuclear export pathway. Examining thisuncharacterized nuclear export pathway led to theidentification of a discreet motif, reffered to as TD-NEM(transcription-dependent nuclear export motif), that directstranscription-dependent nuclear export of VHL. TD-NEM istargeted by naturally-occurring mutations associated with renalcarcinoma and polycythemia in humans. We have also shownthat nuclear export of VHL by TD-NEM is mediated throughthe translation elongation factor eEF1A, a protein implicatedin the nuclear export of tRNA in lower eukaryotes. eEF1Ainteracts specifically with TD-NEM and disrupting thisinteraction, by point key orsiRNA-mediated knockdown eEF1A, show and cancer-causing mutations targeting key residues of TD-NEM disruptthe tumor suppressor function of VHL by altering its nuclearexport dynamics. Such mutations restrain the ability of VHL toefficiently mediate oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF.These results demonstrate that eEF1A/TD-NEM-mediatednuclear export is critical to suppress activation of the HIFoncogenic pathway and highlight the essential role ofsubcellular trafficking in the tumor suppressor function ofVHL. 335 DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERISATION OFAPTAMERS AS INHIBITORS OF VITAL PATHWAYSIN CANCER THERAPYH.

Missailidis1 1Department of Chemistry and Analytical Sciences, The Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA; 2Antisoma Research Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, UK Aptamers can be described as short oligonucleotides that harbour great potential in their versatile applications, due totheir high affinity and specificity for their target of choice.Despite their infancy, aptamers have already emerged at theforefront of clinical research, offering significant contributionas therapeutic agents for a range of diseases. Thus, ourresearch is aimed towards generating aptamer(s) for a specificcancer biomarker that, when blocked, can lead to specific cellkill and thus offer a novel therapeutic potential against cancer. Aptamers are traditionally selected using SELEX technology, which we have adapted to generate high affinityaptamers on a faster timescale. Aptamer selection experimentsagainst a synthetic peptide of our tumour marker have led tothe selection of 3 aptamer species, which appeared in twoindependent variations of the selection method. Lack of an initial positive control, in the form or an Ab or other ligand for our target, and limitations in the physicalproperties our host-ligand system resulted in limitations withregards to characterising the interactions between the aptamerand its peptide target. To overcome such issues, we havesynthesised a DNA intercalating dye with differentluminescence properties depending on its physicalenvironment. The utilisation of this dye in a fluorescencedisplacement assay has demonstrated that this technique canprovide a suitable means to characterise aptamer-peptideinteractions, without the need for modification. However, theability of the peptide to displace the dye from the aptamerappeared to be dependent on the buffer system used in theassay. CD experiments have verified that this is ultimately dueto ligand-induced conformational changes of the aptamerstructure, influenced by the buffer system employed. Othertechniques used to study the interaction of our biomoleculesconsist of FRET assays, EMSAs and biacore. Stability assayshave demonstrated that the remarkableresistance towards nucleases present in human serum andreasonable stability in mouse serum. Flow cytometryexperiments further demonstrated that our aptamers are ableto bind to cancer cell lines proposed to express our targetbiomarker, offering a viable tumour marker validation assay.Remarkably, shorter variations of each aptamer, designed onthe basis of computational predictions, showed better bindingto the cancer cells than their full length counterparts. Finally,our aptamers have shown the ability to effect direct cell kill inprostate and breast cancer cell lines by the proposed inhibitionof vital cellular pathways leading to cell apoptosis.

It was tested if the synergistic effect of ADV-RSV-TK gene therapy with chemotherapy was limited to the primarymechanism of action or whether the vector transduction itselfexerted any pro-apoptotic effect. It is unclear how long asignificant degree of transgene translation can be expectedafter adenovirus-mediated TK transduction, where thetranscriptional complex is localized in the nucleus in anepisomal fashion and thus without stable integration. Thepossible interaction of Acyclovir pretreatment withsubsequent ADV-RSV-TK transduction also beelucidated. The epithelial cell lines OVCAR-3 and MDAH-2774 were established from human poorly differentiated serous ovariancancer.Fluorimetric assay of caspase-3 activity was performedas well as ELISA of the CK 18 split product M30. PARPcleavage was analysed by Western blotting. Transgeneexpression and cell killing efficacy were analysed based onmultiplicity of infection (MOI) and MTT assay.Anti-TK-antibody 1397 was used for immunocytochemistry andWestern Blot analysis of TK expression. After transductionwith ADV-RSV-TK at an MOI of 66, TK translation increasedstrongly in MDH 2774 and OVCAR-3 cell lines theinitial 48 hours. Apoptosis induction was established in thisinvestigation as the mechanism of the ADV-RSV-TK genetherapy effect of acyclovir administration by cleavage. nor showed any apoptotic activity. Thesynergistic effect of TK gene therapy and chemotherapeuticagents was shown to be TK induced. Significant anti-PARP 1 activity was found to be an ADV-RSV-TK treatment effectafter acyclovir addition. CAR expression was observed on themembranes but also intracellular translocation of CAR takesplace dependent on cellular growth patterns TK geneexpression is dependent on multiplicity of infection (MOI) andthus on vector dose in a linear fashion. Neither TK expressionnor ADV transduction influence CAR expression. Differentialsusceptibility of lines to TK induced cell killingby Acyclovir metabolites was observed. CAR expression appears not to be influenced by adenoviral transduction or by the accumulation of the tymidine kinasegene product. Differences in therapeutic sensitivity are mostlikely mediated by intracellular mechanisms and not bymodulation of CAR expression.Virtually constant expressionof the TK transgene was observed by Western blot duringeight days. Cell killing efficacy was increased by repeateddaily administrations of acyclovir. Pretreatment with acyclovirdid not result in significantly increased cell killing efficacy.No negative effect of acyclovir on ADV-RSV-TK transductionwas observed. The at least week-long expression of the TKtransgene with persistently increasing efficacy of cell killingafter adenovirus-mediated tumor cell transduction provide arealistic basis for the development of multicycle ADV-mediated TK gene therapy approaches in the treatment ofovarian cancer. Continuous i.v. acyclovir treatment or daily oral acyclovir-prodrug therapy might simplify the substrateregimen for the TK gene. Due to its anti-PARP activity it mayin the future play a role specifically in the treatment ofBRCA1- and 2- related familial ovarian cancer. 337 6, 08280 Aue, Germany Most tumors with intraperitoneal dissemination are not amenable to surgical treatment strategies. In ovarian cancer,however, patient prognosis can be dramatically improved byradical surgical removal of all macroscopic disease at the timeof primary surgery. This is necessary in the 75% of patientspresenting with advanced disease at the time of primarydiagnosis. In order to achieve this goal, multiorgan resections,peritoneal resection and pelvic and paraaorticlymphadenectomy are in many instances warranted in additionto the routinely performed hysterectomy with bilateralsalpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy. In view of the longduration of these surgical interventions of six hours and more,it is of great importance to optimise the rapidity of eachsurgical step while minimizing blood loss.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3347To this end, high frequency surgery using electrical energy (HF-Surgery) has recently made major inroads. Energyadjustment directly from the handpiece without need forexternal help in adjusting generators, computerized energydosing with vessel sealing and tissue separation by integratedcutting devices have become available. Ultrasound surgery(CUSA) is used in tumor spread to vulnerable surfaces thatare otherwise surgically inaccessible or in diffuse coating oflarge parts of the intestine. In combination with advancedstapling techniques for bowel reconstruction and formation oforgan replacement such as continent conduits these optionsmake possible a vastly increased degree of radicality with lesscomplications. From September 2006 until September 2008 49 patients with ovarian cancer stage III and IV underwent surgicalexploration for ovarian cancer, 37 with newly diagnoseddisease and 12 with recurrence after more than one year aftercompletion of primary treatment. Complete radical debulkingsurgery to no macroscopic residual was possible in 46 patientsoverall, 35 in primary surgery and 11 in recurrent tumors. 3patients could not be significantly debulked. 1 had extensiveinfiltration of the entire muscular anterior abdominal wall, 2suffered from serious comorbidities that made longerinterventions impossible. Those underwent primarychemotherapy. There was no operative mortality. The complete debulking rate of 94% even in this mixed series is in part due to the stillrelatively small numbers. Our serious, however, confirms databy Eisenkop and colleagues while comparing favourably withEuropean data i.e. from Germany, where optimal surgical results are obtained approximately 20% of these cases even incooperative study groups. We conclude, that with adequate surgical training and optimal utilization of the technological advances made insurgical instrumentation complete debulking surgery can beperformed in the vast majority of patients with advancedovarian cancer. 338 CYTOTOXICITY AND CELLULAR UPTAKE OFDOXORUBICIN AND ITS FORMAMIDINEDERIV ATIVES IN Mazowiecka St., 92-215 Lodz; 2Institute of Biotechnology and Antibiotics, 5 Staroscinska St., 02-516 Warsaw, Poland Background: In this work we compared cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of doxorubicin (DOX) and its two derivatives,in which the amino group at 3' position was replaced by 2 different formamidino groups (-N=CH-N), where one of thenitrogen atom is a part of morpholine (derivative DOHM) orhexamethyleneimine (DOXH) ring. All tests were performedin HL60 sensitive and HL60/VINC resistant cells. HL-60/VINC cells retain sensitivity toward vincristine, a drugwhich is typically associated with the classical multidrug-resistance phenotype. Their resistance to anthracyclines is dueto the lowered activity of DNA topoisomerase II. Results: Cytotoxic activity of DOX toward resistant cells was ~200times lower when compared with the sensitive HL60 cell line(resistance index 200). Formamidine derivatives of DOX alsoexhibited decreased cytotoxicity toward HL60/VINC cells butthe resistance index for both compounds was ~2 and thesecompounds were more than 20 times more active in resistantcells than parent drug DOX. It was found that the uptake ofDOX was lowered in resistant cells by 16%. The uptake ofDOXM and DOXH was also lowered by 26% and 19%,respectively. Thus the changes in the cellular uptake ofanthracyclines are not associated with the loss of theircytotoxicity and the fact that cytotoxicity of DOXM andDOXH exceeded the cytotoxicity of DOX. These resultssuggests that DOXM and DOXH are much more cytotoxicthen DOX against HL60/VINC cells because the mechanismof their cytotoxic action is different from that of DOX. Thissuggestion was proven by the experiments in a cell-freesystem containing human topoisomerase II and supercoiledpBR322 DNA. DOX strongly stimulated DNA cleavage,whereas its derivatives were inactive. Conclusion: It is concluded that the introduction of formamidine moietycontaining morpholine or hexamethyleneimine ring ispromising cytotoxic againsttumors cells with altered topoisomerase II activity. 339 TUMOR FORMATION DUE TO ABNORMALITIES IN THE -CATENIN-INDEPENDENT PATHWAY OF WNT SIGNALING Akira Manabu Kurayoshi Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3, Kasumi, Minami-ku,Hiroshima 734-8551, Japan Wnt signaling is a complex pathway in which -catenin is viewed as a central mediator in regulating cell proliferationand differentiation. The significance of Wnt signaling inhuman cancer has been elucidated by the identification ofmutations in genes coding for the -catenin-dependentpathway components, APC, -catenin, and Axin. Evidence hasbeen recently presented on the importance of the -catenin-independent pathway activated by Wnt signaling. It is likelythat this activates several intracellular signalingANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: cell migration, adhesion, and polarity. The -catenin-independent pathway has also been shown to beinvolved in tumor biology. However, the role of the -catenin-independent pathway is still unclear. Since Wnt5a is arepresentative ligand that activates the -catenin-independentpathway, we sought to clarify how Wnt5a is involved inaggressiveness of gastric cancer. Wnt5a was overexpressed in71 of 237 gastric cancer cases. The positivity of Wnt5aexpression was correlated with advanced stages and poorprognosis of gastric cancer. Wnt5a stimulated cell migrationand invasion in gastric cancer cells. Wnt5a activated focaladhesion kinase and small GTP-binding protein Rac, both ofwhich are known to play a role in cell migration. Cellmigration, membrane ruffling, and turnover of paxillin weresuppressed in Wnt5a knockdown cells. Furthermore, anti-Wnt5a antibody suppressed gastric cancer cell migration.These results suggest that Wnt5a stimulates cell migration byregulating focal adhesion complexes and that Wnt5a is notonly a prognostic factor but also a good therapeutic target forgastric cancer. In this talk, we review recent developments inboth the functions and mechanisms of the -catenin-independent pathway of Wnt signaling, with an emphasis onits functional contribution to tumor progression. 340 GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING: CANONICALMOLECULAR CHANGES ANDCLINICOPATHOLOGICAL FEATURES INSPORADIC H.

Methods: Using microarray gene-expression analysis, we therefore assayed patterns ofgene expression, relative to canonical molecular changes andclinicopathological features, in 84 sporadic colorectal cancerpatients, standardized by tumor location. Subsets ofdifferentially expressed genes were confirmed by real-timeRT-PCR. Results: The largest number of genes identified asdifferentially expressed was by tumor location, and the next largest number by lymphovascular or neural invasion of tumorcells and by mismatch repair (MMR) defects. Amongstbiological processes, the immune response was significantlyimplicated in entire molecular changes observed duringcolorectal tumorigenesis ( correlate with tumorigenesis and tumor growth. Most location-associated molecular changes had distinct effects on geneexpression, but the effects of the latter were sometimescontradictory. Conclusion: We show that several differentially expressed genes were associated with canonical molecularchanges in sporadic colorectal cancer, possibly constitutingalternative or subordinate pathways of tumorigenesis. Astumor location was the dominant factor influencing differentialgene expression, location-specific analysis may identifylocation-associated pathways and enhance the ofclass prediction. 341 CHEMO-RESPONSIVENESS ASSOCIATED WITHCANONICAL MOLECULAR CHANGES INCOLORECTAL CANCER C.

Results: Disease-free survival period (mean\u00b1SEM) was significantly longer tumors with TGF-2 expression(42\u00b11.4 p=0.048). In the metastatic settings, the high disease control rate correlatedAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3349significantly with wild-type relative to mutant APC and intact MMR relative to MMR defects ( p=0.013, respectively). Interestingly, specific molecular steps of tumorigenensis wereclosely associated with particular toxicities. Conclusion: A subset of molecular changes occuring during colorectaltumorigenesis showed significant associations withtherapeutic responses and toxicities to chemotherapyregimens, suggesting that these changes may be candidatepredictors of response to chemotherapy. 342 FAK/SRC PATHWAY PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN FARNESIFEROL C INDUCED ANTIANGIOGENIC AND ANTITUMOR Center, College of Oriental Medicine, Kyunghee University, Seoul130-701, Republic of Korea; 2College of Pharmacy and National Core Research Center for Cell Signaling and Drug Discovery, Ewha WomansUniversity, Seoul, 120-750, Republic of Korea; 3The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, 801 16th Avenue NE, Austin, MN 55912, USA Farnesiferol C (FC) is a natural compound from Ferula assafoetida L. that has been used for cancer treatment as a folk remedy; its anti-tumor efficacy and mechanisms are not yetdetermined. Thus, in the present study, we first examined theanti-angiogenic activities and associated mechanisms of FCusing a battery of in vitro /ex vivo assays. cytotoxicity with IC 50of ~70 M. Within ranges exposure FC inhibitedvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced cellproliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation (capillarydifferentiation) and also the expression of matrixmetalloproteinase (MMP) 2 in the VEGF-treated HUVECs.Also, FC decreased the binding of VEGF to VEGFR-1/Flt-1,but not to VEGFR-2/KDR/Flk-1. Interestingly, the dampenedendothelial cellular responses were preceded by a rapidinhibitory action (examined within 10 min of VEGFstimulation) of FC on a number of key VEGF-inducedsignaling VEGF-induced Src and decreasedthe phosphorylation Src kinase activity via itspreferential docking to the ATP-binding site of Src kinase rather than VEGFR2. In addition to HUVEC model, FCinhibited the sprouting of VEGF-treated rat aortic endothelialcells in a concentration dependent manner in an ex vivo model. Furthermore, FC significantly inhibited the in vivo growth of mouse Lewis lung cancer cells inoculated on the flank ofsyngenic mice at a dose of 1 mg/kg without any negativeeffect on the body weight of the host mice.Immunohistochemistry also revealed that its anticancerefficacy is associated with decreased expressions ofmicrovessel density (CD34), proliferative index (Ki-67) andSrc. Taken together, Cpossesses strong anti-angiogenic potential viaFAK/Src and cancer chemopreventive or therapeuticagent. 343 SHIKONIN-INDUCED CELL CYCLE ARREST AND APOPTOSIS IN HUMAN BREAST CARCINOMA MCF-7 CELLS Sun-Joong Kim and Hyo Ihl Chang College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, South Korea Shikonin isolated from Lithospermum erythrorhizon roots has been reported to confer biological properties includingantibacterial, wound healing, anti-inflammatory,antithrombotic, and antitumor effects. We investigated,together with the structurally related naphthoquinone, theeffects on the induction of apoptotic cell death in carcinoma was with TOF-MS/MS. Chromatographic separation wasachieved on a reversed-phase Luna C 18 column and step gradient elution resulted in a total run time of about 25 minand the full scan mass spectra of shikonin. The protonatedmolecules found for shikonin were m/z analysis, (ROS) of did notinduce apoptosis, but rather induced G 0/G1-phase arrest in MCF-7 cells. Flow cytometric analysis indicated thatshikonin directly increased intracellular oxidative stress basedon the cell permeable dye, 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluoresceindiacetate(DCFH-DA) acting as an indicator of reactive oxygenspecies(ROS) generation. Also, shikonin decreased themitochondrial membrane potential ( m), in MCF-7 cells. Overall, our results demonstrated that shikonin treatmentcauses cell death by activating pathway inducing G 0/G1-phase arrest and apoptosis.ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3350344 Chiba City Japan Introduction: The efficacy of immunotherapy for cancer patients is still under debate. Although accumulatingevidence indicates that the immune system recognizestumors and mounts responses against cancer, immunotherapyfor cancer patients has not gained as much public support asa standard therapy such as surgery, chemotherapy orradiation therapy. In our presentation, we report results ofexperimental analysis of killer cell and dendritic cellproduction from regional lymph nodes of primary lungcancer patients. In the presence of dendritic cells obtainedfrom tissue culture of regional lymph nodes of primary lungcancer patients, we obtained activated killer cells whichdemonstrated specific cytotoxic activity against autologouscancer cells. By adding peripheral blood lymphocytes tolong-term tissue culture of regional lymph nodes, we havesucceeded in generating specific killer cells sufficient for theimmunotherapy of cancer patients. Using these cells as asource of adoptive immunotherapy, we report promisingresults of a phase II study of post-surgical adjuvant chemo-immunotherapy against lung cancer patients. Furthermore wewill discuss future possibilities and limits of immunotherapy.Patients and Methods: Pathologically diagnosed N2 lung cancer patients were selected for post-surgical adjuvantchemo-immunotherapy. The activated killer cells anddendritic cells (AKT-DC) obtained from tissue cultures oftumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN) or from TDLN co-cultured with peripheral blood lymphocytes (TDLN-Pb) wereused for the adoptive transfer of immunotherapy. Thepatients received surgery and 4 courses of chemotherapyalong with 10 to 12 courses of adoptive immunotherapyevery 2 months for 2 years. Results: There were 31 N2 patients eligible for the study. Three cases were excludedbecause of refusal by the patients after 1-2 courses ofimmunotherapy. For the 28 cases treated, a total of 313courses of immunotherapy were administered. The maintoxicities were fever (78.0%), chill (83.4%), fatigue (23.0%)and nausea (17.0%) on the day of cell transfer. The 2- and5-year survival rates of the patients with same stage who receivedchemotherapy and surgery without immunotherapy was12.5%. Conclusion: Adoptive transfer of activated killer cells and dendritic cells from the tumor-draining lymph nodes ofprimary lung cancer patients is feasible, safe, and give uspromising hope for the future prospective study of immunotherapy. 345 LOW PENETRANCE GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITYFACTORS University of Sciences, P\u00e9cs; 2Department of County \"Markusovszky\" Hospital, Szombathely, Hungary Cancer is a process caused by gene-environment interactions. The cancer-related genetic factors can be high-penetrancegenes, causing hereditary tumors and cancer syndromes, or socalled individual susceptibility factors. The latter grouptypically consists of minor variants - allelic polymorphisms -in genes regulating cell cycle, cell division, DNA repair,apoptosis and metabolism of carcinogenic substances. The individual susceptibility factors are not strong enough to cause familial aggregation of tumors, but on a populationlevel they can significantly alter the risk of certain cancers.However, in an interaction with each other, or withenvironmental exposures, the low penetrance susceptibilityfactors might already cause substantial risk increase in \"high-risk\" individuals. Genotyping for several allelicpolymorphisms might give a possibility for individualizedprevention, by giving complex information on personalsusceptibility traits. The lecture gives an overview on the most important categories of low penetrance cancer susceptibility factors, theirmode of action and population level significance. Results ofour molecular epidemiological studies on colorectal cancer,thyroid cancer and other tumors, concerning the effects ofallelic polymorphisms of metabolizing enzymes, tumorsuppressor genes and DNA repair genes will also be reviewed,including recent, unpublished works. 346 EXOCRINE PANCREATIC CANCER: NEWCONCEPTS, NEW DRUGS, PERSPECTIVES R. KlapdorInternal Practice, Centre for clinical and experimental tumour marker diagnosis and therapy (ZeTDT)GmbH,Hamburg, GermanyAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3351During the past 15 years most of the scientific clinical studies reported on study protocols following only 1 treatmentregimen. The mean survival of 6-8 months in these studies iseven nowadays accepted as a reference value for survival ofpatients suffering from advanced exocrine pancreatic cancer. Reviewing the literature the main reasons for this disaster seem to be: 1. The known cytostatic drugs only show alimited/disappointing efficacy in the case of single agenttherapies. 2. Palliative therapy in general is started too late,not allowing a second or third line therapy. 3. Follow up onlybased on imaging methods performed in more or less longintervals. 4. Study-protocols to investigate new drugs or drug-combinations mainly base on 1- line- treatment strategies. 5.Symptomatic supportive treatment with all their actualfacilities is not employed in a way, possible today (nutrition,pain therapy, endoscopic palliative surgery, palliative resectivesurgery etc.). 6. Some kind of treatment nihilism due to theknown limited efficacy of Gemcitabine and it's combinationsduring the past 14 years seem to paralyse some activities inthe oncological field. Our own experience however suggests that the outcome of these cancer patients can be improved by earlier diagnosis andearlier start of palliative tumortherapy, by valid follow-upbased on imaging methods every 6-8 weeks in combinationwith tumor marker determinations every 2-4 weeks, byconsequent offer of best supportive care to the patients and bytreatment concepts following the concept of EOSPC (EfficacyOrientated Sequential Poly-Chemotherapy). Following thisconcept we were able to report on median survival rates of 16months for all patients and of 18 months for locally advancedand 13 months for metastasized carcinomas resp.. 73% of ourpatients allowed to start a second line therapy, 68% also a thirdline treatment. M1 patients with >1 effective treatmentsequence (49% of the M1 tumors diseases) showed a mediansurvival of 18.5 months. As cytotoxic drugs we mainly usedGemcitabine, 5-FU, Folinic acid, Oxaliplatin, Mitomycin-Cand/or Irinotecan as single drugs or in combinations. Newdrugs acting by new mechanisms like e.g. Erlotinib, new combinations or local regional approaches seem to furtherimprove the survival. Summarizing the data support the concept of efficacy orientated sequential pancreatic cancer therapy. Consequentlyalso clinical prospective studies should be planned no longeras 1-line concepts, but at least as 2- or 3- line concepts withnew drugs or drug combinations to be evaluated as 1st-, 2nd-or 3rd lines. 347 CHRONIC AND BREAK-THROUGH PAIN INCANCER PATIENTS U.R. KleebergHOPA, Hamburg, GermanyAlthough the pathophysiology of pain has been studied in great detail, cancer-related chronic pain syndromes and break-through pain are highly complex and difficult to analyze inindividual patients, reflecting the clinical day to day problemswith an optimal and tailored treatment. Several surveys onpatient satisfaction with the quality of pain control, both forin- as well as in out-patients of specialized oncology units,leave quite some room for improvement. Roughly 20% ofcancer patients continue to suffer from pain, though improved,despite optimal interdisciplinary efforts. The dominant clinical problems stem from the delicate balance between pain control, treatment-related side-effectsand patient adherence. Increasing dosage and dose intensity ofOpiods, combinations with adjuvants and psychosocial supportmay help in most situations, but definitely not in all, especiallyin neuropathic and break-through cancer pain (BTCP). New insights in the pathogenesis of pain and new drugs and drug combinations have moved us on a little further, still beingunsatisfactory though in difficult clinical situations. Teachingpropaedeutics in Palliative Care remains one of the dominanttasks in academic medicine: Detailed case history, differentialdiagnosis, documentation of the course, and repeatedconsultation of all disease-related disciplines under theguidance of the medical oncologist will ameliorate the cancerpatient's suffering and allow for new strength \"zumMenschsein\". An overview about the current state of the art will be given. 348 THE ROLE OF MICROENVIRONMENT IN EBVASSOCIATED LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES Eva KleinDepartment of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology. Karolinska Institute, 17177, Stockholm, Sweden Depending on the differentiation and maturation of EBV- genome carrying cells, virally encoded proteins areexpressed in various combinations. These proteins determinethe fate of the viral genome harbouring cells. Virustransformed B lymphocytes - lymphoblastoid cell threesurface proteins. This phenotype isencountered only in B lymphocytes and it is associated withcell proliferation. Therefore, it is usually referred to asgrowth transformation program and also as Type III EBVexpression. Such cells are readily recognized by the immuneresponse. Their proliferation therefore is inhibited in healthyindividuals. Consequently in immunosuppressed patients thismechanism does not function and the risk for EBVassociated B cell malignancies is high. In other cell typeswhich carry the EBV genome the expression of the virallyencoded proteins is restricted, such as in NK cells, T-cells. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3352They express only EBNA-1 and LMP-1, thus they lack the nuclear protein EBNA-2 that is required for the proliferatinginducing capacity of the virus. In such cells the presence ofthe viral genome does not induce proliferation. However itmay affect the phenotype of the cell and alter theirbehaviour, by avoidance of apoptosis, by inducingenrichment of inflammatory cells in their surrounding and/ortheir response to growth inducing intercellular contacts or tocytokines may be intensified. There is evidence suchmechanisms in associated of Cell Proliferation and Ageing, Institute of Biology, National Centre for Scientific Research\"Demokritos\", 15310 Athens, Greece The majority of normal somatic cells cannot proliferate indefinitely and after a limited number of duplications theyenter a state called replicative senescence, characterizedmainly by the cell's inability to proliferate. This phenomenonis the consequence of a progressive telomere shortening, thatis perceived by the cells as a DNA damage, leading to theactivation of p53 tumor suppressor and thus to cell cyclearrest. In addition, the cells can senesce prematurely afterexposure to various types of genotoxic stress. Interestingly, theoverexpression of several oncogenes in normal cells leads alsoto premature senescence, indicating that senescence is a potentanticancer mechanism. We have recently shown that thisoncogene-induced senescence is also the outcome of a DNAdamage response, suggesting common mechanisms underlyingreplicative and stress-induced damaging agent provoke a phenotype intumor cells. Beyond their inability to proliferate, senescent cells express a pro-inflammatory phenotype that is believed to contribute tothe ageing process and to the development of age-relateddisorders. We have shown that p53 is responsible for thesenescence-associated overexpression of ICAM-1, a crucialpro-inflammatory molecule, indicating that the variousfeatures of senescence (cell cycle arrest and the pro-inflammatory phenotype) are, at least in part, linked with thesame molecular mechanisms. Although cellular senescence is considered an anticancer mechanism, it has been proposed that senescent cells, due totheir specific phenotype create a permissive environment forthe growth of cancer cells, supporting the idea that thesenescence response is antagonistically pleiotropic. In thisvein, we have shown that subcytotoxic doses of ionizingradiation, used in several anticancer treatment regimes, provoke premature senescence in stromal fibroblasts, viaa DNA damage response, and these senescent cells enhance thegrowth of cancer cells, both in vitro and in immunocompromised mice in vivo . The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon will be discussed. These findingssupport the idea that replicative- or stress-induced- senescencemay play a role in tumorigenesis late in life.This work has been partially supported by KESY . 350 THE NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION REPAIR COMPLEXERCC1-XPF AS A POSSIBLE FACTOR FOR REPAIRDEFICIENCY AND CISPLATIN SENSITIVITY INTESTIS TUMOR CELLS S. Usanova, A. Pi\u00e9e-Staffa, U. Sied, B. Kaina and B. K\u00f6berle Institute of Toxicology, University of Mainz, ObereZahlbacher Strasse 67, 55131 Mainz, Germany Metastatic testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are cured in over 75% of patients using cisplatin-based combinationtherapy. The reasons underlying this cisplatin sensitivity arenot yet known. Cell lines derived from TGCTs retain thiscisplatin hypersensitivity in vitro , therefore providing a good model system for investigating the factors controllingcisplatin sensitivity. Our earlier data showed that testistumor cells have a reduced capacity to repair cisplatin-induced DNA damage, suggesting that repair deficiencymight be a factor for the observed cisplatin sensitivity. Infurther studies, we found that the nucleotide excision repair(NER) factor ERCC1-XPF is reduced in testis tumor-celllines, indicating a possible role of ERCC1-XPF for repairdeficiency and cisplatin sensitivity of testis adducts (IA) and inter-strand crosslinks (ICLs). To investigate repair of IAs, weused the method of DNA slot blotting, while repair of ICLswas investigated using the Comet assay. We found that therepair of IAs was slightly reduced in the two testis tumorcell lines compared to a cisplatin-resistant bladder cancercell line. Repair of ICLs, however, was significantly reducedin the testis tumor cells compared to the bladder cancer cellline. To analyse the causal role of ERCC1-XPF for repairdeficiency and cisplatin sensitivity in testis tumor cells, ERCC1-XPF in the testis tumor cell lines833K and SuSa using a mammalian expression vector.Overexpression of ERCC1-XPF increased ICL repair in833K cells, suggesting that ERCC1-XPF might be rate-limiting for repair of ICLs in testis tumor cells.Investigations into the effect of ERCC1-XPF cisplatin sensitivity in testis tumor cells are currentlyunder way.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3353351 INVESTIGATION OF THE HERITABILITY OF THECANCER RESISTANT PHENOTYPE SR/CRMOUSE Jann Hau1 and Klaus Rieneck1,2 1Department of Experimental Medicine, Copenhagen and University 3 Blegdamsvej, 2200Copenhagen \u00d8 Copenhagen, Denmark The SR/CR mouse model of cancer resistance was discovered in 1999. It is resistant to a number of different cancer cell linesand the heritable phenotype was demonstrated on differentgenetic backgrounds. The cancer resistance is transferable toother strains of mice by adoptive transfer of innate immunecells. We independently, for the first time, confirm the findingsof the SR/CR phenotype of cancer resistance to the S180 cellline in mice of two different genetic backgrounds: BALB/cand C57BL/6. The SR/CR mice were screened by intraperitoneal injection of S180 cells. The frequency of the SR/CRphenotype in the present study was 30% for the BALB/c strainand 22% for the C57BL/6 strain in the first litters, but theoverall frequency was 8% for both strains. A frequency ofabout 30% was reported in the original US-colony. A litterseriation effect on the frequency of the SR/CR phenotype wasrecorded. The phenotype frequency in the first born litters wassimilar to the one recorded in the founder colony in the US.There was no significant difference in the frequency of theSR/CR phenotype between the two genders, but the overallfrequency of the SR/CR phenotype was significantly higher inlitters from SR/CR mice on BALB/c background compared tolitters from SR/CR mice on C57BL/6 background. 352 REDUCTION 3-25-8Nishi-shimbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8461, Japan Objective: To report on how the prevention of chemotherapy- induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) has been successfullyachieved by administering clonazepam. Methods: We identified a patient who had recovered from CINV after takingclonazepam. Based on the outcome of this case, we conductedan investigation into the cases of 26 patients who stillexperienced CINV despite taking 5HT3 and corticosteroids.Results: Significant differences were found in following symptoms nausea, vomiting and appetite loss, and the rates ofpartial remission and complete remission of the threesymptoms were as follows: 76%/47%, 93%/79% and72%/50%, respectively. Conclusion: be useful the control of CINV . We believe that clonazepamcontributed to the outcome in the following ways: (i)anxiolytic effect, (ii) anticonvulsant effect on myoclonus. 353 THE ROLE OF ENDO180 IN Sturge1 1Prostate Cancer Research Group, Department of Oncology, Division of SORA, Imperial College London, HammersmithHospital Campus, London; 2Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Division of SORA, College London Charing Cross Hospital Campus,London, UK Background: Metastasis to bone is a major clinical complication in patients with advanced prostate cancer (Pca)and can cause either bone forming or bone degrading lesions.Evidence from recent in vivo studies has identified an important regulatory function for the recycling collagen-binding and internalisation receptor Endo180 in bonedevelopment. Here we are investigating whether expression ofthis collagen receptor can be regulated in prostate bonelesions. Materials and Methods: Tissue biopsies from human prostate bone metastases were analysed by co-staining forEndo180 of human primary bone osteoblasts (hOBs) andprostate cells (PCs) derived from benign hyperplasias, primarytumours and various metastatic lesions were characterised fortemporal changes in mineral deposition, alkaline phosphataseactivity, collagen turnover and Endo180 expression inducedby either direct hOB-PC interaction or soluble factors releasedinto their conditioned media (CM). Quantification of Endo180expression was assessed by Western blot andimmunofluorescent staining analysis. Local ethical approvalwas given for the use of human tissues in this study. Results: Endo180 was strongly expressed by bothosteoblastic/osteocytic and prostate cancer cells located inmetastatic bone lesions. Levels of alkaline phosphatase activityANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3354and mineral deposition by OBs were reduced, whereas collagen production was increased by direct hOB-PCinteraction and soluble factors released by PCs with aninvasive phenotype. The constitutive expression of Endo180by hOBs was unaltered in co-cultures with all of the PCstested. Direct hOB-PC interaction, but not hOB CM, resultedin the up-regulation of Endo180 expression on PCs with aninvasive phenotype. Conclusion: Endo180 is strongly expressed in prostate bone metastases where its up-regulationin prostate cells is mediated by their direct interaction withosteoblasts. These findings suggest that the constitutivelyrecycling collagen receptor Endo180 could play an importantrole during active collagen remodelling associated with thepathology of these lesions. 354 ENDO180 TUMOUR Marjorie M. Walker, Jonathan Waxman and Justin Sturge Imperial College London, London, UK Purpose: In our previous work, Endo180 was found to have prognostic value for invasive basal breast carcinomas. Here weinvestigated Endo180 expression in prostate cancerprogression with its co-functional partners Tissue microarray (TMA) containing 169 prostate tissue samples clinicallygraded as benign prostate hyperplasia (pCk -) and epithelial (pCk+) cells in all tissue cores. Co-expression of Endo180 with vimentin, MT1-MMP and uPAR-uPA was also investigated. Significantdifferences categorical variables,including clinical grade and antigen(PSA), were determined using two-sided Tukey test, Results: Increased +/pCk-and Endo180+/pCk+cells confirmed gradescompared BPH. Epithelial Endo180 expression displayedstrong positive correlation with Gleason grade for which it wasa stronger predictor than serum PSA. Co-staining withvimentin, MT1-MMP, or uPAR-uPA by invasive tumor andreactive stromal revealed differential patterns ofexpression during disease progression. Conclusion: Endo180 is a reliable predictor of clinical grade, supporting its use as abiomarker for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The potentialmolecular interplay of Endo180 with MT1-MMP and uPAR- uPA be at distinct stages of prostate cancer progressionprovide potential new pathways to targeted in the preventionof metastasis. 355 PIK3CA AMPLIFICATION IS ASSOCIATD WITH Center and Institute ofOncology, Roentgena 2Department of Gynecologic 5, 02-781 Warsaw; 3Department of Biostatistics, The Maria and Institute of Oncology,Roentgena 5, 02-781 Warsaw; 4Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Brodnowski Hospital and II-nd Faculty of Medicine, Medical University,Kondratowicza 8, 03-242 Warsaw, Poland The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway controls important cellular processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. ThePIK3CA gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the PI3K is mutated and/or amplified in various neoplasms, includingovarian cancer. We aimed to evaluate PIK3CA alterations and their clinical importance in ovarian cancer patients. Molecular analysis was performed on 117 ovarian carcinomas with the use of qPCR, SSCP and sequencing. In agroup of 98 patients with complete clinical data, 62 patientswere treated with standard taxane-platinum regimens and 36patients with platinum-cyclophosphamide regimens. Amultivariate analysis was performed by Cox logisticregression models. PIK3CA mutations occurred in 5/117 (4.3%) carcinomas, exclusively in the endometrioid and clear cell types(p=0.0002); they were also associated with low FIGO stage (p=0.0003), low tumor grade ( p=0.045) and early age at diagnosis ( amplification strongly diminished odds of complete remission(p=0.033, OR=0.25) and platinum sensitive response (PS, p=0.004, OR=0.12) in the taxane-platinum treated patients. The odds of PS were also much lower in all patients with thePIK3CA amplification evaluated together, regardless of the treatment applied ( p=0.001, OR=0.18).Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3355Our results suggest that PIK3CA amplification may be a marker predicting ovarian cancer response to chemotherapy. 356 ARRAY-COMPARATIVE GENOMICHYBRIDISATION: A NEW TOOL IN CANCERDIAGNOSIS AND RESEARCH Aggeliki KolialexiDepartment of Medical Genetics, Athens University School of Medicine, Athens, Greece Genetic alterations are key features of cancer and typically target biological processes and pathways involved in cancerpathogenesis. DNA copy number changes are common incancer and lead to altered expression and function of genesresiding within the affected region of the genome. be rapid,less labour-intensive than karyotype banding analysis andhighly amenable to automation. a-CGH has provided newinformation on copy number changes in cancer on a genome-wide level and has doubled the detection rate of pathogenicchromosomal imbalances in patients. A number of newregions frequently involved in gains and losses have beenidentified and data obtained have been utilized in cancerclassification. This has been possible by increasing theresolution level from the 5 Mb obtained using conventionalcytogenetic techniques to as low as 100 kb by arraytechnology. More importantly, aCGH analysis has allowedaccurate localization of specific genetic alterations associatedwith tumor progression, therapy response, or disease outcome.Understanding cancer, however, will require profiling oftranscriptome, miRNAome, epigenome, and proteome to fullycomprehend complex tumor behavior. 357 ON THE TRAIL TO A CURE ? - APOPTOSIS VIA DEATH RECEPTORS IN EWING'S SARCOMA Udo KontnyDivision of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Center for Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University MedicalCenter Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany Ewing's sarcoma is the second most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. Tumors arise frommesenchymal stem cells and are characterized by fusion ofEWS with a member of the ETS family of transcriptionfactors. About 30% of patients present with metastatic disease.For these, as well as for patients with recurrent disease,survival rates are <20%. In order to identify new targets fortherapy, we have analyzed the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in Ewing's sarcoma. Whereas the majority of tumor cells bearreceptors for FasL and TRAIL, only the latter pathway provesto be intact in most tumor cells. In vitro , about 80% of cell lines are susceptible to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. In TRAIL-resistant cell lines absence of caspase-8 expression has beenidentified as a cause of resistance. Deficient expression ofcaspase-8 has also been observed in about 25% of Ewing'stumor specimens. Resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosiscan be overcome by incubating caspase-8-deficient cells withinterferon-gamma at concentrations achievable in humans.TRAIL has also been shown to be active against Ewing'stumors in vivo , in a mouse xenograft model. Whereas in this model the combination of TRAIL and interferon-gamma didnot increase suppression of tumor growth in primary tumorswhen compared to TRAIL alone, it was significantly moreactive in preventing the occurrence of metastases. Based onthese findings, the combined application of TRAIL andinterferon-gamma makes it an attractive candidate forevaluation in clinical trials in patients with Ewing's sarcoma. 358 IMPACT OF IFN- GENE ON 2Department of Biotechnology, Panjab University, Chandigrah, India. 3Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigrah,India Background: Cervical cancer, the second most common malignancy in women worldwide, is almost invariablyassociated with infection by human papillomavirus (HPV).However, although many women are infected with high-risktypes of HPV , only a subset of infected women will everdevelop cervical cancer. Therefore, host genetic factor mayplay a role in cervical carcinogenesis. Several studiessuggested that immunological components thus play a key rolein the development of cervical cancer. Interferon gamma (IFN-) is a cytokine produced by activated T-cells and natural killer(NK) cells that enhances cellular immune responses byincreasing T-cell cytotoxicity and NK-cell activity. Objectives: The striking correspondence the various biologicalactivities of IFN- and the immunological modificationsobserved in cervical carcinomas, prompted us to study singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP), T to A, located at the +874position and measure IFN- messenger RNA (mRNA) at the tumor site. Methods: DNA was isolated from peripheral bloodANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3356of 200 patients with cervical cancer and 200 healthy controls. The allele polymorphism at position +874 in the IFN- gene was studied by ARMS-PCR (Amplification RefractoryMutation System) and IFN- messenger RNA (mRNA) in the tumor was measured by means of a semi-quantitativepolymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Variation in thepromoter region through sequencing. Results: Genotypes ATand AA+AT OR=2.9, 95% reflected thesimilar level of mRNA expression of IFN- gene in patients suffering from cervical carcinoma to that in healthy control.Conclusion: This is the first study to provide evidence for the effect of IFN- on the risk of cervical cancer in North Indian population. 359 CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL FEATURES ANDPROGNOSTIC FACTORS Medicine, 2Human Pathology, and 4Division of Oncogenic and Persistent Viruses, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases,Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical andDental Sciences, 8-35-1 Japan Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human carcinogenic virus and is known to cause Burkitt's lymphoma, undifferentiatednasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin's disease and some typesof lymphomas. Its involvement was also found some of gastricadenocarcinoma cases, and about 10% of Although rarely expressed in EBV-GC, EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) is expressed in almost everyEBV-GC cell, suggesting its importance for developing andmaintaining this carcinoma. A recent study suggested thatEBER activates insulin-like factor-1 in EBV-GCs. down-regulation, frequently observed in EBV-GC, appears to give aselective advantage for carcinoma cells. Prognosticsignificance of EBV involvement in gastric carcinoma is yetto be established, although there is a study reporting afavorable prognosis in EBV-GC. In addition to p53 and beta-catenin expressions, we examined 59 EBV-GCs and 120 non-EBV-GCs forexpressions of MUC1, MUC2, and MUC6, which have been reported as significant prognostic markers as well asphenotypic markers for gastric carcinoma, by immunostaining.All the phenotypic markers examined in this study were down-regulated in EBV-GC when compared to non-EBV-GCs,suggesting that most EBV-GCs may be classifiedphenotypically as null phenotype or gastric phenotype.Survival analysis revealed that lymph node metastasis anddepth of invasion were significantly related to poor prognosisamong non-EBV-GCs. On the other hand, intestinal typeLauren classification and tumor with MUC1-positive andMUC2-negative expressions, in addition to lymph nodemetastasis and depth of invasion, were significantly related topoor prognosis for EBV-GCs. Interestingly, nuclear and/orcytoplasmic expression of beta-catenin was associated withbetter prognosis of EBV-GC. Factors involved in the prognosisof EBV-GCs and non-EBV-GCs might be different from School, University of Thessalia, Larissa, Greece A large number of molecular studies in recent years has revealed multiple interactions between HPV oncoproteins andtheir cellular targets, which result in alterations of the cellcycle control, apoptosis and telomerase up-regulation.Increasing emphasis has been placed on the molecular analysisof HPV in cervical samples, with HPV typing, viral-loadassessment and detection of HPV integration attracting theattention of most investigators. Although histopathologicevaluation remains the basic method for the diagnosis of HPV-related lesions and several studies have investigated therelationship of morphological findings to specific molecularevents, the routine application of techniques assisting thediagnosis is limited. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been employed, targeting antigens that are secondarily affected by the presence of HPVthrough several pathways. Since HPV oncoproteins inducealterations in the cell cycle, several associated markers havebeen investigated for their potential utility in assisting thehistopathologic classification of squamous intraepitheliallesions and facilitating the Ki67, PCNA, p16, cyclins andother molecules associated with regulation of the cell cycle. In most laboratories immunostains for p16, a cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor, and Ki-67 are the only routinelyAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3357used, cost effective surrogate markers for histopathologic diagnosis of HPV-related lesions. A review of publishedarticles concerning p16 applications reveals severaldiscrepancies and limitations. Positivity in squamousintraepithelial lesions varies from 14.3% to 100% in publishedstudies and this variation could be attributed to: a) differencesin the criteria for lesion diagnosis and for evaluation ofimmunohistochemical staining, b) differences in antibodiesand techniques used, and c) geographic differences in thedistribution of HPV types. Nevertheless, with increasingnumbers of cases in different studies there appears a smallgroup of high grade lesions that do not show anyimmunoreactivity. This observation diminishes the utility ofp16 as a screening test. Our laboratory has been recently involved in a project about cell cycle deregulation at G2M-transition checkpoint andbeyond. Following some preliminary data we investigated thepotential applications of cyclin B1 IHC in the diagnosis ofcervical lesions and have recently shown that patterns ofimmunoreactivity for cyclin B1 correlate to lesion cyclin immunoreactivity of . cyclin B1 immunoreactivityforecasted the detection of HPV by PCR in cases with dubiousmorphologic features, probably facilitating the recognition of\"pre-koilocytes\". INCENP, the archetypal chromosomal passenger protein and a component of the chromosomal passenger complex, hasbeen shown to be overexpressed in tumour cells and hasrecently been investigated by our group concerning its possibleutility as surrogate marker in cervical biopsy diagnosis and itsrelationship with high-risk HPV types. The potential applications of immunohistochemistry in thediagnosis of HPV-related cervical squamous intraepitheliallesions are not restricted to the above markers. Future studiescould identify an ideal test or panel of markers which wouldreliably predict progression. 361 SENSITIVE DETECTION OF OVEREXPRESSEDTUMOR-ASSOCIATED STRUCTURES ON Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90064, USA; 4University of California, MAE Department, La Jolla, San Diego; CA 92037, USABackgound and Objectives: One aim in cancer research is to reveal and detect novel tumor-associated membrane structures.Special acidic glycosphingolipids overexpressed on themalignant tissue have been shown to be important candidatesfor therapeutic issues. Monoclonal antibodies currentlyavailable are restricted in terms of specificities, and uniquetypes of these antigens fail to be detected this way. Theobjective of this project was to overcome the difficultiesconcerning the detection of tumor-associated antigens with lowimmunogenicity. Methods and Results: Antibodies were obtained from different tissue origins and by different methods,that is hybridoma technology, EBV transformation andantibody engineering. Tumor cells of different hystologicaltypes were investigated in a standardised enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) and thin layer chromatoraphy(TLC) with dot blot technique. Indirect immunofluorescence(IF) assay with FACS analysis and modified chamber slide IFtechnique with confocal laser microscopy were performed totest for fine specificity and the degree of expression. Thespecific antibody-based immunological techniques weresuitable to detect special characteristics of these acidicglycosphingolipids, highly associated with the cancerous tissue.Conclusion: The applied technique was suitable to define and bind to those tumor-associated cell surface structures that aredifficult to reveal because of their weak immunogenicity. Theresults are promising, as tumor diagnostic and antibody-basedtherapy may be better formulated for the control of the disease. The work was supported by grants from OTKA T048933 andFulbright No:120610. FIRST-LINETREATMENT AGAINST NSCLC: INTERIMANALYSIS OF A PHASE III TRIAL N. Mylonakis 1, A. Athanasiou2, J. Angel3, S. Lampaki4, of Athens; 7Regulon, Mountain View, California, and Athens, Greece Background: Lipoplatin is a liposomal cisplatin, designed to reducing efficacy. 28: 3157-3556 (2008) evade immune surveillance, extravasate preferentially into tumors and metastases and targetendothelial cells of tumor vasculature inducing cell apoptosisand antiangiogenesis. Human studies have shown a 40-200fold higher concentration of platinum in tumor specimens aftera single infusion compared to adjacent normal tissue.Lipoplatin has an orphan drug status for pancreatic cancer inthe EU. This is the initial report of a randomized phase IIItrial. Methods: Eligibility criteria included inoperable/ metastatic NSCLC, no previous PS 0-1,adequate end-organ Patients received Lipoplatin 120mg/m 2D1,8,15 (Arm A) cisplatin 100 mg/m2D1 (Arm B) with gemcitabine 1 g/m2D1,8, in 3-week cycles, with disease evaluation after 3 and 6 cycles. Primary endpoints were OS;secondary endpoints are ORR, DCR, PFS, and toxicity.Results: 88 patients treated, 47 with LipoGem and 41 withCisGem; 80 were evaluable. Response rates were (Arm A vs. B): vs.28%, SD vs.59%. PFS range is duration of response is 2.8-14.8+ vs.2.1-10.4+ (months); final data are pending. The only grade IV adverse event in LipoGem wasneutropenia in 2% of patients. were administeredin Arm A. Conclusion: Lipoplatin appears to have lower toxicity, mainly nephrotoxicity, as well as higher efficacy thancisplatin, when combined with gemcitabine in advancedNSCLC. Particularly relevant is that Lipoplatin is administeredwithout pre- or post-hydration, on an outpatient basis. 363 ASSOCIATION NUCLEOLI FRAGMENTATIONWITH CISPLATIN RESISTANCE G.K. 19014, Greece Background: Cisplatin has been one of the principal anticancer drugs for the last 3 decades and is widely used in the treatmentof several cancers. However, it is known to be implicated incases of development of drug resistance. It is well establishedthat there are several mechanisms of drug resistance in cancercells mostly involving increased production of specificproteins. The nucleolus represents a highly dynamic nuclearcompartment, easily visible by light microscopy, directlyinvolved in the fulfilment of the need for synthesis largeamounts of ribosomal RNA. Nucleolar morphology can beevaluated histologically nucleolar organizer regions (NORs). NORs are loops ofribosomal DNA within the nucleus that transcribe ribosomalRNA and are usually tightly aggregated within the nucleoli ininterphase cells. Alterations in the number and configurationof NORs have been demonstrated in several human neoplasmsand related to progression. In our previous study, NOR activityand morphology has been associated with the mechanism ofthe DHFR gene amplification during the Oncol Tumor Pharmacother, 2(1): 33, 1985, Experimental Cell Biology, 55: 69, 1987). The aim of this work is to examine the NOR activity and morphologyduring development of resistance to Cisplatin in vitro in HeLa cells. Methods: Acquired resistance to Cisplatin was induced in HeLa cells by gradually increasing doses of Cisplatinstarting from 0.05 g/ml. HeLa clones resistant to Cisplatin0.1 and 0.2 g/ml were established over a period of 4 months.AgNO 3staining was applied to resistant HeLa cell lines and their sensitive counterparts. Morphometric analysis of 100HeLa cells for each Cisplatin resistance level was applied for2-D measurement (pixels 2) of stained regions using Axiovision's LE morphometry application. The organizationpatterns of NORs were investigated size,configuration). Results: Non-resistant 1-3 small nucleoli (Figure1AB). number of nucleoli with irregular (Figure cells resistant to Cisplatin 0.2 g/ml exhibitedremarkably fragmented nucleoli. One large irregularly shapedand numerous small nucleoli were present in 100 % of thecells (Figure 1EF). Figure 1. NORs of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3359Measurement of the total 2-D NOR surface in the non-resistant and the two resistant HeLa cell lines did not show a significantdifference. However, if the number of individual NORs in eachnucleus were counted separately and independently of size, avery significant difference was noted between the non-resistantand the Cisplatin 0.2 g/ml resistant HeLa cells (Table). Table. Morphometric analysis measurements of HeLa resistant and non-resistant cells. Cisplatin (g/ml) 0 0.1 0.2 nuclei showed a total number of NORs rather close to non-resistant cell nuclei.However, the morphology of the large nucleoli was irregularand gave the impression of an aggregation of many smallernucleoli resembling a \"bunch of grapes\". Discussion and Conclusion: The present results showed that the development of resistance to Cisplatin is associated with obvious changesin the morphology of NORs in interphase nuclei of HeLacells. The total surface of the nucleoli in the Cisplatin 0.2g/ml resistant HeLa cells is obviously larger in comparisonto the non-resistant cells. Therefore, we may infer that theincreased surface of the nucleoli, due to their extensivefragmentation, is associated with the mechanisms ofresistance to Cisplatin. Whether, or not this feature isaccompanied with a higher production of rRNA should beinvestigated. 364 HELICOBACTER PYLORI INVOLVEMENT IN UPPER AND LOWER GI TRACT ONCOGENESIS IN GREECE Jannis KountourasDepartment of Medicine, Second Medical Clinic, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Ippokration Hospital,Thessaloniki, GreeceGastric adenocarcinoma not located in the cardia still remains second only to lung cancer as leading cause ofcancer-related mortality worldwide, althoughadenocarcinoma of the cardia and gastroesophageal junctionhas been rising rapidly over the past two decades. Gastricmalignancy can be subdivided into diffuse and intestinalpathological entities that have different epidemiological andprognostic features. Various genetic and environmentalfactors lead to either abnormal genes overexpression orinappropriate expression of normal genes, whose productsconfer the malignant phenotype. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori ) infection appears to be involved in gastric carcinogenesis through various molecular mechanisms,including repopulation of the stomach with bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMDSC) that may facilitate gastriccancer progression, thereby necessitating eradication of thisbacterium. In addition, H. pylori might be involved in the gastroesophageal reflux disease - Barrett's esophagus (BE)- esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) sequence and itseradication might inhibit the progress of this sequence.Although EA is now the most common esophagealmalignancy in Western countries whose incidence isincreasing faster than any other cancer, mortality fromesophageal cancer in Greece is among the lowest in theworld and no clear-cut answer has emerged as to why theincidence of EA is so low in Greece. Our findings indicatethe possible existence of a balance between cellproliferation (indicated by Ki-67 increased expression) andapoptosis (indicated by Bax protein overexpression) in BEpatients, thereby providing an equilibrium between cellapoptosis and cell proliferation, and this may partlyexplain the low EA incidence in Greece. Moreover, somereports have indicated an increased risk of colorectalcancer in patients with BE or EA. A possible associationof both diseases might be explained by geneticpredisposition or common environmental risk factorspossibly including H. pylori infection. Our findings established the presence of H. pylori in cancer tissues of the majority of colorectal cancer patients, and H. pylori infection might also recruit BMDSC that may ultimately facilitate colon cancer progression. Contrary to the data ofother countries, the incidence of cancer in Greek patientswith inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) also appears to below. In this respect, our preliminary results also suggest thepossible existence of a balance between cell pro-apoptoticand anti-apoptotic mechanisms in ulcerative colitis,indicated by Bax and Bcl-2 overexpression in 50% of thepatients, and a great propensity of pro-apoptoticmechanisms in Crohn's disease, indicated by Bax and Bcl-2 overexpression in 62% and 25% of the patientsrespectively, thereby reflecting a coherent apoptotic processthat might explain, at least in part, the low incidence ofcancer development in Greek IBD patients.ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3360365 INFLUENCE OF TWO LEGUMINOSAE PLANT EXTRACTS ON GROWTH ANDANTIOXIDANT DEFENSE SYSTEM OF Hep2 CANCER CELL LINE C. Spanou and D. Kouretas University of Thessaly, Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, 41221, Larissa, Greece Legumes are considered to be a very good source of phytochemical compounds that may act aschemopreventive agents especially by their antioxidantproperties (1). In a previous report we examined theantiradical and protective properties against free radical-induced DNA damage of extracts derived from variousGreek Leguminosae family plants (2). From the results obtained two extracts showing potent antioxidantproperties were chosen for further study. Aqueous extractsof aerial parts of Lathyrus laxiflorus and Phaseolus vulgaris plants were initially examined for their cytotoxicity properties on Hep2 cancer cell line. Theircytotoxicity was assessed at concentrations 100, 400, 800g/ml after 24h incubation with the extracts. Lathyrus laxiflorus plant extract exhibited 57% and 74% inhibition of cell growth at concentrations 400 and 800 g/mlrespectively, whereas Phaseolus vulgaris extract had no effect on cell growth in none of the tested concentrations.IC 50values for Lathyrus laxiflorus were 390 OHand ROOradicals respectively, whereas forPhaseolus vulgaris against the same radicals were >1600 g/ml and 17 g/ml (2). Non cytotoxic concentrations, Lathyrus laxiflorus and 800 g/ml of Phaseolus vulgaris extract, were used for 2, 12, 24 hours incubation of the cells. Theinfluence of the extracts on the antioxidant defense systemof the cells was assessed by measuring the totalantioxidant capacity of the cells (TAC) and the amounts ofcatalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), oxidized form ofglutathione substances(TBARS) all times of incubation of the cells. From theresults obtained it seems that only Lathyrus laxiflorus extract induces oxidative stress in the cells by reducingTAC, and CAT and inducing TBARS especially in 2 and12h of incubation. Phaseolus vulgaris extract reduced only TAC at 2h of incubation indicating also a mild inductionof oxidative stress. These results imply that potentantioxidant extracts, beyond a critical concentration, mayinduce oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in cells whichshows that antioxidant activity of various chemicals shouldbe considered with caution.1 Rochfort S et al: J Agric Scientist, ImmunoGen, USA Conjugation of cytotoxic compounds to antibodies allows targeted delivery of the cell-killing agents to tumor sites.Numerous conjugates of antibodies with maytansinoids,derivatives of a microtubule-binding compound, are indevelopment and several antibody-maytansinoid conjugatesare in clinical trials. Modifications of the linker that connectsthe maytansinoid to the antibody impact the intracellular retention of cytotoxic design of conjugates for the treatment of multidrug-resistant cancer and tumors that express the target antigen in aheterogeneous manner is discussed. 367 PRACTICAL USE OF TELEPATHOLOGICALCONSULTATION TO CANCERINCIDENCE STATISTICS Frick University Department of Forensic Medicine, 7624 P\u00e9cs, Szigeti \u00fat 12, Hungary It is a widely observed fact that the number of clinical autopsies around the world are decreasing, therefore theirrelevance in providing accurate statistics for the incidenceof cancers is also getting weaker. However, the number ofmedico-legal autopsies in our Institute are growing. Thistendency has been noted by several other universities. Ourgoal is to help improve the accuracy of these statistics bydocumenting all accidentally found tumors during amedico-legal autopsy, because these were not included inthe statistics numbers up to now. To gain useful data fromthese specimens, the histological slides have to bediagnosed by a pathologist, however, there is no one withsuch a qualification in our institute. The most promisingsolution for our endeavour in telepathological consultationis the use of digital microscopy. It permits the digitalmodelling of routine histological slides and it also allowsmeasurements by using analysis or stereology softwarepackages. The digital slide is nowadays a fast andaccessible item due to fully established broadband internetand local area networks (LAN). The MIRAX Desk (CarlZeiss, Germany) scanner we use turned out to be aneffective tool due to its high quality images and fastscanning process. By using the digital slide databasePathoNet (www.pathonet.org) and the MIRAX ViewerAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3361software we were able to set up a fast telepathological consultation process, which can connect us with anypartners around the globe with network access, herebyproviding an exact diagnosis of our specimen. 368 TARGETING CELL SURVIV AL AND APOPTOTICSIGNALING PATHWAYS Addanki P. Kumar Department of Urology University of Texas Health ScienceCenter at San Antonio, TX, USA Prostate cancer (PCA) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in western society. WhileAfrican American men have the highest incidence ofprostate cancer in the world Asian men native to theircountries who consume low fat and high fiber diet have thelowest risk. Migration of Asians to Western countries putsthem at high risk for prostate cancer. Epidemiologicalstudies also suggest that a reduced risk of cancer isassociated with the consumption of phytochemical-rich dietthat includes fruits and vegetables. Strategies to delayclinically significant prostate cancer will have a tremendousimpact in reducing the overall incidence of prostate canceras well as increasing quality of life for elderly men. Thelong latency involved in the development of clinicallysignificant prostate cancer provides plethora ofopportunities for its management especially usingprevention approaches. In addition cancer arises due toderegulation of multiple signaling pathways, thus targetingmultiple signaling pathways using a combination of agentsor complex botanicals have an added advantage inproviding synergistic or additive effects. Studies conductedin our Nexrutine R(bark extract from Phellodendron amurense ) inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cells and prostate tumor development in thetransgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP)model through modulation of Akt signaling pathway. Tofurther define the mechanism of action of Nexrutine Rand to identify the active component associated with itsbiological activity using activity guided fractionation wehave identified butanol fraction as the active component ofNexrutine R. Butanol fraction recapitulated the activities of NexrutineRin (i) inhibiting proliferation; (ii) inducing apoptosis; and (iii) modulating transcriptional activity ofNFB in prostate cancer cells. Our data also indicates that both Nexrutine Rand butanol fraction modulates NF B transcriptional activity by inhibiting I B phosphorylation.Expression of p65 and phosphorylated I B are high in tumors from TRAMP mice. In contrast dietaryadministration of Nexrutine Rreduced expression of p65 and phosphorylated I B in prostate from TRAMP mice that correlated with inhibition of tumor development. Inaddition using ultra-performance liquid chromatography wehave identified berberine or closely related compound maybe responsible for the observed biological activities in thebutanol fraction that may induce apoptosis in prostatecancer cells by targeting critical cell survival signalingpathways both in vitro and in vivo . Studies from our laboratory also identified potential role for Sp1-FLIP (FADD-Like interleukin-1-converting enzyme(FLICE) inhibitory protein) signaling for modulation ofapoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Data to demonstrate role forFLIP signaling or Akt/CREB signaling in prostate cancerprevention efforts will be discussed.

Genes regulated in the same way by threedifferent isoforms might also be important. PAX3 might usedifferent target genes in cells following different differentiationpathways. It is hoped that this study will illuminate the role of PAX3 in cancer and identify important molecular targets to be usedin therapy. 370 TELOMERASE ACTIVITY AS A DIAGNOSTIC AND PROGNOSTIC FACTOR IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER Zuzana Kunick\u00e1 and Proteomics, Institute of Faculty of Science,Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, CZ-62500 Brno; 2Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences the Czech Republic, Kralovopolska 135, CZ-61265 Brno; 3St. Ann's University Hospital, Pekarska 656 91 Brno, Czech Republic Activation of telomerase is tightly associated with many types of cancer, including head and neck cancer. We examine theuse of telomerase activity as a diagnostic and prognosticmarker of head and neck cancer development in comparisonwith standard histological analysis. Telomerase activity was determined using quantitative Dual-Colour Real-Time TRAP. In each of 58 patients, asample of tumour tissue and adjacent mucosa was collected.As a control, we collected samples of normal muscletissues. Telomerase activity was observed in 88% of tumour tissues and 34% of tumour-adjacent mucosa samples. Notelomerase activity was detected in normal muscle tissues.Telomerase activity correlated with tumour grade, showingan average of in well-differentiated, 8.3 in moderately-differentiated in differentiated tumours. Relapse occurred in 13patients and no telomerase activity was detected in 3recurrent tumours. Telomerase activity may be used as an objective parameter inversely related to tumour differentiation. Prognosis intelomerase-negative tumours is worse than that of thetelomerase-positive group due to a higher frequency ofrecurrences.The research was supported by the Czech Ministry ofEducation (MSM0021622415) and the Czech Academy ofSciences (A V0Z50040507 of 1Parasitology 2Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan,ROC Although baicalein has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in many human cancer cell lines, the exact molecularmechanism of apoptosis induced by baicalein in human livercancer J5 cells is unknown. The purpose of this study was toinvestigate whether or not baicalein affects the cell cycle andinduces apoptosis in J5 cells by flow cytometry. DAPI stainingand Comet assay were used to examine the DNA damage.Confocal laser microscope was used to examine thetranslocation of AIF and Endo G from mitochondria to nuclei.Western blotting was used to examine the associated proteinsin cell cycle and apoptosis. The results indicated that baicaleininduced G 2/M-phase arrest through the phosphorylation of cdc25c and cdc2, and inhibited cdc2-cycin B1 complex.Baicalein promoted the productions of reactive oxygen species(ROS) and Ca 2+and reduced the change in the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential in J5 cells. Baicalein-induced apoptosis also caused AIF and Endo G frommitochondria promoted the activations of caspase-9 andcaspase-3. Baicalein caused oxidative stress and decrease the productionROS and percentage of apoptosis. Matrix metalloproteinase(MMPs), one of the families of enzymes that degrade theextracellular matrix (ECM), are considered to play animportant role of tumor invasion and spread. We havedemonstrated that baicalein inhibits the invasion of J5 throughthe inhibition of MMP-9. 372 DEFINING THE ROLE OF THE TYPE-1 INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR (IGF-IR)SIGNALING IN CHILDHOODRHABDOMYOSARCOMA CELLS IN VITRO UNDER HYPOXIC GROWTH CONDITIONS Raushan T. Kurmasheva and Peter J. Houghton St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN 38105, USA Background: IGF-IR signaling in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cell thought to be dysregulated by overexpression ofthe IGF-II ligand. However, functional linkage between of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3363IR signaling and activation of a critical node in signaling, Akt, has not been defined. Further, the role of IGF-1R signaling insecretion of VEGF or IGF-2 is unknown. Methods: RMS cell lines were grown in vitro under normoxic (21% O 2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. Cells were treated for 24 h with CP751871 (1 g/ml), an antibody targeting IGF-IR. IGF-IR,Akt, GSK-3, S6 and their phosphorylated derivatives Levels of VEGF and IGF-2 weredetermined by ELISA. Results: Under treatment completely blocked IGF-I stimulation ofAkt phosphorylation in all cell lines. Under normoxicconditions in serum-containing media, treatment caused down-regulation of IGF-IR in 3 of 4 RMS lines but only slightlyreduced p-Akt levels. Under hypoxic conditionsphosphorylation of IGF-IR was significantly increased andCP751871 treatment markedly inhibited p-Akt in 3 out of 4RMS lines. These results indicate the predominant pathwayactivating Akt under hypoxia is up-regulation of IGF-IRsignaling. Of note, while cellular proliferation slowed underhypoxia, signaling through mTORC1 (the mTOR-raptorcomplex) was not attenuated, as S6 protein remainedhyperphosphorylated. Under these conditions there was noincrease in apoptosis in any cell line with or withoutCP751871. Furthermore, CP751871 had relatively modesteffect in reducing hypoxia-driven increases in VEGF secretion,and no significant effect on hypoxia-driven increases in IGF-2 secretion. Conclusion: Our results suggest that CP751871 treatment signaling in vitro . Under normoxia, inhibition of IGF-IR has relatively small effect onp-Akt levels, suggesting alternate receptor-mediated pathwayssignal to Akt. In contrast, under hypoxic conditions, secretedIGF-2 levels increase and activate IGF-IR, leading toactivation of Akt. Under these conditions, there is tighterlinkage between IGF-IR signaling and Akt activation,suggesting a switch to IGF-IR dependence. Current studies arefocused on defining whether CP751871 equally inhibits IGF-1 and IGF-2 andCA96696 and ALSAC. 373 THE DOUBLE HAZARD OF BLEEDING AND THROMBOSIS IN CANCER PATIENTS Hau C. Kwaan and Marjorie Barnett Hematology-Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL. 60611, USA Since Trousseau first pointed out the association between thrombosis and cancer, both thrombosis and bleeding incancer has been extensively studied. Major advances in basicand clinical investigations have enhanced our understandingof the pathogenesis of these complications. Recent epidemiological studies have also clarified the incidence ofthrombo-embolic complications in different types of cancer,with notably higher incidence in malignant hematologicaldisorders. The present day concept of thrombogenesis incancer remains to be based on Virchow's original triad ofaberrant blood flow, loss of vascular integrity and alteredblood components, but with added knowledge of theinfluence of cytokines, growth factors and prothromboticadverse effects of therapeutic agents and vascular accesscatheters. factors antiphospholipid syndrome and acquired activatedprotein C resistance. While most cancer patients experiencebleeding at some time during the course of their illness, thereare special situations that increase bleeding diathesis. Theseinclude thrombocytopenia, endothelial injury, disseminatedintravascular coagulation, excessive fibrinolysis, acquiredhemophilia and adverse effects of drugs. Recognition of thesefactors will help with the adoption of appropriate prophylacticand therapeutic 374 Sciences and Technology,University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy Cancer is often the result of a stepwise, chronic disease process encompassing an extensive segment of the lifespan ofany species. A common pathway in the natural history of thedisease is the appearance of focal proliferative lesions that areknown to act as precursors for cancer development. It isbecoming increasingly apparent that the emergence of suchlesions is not a cell-autonomous phenomenon, but is heavilydependent on microenvironmental cues derived from thesurrounding tissue. Specific alterations in the tissuemicroenvironment that can foster the selective growth of focallesions will be discussed. Furthermore, we argue that a fundamental property of focal lesions as it relates to their precancerous nature lies intheir altered growth pattern as compared to the tissue wherethey reside. The resulting altered tissue architecturetranslates into the emergence of a unique tumormicroenvironment inside these lesions, associated withaltered blood vessels and/or blood supply which in turn cantrigger biochemical and metabolic changes fueling tumorprogression. From this perspective, the slow build-up of alterations in the tissue and tumor microenvironments represent rate-limitingANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3364steps in cancer development. A deeper understanding of the role(s) of these changes in the pathogenesis of neoplasia isessential to design more effective strategies for themanagement of this disease.Supported in part by AIRC, Italy Milano, Italy For chemotherapy regimens, neurotoxicity is the most important non-hematological dose-limiting toxicity and thereare no guidelines for the treatment of chemotherapy-inducedperipheral neuropathy. We tested the efficacy pain following chemotherapy,prescribing 10 drops of each alcoholic preparation in theevening. We first tested the treatment in 7 patients with post-taxane neuropathic pain in the hands, present for at least 3months, refractory to gabapentin. In all cases, we observeda clinically significant reduction in hand pain about 3months after initiating the treatment. We next successfullytreated 5 breast cancer patients, with post-taxaneneuropathic pain which had been present for about a monthand 2 lung cancer patients with neuropathy of the hands andfeet who experienced pain reduction within 20 days ofinitiating treatment. We subsequently treated two furtherpatients one with lung cancer and the other with coloncancer. The former had had neuropathy of the hands andfeet for over a year, the second had a similar complaint fortwo years following treatment with oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil which worsened at night and disturbed sleep.The patient with lung cancer stopped taking the treatmentafter 20 days for lack of benefit. In the patient treated forcolon cancer, the symptoms in the hands resolved within 2months but the problems in the feet persisted. In this patientwe started weekly treatment with an injectablephytotherapeutic preparation The foot paresthesia improved after the first injection and further improved (no longerinterrupted sleep) after the second injection. A thirdinjection is planned and after that the oral treatment willcontinue.The encouraging results with these low cost phytotherapeutic preparations indicate that controlled studiesshould be performed to validate their efficacy. 376 RNA TECHNOLOGIES FOR REVERSAL OF ABCTRANSPORTER-MEDIATED MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE IN CANCER Hermann LageCharit\u00e9 Campus Mitte, Institute of Pathology, Charit\u00e9platz 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany ABC transporters can mediate the multidrug-resistance (MDR) phenotype of human cancer cells. Thus, disruptionof ABC transporter-mediated drug extrusion results in a re-sensitization of tumor cells to drug treatment. Lowmolecular weight compounds may circumvent MDR byinhibiting the efflux pump activities of the transporters.However, the innate side-effects of these compounds mustbe carefully considered. Thus, experimental genetherapeutic approaches using RNA technologies have beenapplied for inhibition of different ABC transporters. Thesetechniques include antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymesand chemically synthesized small interfering RNAs(siRNAs) or expression cassette encoded short hairpinRNAs (shRNAs) mediating the RNA interference (RNAi)phenomenon. In order to reverse different types of MDR,different ribozymes and siRNAs were designed to inhibitthe expression of the ABC transporters MDR1/P-gp,MRP2, and BCRP. These RNA constructs were used totreat different ABC transporter expressing cancer cell linesderived from various tissues. All RNA constructsdecreased the level of specific ABC transporter mRNA andprotein expression dramatically, and reduced the cellularresistance to drug treatment by enhancing the cellular drugaccumulation in vitro . Since all of the anti-ABC transporter RNA constructs showed gene-silencing activity,plasmid expression vectors were designed for stableexpression of shRNA molecules. Furthermore, expressionvectors were designed that encode a multitargetmultiribozyme (MTMR) or a multitarget-multi-siRNA/ribozyme (MTMsiR) simultaneously directedagainst three different transporters, MDR1/P-gp,MRP2, and BCRP. Transfection of these RNA constructsinto different MDR cell lines fully inhibited ABCtransporter expression at the mRNA and protein level andcompletely reversed the drug-resistant phenotypes. For in vivo application, shRNA encoding DNA was designed to reverse ABC transporter-mediated MDR phenotype. Anadenovirus- and an Escherichia coli -basing as a nonviral jet-injection technology were developedfor in vivo delivery of shRNA-vector constructs. Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3365377 RADIATION FROM SUN AND SUN-BEDS:CARCINOGENIC AND ANTICARCINOGENICEFFECTS Johan Moan, Z. Lagunova and A.C. Porojnicu Norwegian Radium Hospital, Institute for Cancer Research, Department of Radiation Biology, Montebello, 0310 Oslo,Norway All life, certainly including human life, has been developed under solar radiation. Humans and their ancestors have spentmost of their time under the strong fluence rates of theEquatorial sun, and are adapted to those. In fact, the action ofsolar radiation is so important for human health that the skincolor changed from black to white when humans migratedfrom their Equatorial home place to higher latitudes. In spiteof this evolutionary fact, the medical literature tells that ourattitude towards solar radiation has oscillated like a pendulum:from fear and avoidance to love and worship and back to fearagain. The reason for this is certainly that solar radiation hasboth positive and negative effects; all depends on exposuresand exposure patterns. With our current knowledge of actionspectra and dose-effect relationships for positive and negativehealth effects, we should be able to quench the oscillations andsettle at an intelligent behavior of optimal equilibrium. Skincarcinogenesis is certainly the major negative effect of sunexposure, while vitamin D formation is linked to a number ofpositive effects, one of which is anticarcinogenesis. Actionspectra for these effects will be reviewed: While those forvitamin D formation, for pigmentation, for erythema and fornon-melanoma generation are quite similar and located in theUVB region, that for melanoma generation has a significantcontribution in the UV A region. This has important healthconsequences: UV A has a much smaller latitude gradient thanUVB and decays less with time before and after noon. In viewof this it is possible to find a time and an exposure pattern thatis optimal for vitamin D generation at a minimal risk ofmelanoma. From our epidemiological studies we conclude that for European countries a moderate increase in non-erythemal sunexposure for those with indoor work would be associated withmuch larger positive than negative health effects. For instance,in Norway an increased exposure, leading to 200 moremelanoma deaths per year (a doubling) if non-optimallyobtained, would probably lead to more than 2000 fewerinternal cancer deaths. If the early humans had known sun-beds, all of us would probably still have been black. Our fear of \"artificial devices\"like sun-beds, should be reevaluated in view of the fact that ata given wavelength it is impossible to distinguish photonsfrom a sun-bed from photons from the sun. It is possible toconstruct sun-beds with spectra that are much more \"healthy\"than those of the sun. Such spectra would be stable and would not vary with time and localization like the spectra of the sun. 378 LYSOSOMES AND PROTEOLYTIC SIGNALLING INTUMOUR PROGRESSION Tamara T. Irena Zajc Department of Genetic Toxicology and Cancer Biology, National Institute of Biology, Ljubljana, Vena pot 111, 1000Ljubljana, Slovenia Altered lysosomal functions in tumour progression have not yet been completely revealed. These vesicles contain varioushydrolytic enzymes, including cathepsins, which are involvedin several cellular processes, both intracellularly as well asextracelluly after cathepsin secretion. Therefore, cells microenvironment, forexample in angiogenesis, are also mediated viacathepsins in addition to processes such as tumour cell invasion, apoptosisand drug resistance. These processes are associated withpartial or extensive degradation of protein substrates,trafficking and recycling of relevant biological molecules, suchas receptors and growth factors, and post-translationalmodifications of secretory proteins. A broad pH optimum andselective specific activity of these enzymes, being tuned by atleast three cystatins (stefins A and B and cystatin C), allowthem to participate in biochemical mechanisms underlyingtumour progression. Recent experiments using variousmethods for knocking out and silencing cathepsin genes innormal and tumour cells have clearly revealed differentialexpression and novel functions of these enzymes. They alsoaffect gene regulation in the tumour and in the surroundingcells, clearly depending on the cell type. A review of recentexperimental and clinical findings in glioma will be presented.It is concluded that, at least in brain tumours, cathepsin Bsupports tumour cell invasion and angiogenesis whilecathepsin L is more associated with apoptosis and drugresistance, whereas the role of cathepsin S is at present lessclear. 379 KEY ISSUE IN RESPECT TO STABILITY OFCYTOKERATIN18 Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; 2Department of pathology, Jen Ai Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan;ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 33663Department of Pathology, Tzu Chi Hospital and University, Hualien, Taiwan; 4Department of Nursing, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taichung, Taiwan; 5Department of Pathology, Hospital and Medical College of Chung Shan Medical University, ROC Intermediate filaments are important in building cellular architecture. Previously we found cytokeratin18 wasmodulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Plectin is across-linking protein that organizes the cytoskeleton into astable meshwork, which can maintain the uniform size andshape of hepatocytes. Because the cells of hepatocellularcarcinoma were morphologically different from thehepatocytes, we speculated that expression of plectin andorganization of intermediate filament might play roles inthe pleomorphism of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Westudied the hepatocellular carcinomaand liver tissues by andimmunoblot. results plectin was deficientand in hepatocellularcarcinoma. Furthermore, the plectin mRNAin Chang cells, revealed that plectin was deficient and theorganization of cytokeratin18 was altered. Conclusively,this study offers a hypothesis that plectin deficiently mightplay an important role in the tumorigenesis ofhepatocellular carcinoma. 380 STROMAL FGF-2 PARTICIPATES Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer Branch, Building 30 Room 211, 30 Convent Dr MSC4340, Bethesda MD 20892-4340, USA We have developed an experimental model of breast cancer in BALB/c female mice in which metastatic ductal mammarycarcinomas transit through different stages of hormonedependence. Hormone-dependent (HD) tumors need theexogenous administration of progestins to whilehormone-independent (HI) carcinomas grow in vivo without exogenous progestin supply, although they retain high levelsof estrogen and progesterone receptors (PR). In vitro , however, there are no differences in hormone responsiveness betweenboth tumor types, suggesting the involvement of host factorsregulating in vivo tumor growth. The mechanisms by which mammary carcinomas acquire hormone independence are still unknown. The aim of thisstudy was to evaluate the role of carcinoma-associatedfibroblasts (CAF) in the acquisition of hormone independence.We demonstrated that CAF from HI tumors (CAF-HI)growing in vitro express higher levels of FGF-2 than HD counterparts (CAF-HD). FGF-2 activated the PR in the tumorcells, thus increasing cell proliferation. CAF-HI induced ahigher proliferative rate in the tumor cells and in PR activationthan did CAF-HD. The blockage of FGF-2 in the co-cultures,and the genetic or pharmacological inhibition of FGFR-2inhibited PR activation and tumor cell proliferation. In vivo , an FGFR inhibitor reduced HI tumor growth, and exogenousadministration of FGF-2 to HD tumors promoted growth.T47D human breast cancer cells were also stimulated byprogestins, FGF-2 or CAF-HI, and this stimulation wasabrogated by antiprogestins, suggesting that the murine C4-HIcells respond as the human T47D cells. In summary, this is the first study reporting differences between CAF from HD and HI tumors suggesting that CAF-HI actively participate in driving HI tumor growth. 381 OBESITY PROMOTES GASTROINTESTINALCANCER IN Apc MUTANT MICE Claudia Gravaghi, Jin Division ofGastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine,Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY ,Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College ofMedicine, Bronx, NY , Laboratory of Comparative Pathology,Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY ,Laboratory Animal Research Center, The RockefellerUniversity, New York, NY , Department of Genetics, Harvard-Partners Center for Genetics and Genomics, Boston, MA,USA Epidemiological studies indicate a link between obesity and colon cancer. The main objective of this study was to produce a new mouse line that displays both obesity and intestinaltumorigenesis. To this end we have generated doublemutant Apc1638N/+mice. Homozygous db/db mice carry mutation resulting in premature termination of the intracellulardomain of the long form of the leptin receptor associatedwith a complex phenotype of obesity and diabetes mellitus.Mutant Apc 1638N/+mice progressively develop intestinal neoplasia and serve as a suitable model for humanadenomatous polyposis syndrome.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3367Heterozygous were then intercrossed to generate the obese double mutant offspring used in this study. All animals wereeuthanized at 6 months of age. The gastrointestinal tract wasremoved and paraffin sections of all regions were stained withhematoxylin and eosin to identify preneoplastic and neoplasticlesions. The main findings were (i) homozygous db/db mice did not develop gastrointestinal neoplasia, (ii) the introduction of thedb mutation into the mutant Apc 1638N/+ background not only enhanced Apc-driven development of small intestinal polyps but also induced the formation of gastric and colonic tumors.It is noteworthy that these tumors do not develop in singlemutant Apc 1638N/+mice at the age of 6 months age and are only infrequently observed in older Apc1638N/+mice. All tumors were adenomas. No gastrointestinal tumors were foundin wild-type littermates. These findings indicate that the hormonal and metabolic background of the db/db mouse exacerbates gastrointestinal neoplasia in the presence of a pre-existing Apc mutation and provide evidence of a mechanistic link between obesity andcolorectal cancer. 382 SMALL RENAL TUMOURS: SURGICALCONSERV ATIVE APPROACH A. , A. Minervini and Carini Department of Urology, University of Florence, Italy Introduction: The widespread use of ultrasonography has led to an increasing number of early detected/incidentally foundsmall renal masses, which are potentially suitable for nephron-sparing surgery (NSS). Presently, NSS is the accepted standardtreatment in patients with small renal tumors and a normalcontralateral kidney. We routinely perform the tumorenucleation (TE) technique, which consists of excising thetumor by blunt dissection without a visible rim of normalparenchyma. We report our experience with tumor enucleationin 303 patients. Patients and Methods: Between 1986 and 2004 303 patients with sporadic unilaterally RCC underwentNSS by tumor enucleation. In 232 patients, preoperativeimaging evaluation showed renal mass <4 cm in greatestdimension,pathological evaluation confirm pT1a Renal cellcancer. In 71 cases the tumors were >4 cm but <7 cm ingreatest dimension, and pathological review according to the2002 TNM classification showed that 42% of the tumors (30of 71) were pT1a, 44% (31 of 71) were pT1b 14% (10 of71) were pT3a. Results: 4 cm RCC. The mean (median, range) follow-up was 76 (61, 12-225) months. The 5- and 10-year cancer-specific survival were survivalwere 96% and 94%, respectively. Overall, 13 (6.4%) patients had disease progression, three of whom had local recurrencesalone (1.5%). 4-7 cm RCC. The mean follow-up was 74 months (median 51, range 12 to 225). Five and 8-year cancerspecific survival was 85.1% and 81.6%, respectively. Five-yearcancer specific survival in patients with pT1a (4 pT1band pT3a disease was 95.7%, 83.3% and 58.3%, respectively).Overall 10 patients experienced progressive disease (14.9%),of whom 3 had local recurrence (4.5%) alone or localrecurrence associated with distant metastases. Discussion: To avoid the risk of local recurrence, the excision of a minimaland visible margin of normal-appearing parenchyma aroundthe tumor is considered the standard surgical technique ofNSS. Recent reports concluded that the width of the resectionmargins does not correlate with disease progression and thatif the tumor is completely excised, the margin size isirrelevant, thus providing an intriguing insight into thepossibility of bluntly excising the tumor, such as a tumorenucleation. Conclusion: Tumor enucleation is a safe and acceptable nephron-sparing treatment that provides excellentlong-term local control and survival rates. 383 CURRENT CHALLENGES IN TUMORIMMUNOLOGY: BETTER UNDERSTANDINGTUMOR/IMMUNE SYSTEM laboratory, Notre-Dame,Montr\u00e9al, Cancer is a major challenge in our society; although early surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are effective andrecognized, cancer is still a major killer. Alternative strategiesare needed to improve outcomes for affected patients. Cancerimmunotherapy is based on prompting the immune system tospecifically recognize and kill tumours. Tumour regressionmediated by an immunological response has beendemonstrated in multiple clinical trials. However, we have toface a hard reality: the first generation of human cancerimmunotherapies, especially that emerging from animalmodels, is effective in a limited number of patients. Tumoursmay negatively influence the cancer-specific immuneresponse, and the search for major mechanisms mediatingimmune tolerance to tumours has been intense. Themechanisms include a lack of T-cell help, inadequate Tlymphocyte functions (proliferation, lysis, etc.), decreased TCR signalling, and local production of immunosuppressivefactors with many others (regulatory T-cells [Treg], MHCexpression by tumours, also being proposed. TheseANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3368mechanisms will be briefly reviewed and our recent data on tumour-influenced immunological environments will bepresented. Our recent immunotherapeutic strategies tooptimize antigenic presentation will also be described. Cancerimmunotherapy can work, and efficiency could be increasedonce we have better control of negative immune regulatorsfrom tumours, and develop more appropriate ways oftriggering a specific immune response. 384 GENETIC AND PROTEOMIC PROFILING OFPROSTATE CANCER PROGRESSION S.E.T. Walker2 and C.L. Hastie1 and Biomedical Sciences, University of Portsmouth; 2Department of Histopathology, Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth; 3Department of Urology, St Mary's Hospital, Portsmouth, UK Advanced metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) is usually treated with hormone therapy, though this is rarely curative. Inyounger men, with organ-confined disease, radicalprostatectomy is carried out to eliminate the risk of metastasisin later years. This procedure carries risks of impotence,urinary incontinence and even death. The aims of this project, therefore, were to investigate the genetic and proteomic profiles of PCa in patients with varyingstage and grade of the disease to identify prospectivepredictive markers of clinically significant PCa. To identify prognostic markers in both studies, samples were split into two groups: Gleason grade 7 and Gleasongrade <7. Using Taqman qPCR, a pilot study of geneexpression in FFPE prostate tissue (46 samples) wasexamined. Ninety-six genes of interest were identified fromliterature reviews and microarray data mining. Results of thisstudy show a significant difference ( p<0.05) in at least 10 of the genes analysed. Three of these are significant to p<0.025. These three genes are the first to be analysed further byimmunostaining of tissue microarrays to analyse proteinexpression, the results of which will be presented at thismeeting. Additionally, a novel 2D gel electrophoresis method,encompassing liquid phase IEF followed by large format SDSPAGE, and mass spectrometry has enabled the study of serumproteomic profiles. Study of the presence and absence ofproteins between the two patient groups (8 with Gleason <7,18 with Gleason 7) has revealed 6 proteins of interest. Massspectrometry analysis has identified 4 of these proteins andfurther analysis of two of the most interesting is currentlybeing undertaken. Western blotting data of the expression ofthese proteins will be presented at this meeting. 385 MANNOSE-6-PHOSPHATE/INSULIN-LIKE GROWTHFACTOR-II RECEPTOR IN HUMAN MELANOMACELLS: EFFECT OF LIGANDS AND ANTIBODIES ONTHE RECEPTOR EXPRESSION Friedemann Laube Institute of Physiological Chemistry, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, D-06097 Halle, Germany The Mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGF-II) R is a multifunctional transmembraneglycoprotein that induces cellular responses in special cells.Previous attempts have given controversial results about thesignal transduction capability of the receptor. However, morerecent studies have shown the capability of M6P/IGF-II R toinitiate transmembrane signalling (1). Human melanoma cells were used to detect the cell surface expression of M6P/IGF-II R by immunoluminescence. Theincubation of melanoma cells with M6P (5 mM) caused anincrease of the receptor signal of ~50%. Pre-incubation ofM6P-non-stimulated cells with cycloheximide (CHI, 10g/ml) reduced expression of ~15%, whereasactinomycin D (Act-D, 5 g/ml) did not. But 30 min pre-incubation of cells with the inhibitors following M6Pstimulation in the presence of Act-D or CHI caused areduction of transcription of 27% and a reduction of receptorprotein synthesis of 31%, respectively. monoclonalantibodies (mAb 2G11 and MEM-238) and a polyclonal Abwere used for the detection of the receptor. 2G11 was able tomimic the M6P ligand effect but MEM-238 did not. Thesignal by 2G11-stimulated receptor of M6P and 2G11 and thefailure of 2G11 to compete with the M6P action suggests thatboth effectors have different binding sites on receptor.Unlike 2G11, the mAb MEM-238 prevented the M6P epitopes of both effectors on the extracellular receptordomains 1- 3. MEM-238 recognizes an epitope between domains 2 and 5. Either the M6P binding site betweendomains 1- 3is essential for its stimulating effect or both M6P binding sites (domains 1- 3and 7- 9) have to be occupied by M6P for the receptor up-regulation.

Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, HETEROGENEITYOF GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME Libero LauriolaInstitute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy Glioblastoma is the most malignant among brain tumours with astrocytic differentiation. It is also the most frequent gliomaand affects primarily the cerebral hemispheres of adults, witha peak incidence in the fifth and sixth decades. The definition of glioblastoma, recalling an embryonal or poorly differentiated tumour, echoes the uncertainty stillpresent in the 1979 WHO classification. Glioblastoma is nowconsidered as derived by the neoplastic transformation ofmature astrocytes or astroglial precursors. The tumour ischaracterized by a high cell heterogeneity and pleomorphism,that complicates the description of all the tissue patterns andmorphologic variations of the neoplastic cells; however,scattered differentiated astrocytic neoplastic cells are alsofrequently present. In addition to the more common pattern,glioblastomas can be composed of small uniform cells,whereas other tumours can be prevalently composed ofpleomorphic giant sarcoma-likeglioblastoma, glioblastoma carcinoma-like features andthose containing metaplastic or cartilage. Vascularproliferation, with features of 'microvascular' or 'endothelial'proliferation, and necrosis, consisting in large areas of tissuedestruction or small foci of 'pseudopalisading' are cardinalfeatures of glioblastoma. The finding of areas of well-differentiated astrocytic neoplastic cells coexisting with glioblastoma in cases of longclinical duration led to the conceptual distinction, firstlymade by Scherer in 1940, between 'primary' and 'secondary'glioblastoma. Primary and secondary glioblastomas are nowconsidered distinct subtypes, affecting different age groupsand developing through different genetic pathways.Interestingly, they show different expression of somemolecules and different responses to therapy. The diagnosisof secondary glioblastoma requires clinical and histologicalevidence of derivation from a low grade astrocytoma (WHOgrade II) or anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III).Primary glioblastomas pursue a short clinical course and donot show histological evidence of a less malignantcomponent. These glioblastoma subtypes also differ at themolecular level. Ohgaki et al. (Cancer Res, 64: 6892-6899, 2004) on a large population-based study demonstrated thatTP53 mutations are the most frequent genetic alteration insecondary glioblastoma and are also present in the precursorlow-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma. On the other hand,EGFR amplification, a possible target for therapy, and PTENmutation were detected more frequently in primary (36% and25%, respectively) but very rarely in secondary glioblastomas. 387 THE EMERGING SIGNALING VRK1 PATHWAY ANDITS IMPLICATIONS IN PROLIFERATION AND DNADAMAGE RESPONSE VRK a new subgroup in the human kinome with two active members with a conserved catalyticdomain and unrelated regulatory domains in their C-terminus. Human VRK1 is the better known member. VRK1 gene expression is regulated by entry and exit in the cell cycle. Thekinase activity is regulated by phosphorylation by growthfactors. Furthermore, induction of DNA damage by UV light,doxorubicin, or etoposide induces an additionalphosphorylation that further raises the kinase activity. VRK1 ismostly located in the nucleus, particularly in proliferatingcells. Among its targets are p53, c-Jun and ATF2. VRK1specifically phosphorylates p53 in Thr18 preventing itsinteraction with Hdm2; thus stabilizing p53 and leading to itsaccumulation and induction of growth arrest. This arrest wouldbe permanent unless an autoregulatory mechanism toeliminate VRK1 was functional. This mechanism has beenidentified as being regulated by a transcriptionally active p53,and its structure is similar to that of the p53-Hdm2autoregulatory loop. Active p53 induces a gene, DRAM , that targets p53 for its proteolytic down-regulation via the lysosomal pathway; VRK1 requires an inducible proteolyticdegradation because it is a very stable protein with a half-lifeof several days. The existence of this pathway predicts that intumors with p53mutations, there should be an accumulation of VRK1 protein. This was confirmed in a series of lungcarcinomas, where VRK1 accumulates if they harbor a p53 mutation. A similar finding has been detected in breast cancer. The knock-down of VRK1 by siRNA results in a block in cell cycle progression, due to the contribution of VRK1 as an early gene, expressed at the same time as MYC and FOS oncogenes and required for cyclin D1 expression. VRK1 lossis accompanied by a loss in phosphorylation of RB suggestingit is required very early in cell cycle progression, probably inthe G0 exit to G1 and before the restriction point. This loss isaccompanied by accumulation of cell cycle inhibitors, such asp27, consistent with the cell cycle block. In human head andneck squamous cell carcinomas, VRK1 positively correlateswith proliferation markers 67, II, and cyclins. These correlationsANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3370indicate a role early in the cycle. However, VRK1 can play additional roles in proliferating cells, such as participating inresponses to DNA damage. VRK1 activity can also be regulated by interaction with other proteins. VRK1 interaction with nuclear Ran regulatesVRK1 activity. Interaction with RanGDP inhibits VRK1kinase activity, but the interaction with RanGTP recovers theactivity. RanGDP inhibits the way, an asymmetric distribution of VRK1 activity in thenucleus can be achieved. Early during mitosis it is necessary to fragment the Golgi apparatus in order for it to be redistributed in daughter cells.VRK1 is a necessary step required for Golgi fragmentationacting downstream of MEK1 and PLK3. VRK1 is target of PLK3. VRK1 is a novel kinase that participates in several processes related to cell cycle progression. 388 PROTEINPROFILING FOR IDENTIFICATION OFBREAST CANCER BIOMARKERS IN TEAR FLUIDAND SERUM Lebrecht , D. Boehm, H. Koelbl and F. Grus Dept. of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Johannes Gutenberg- University, Mainz, Germany Introduction: In patients with breast cancer early diagnosis is important for survival. Actually mammography is the bestavailable method. Although sensitivity is high, specificity isrelatively low. New biomarkers are needed to improve theearly detection of breast cancer. The aim of the study was togenerate a protein biomarker profile in tear fluid and serumfor breast cancer patients. We used this established biomarkerprofile subsequent to discriminate between cancer patients andhealthy controls. Methods: We screened for potential biomarkers in tear fluid and serum 60 women with breastcancer (CA) and 60 healthy women (CTRL), matched to theage. Blood samples and tear fluid were drawn prior to surgery.We used SELDI - TOF - MS (Surface Enhanced LaserDesorption Ionisation - Time Of Flight - Mass Spectroscopy)for protein profiling. Three different active surfaces of theprotein chips were used: cationic exchanger(CM-10),hydrophobe surface (H50) and metal ionic affinity surfacewith different binding properties. The chips were read by massspectroscopy and the analyses were done by multivariatestatistics. Results: In a pilot study with 20 patients we found complex protein and peptide distributions on all three surfaces.We identified the main proteins in tear fluid, like lysozymeand lipocalin. Between breast cancer patients and healthycontrols we found statistically significant differences in theprotein profiling ( p<0.001). Second we used SELDI-TOF-MS for protein profiling with two different active surfaces of theprotein chips, a cationic exchanger (CM-10), and a reverse-phase surface (H50) in 100 patients. The data were analyzedby multivariate statistical techniques and artificial neuralnetworks. Both, in tear fluid and in serum, we could generatestatistically significant biomarker panels ( p<0.0005). The diagnostic pattern could differentiate CA from CRTL with aspecificity and sensitivity of about 70% in tear fluid and aspecificity of 77% and a sensitivity of 85% in serum.Conclusion: It was successful to generate biomarker panels in tear fluid and blood to discriminate breast cancer patients andhealthy women. With the help of neural networks these panelsshow a respectable sensitivity and specificity. The protein chiptechnology could greatly facilitate the discovery of new andbetter biomarkers. It is a promising approach to analyse a highnumber of patients. Analysing tear fluid may be useful forhigh-throughput biomarker discovery. 389 INITIAL TUMOR GROWTH AND TUMOR University of fibroblasts that are activated by tumor-derived cytokines play a crucial role for tumor growth and invasion.In the HaCaT-model of skin carcinogenesis, we identifiedPDGF-BB and VEGF-A activated fibroblasts as key mediatorsdriving initial tumor growth and tumor invasion. PDGF-BBinduces the conversion of immortal non tumorigenic HaCaTcells to benign tumor growth by differentially regulatingcytokine expression in stromal fibroblasts, by promoting theirdifferentiation into myofibroblasts and by enhancing pericyterecruitment. De novo expression of murine VEGF-164 inducesmalignant and invasive tumor growth of the before nontumorigenic HaCaT cells, associated with a strong andongoing activation of myofibroblasts. However, the VEGF-induced tumors are ulcerated with a disorganized epitheliumthat is interrupted by lacunae with limited basementmembrane and endothelial cell coverage. Additionally, vesselmaturation is strongly impaired. Tumor and vesselmicromorphology are markedly improved by the combinedexpression of PDGF-BB and VEGF-A, leading to a similartumor growth but more compact tumors with a maturefunctional tumor vasculature. Invasive growth of the tumorcells is dependent on the presence of fibroblasts and ismediated by their VEGF and PDGF induced MMP-expression.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3371Specifically the expression of MMP-13 by activated fibroblasts is essential for ongoing angiogenesis and invasionof malignant skin SCCs. These data highlight the importanceof cytokine activated fibroblasts in promoting tumor growthand progression and emphasize the importance of interferingwith the tumor-fibroblast interactions for an efficient tumortherapy. 390 TUMOR-LOCALIZED LIGATION OF CD3 AND CD28 WITH SYSTEMIC REGULATORY T-CELL DEPLETION INDUCES POTENT INNATE AND ADAPTIVE ANTITUMOR RESPONSES Chien-Hsin Lee , Yi-Shen Chiang, Shih-En Chang, Chin-Liew Chang, Bing-Mae Cheng and Steve R. Roffler Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC Tumor-localized activation of immune cells by membrane- tethered antibodies is currently under investigation to treatpoorly immunogenic tumors. Here, we investigated themechanism of antitumor by tumor-locatedexpression of tumor in subcutaneous,peritoneal and metastasis models, and protected mice fromrechallenge with B16 melanoma cells. However, in vivo antitumor activity against primary depended on NK cells rather than CD4 Treatment of in tumors increased and B16/3L86 tumors were completely rejected in a CD8+and CD4+T-cell-dependent fashion. Furthermore, fibroblasts expressing CD3L and CD86 suppressed growth ofneighboring B16 cancer cells in vivo and direct injection of expressing antibody significantlysuppressed results show that tumor-located ligation of CD3 and CD28 can activate both innate (NKcell) and adaptive (CD4 +and CD8+T-cell) responses to create a tumor-destructive environment to control tumorgrowth, but modulation of Tregs is necessary to unmasklocal adaptive antitumor responses. Depletion of Tregs andpharmacological stimulation of NK cell activity are potentialavenues to increase efficacy of therapies that activatelymphocytes viaCD3, including bispecific antibody therapy of cancer. HIGHLY and Cellular Biology, National Taiwan University, Taiwan; 2Department of Nutrition and Health, ToKo University, Taiwan; 3Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taiwan; National Taiwan University, Taiwan; 5Institute of Physiology, National Yang Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC Recently, highly invasive tumor cell lines (designated A431- I, -II and -III) derived from parental A431 tumor cells (A431-P) were isolated in our laboratory by three successivepassages through a Boyden chamber with matrigel-coatedmembrane support. The invasive potential and the activity ofsecreted MMP-9 of each subline increased > A431-II > asevidenced the invasion assay, gelatin zymography and immunoblotting analyses. RT-PCR results also revealedthe MMP-9 in A431-III. We furthercharacterized the A431-III subline and found that these cellsexhibited a greater potential for attachment and spreading onfibronectin-coated substratum and for migration. The A431-III cells displayed multiple cytoplasmic extensions with focalcontacts (vinculin-positive staining) during cell spreading.Our results indicate that an increase in MMP-9 secretioncould disrupt the E-cadherin complex of proteins and lead tothe loss of cell adhesion. It is well known that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) can result in the loss of E-cadherin. Therefore, we decided to investigate whether MMP-9 could induce EMT in a highly invasive A431-III tumor cellsub-line. In this study, we noticed a strong multigenesignature indicative of EMT as identified by microarrayanalysis. The observation of the increase of EMT markerproteins was supported these results demonstratethat the greater invasion potential exhibited by the highlyinvasive. In conclusion, the invasiveness of the A431-IIIsubline is likely attributed to an increased ability forattachment, spreading and migration, as well as increasedMMP activity. That action of MMP-9 on cancer cells caninduce EMT provides insight into novel therapeutic targets.A431-P and the highly invasive A431-III subline could be anexcellent model for studying the mechanism of cancermetastasis. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3372392 DNA U87 GLIOBLASTOMACELL LINE S.Y . Lee , S.P. Yip and S.S.T. To Dept. of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, HongKong SAR, China Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a new modality of cancer therapy which relies on the use of light and thepreferential accumulation of photosensitisers in neoplastictissues to kill cancerous cells. PDT is suitable as an adjuncttherapy for glioma. However, the failure of PDT to have anyeffect has been reported in some studies, and the underlyingcellular mechanisms leading to failure are still unknown.DNA repair mechanisms may account for reported PDTfailures. During the course of PDT, reactive oxygen speciesgenerated by the photosensitiser may interact with DNA,causing chromosomal damage and mutations. This in turnleads to apoptosis and necrosis in the cancerous cells.However, if the DNA lesions caused by PDT are repaired, thecells may survive the damage induced by PDT. Wehypothesise that if the expression of DNA repair proteins ishigh in glioma cells, the cells can efficiently repair the DNAdamage caused by PDT. Consequently, these glioma cellsbecome more resistant to PDT and therefore are notsusceptible to the actions of PDT. Objectives: To investigate the role of DNA repair mechanisms in glioma cells resistantto Photofrin-based PDT. Methods: The expression levels of DNA repair messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNA) and DNArepair proteins in different grades of Photofrin-PDT-resistantU87 glioma cells were examined using quantitative real-timepolymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The mRNAexpression data were further analysed by one-way analysis ofvariance followed by Tukey post-test. Six specific genesrepresentative of six DNA repair mechanisms were examined.Results: Four of the DNA repair genes investigated have comparable mRNA expression levels between the controlsand Photofrin-PDT resistant homolog 2 ( E. coli )) DNA damage and the REV1 (REV1 homolog ( S. cerevisiae )) gene of The mRNA transcripts of these two genes wereexpressed at a significantly higher level in Photofrin-treatedcells ( p<0.01) when compared with the control cells. Increased expression was observed from 30 minutes to 48hours post-treatment with Photofrin. These results were alsoconfirmed at the protein level by Western blotting. Thissuggested that induced expression in both genes occurredimmediately in treated cells after irradiation with the lightsource. Conclusion: Since high mRNA and protein expressionof ALKBH2 and REV1 were observed in Photofrin-PDT resistant glioma cells but not in control cells, the resultsindicate that both DNA damage reversal and translesionsynthesis mechanisms may play important roles in Photofrinresistance. High expression of REV1 also indicates that muchDNA damage is produced during Photofrin-PDT and cannotbe repaired. Further work is in progress to investigate therelationship between the expression of DNA repair proteinsand Photofrin resistance by using silent RNA, and to evaluatethe types of DNA damage generated by Photofrin. 393 RADIATION-INDUCED CHANGES IN THE MOUSE BRAIN PHOSPHOPROTEOMEANALYZED BY DIFFERENTIAL 16O/18O D. Lehmann1 1Molecular Structure Analysis, Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg,Germany; 2Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel AvivUniversity, Tel Aviv, Israel Differential 16O/18O proteolytic labeling (1) is a versatile method in analytical proteomics for relative quantitification oftwo samples. The latest version of MASCOT contains a toolfor relative quantification within pairs of 16O/18O labeled peptides (2). Experimental and procedural parameters for LC-MS/MS analysis were set-up, which allowed an accuratequantification using this tool. This is demonstrated usingstandard peptide mixtures and ovalbumin digest mixtures. Themethod was then for the first time applied to quantitativeproteomic analyses in a complex sample. Quantitative changesin the mouse phosphoproteome induced by irradiation-inducedDNA damage before and after treatment with a dose of 10 Gywere investigated. For this purpose, mouse brain proteome samples were prepared and digested with trypsin, using 16O water for the treated sample and 18O water for the control sample. After combination of a pair of samples, fractionation of the complexpeptide mixture by mixed-bed ion-exchange chromatographywas performed. Each fraction was subjected tophosphopeptide enrichment by IMAC and both the flow-through fractions and the phosphopeptide fractions wereanalyzed separately by nanoUPLC-MS/MS. For thequantitative analysis, all data were combined into a single fileand analyzed by MASCOT. As a result, 342 proteins wereidentified. In the analysis of phosphorylation sites, 174phosphopeptides were identified, of which 24 were up- ordown-regulated by more than a factor of 2. Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3373Several up-regulated phosphorylation sites observed stem from proteins known to be involved in signaling cascades orDNA-binding. These include ERK, MAP tau, MAP 2, MAPkinase-activating death domain, p130Cas-associated protein,R3H domain containing protein, etc. The results are discussedin relation to the involvment of known signaling cascades inthe response to radiation induced DNA damage. It isconcluded, that the 16O/18O method is suitable for monitoring quantitative changes in the phosphoproteome of complexprotein samples. 1 Schnolzer M, Automated comparative proteomics based on multiplex tandem stable isotope labeling. Mol. Cell. Proteomics 401- 411, 2006. 394 OF U682, 3 avenue Moli\u00e8re, F-67200 Strasbourg France Culture of cancer cells is widely used for testing antiproliferative drug response in cancer research. Cellresistance against antineoplastic agents often results frommobilization of various factors, the modulation of which islinked to the culture conditions. Most of the protocols utilizecells growing in [air+5-10%CO 2] atmosphere thus achieving a 19-20%O2level. Under these conditions, cells are growing in hyperoxic environment, as the highest physiological partialoxygen pressure (pO 2) found in mammals is 16% ( e.g.blood from hepatocyte artery). Most of the cells within solid tumorsare exposed to a low pO 2, this hypoxic condition ( e.g.0.1- 5%O2) being linked to their location within the tumor, the tumor compaction, and the presence or absence oflymphovascular tumor emboli. This low pO 2 affects notably cell physiology, the level of ROS generated and the cellgrowth in response to various drugs. In this study we addressed the variation of the pharmacological response of MDR and non-MDR variants ofLoV o colon carcinoma grown either in hypoxia (5%O 2) or in standard conditions (20%O2), using a multigas incubator. Wehave tested the effect of pO2on the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin, cisplatin, 5-FU and combinations. Drugs werecontinuously present and proliferation was monitored every 3day during 9 days. In the absence of drugs, all LoV o variantsgrew notably faster at 20%O 2than at 5%O2[3X for MDR, for sensitivities of bothvariants to and cisplatin lowered 2compared to 20%O2. Non-MDR and MDR cells that were never exposed to the drug, showed a relative highresistance to 5-FU (IC 50: 0.36 M; 0.55 M, respectively) that was not affected by pO2. Our results underline the importance of evaluating the role of hypoxia on the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agentsand on the proliferative status of cells. These data will bediscussed taking into account the drug metabolism withrespect to environmental oxygen pressure and cell cultureconditions. 395 SPATIAL REDISTRIBUTION OF P-GLYCOPROTEINLINKED TO ESTRADIOL TREATMENT INENDOMETRIAL AND PROSTATIC F-67091 Chemoresistance in oncology refers to complex and multifactorial process involving various cellular pathways.One of the most studied causes of multidrug resistance (MDR)is related to various ABC transporters being capable ofovercoming cytotoxic xenobiotics e.g. anticancer agents aggression of the cells by mean of active efflux. Among these,P-glycoprotein (Pgp, ABCB1) is often representative ofindividual cell resistance particularly when overexpressed inthe plasma membrane of multidrug resistant cancer cells.Although this pericellular location is related to \"standard\"MDR phenotype, intracellular location of such transporter(s)in numerous non-MDR tumor cells has also been described.It was hypothesized that this peculiar location could be inrelation either with a primary defense mechanism e.g. involving cytosolic \"scavenging\" of the drugs or would berelated to another physiological pathway, to date unknown.Being interested in MDR phenotype emergence in hormone-dependent cells, apart from cytotoxic drug challenge andselection, endometrial cell lines from our laboratory werescreened for presence of P-glycoprotein in conjunction withestradiol treatment. Variants of Ishikawa endometrialcarcinoma cell lines with 17-beta-estradiol (E2) and towards tamoxifen werestudied. As E2 plays an important role in male physiology viathe androgen receptor (AR), the prostatic LNCaP cell line wasANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3374also used in this study. All cell lines showed cytosolic location of P-glycoprotein in the absence of E2. Estrogen receptor (ER)was detected in all endometrial cell lines and underwentcytosol to nuclear location upon E2 treatment of the cells. ERwas present in LNCaP cells as well. By far more intriguingwas the overall spatial tissue redistribution of Pgp from apatchy-like to an islet-like pattern when Ishikawa monolayerswere treated with E2. Emerging evidence exists to suggest thatsome of the pivotal cancer-related biological events depend onmulticellular interactions between cell sub-populations that aresubjected to Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala University, SE-751 24 Uppsala, Sweden The emerging connections between growth factor-induced signal transduction and the DNA repair machinery will bedescribed, stressing implications for radiotherapy.Furthermore, the prospect of developing targeting agents,which selectively deliver radioactivity to the tumor and at thesame time radiosensitize tumor cells will be discussed. Inaddition, the possibility of increasing radiosensitivity by theuse of low molecular weight compounds will be addressed. 397 REGULATION OF MAP KINASE SIGNALING INRESPONSE TO Ludwig for Cancer Research, Uppsala University, Sweden The MAP kinase family is evolutionary conserved and mammalian cells contain several MAP kinase pathways, e.g. Erk1/2, p38, Jnk and Erk5. Several biological responses arecontrolled by MAP kinase activity and both the magnitude andkinetics of activation encode information for the cell on how torespond to the stimulus. A large fraction of human tumor cellshave augmented MAP kinase activity, emphasizing theimportance of these pathways in the development of cancer.Improper MAP kinase signaling can be caused by oncogenicactivation of an upstream component such as Ras or loss of anegative regulator. This presentation will discuss theimportance of the negative regulator MAP kinase phosphatase3 in proper Erk1/2 activation in response to PDGF, as well ascross-talk between the Erk1/2 and Erk5 cascades. We havefound that PDGF induces a rapid proteasomal degradation of MKP3, which is necessary for Erk1/2 activation to occur.Moreover, prolonged PDGF stimulation induces expression ofthe mkp3 gene and subsequent increase in MKP3 protein level. The re-synthesis of MKP3 plays an important role in reducingErk1/2 signaling at a later stage. Thus, MKP3 has a centralrole in two phases of signal transduction: first a rapid feed-forward mechanism and second a later feed-back loop.Furthermore, we have data suggesting that activation of Erk5and Erk1/2 in response to PDGF negatively regulate eachother in a reciprocal manner, providing an additional level ofMAP kinase activity regulation. 398 BEDSIDE TO BENCH: PROFILING BIOLOGICALLY BASED CAM PRODUCTS IN MALIGNANCY USING THE HERBALCOMPOUND ESSIAC AS A CASE STUDY Blair J.N. LeonardMcMaster University, Hamilton, Canada The use of biologically based complementary alternative therapies (CAM) in patients with malignancy is a welldocumented phenomenon of international scale, with differentstudies estimating use in 20-80% of cancer patients dependingon the studied population. Biologically based CAM use inmalignancy is not benign, with several in vitro and clinical studies documenting adverse interactions between commonCAM therapies and conventional chemotherapeutic treatments.Despite widespread use and the establishment of evidence-based practice guidelines in oncology that call for furtherresearch into these therapies, many commonly used therapiesremain largely unstudied. An archetypal example of such pharmacological therapy is Essiac tea, a proprietary mixture of four herbal compoundsthat has been available without restriction for use in cancerpatients for over 80 years. Several recent large studies of CAMuse in oncology patients have confirmed Essiac as a popularchoice, including documenting its concomitant use during bothconventional radiation and chemotherapeutic management ofmalignancy. Despite this, rational and rigorous approachesadopting the scientific method to understand thepharmacological, as well as the pathophysiological propertiesof Essiac are lacking in the peer reviewed medical literature. This presentation will outline the body of peer reviewed basic research involving Essiac that is currently available.Specific attention will be placed on the recent in vivo and in vitro series of experiments that investigated several alleged medicinal qualities of Essiac, as well as the potential for aharmful side-effect profile. Data derived from theseinvestigations and others have identified pharmacologicalcharacteristics of Essiac that make it of interest for furtherAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3375investigation: data that is freely available for access and appraisal by health care practitioners and their patients forinformed choice. This last point underscores the overridingtheme of the presentation, as previous studies identified thatpatients derive much knowledge on which they base decisionsabout their CAM-related health care on unreliable, non-peerreviewed sources. 399 A TWENTY YEAR JOURNEY TO UNDERSTANDING AND TREATMENT OF THE CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROMEINCLUDING A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF GROUPS A AND B CFS PATIENTS, 2000-2006 A. Martin Lerner32804 Pierce St, Beverly Hills, MI 48025 USA The Energy Index point score (EI), (copyright, Lerner AM and Deeter RG, 1999), (0-10) is a simple reliable metric easilyevaluating the functional capacity at each CFS patient-physician visit. A hanging sign in the examining room, withphysician and patient together, is used. Validation of the EI wascarried out using two methods: a) 20 CFS patients and 22healthy adults, matched for sex, age, place and time; EI,CFS=3.6; EI, healthy adults=9.9, p0.0001, and b) 55 CFS patients evaluated at the same time by the EI and FatigueSeverity Score, correlation 0.67, p=0.0066. Improvement to disappearance of CFS symptoms correlate with an increasingEI. The validated Energy Index (EI) point score (1-10) was calculated for each CFS patient every 3 months at physicianvisits. A CFS patient has an EI5. A CFS patient with an EI of0 is bedridden; a CFS diagnosis is no longer present at anEI>5. The EI effect size is 0.25, a medium effect size is 0.5. Alarge effect size is >0.8. Administrations of antiviral drugswere given within a defined pharmacokinetic therapeuticwindow. Eighteen CFS 5 mg/kg q12 h for 30 days. At evaluations, 24 weeks later, 13 patients (72%) returned to theirpremorbid healthy states (Infectious Diseases in ClinicalPractice, 6: 110-117, 1997). In a second study, 25 CFS patients with elevated serum antibody titers to Epstein-Barrvirus antigen (Diffuse) and/or capsidantigen (VCA, IgM) were treated with valacyclovir (14.6mg/kg po q 6 h) for 6 months. This valacyclovir dose achieved serum acyclovir C max>7 m and high antiviral activity versus EBV (ID50, 4.4-13.3 m), but no antiviral activity versus HCMV . The CFS patients EI functional capacity as and HCMV serum antibody titers were again assessedafter 1, 3 and 6 months of valacyclovir. We concluded that the16 CFS patients with EBV persistent infection (EBV single- virus subset) improved after 6 months, but 9 CFS patients antibody valacyclovir (Drugs of Today, 38: 549-561, 2002). With this guidance, a randomized double blindedcontrolled 6 month study of EBV subset single virus (noHCMV serum antibody) showed an EI rise after 6 months of+1.12 units (122 kcal/day), in the valacyclovir group while theplacebo improved +0.42 units (65 kcal/day), In Vivo 21: 707-714, 2007. The current inclusive CFS data (May 1, 2001-December 31, 2007) regardless of duration of CFS illness from this treatmentcenter of 201 CFS patients include 5,700 visits and 44,000fields of information which reveal demographic andepidemiologic data, 156 (77.6%) female; 45 (22.4%) male.The mean CFS patients 45.2 years, BMI 26.4 Kg/m 2. These 201 CFS patients are two with similardemographics; (A) CFS Herpesvirus Illness (EBV , B group meeting internationalcriteria for diagnosis of CFS. (Fukuda, Ann Intern Med, 121: 953-959, 1994). The major co-infections of Group B are Lymedisease, babesiosis, adult rheumatic fever. The subsequent data here are those of CFS Group A who were ill an average of 5.2 years before receiving antiviraltherapy. Data for CFS Group B are not included. There were138 group A CFS patients, 104 females (75.4%) and 34 males(24.6%). The mean age was 46.4 years, BMI 26.7 Kg/m 2. Patients were further identified by the presence of elevatedserum antibody or inverted T-waves at24 hr ECG monitor and abnormal cardiac wall motion at rest(11.5%) and stress (24.1%). Cardiac biopsies from CFSpatients seen in 1997 showed a non-inflammatorycardiomyopathy with myofiber disarray, myofiber drop out,apoptosis, and cardiac replacement fibrosis. Among the 138 Group A herpesvirus CFS patients there were single virus infections, EBV patients (27.5%); HCMV(13.8%); and HHV6 (1.4%). However, more commonly, eachCFS patient was infected with several herpesvirusessimultaneously: 79 patients with to each patient until the EI point score reached8, at which time, antiviral medicines were tapered, stopped, orcontinued, as appropriate with no change in the EI pointscore. The EI point score at 3 month intervals for the 6 yearsof the study was recorded. There were a mean of 46 EIpatients at each 3 month time interval and 25 time intervalsover the 6 year longitudinal study. The mean EI for the 138ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3376CFS patients at baseline was 4.5. The mean final EI point score was 6.0, an increase of 1.5 EI units and, therefore, alarge EI effect size change (Spearman's p nonparametric correlation test, Spearman's p=0.562, p=0.0019). These data indicate that specific long-term anti-herpesviruspharmacokinetic administration of valacyclovir/valganciclovir provides long-term significant benefit to GroupA CFS patients. There was no toxicity to this long-termantiviral therapy as given. For the evidence-based physicianrequiring placebo controlled double blinded trials forveritude, without recognition of the differences betweenGroup A and Group B CFS patients, as defined here, it islikely that the evidence based trial may have falsely yielded\"no benefit\" from the antiviral therapy. 400 CANCER AND INFLAMMATION: NEW INSIGHTS TO THE ROLE OF NF-KAPPAB AND COX-2 IN CARCINOGENESIS Shahar Lev-AriTel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, affiliated to the Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel Cumulative experimental and epidemiologic evidence indicates that nuclear factor kappaB (NF- B), a pro- inflammatory transcription factor, plays a significant role incarcinogenesis. Activation of NF- B was shown to regulate the synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), as well as other signalingpathways which enhance tumor cell proliferation,angiogenesis, invasiveness and resistance to apoptosis-basedtumor surveillance mechanisms and chemo-radiation therapies. Research aimed at developing chemical and natural inhibitors that block NF- B activation is currently flourishing. Several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) andnatural compounds, such as Aspirin and curcumin, have shownto inhibit NF- B activity. Other agents targeting the IKK, and other upstream kinases involved in NF- B activation such as bortezomib (Millennium Pharmaceuticals) and PS-1145(Bristol-Myers) are under development. Several of theseagents have shown anticancer activity in clinical or preclinicalstudies with acceptable safety profiles. Recent research hasdemonstrated that concurrent inhibition of NF- B may increase chemo-radiotherapy efficacy. This could lead to noveltherapeutic modalities in cancer therapy. 401 IN VITRO AND IN VIVO EV ALUATION OF [ 64CU-NOTA-8-AOC-BBN(7-14)NH2] RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL FOR PET IMAGING OF HUMAN BREAST AND PROSTATE CANCER TUMORSMichael R. Lewis, Adam F. Prasanphanich, Lauren Retzloff, Stephanie R. Lane, Prasant K. Nanda, Gary L. Sieckman, Tammy L. Rold, Lixin Ma, Said D. Figueroa, Samantha V . Sublett, Timothy J. Hoffman and Charles J. Smith The Radiopharmaceutical Sciences Institute, University of Missouri School of Medicine, Columbia, Missouri, 65211,USA Introduction: Human prostate and breast cancers are known to express the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) invery high numbers. In this study, a derivative of bombesin(BBN) peptide, an agonist for the GRPr, has beencomplexed making the conjugatea potential candidate for positron-emission tomography(PET) imaging and therapy of these human cancers. 64Cu- microPET assayed in vitro and in vivo T-47D (human breast) and PC-3 (human prostate) cell lines in order to determine itsspecificity and selectivity for the GRPr and was mice models bearingxenografted tumors. Results: The 64Cu-NOTA-8-Aoc- BBN(7-14)NH2targeting vector was determined to specifically localize in GRPr-positive tissues. Accumulationof radioactivity was observed in the tumor in sufficientquantities to allow for identification of tumors in microPETimaging procedures. Uptake and retention of conjugate inT-47D xenografted determined to be2.27\u00b10.08%, 1.35\u00b10.14%, and 0.28\u00b10.07% ID/g (PercentInjected Dose Per Gram Tissue) at 1, 4, and 24 h. Uptakeand retention of conjugate in 3.58\u00b10.70%, 1, 4, and 24 h, respectively.Conclusion: The 64Cu-NOTA-8-Aoc-BBN(7-14)NH2 produced high quality microPET images. The pharmacokinetic profile of this conjugate justifies furtherpreclinical evaluation of this new radiopharmaceutical as apotentially-useful diagnostic agent. Additionally, this newradiopharmaceutical serves as a good reference formodification and optimization of similar agents tomaximize tumor uptake and minimize non-targetaccumulation of radioactivity in collateral tissues.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3377402 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL IMAGING AND THERAPY TARGETING THE BCL-2 ONCOGENE IN B-CELL LYMPHOMA Michael R. Lewis 1, Fang J. Hoffman1 Harry S Truman Memorial Veterans' Hospital, Columbia, MO; 2Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, 3Molecular Biology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA Introduction: The B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (bcl-2 ) oncogene is a dominant inhibitor of apoptosis, correlatingwith resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, high relapserate, and poor survival in non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma(NHL). NHL also expresses type 2 somatostatin receptors(SSTR2) in 87% of cases, making it attractive radiotherapy (TRT) in NHL cells in culture, mouse models of humanNHL, and dogs with spontaneously occurring NHL. SCIDmice Mec-1 The111In conjugate of canine NHLpatients (n=15). The 177Lu conjugate was Mec-1 Results: Incubation -Tyr3-octreotate showed a 51% decrease in bcl-2 protein synthesis, suggesting that the target mRNAfunction had been perturbed by a specific antisense effect.Both 111In microSPECT and 64Cu microPET could not Ramos tumors, in SCID mice(p<0.05). Gamma scintigraphy demonstrated the utility of the 111In conjugate for molecular staging of bcl-2 in canine NHL. In vitro Mec-1 cell studies showed that the 177Lu conjugate had at least an additive effect on cell viability,compared to controls for targeted radioactivity and bcl-2 antisense activity. Conclusion: 1) Imaging studies demonstrated that were specific for xenografts. 2)Imaging of canine NHL established bcl-2 expression as a clinical and molecular model relevant to human disease. 3)TRT studies of the 177Lu conjugate in Mec-1 cells demonstrated down-regulation of bcl-2 with radiation insult, creating a NHL therapy agent acting through two targetedanti-tumor mechanisms.403 CHARACTERIZATION OF BRIT1/MCPH1'SFUNCTION IN DNA DAMAGE RESPONSES USING AKNOCKOUT MOUSE MODEL Yulong Liang, Hong Gao, Shiaw-Yih Lin, Pumin Zhang, Asha S. Multani, Sandy Chang, John A. Goss, Francis C. Brunicardi and Kaiyi Li Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine,Houston, TX, 77030, USA The DNA damage-response pathway is essential for the maintenance of genomic stability; as a result, it acts as thebarrier for tumorigenesis. Previous studies in cell culturedemonstrated that Brit1 played critical roles in checkpointcontrol and DNA damage response. Aberrant expression ofBrit1 was also identified in several types of human cancers.To address the physiological functions of Brit1 and the effectof its deficiency on tumorigenesis, we recently generated aBrit1 knockout (Brit1 -/-) mouse model and analyzed its in vivo function. We found that Brit1-/-mice can survive to adulthood but with growth retardation and low birth rate. Both Brit1-/- male and female mice were infertile with much smaller testesor ovaries. When analyzing Brit1 -/-testes, we found that there were no spermatids and much fewer spermatocytes withmeiosis dysregulation. Consistently, Brit1 DNA repair defects reduced Rad51 andgamma-H2AX foci formation. In addition, both Brit1-defecient mice and MEFs (M ouse E mbryonic F MEFs Tlymphocytes with Brit1 -/-genotypes also exhibited severe chromosome aberrations. Notably, we found that, in contrast totheir wild-type or heterozygote littermates, 45% of Brit1 -/- mice with age one to two years old developed ovarian tumors.Moreover, tumor incidence in Brit1 -/-p53-/-double null mice is significant earlier than those in Brit1+/+p53-/-, indicating that loss of Brit1 enhances cancer susceptibility of p53 null mice.Together, the generation of Brit1 knockout mice providesconvincing evidence that Brit1 is crucial for maintaininggenomic stability in vivo to protect the hosts from both programmed and irradiation-induced DNA damages. Inaddition, our studies provide genetic validation of Brit1's roleas a novel tumor suppressor gene. 404 RECOMBINANT LEPTIN ADMINISTRATIONIMPROVES EARLY ANGIOGENESIS IN FULL-THICKNESS University Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; 22d Department of Surgery and 4Department of Pathology, Medical School, Democritus University of Thrace,Alexandroupolis; 31st Department of Surgical Oncology, Hellenic Anticancer Institute, Aghios Savvas Hospital, Athens; 51st Department of Propaedeutic Surgery, Hippokration Hospital, University of Athens, Greece Background: Leptin is a potent direct angiogenic factor that stimulates endothelial cell migration and activation in vitro , and angiogenesis in vivo . In addition, leptin seems to play an important role in angiogenesis as it promotes the formation ofnew blood vessels. Objective: To determine the effect of local application of exogenous leptin on the survival of fullthickness skin flaps in an experimental animal model.Materials and Methods: Ninety Sprague-Dawley rats were used. A full thickness dorsal flap (10 cm \u00d7 2 cm) with thepedicle located at the level of the iliac crest was designed.Animals were divided into ten groups of nine animals each.In the distal two thirds of the flap and by means of subdermalinjection at 8 different locations, rats were injected with 100ng/ml leptin, 250 ng/ml leptin, 500 ng/ml leptin, 1000 A, B, and D), 1 g/ml VEGF (group E), or1ml saline (control group), respectively. For each of the fourleptin doses used, another animal group was injected with acombination of leptin/antileptin: 100 ng/ml ng/ml antileptin (groups A1, B1, C1 and D1,respectively), in order to study the inhibition of the leptinfactor. Nine rats served as controls and were injected with 1ml saline solution. Rats were sacrificed 3, 7 and 9 dayspostoperatively. After sacrifice of the animals, the skin wasgrossly arranged on its appearance, color and texture. Fullthickness skin flaps were dissected for histologicalexamination. A qualitative analysis of angiogenesis in the flapwas conducted following a standard hematoxylin and eosinstain. The wound tissue samples from each experimentalgroup underwent immunohistochemical evaluation ofmicrovessel density angiogenesis were observed in group D(1000 ng/ml leptin) flaps compared to those in the VEGF,leptin/antileptin and saline groups. In addition, skin flapsurvival rate in group D (1000 ng/ml leptin) and group E (1g/ml VEGF) were significantly better than those of the othergroups. The most impressive formation of new blood vesselswas noted in the groups with the higher leptin doses. Surgicalwounds in the control, as well as in the leptin/antileptingroups, did not demonstrate any new vessels. Conclusion:Exogenous administration of recombinant leptin increases early skin flap angiogenesis in an experimental animal model.Local application of leptin could efficiently improve survivalof ischemic skin flaps.Dr Liapakis DRUGINTERACTIONS, AND Laboratory, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway Tamoxifen is regarded as a pro-drug as two of its metabolites, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and 4-hydroxy -N-demethyltamoxifen have estrogen receptorthan tamoxifen itself. 4-Hydroxy- N-demethyltamoxifen is metabolite of tamoxifenbecause its pharmacological potency is equivalent to that of 4-hydroxytamoxifen and its concentration in blood and tissuesis several fold that of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Tamoxifenmetabolism shows considerable inter-individual variation innormal dose as regimens. involves N-oxidation, N- hydroxylation. The catalyzed a monooxygenase.Tamoxifen N-demethylation to 1A1. CYP2D6 activity is highly polymorphically distributed in the population due to inherited mutations in the CYP2D6 gene. The poor metabolizer phenotype carries a combination of twonon-functional variant alleles, which results in lack ofCYP2D6 activity in the liver. In contrast, the ultrarapidmetabolizer phenotype is associated with an inheritedduplication of the CYP2D6 gene that may increase enzymatic activity. Although CYP2D6 is the major contributor to thehydroxylation process of tamoxifen, in vitro studies using recombinant human CYPs have indicated an additionalcontribution by the enzymes CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19and CYP3A4. While the results vary, multiple studies fromdifferent groups have found an association between non-functional CYP2D6 alleles and poor outcome amongindividuals treated with tamoxifen. Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3379The observed major interindividual variation in the serum levels of tamoxifen during steady state treatment has severalcauses. Breast cancer patients often use drugs that interactwith CYP2D6 and the inducible CYP3A4. Furthermore, a lowwillingness of breast cancer patients to participate in clinicalstudies with tamoxifen has been observed. Moreover, thepharmacokinetics of tamoxifen varies by age. The tissue levels of tamoxifen and its metabolites are related to their levels in serum. Accordingly, therapeuticeffects as well as side-effects of the drug may be related to itsserum levels. We therefore propose the inclusion of therapeuticdrug monitoring in clinical tamoxifen studies. 406 TUMORIGENICITY AND ANGIOGENESIS OF PANCREATIC CANCER ARE INHIBITED IN Clinic, Daejeon, Korea; 4Department of of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA15213, USA; 5Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA 3-Polyunsaturated fatty acids (3-PUFAs) including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are known to inhibit cell growththrough apoptosis in various types of cancer cells. However,the mechanism of 3-PUFA-induced cell death is still unclear.In this study, we have investigated inhibition of tumorigenicityand angiogenesis of 3-PUFAs on pancreatic transgenic mice express aCaenorhabditis elegans 3 desaturase, converting 6- to 3- PUFAs endogenously). Treatment of cells with two 3-PUFAs, DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), significantly and dose-dependently induced inhibition of cell growth and increasedsub-G1 population in SW1990 and PANC-1 cells. The effectof 3-PUFAs due arachidonic acid (AA) had no effect. Moreover,DHA treatment reduced the level of -catenin in SW1990and PANC-1 cells. DHA also induced the association of -catenin/Axin/GSK-3 complex, which serves as a parallelmechanism for -catenin degradation. Increased nuclearstaining for -catenin was observed in tumor tissues prepared from human pancreatic cancer patients whencompared with the non-tumor of -catenin, expression was reduced in the DHA-treated SW1990 cells as compared to control cells. TheTCF/LEF reporter activity, a -catenin-controlleddownstream signal, was also reduced by DHA treatment.DHA also inhibited Cox-2 reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner. When mouse pancreatic cancer PANC-02 cells were implanted into Fat1 mice and wild-type mice,respectively, tumor size and volume of Fat1 transgenic micewas dramatically reduced as compared with wild mice. Inimmunohistochemical analysis of tumors of Fat1 mice,apoptosis was markedly increased and angiogenesis wassignificantly reduced wild-type micetumors. Neoangiogenesis in Matrigel was dramaticallyinhibited in Fat1 mice compared to wild mice. These findings suggest that 3-PUFAs induce apoptotic cell death through the Cox-2 and -catenin/wnt signaling pathwayin human pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, They alsoprovide evidence that 3-PUFAs may inhibit tumorigenicityand angiogenesis of pancreatic cancer in the Fat1 transgenicmice model. Therefore, utilization of 3-PUFAs mayrepresent a potential effective therapy for the chemopreventionand treatment of human pancreatic cancer. This work wassupported by Yihang Scholarship Foundation of ChungnamNational University Medical School, Dr. NF- B AND AP-1 Clinic, Daejeon, Korea; 4Department of of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA15213, USA; 5Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (3-PUFAs) are known to inhibit cancer cells proliferation in animal models and cellANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3380lines. In contrast, 6-PUFAs promote the growth of cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms remain to beelucidated. This study was designed to investigate actionmechanisms of 3-PUFAs, especially docosahexaenoic acid(DHA), on inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis in breastcancer. Treatment of human breast cells (MDA-MB-231, T47) with two 3-PUFAs, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) andeicosapentaenoic acid for 12-48 hours adose- and time-dependent inhibition of incontrast, a 6-PUFA, had nosignificant effect. The 3-PUFAs effect are due to theinduction of apoptosis, given that DHA induced the cleavedform of PARP, and caspase-3. DHA treatment caused adecline of protein. Accordingly, DHA treatmentalso reduced the -catenin-mediated T-cell factor/lymphoidenhancer factor reporter activity, the a -catenin-controlled downstream geneimplicated in breast carcinogenesis. and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner; in contrast, AA had no effect. In gelatin-embedded zymography, activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9were decreased by DHA treatment and the levels of theirmRNA were also reduced in dose-dependent manner. Thelevels of VEGF protein and its promoter activity wereinhibited by DHA treatment. AA- and PGE2-induced VEGFpromoter activity was also inhibited by DHA pretreatment.The level of NF- B protein and binding activities of NF- B and AP-1 decreased by DHA treatment. DHA inhibited NF-B and Cox-2 reporter activities and PGE2-dependent increases of NF- B and MMP-2 promoter activities were also inhibited by DHA pretreatment. When mouse breastcancer EO771 cells were implanted into Fat1 mice (Fat1transgenic mice express a Caenorhabditis elegans 3 desaturase, converting 6- to 3-PUFAs endigenously),tumor size and volume of Fat1 transgenic mice weredramatically reduced compared with wild-type mice. Inimmunohistochemical analysis of tumors of Fat1 mice,apoptosis was markedly increased; in contast, angiogenesissignificantly wild-type mousetumor. Binding activites of NF- B and AP-1 were decreased in Fat1 mouse tumors. These findings suggest that 3-PUFAs may inhibit tumor invasion and angiogenesis byreducing MMP activities and VEGF level viareduction of NF-B and AP-1 in breast cancer. Thus, utilization of 3- PUFAs may represent an effective and safe therapeuticapproach for the chemoprevention and treatment of humanbreast cancer.

This study was conducted to elucidate themechanism of USHT on the cellular accumulation of P-gp-recognized substrates in the multi-drug resistant (MDR) cellssince P-gp plays a major role in limiting drug permeability inMDR cells. When the concentration of P-gp inhibitor,verapamil or PSC 833, increased from 1 M to M,verapamil and PSC 833 revealed a dose-dependent increase inR123 accumulation in MDR cells. To determine if USHTmediated its effect on the cellular accumulation ofhydrophobic molecules by affecting membrane permeability,we compared the cellular accumulation of a non-P-gphydrophobic substrate ([ 14C]-antipyrine) with that associated with a P-gp substrate (R123). Antipyrine was chosen as ahydrophobic permeability marker, because this molecule is notconsidered a substrate of P-gp or of any known transporterproteins in MDR cells. Cellular accumulation of both 4 M ofR123 (log partition coefficient 0.53) and 0.5 M of [ 14C]- antipyrine (log partition coefficient 0.4) was increasedimmediately after USHT treatment: the accumulation of [ 14C]- antipyrine reached a level that was 2.5-fold higher right afterUHST treatment, whereas R123 accumulated only 33% overthe control (No USHT) right after USHT. The enhancedpermeability was reversible and size-dependent as USHTproduced a much larger effect on cellular accumulation of[ 14C]-antipyrine (MW 188) than that of R123 (MW 380.8). It also took less time after USHT treatment for R123accumulation in USHT-treated cells to return to that of theuntreated cells (20 min for R123 vs. >60 min for antipyrine). The results suggest that USHT does not modulate P-gpactivity, but rather it increases cellular accumulation of R123by altering membrane permeability in a manner that wasselective and reversible. The present results point to thepotential use of USHT to increase cellular uptake of P-gp-recognized substrates, especially anticancer agents, into cancercells. Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3381409 INDUCTION OF APOPTOSIS BY CANTHARIDIN IN COLO 1, Jai-Sing Yang2, City of Pharmacology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; 3School of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC Cantharidin, a natural toxin, is the active substance of mylabris and has antitumor effects in man. The presentstudy was designed to investigate whether or not cantharidinexerts cytotoxic activity against colorectal cancer cells byinducing apoptosis and to examine the possible mechanismof the phenomenon. Inhibition of proliferation of cantharidinon COLO 205 colorectal cancer cells was determined by thetrypan blue dye exclusion test in vitro . Apoptosis of cantharidin-treated cells was determined by morphologicalanalysis and quantities by flow cytometry after staining withpropidium iodide. Cell cycle and the cell expressionof the CD95/CD95 ligand were evaluated by flowcytometry. Caspase activities were also analyzed. Results: Treatment with cantharidin of COLO 205 cells not onlyinhibited cell proliferation, but also induced apoptosis.Cantharidin induced apoptosis mainly in two phases: rapidapoptosis and delayed apoptosis in G 2/M arrested cells. Treatment with cantharidin in COLO 205 cells resulted inan up-regulation of the CD95 receptor and CD95L on showed effect cells. Ourresults suggest that cantharidin triggers apoptosis incolorectal cancer cells viathe activation of the CD95 receptor/ligand system, and that this agent may be useful fordeveloping new therapeutic regimens for the treatment ofcolorectal carcinoma. 410 RUTIN INHIBITS HL-60 Chung3 1School of Chinese Medicine, 3Department Science and Technology, China Medical University,Tiachung, Taiwan; 2Traditional Chinese Medical Department, Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University,Kaohsiung, ROCIt was reported that rutin, a flavonoid present in onions, apples, tea and red wine, can induced apoptosis in cancer cellsthrough the induction of apoptosis, however, the effects ofrutin on human leukemia HL-60 cells is unclear. Therefore,the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of rutinon HL-60 cells in vitro as well as in vivo systems. Nude mice bearing HL-60 leukemia tumors were treated once per 3 dayswith i.p.administration of 30 and or 50 mM rutin in 0.9% NaCl solution for 4 weeks. Tumor volume and survival timewere recorded. TUNEL assay and CD34 vessel staining wereconducted in vivo was determined by sponge assay. Antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities of rutin in vitro were examined on HL-60 cells. The results of the administration of rutin were significantinhibition (60%-80% maximum inhibition relative to controls)of the growth of HL-60 tumor xenografts, and prolongedsurvival of the treated mice. Complete tumor regressionoccurred in rutin-treated nude mice. The antitumor responseswere associated with marked increases in tumor apoptosis andreductions in tumor size and weight. In conclusion, our dataindicate that rutin may provide an effective approach to inhibithuman leukemia HL-60 cancer both in vitro andin vivo. 411 ORPHAN NUCLEAR RECEPTOR, NURR-77 IS A POSSIBLE TARGET GENE OFBUTYLIDENEPHTHALIDE CHEMOTHERAPY INGLIOBLASTOMA Horng-Jyh Harn3 National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan; 2Graduate Institute of Biotechnology, National Ilan University, Ilan, Taiwan; 3Pathology Department, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC The natural compound n-butylidenephthalide (BP), which is isolated from the chloroform extract of Angelica sinensis , has been investigated for its antitumoral effects on glioblastomamultiform (GBM) brain tumors both in vitro and in vivo . In order to determine the mechanism of BP-induced growtharrest and apoptosis, we examined BP-induced changes ingene expression by microarray screening using human GBMbrain tumor cells. This analysis identified several BP-induciblegenes, including the nuclear receptors NOR-1, Nurr1, and Nur77 . Among these genes, Nur77 is particularly interesting because it plays an important role in the apoptotic processes invarious tumor cell lines. BP was able to increase Nur77 mRNA and protein expression in a time-dependent manner.After BP treatment in GBM 8401 cells, Nur77 28: 3157-3556 (2008) negatively affected GBM 8401 cell survival. In summary, our results suggest that up-regulation ofNur77 may explain the antitumoral activity of BP in braintumor cells. 412 DNA DAMAGE AND ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUMSTRESS MEDIATED CURCUMIN-INDUCED CELLCYCLE ARREST Wood3 and Jing-Gung Chung2 1Department of Radiological Technology, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, No 11, Buzih Lane,Buzih District, Taichung 40605, Taiwan, ROC; 3Department of Pharmacology, University of Minnesota, School of Medicine, Geriatric Research, Education andClinical Center, V A Medical Center, Minneapolis,Minnesota, USA; 2Departments of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, No 91, Hsueh-Shih Road, Taichung 404,Taiwan, ROC Curcumin, a major component of the Curcuma species, is known to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory properties andinduce apoptosis of cancer cells, however, the precisemolecular mechanisms of apoptosis in vitro are unclear. In this study, we showed that curcumin, a plant product containingthe phenolic phytochemical, caused DNA damage andendoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial-dependent-induced apoptosis through the activation ofcaspase-3 at a treatment concentration of 30 M in humanlung cancer A-549 cells. In contrast, treatment with 5-10 Mof curcumin did not induce significant apoptosis, but ratherinduced G 2/M phase arrest in A-549 cells. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that curcumin directly increasedintracellular oxidative stress based on the cell permeable dye,2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), actingas an indicator of reactive oxygen generation.GADD153 and GRP78 were increased by curcumin whichwas indicative of ER stress. Curcumin increased Ca 2+levels and the mitochondrial membrane potential (m) decreasedin A-549 cells. Overall, our results demonstrated that curcumintreatment causes cell death by activating pathways inducingG2/M phase arrest and apoptosis.413 THE ROLE OF BRIT1/MCPH1 IN CHROMATINREMODELING, DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE, ANDCANCER Guang Peng and Shiaw-Yih Lin Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA We previously identified BRIT1/MCPH1 as a novel tumor suppressor gene and an early regulator in response to DNAdamage through its regulation of ATM/ATR signaling as wellas the expression of BRCA1 and Chk1. In addition to its rolein DNA damage signaling, our recent endeavor indicated thatBRIT1/MCPH1 was required for both homologousrecombination DNA repair and nonhomologous end joiningrepair. Interestingly, using a proteomic approach, we identifieda previously unknown function of BRIT1/MCPH1 as a novelregulator of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexSWI/SNF in DNA repair. Our data indicate thatBRIT1/MCPH1 interacts with SWI/SNF and provides a meansby which SWI/SNF can be specifically recruited to andmaintained at DNA lesions, facilitating DNA repair. Weestablish that loss of BRIT1/MCPH1 causes impairedchromatin relaxation in response to DNA damage owing toreduced association of SWI/SNF with chromatin. This thenexplains the observed decreased recruitment of repair proteinsto DNA lesions and reduced efficiency of repair inBRIT1/MCPH1-deficient cells. Our findings, therefore,identify BRIT1/MCPH1 as a key molecule that directly linkschromatin remodeling with DNA damage response in thecontrol of DNA repair, and its dysfunction contributes togenomic instability and cancer. 414 BREAST CANCER AND GROWTH HORMONERECEPTOR EXPRESSION IN YOUNG ARABWOMEN David T. Lincoln 1, Fatma Al-Yatama2, Fawziah M.A. Mohammed2and Anwar Al-Banaw2 Foundation, Chapel Hill, QLD, Australia; 2Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Kuwait University, Kuwait Growth hormone (GH) exerts its regulatory functions in the mammary gland by acting on specific receptors, which triggera cascade of biochemical signals and dictate gene expression.However, GH induced neoplastic changes have been reportedin mice and human mammary gland tissue. In thisinvestigation, the expression of receptors for growth hormone(GH-R) was undertaken in 122 cases of breast cancer in youngAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3383Arab women. In 24% of the patients, the tumour was very large, involving half the breast. The majority of cases wereinfiltrating ductal carcinomas (66%), of which 59% weremoderately differentiated G2 or were poorly differentiated G3.The remaining cases included benign breast tumours,intraductal and lobular carcinomas in situ and routinely paraffin wax-embedded tissue sections, the cellular and nuclear expressionof human GH-R was demonstrated by the streptavidin-biotinhorseradish peroxidase complex (ABC) technique. The MAbused in this study was obtained by hybridoma technology fromBalb/c mice immunised with purified rat and rabbit liver GH-receptor. The results show distinct receptor immunoreactivityin carcinoma cells. GH-R expression was primarily in themembrane-cytoplasm of cancer cells, but nuclei were alsopositive (16-30%) for GH-R. The proportion of membrane-cytoplasmic and nuclear expression in intraductal carcinomaswas greater than 31% and 5-15% respectively. Strongeststaining intensity was present in the large proliferating tumourcells. All cases of infiltrating ductal carcinomas were GH-R-positive with a high (>31%) positive nuclear component in thistumour etiology. The majority of ductal carcinomas were GH-R-positive, the proportion of immunoreactivity ranging greater than 31%, while in lobular positiveimmunostaining was from 16% to greater than 31%, withnuclear expression being less than 5%. In signet ringcarcinomas, cellular and nuclear GH-R expression was inexcess of 31% and 16-30% respectively. All metastatic lymphnode cases were positive for GH-R. Expression in normalbreast tissue was generally low or absent. In conclusion, thisstudy demonstrates the expression of receptors for growthhormone, an important mammotrophic hormone, in breastcancer tissue. It is proposed that growth hormone enhancescellular proliferation by acting on sensitive ductal stem cells,rendering them targets for the proliferative effects of IGF-I,resulting in propagation of genetic errors. Growth hormonealso facilitates cell proliferation through paracrine and/orautocrine mechanism. It also suggests caution in the use ofrecombinant GH in the treatment of short stature prepubescentgirls. This applies to those without evidence of classic GHdeficiency, particularly in the presence of a family history ofbreast cancer. 415 EXPRESSION OF GROWTH HORMONERECEPTORS IN HUMAN LYMPHOMAS David T. Lincoln 1and Anwar Al-Banaw2 1Entity Systems, Independent Research Foundation, Chapel Hill, QLD., Australia; 2Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Kuwait University, KuwaitThe classification of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is controversial in histopathology. The Kiel and the Lukes-Collinsclassifications are widely used for the diagnosis of B-cell andT-cell lymphomas. In contrast, peripheral T-cell lymphomas areless well characterized and their identification is often difficultas the result of a multiplicity of immunological, histologicaland clinical characteristics. There is a growing appreciation ofthe role of the immune response in preventing the emergenceand progression of cutaneous lymphomas, particularly withrespect to local imbalances in immune regulations, creating anenvironment for tumourigenesis. Growth hormone (GH) has been amply implicated as having a modulatory role in immune functions.Hyophysectomised rats and dwarf mice have suppressedimmune responses, which can be restored by GH. Human GHstimulates T-cell proliferation, possibly via induction thegeneration enhanced GH. IGF-Isynthesis in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines isincreased in response to GH. Furthermore, GH has beenshown to stimulate B-cell immunoglobulin synthesis andproliferation. Clinically, GH treatment ofchanges in lymphocyte subpopulations and stimulates theproliferation as well as the transformation of normal andleukaemic lymphocytes in vitro and significantly increases the expression of c-myc proto-oncogene. GH induced neoplasticchanges have been reported in lymphosarcoma of the lung andin plasma cell tumours. To address the site/mode of action through which GH exerts these effects in a variety of human lymphomas, in this studywe have applied a well-characterized monoclonal antibody tothe GH-receptor (GHR), directed against the diagnosis. The results show strong GHR expression in the great majority of CD20 +B-lymphocyte lymphomas, whereas CD2+ lymphomas, including levels of expression. The different levelsof GHR expression observed on B- vs.T-lymphocytes were previously confirmed on peripheral lymphocytes by analysisof the GHR mRNA transcript. Cutaneous lymphomas, identified as highly malignant Ki-lymphoma of largeanaplastic cells, expressed intense GHR immunoreactivity.Possibly the tumours presented here are a separate entitywithin the group of peripheral T-cell GHR staining was localized in a homogenous pattern and most of the neoplasticcells were positive. At times, nuclei were GHR positive in thetumour cells. In conclusion, this study confirms ubiquitous expression of GHR on peripheral lymphomas and reveals discretely higherGHR levels in cutaneous B-cell compared to T-celllymphomas. It strongly supports the idea that GH is directlyinvolved in the control of the development and/or activationof specific cell populations of the immune system and that B-and T-cells may exhibit differential sensitivity to GH. Theeffects of GH may be particularly important at ages when thelymphoid compartment is still, to a certain extent, immature.On this basis, it would be of interest to reevaluate thebiological effect of GH on the immune system of childrenwith growth retardation undergoing GH treatment, and thepossible carcinogenic and/or tumour growth stimulatingeffects of this treatment. A possible relationship is postulatedbetween exogenous GH therapy and an increased risk oflymphoproliferative malignancy, including leukaemia growth-stimulating effects. 416 HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ASPECTS AND RISKFACTORS OF BREAST CANCER IN YOUNG ARAB WOMEN David T. Lincoln 1, Fatma Al-Yatama2, Fawziah M.A. Mohammed2and Anwar Al-Banaw2 Chapel Hill QLD 4069, Australia; 2Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Kuwait University, Kuwait Breast cancer is characterized by a long history and marked heterogeneity in growth rates and clinical manifestations. InWestern women, peaks between the ages of 60-65 years, withonly 14% occurring below the age of 40 years. In contrast, inArab women the mean age is 48 years and the peakoccurrence is 45-50 years. Only 14% of breast cancer occursabove the age of 60 years. However, a significant proportion ofbreast cancers occur below the age of 30 years and theincidence is increasing. The combination of obesity,hypertension and diabetes mellitus seems to be in closecorrelation with onset of the disease. Furthermore, the tumoursize and the number of positive lymph nodes reflect the statusof the cancer. This study evaluates the expression of different prognostic tumour markers, including HER-2/neu oncoprotein, growthhormone reductase(TR). A total of 122 cases of breast cancer in young (<30 years old) Arab women were investigated and correlated withhistopathological grade and lymph node status. In 24% of the patients the tumour was very large, involving half of the breast; 80% presented without distant metastasis.According to the TNM staging system, most cases were T2,with an average tumour size of 3.5 cm (1.5-6.5).The larger thesize of breast tumour, the more likely was the involvement ofaxillary lymph nodes. Stage I represented 14% of the patients,44% were in stage II, 24% in stage III and 13% in stage IV .The average number of lymph nodes dissected was 18 (6-43).Results from this investigation show strong expression ofHER-2/neu was present in 65.6% of breast carcinomas.Immunoreactivity was concentrated in the cell membranes oftumour cells. Among the 14 cases of infiltrating ductalcarcinomas, 10 were strongly HER-2/neu positive andassociated with lymph node involvement, while only 4 caseswere moderately positive. The intensely positive cases of theintraductal carcinomas were all lymph node positive,indicating a relationship between HER-2/neu overexpressionand lymph node involvement. The strongly positive cases oflobular, infiltrating lobular and signet ring carcinomascorrelate with lymph node involvement. Growth hormone receptor (GH-R) was expressed in all cases of infiltrating ductal carcinomas with a high (>31%)positive nuclear component in this Themajority of ductal nuclear expression rangingfrom 5% to greater In signet ring carcinomas, theproportion of GH-R immunoreactivity was in excess of membrane-cytoplasmic component and 16-30% of thenuclei of tumour cells. The proportion of membrane-cytoplasmic and nuclear expression in the intraductalcarcinomas was greater than 31% and 5-15% respectively.With 57.4%, distinct nuclear p53 staining was high, indicatingalterations in p53 tumour suppressor gene of breast carcinomas in young patients, and while 63.7% of thesetumours were aneuploid, 93.6% of these were negative ORand 64.8% of the p53-positive tumours were lymph majority of p53-positive carcinomas wereGrade III (76.6%), 21.3 % were Grade II and only 2.1 %Grade I, but neither tumour grade ( p=0.066) nor tumour size (p=0.53) showed a correlation with p53 expression. A total of 60.9% of the p53-positive breast carcinomas had positivelymph node involvement. A significant negative correlationbetween OR and PR content ( p=0.006) and p53 was observed. Of the breast carcinomas from patients of young age investigated, 39% stained positive for cathepsin D, which waspresent in all grades of malignancy, including low Grade Itumours. Generally, only a small number of the carcinomacells displayed distinct Cathepsin D immunoreactivity, whichwas to the cytoplasm only. Immunoreactivity theMVD marker CD-31 was present in the vascular endothelialAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3385cells of the larger blood vessels and capillaries. All other components of the breast carcinoma tissue, including tumourcells, stromal cells, adipocytes and nerve cells, were CD-31-negative. Ki-67 cell cycle immunoreactivity was present tovarying degree in all breast carcinomas investigated and wasmostly confined to the nuclei of the tumour cells. Cells inmitosis at times also displayed weak staining in theircytoplasm. The number of cells displaying Ki-67-positivenuclei varied between 9% and 89% of all malignant cells in agiven tumour PCNA was (2% to 100%). The rangeof positive cells in the majority of carcinomas was between 20to 35% of the tumour The histochemical analysisof and TR shows they were overexpressed in thecytoplasm and nuclei in the majority of mammary carcinomas.TRX was found in 100% of the signet (TR),the in the reduction of TRX, was also presentin large amounts in the breast tumours, indicating that a largeamount of its substrate (TRX) is also present. TR was presentin 100% of the signet ring carcinomas and in the mucinproducing carcinomas, 80% of the all lobular carcinomas investigated. Patients <30 years of age have a worse prognosis than older patients. Only 6.5% of the tumours were classified as Grade 1,while 25.4% were of Grade II and 68.1% were Grade III.Furthermore, 14.6% of all carcinomas were <2 cm in size,53.3% were between 2.1 and 5.0 cm and 28% were larger than5 cm in size. In 42.8% of all cases, there was no lymph nodeinvolvement, 15.9% had one to three and 41.4% had four ormore lymph node metastases, while high-grade tumours. All of Grade I tumours, 47.4%of Grade II and 61.6% of Grade III tumours were aneuploid. In conclusion, there are highly significant trends for the prevalence of poor prognostic features such as Grade 3histology, extensive intraductal component and vascular andlymphatic invasion. The application of new biochemicalmarkers for the diagnosis of breast cancer is valuable intherapeutic assessment and in clinical prognosis and hasinfluenced the treatment selection. Expression of Ki-67, PCNA,p53 and HER-2/neu correlated significantly with each otherand with the histological grade. Many of the carcinomasshowed a high Ki-67 and PCNA proliferative activity,indicative of poor prognosis. A positive correlation was alsodemonstrated between tumour grade, nuclear proliferation and expression of GH-R, HER-2/neu, TRX and TR. A direct rolefor GH in breast cancer cell and in vascular epithelial cellsproliferation suggests caution in the use of recombinant GH inthe treatment of short stature prepubertal girls. This applies tothose without evidence of classic growth hormone deficiency,particularly in the presence of a family history of breast cancer.Secreted TRX can regulate the redox state of specific cellsurface receptors and of the extracellular environment.Consequently, TRX may exert a redox control over cellularmechanisms that are involved with cell attachment, invasionand metastasis and that the extracellular TRX systemcontributes to the invasive capacity of breast cancer cells. Giventhe association of the thioredoxin system with the process oftumourigenesis and malignancy reported here, the targetedinhibition of the TRX system is suggested as a novel approachfor the treatment of aggressive breast cancer phenotypes.Indeed, specific chemical inhibitors of TRX and TR are knownto inhibit cancer cell growth and exhibit antitumour activity in vivo. MVD was prognostically significant in univariate analysis of disease-free status and overall survival, as were stage of thedisease, tumour size, nodal status and histological grade. High-grade carcinomas contained greater MVD than low-gradecarcinomas. On the other hand, a negative correlation existedwith OR and PR status and a weak correlation was foundbetween HER-2/neu, Ki-67, PCNA, GH-R and p53 on onehand and Cathepsin D on the other. The association of bothoestrogen and progesterone receptor-negative hormone statusand positive p53 expression points to a greater tumouraggressiveness. This may reflect changes in steroid metabolismand usually excludes tamoxifen therapy. Most early recurrencesand aggressive growth were present in high grade tumours withsize of more than 3 cm. Development of recurrent metastaticdisease was 22% of patients at intervals ranging from 1 monthup to 12 years. 417 HOW DO WE DEVELOP EFFECTIVE CYTOTOXICDRUGS FOR SOLID TUMORS? Stig LinderCancercenter Karolinska, R8:00, Department Pathology, Stockholm, Sweden Clinically used anticancer agents such cisplatin induce both tumor cell death and terminal growth arrest. They do so bycomplex mechanisms, involving both nuclear and cytoplasmictargets (Mandic et al : J Biol Chem 278, 9100, 2003; Berndtsson et al : Int J Cancer 120: 175, 2007). Despite considerable potency (and toxicity), these drugs do generallynot cure metastatic disease. Most currently used anticancer agents were develop using tumor cell lines grown in monolayer culture. Our group has ANTICANCER a cells (Erdal et al: PNAS 102: 192, 2005), that induce the lysosomal cell death pathway and agents that induce apoptosis in cellsoverexpressing AKT. A problem in this field is that monolayer cultures of tumor cells poorly reflect the properties of in vivo tumors. Tumor cells in vivo grow in a three dimensional matrix, and are often hypoxic and poorly nutritioned. Many currently usedanticancer drugs are ineffective on 3-D multicellularspheroids. We have al: J Biomol Screening 13: 1, 2008). We have identified natural products and other compounds that induce efficient apoptosisof multicellular spheroids, and have characterized the mode ofaction of these drugs. We hope that agents that induceapoptosis of spheroids will also be effective in vivo . Clinical testing represents an important part of the drug development process. Our laborarory has together with abiotech company, developed a method for determination of anapoptosis product released from dead tumor cells (Kramer et al: Cancer Res 64: 1751, 2004). This method has proven useful for determination of clinical response after treatmentwith effective drugs (H\u00e4gg Olofsson et al: Clin Cancer Res 13: 3198, 2007). In conclusion, it is hope that improved cell-based screening systems together with effective determination of drug responsein clinical trials will result in the development of moreeffective drugs against solid tumors. 418 LRIG AND CERVICAL CANCER Annika K. Lindstr\u00f6mVentrum Clinic, Skov\u00e4gen 2, 79021 Bjurs\u00e5s, Sweden Cancer results from a multistep process in which acquisition of self sufficiency in growth signals is an important step.Growth factor receptors are frequently amplified and/orinappropriately activated in carcinoma cells. Three humanleukokine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin like domains(LRIG) genes and proteins, named LRIG1-3, that may act onas promoters and/or suppressors of tumor growth have beencharacterized recently. We analyzed the LRIG gene familymembers in human cervical cancer. The relationship betweenLRIG protein expression and clinical parameters, ten othertumor markers, smoking, endogenous sex hormones andsurvival rate were investigated. LRIG1 appears to be asignificant prognosis predictor in early-stage squamous cervicalcancer. Diminished expression in advanced stages and theinverse correlation to serum progesterone and smokingindicates that LRIG1 is a tumor suppressor in cervical cancer.Expression of LRIG2 was strongly associated to poorprognosis, particularly in early stage squamous cell cervical cancer. There were correlations between LRIG2 expression andexpression of the tumor suppressor A combination of high LRIG2expression and absence of LRIG1 expression identified womenwith a very poor prognosis The results of this study suggestthat LRIG2 act as a tumor promoter in cervical cancer.According to our preliminary results LRIG 3 does not have anyclinical importance in cervical cancer. 419 TUMOUR MARKERS AND PROGNOSIS OFRECURRENCE AND SURVIV AL AFTER LIVERSURGERY FOR COLORECTAL LIVERMETASTASES - DYNAMIC Hospital Pilsen, Charles UniversityPrague, Prague, Czech Republic Aim: Statistical analysis of dynamic of tumour markers and comparison of tumour markers and their dynamics in patientswithout or with liver surgery. Methods: Log-rank test and Wilcoxon test were used for statistical evaluation. Survival rateand disease free interval (DFI) were computed by Kaplan-Meier method. We analysed serum levels tumor markersconventionally used in clinical praxis (CA19-9, CEA, CA72-4) and markers informing us of the proliferative activity ofmalignancy (TK, TPA, TPS). The liver metastases (CLM) and82 patients who underwent radical liver surgery for CLMbetween September 1999 and June 2005. Results: The statistical analysis proved conventional tumour markers asprognostic factors of survival rate for patients after explorativelaparotomy ( p<0.05). The survival rate did not depend on the proliferative activity of malignancy. The statistical analysis ofthe dynamics of tumour markers after liver surgery (speed andpower of recurrence) proved the dynamics of CA19-9 andCEA to be excellent prognostic factors of early recurence ofCLM, contrary to proliferative tumor markers. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest the importance of tumormarkers for the prediction of a short survival rate or DFI. Itseems to be very helpful for planning of palliative oncologicaltherapy for patients with liver malignancies who could not betreated by surgical therapy. Patients with a high tendency torecurrence of CLM after liver surgery should be followed-upmore thorougly to increase the possibility of reoperation.

TNF- and IL-6 are cytokines ofinflammatory response and are connected with initial phase ofliver regeneration. Aim: The aim of this study was to accelerate regeneration of liver parenchyma after PVL. The experimentalporcine model was developed to be as compatible as possiblewith PVE in human medicine. Methods: The animals were divided into three groups: 10 piglets in a TNF- group, 9piglets in an IL-6 group and 8 piglets in a control group. Afterligation of portal branches of caudate and right lateral and rightmedial liver lobes, recombinant porcine TNF-, IL-6 orphysiological solution (control group) were applied into non-occluded portal vein branches. The blood samples werecollected from central vein catheter (1) before operation, (2)after ligation of the last portal branch, (3) during application ofcytokine, (4) 2 hours after application of cytokine, (5) 1stpostoperative day (p.d.), (6) 3rd p.d., (7) 7th p.d., (8) 10th p.d.and (9) 14th After termination of the experiment, tissuesamples for histological examination were acquired.Ultrasonographic examinations were undertaken immediatelyafter operation and on 3rd, 7th, 10th and 14th p.d. day toevaluate the compensatory hypertrophy. Results: The acceleration of growth of hypertrophic liver lobes measured byultrasonography was maximal between the 3rd and 7thpostoperative day in the TNF- group and on the 7thpostoperative day in the IL-6 group in comparison with thecontrol group ( p<0.05), nevertheless this stimulating effect was lost at the end of experiment. Important differences in thebiochemical, immunoanalytical or histological parametersstudied were not proven. Conclusion: The presented study describes a newly developed experimental model of portal veinligation in a large animal. The achieved acceleration of growth of hypertrophic liver lobes after application of TNF- or IL-6confirmed their key roles in priming of regenerating liverparenchyma after portal vein ligation.This experimental work was supported by grant IGA CR NR8860/1-3 and grant MSM 0021620819 (Replacement of andsupport to some vital organs). 421 NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN EPIGENETIC THERAPY OF CANCER Delong Liu and Shundong Cang Division of Hematology/Oncology, New York Medical College, 10595, USA Aberrant DNA methylation and histone acetylation play very important roles in carcinogenesis.

Sulfation, cell-matrixinteractions, cell adhesion, as well as cell recognition andinvasion, which are generally thought to remarkably the universal sulfate donor compound for allsulfotransferase reactions. In an attempt to explore theenzymatic characteristics of PAPSS, we have developed andoptimized a rapid, coupled fluorometric assay thedetermination of PAPSS activity. This assay replaced method and is the first continuous method.PAP-free phenol sulfotransferase proved to be ideal under thepresent situation because of its higher tolerance to substrateinhibition by PAP and MU, and exhibited the relativeresistance to the inhibition by ATP, a substrate for PAPSS-catalyzed step. The selective phenol sulfotransferase wastherefore utilized to catalyze the sulfate MU, served as fluorometric fordetermining PAPSS activity, by transferring the sulfuryl groupfrom PAPS formed from ATP and inorganic sulfate byPAPSS. This rapid and continuous method can be used in thedetailed pharmacogenetic and toxicological studies of PAPSS,and will allow for investigation of other pathologicalmechanisms for a better understating of the regulationbetween sulfation and tumor procession. 423 HMJ-38 INTERACTS WITH MICROTUBULEPOLYMERIZATION, PROMOTE G 2/M ARREST AND INDUCES APOPTOSIS IN HUMAN National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan;2Department of Pharmacology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; 3Graduate Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; 4School of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; 5School of Pharmacy, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC We reported that HMJ-38 was the most potent 2-phenyl-4- quinozolinone derivative in inhibiting tubulin polymerizationand it showed significant cytotoxicity against humanleukemia HL-60 cell. In this study, HMJ-38 was examined forits growth inhibition effect on human tongue cancer CAL27cells. After 48 hours treatment of HMJ-38 on CAL27 cells,the MTT method was applied to determine the proliferationrate and a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cellproliferation was observed. The IC 50of HMJ-38 for CAL27 cells was 2.5 M. Cell cycle analysis and microscopicexamination of CAL27 cells showed that HMJ-38 inducedsignificant G 2/M arrest and apoptosis. We found the protein levels of p-CDK1 (Thr161), byDAPI/TUNEL staining and increase of internucleosomalDNA cleavage. In addition, apparent release of cytosoliccytochrome c, and pro-caspase-9 were detected by Western blotting. Caspase activityassay and sub-G1 nuclei analysis of HMJ-38-treated CAL27in the absence or the presence of caspases inhibitors indicatedthat the HMJ-38-induced apoptosis was mainly mediated bythe activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Our results suggesta mechanism of cytotoxic action of HMJ-38 and indicate thatHMJ-38 may be a promising chemotherapy agent againsthuman tongue cancer. 424 GALECTIN-3: A USEFUL TUMOR MARKER IN THYROID AND University, Karlovarsk\u00e1 48, 301 66 Plze; 2Department of Oncology, Medical Faculty, Charles University, Plzen; 3Department of Pathology, 1st Medical Faculty, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic; 4A.I.Virtanen Institute for Molecular Sciences, University of Kuopio, FinlandAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3389This review aims to summarize diagnostic and prognostic difficulties in thyroid and colorectal cancer from apathologist's point of view, with emphasis on the role ofgalectin-3 in diagnosis and/or prognosis of these tumors.Results of our current galectin-3 studies will also be presented. Galectin-3 (endogenous -galactoside-binding protein) is a member of a group of widely distributed carbohydrate-bindingproteins that have been implicated in a spectrum ofphysiological and pathobiological processes includingmalignant transformation. Galectin-3 was proven to beexpressed in various cancer cells, mainly of thyroid andcolorectal cancer. Its expression in these tumors has beenintensively studied with respect to the diagnostic andprognostic role of this tumor marker. Thyroid tumors of follicular cell origin represent a diagnostically and prognostically a difficult group ofneoplasms. In particular differentiation between follicularadenoma and carcinoma, and between follicular tumor andfollicular variant of papillary carcinoma await additionalmethods. Galectin-3 was produced in both benign andmalignant thyroid tumors of follicular cell origin, but galectin-3 was significantly up-regulated in papillary carcinomas onlyin comparison with the other tumors ( p<0.0001). The main task at the time of a pathologist's diagnosis is the of assessment of the metastatic potential of colorectal cancerusing several tumor markers. Liver metastatic lesions as wellas primary tumors showed up-regulated mutually correlatinglevels of galectin-3. Galectin-3 seems to be a promising diagnostic marker in malignant thyroid tumors of follicular cell origin, as well as aprognostic marker predicting metastasis in colorectalcarcinomas.

Epithelialtumors of the ovary comprise about 60% of all ovarianneoplasms and more then 90% of ovarian malignancies.Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal neoplasm of thegynecological malignancies. The early stage of ovarian canceris often asymptomatic and more than two-thirds of patients arediagnosed with advanced disease. The clinical outcome reflects the histological type and pathobiology of ovarian cancer. A dualistic molecular modelof epithelial ovarian cancer elucidating clinical course has been proposed. Moreover, cancer stem cell theory couldprovide a unifying model of ovarian cancer, reflectinghistologic heterogeneity and metastatic potential, as well asresistance to chemotherapy. However, molecular pathogenesisand progression of this disease are yet been definitivelyunderstood. Currently histological diagnosis of ovarian neoplasms is based on their features in hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections,which continue to be the fundamental substrate of surgicalpathology. Immunohistochemistry has assumed the prominentrole in diagnostic ovarian pathology. Diagnostic tissue tumormarkers serve for discrimination between microscopicallysimilar pathological ovarian lesions. Unlike breast andcolorectal cancer, no useful prognostic and predictive tissuetumor markers have been identified yet in ovary. Severalpromising prognostic and predictive ovarian tumor and angiogenetic markers, p53 overexpression, p16 decreased expression) have been studiedso far, but none has proven to be useful for clinicalapplication. The clinical course of advanced disease is therefore difficult to predict in an individual patient. Dissimilarity of clinicaloutcome in patients with ovarian carcinoma suggests thatreliable prognostic and/or predictive (tissue and/or circulatory)biological markers would be of potential clinical value andnew treatment options are warranted. Supported by research project VZ MSM 0021620819. Surgical and School of Medicine, hypercalcemia (MRH) mayoccur in 5% to 30% of patients with cancer during the courseof their disease, but its incidence varies with type of tumor.Lung cancer ( i.e.squamous cell carcinoma), breast cancer and myeloma have the higher incidence of MRH, accounting formore than 50%, while the disease occurs rarely in patientswith colorectal and prostate cancers. Usually, the prognosisof cancer patients with MRH is poor, with a mean survivalrate of 2-3 months. However, in patients with breastcarcinoma and multiple myeloma the course of the disease ischaracterized by self-limited episodes of hypercalcemia,which may be treated. Pathophysiology: Different mechanisms are responsible for hypercalcemia, enclos-ing (1)ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3390degradation of bone matrix in patients with osteolitic lesions (i.e.lung, renal and head and neck cancer), (2) abnormal conversion of vitamin D3 within lymphoma cells and (3)secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP),which repre-sents the principal pathway leading tohypercalcemia in cancer patients. Most hyper-calcemicpatients with bone metastases may have also increased levelsof PTHrP and the serum PTH measurement represents thefirst step in the differential diagnosis from benign ( i.e. primary hyperparathyroidism) versus malignant hypercalcemia. Unfortu-nately, signs and symptoms (nausea,weackness, polyuria, lethargy, depression) are aspecific, butlow PTH levels together with high calcium levels in a cancerpatient may suggest a malignancy-related hypercalcemicsyndrome. Medical Treatment: along with i.e. furosemide) administration, which enhance renal excretion of calcium,represents usually the first step of the medical treatment. Oldagents such as mithramycin, eth-ylphosphorothoric acid,calcitonin and gallium nitrate have practically been aban-doned due to their limited activity and huge side-effects,especially for the kidney. Bisphosphonates: Several bisphosphonates have shown to decrease serum calcium levelsby inhibiting PTH-dependent osteoclast activation. Bothclodronate and etidro-nate proved to be of some efficacy inpatients with parathyroid cancer when given intravenously,while the oral formulation is inactive. Subsequently, morepotent agents ( i.e.pamidronate and zoledronate) have become available, and currently they represent the drugs of choice.Zoledronate is the most potent drug of this class, al-thoughperiodical monitoring of renal function is stronglyrecommended for some cases of acute renal insufficiencyhave been reported. Calcimimetic Drugs: Since the production of PTH is negatively controlled by ionisedcalcium, agents able to potentiate this homeostatic controlmight be effective in sup-pressing PTH levels and reducingserum hypercalcemia. The prototype of these \"cal-cimimetic\"agents is cinacalcet, a new drug which interacts with themembrane-spanning segments of the CaSR and enhancessignal transduction, presumably by inducing conformationalchanges in the caSR receptor which reduce the thres-hold foractivation by ionised calcium and suppress PTH secretion inthe absence of a change in the level of extracellular calcium.Experimental Therapy: A new experimental approach to treat malignant hyper-calcemia involves the blockade of receptoractivator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand, usually abbreviatedas RANKL. RANKL is a key element in the differentiation,func-tion, and survival of osteoclasts, which play an essentialrole in removing Ca ++ from the bone in response to PTH stimulation. Denosumab (AMG 162) is a new, fully hu-manmonoclonal antibody against RANKL, which has beendeveloped to antagonize osteolysis and PTH-relatedhypercalcemia. 427 GENETIC MODELS CANCERRESEARCH Leif R. Lund Kasper Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen Biocenter, Denmark Growth and invasion of breast cancer require extracellular proteolysis in order to physically restructure the tissuemicroenvironment of the mammary gland. This pathologicaltissue remodeling process depends on a collaboration ofepithelial and stromal cells. In fact, the majority ofextracellular proteases are provided by stromal cells ratherthan cancer cells. This distinct expression pattern is seen inhuman breast cancers and also in transgenic mouse models ofbreast cancer. The similar expression patterns suggest thattransgenic mouse models are ideally suited to study the roleof extracellular proteases in cancer progression. Indeed, thesestudies demonstrate that proteases are involved in all stages ofbreast cancer progression from carcinogenesis to metastasis. Particular matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) have several roles that influence cancer progression and dissemination.However, low molecular weight metalloproteinase inhibitors(MPI) have not yet been tested in transgenic/spontaneousmetastasis models. We have tested Galardin/GM6001,a potentMPI that reacts with most MMPs, in the polyoma middleT oncogene mouse model (MMTV-PymT) transgenic breastcancer model. Galardin treatment significantly reducedprimary tumor growth. Final tumor burden in Galardin-treatedmice was We quantified the total lung metastasis volume in the same cohort of mice and found that themetastasis burden was reduced more than 100-fold, whereasprimary tumor size was reduced only 2-fold. We also foundthat primary tumors from Galardin-treated mice exhibited alower histo pathologic tumor grade, increased collagendeposition, and increased MMP-2 During progression of mammary carcinomas the MMTV- PymT model, MMP13 mRNA was strongly upregulatedconcurrently with the transition to invasive and metastaticcarcinomas. As in human tumors, MMP13 mRNA was foundin myofibroblasts of invasive grade II and III carcinomas, butnot in benign grade I and II mammary intraepithelialneoplasias. To determine if MMP13 plays a role in tumorprogression, we crossed MMTV-PymT mice with MMP13deficient mice. The absence of MMP13 did not influencetumor growth, vascularization, progression to more advancedtumor stages, or metastasis to the lungs, and the absence ofMMP13 was not compensated for by expression of otherMMPs or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. However, anincreased fraction of thin collagen fibrils was identified inAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3391MMTV-PymT;MMP13(-/-) compared to MMTV- PymT;MMP13(+/+) tumors, showing that collagenmetabolism was altered in the absence of MMP13. Weconclude that the expression pattern of MMP13 mRNA inmyofibroblasts of invasive carcinomas in the MMTV-PymTbreast cancer model recapitulates the expression patternobserved in human breast cancer. Our results suggest thatMMP13 is a marker of carcinoma-associated myofibroblastsof invasive carcinoma, even though it does not make a majorcontribution to tumor progression in the MMTV-PyMT breastcancer model. 428 EV ALUATION OF THE CYTOTOXIC ORTHODONTICBONDING ADHESIVES A HUMAN Purpose: Numerous in vitro studies have shown that the composite materials have cytotoxic and genotoxic effects oncells they come into contact with. These materials arecommonly used for restorations in conservative dentistry, andin orthodontics to anchor brackets to the tooth enamel. Thestudy determined expression of p53, p63 and p16, biomarkersthat are useful for predicting the potential genotoxicity of themonomeric adhesives used to anchor orthodontic brackets.Patients and Methods: Histological examination and P53, expression were determined immunohistochemicallyon the gengival papillae of 99 patients, of which 69 had beenbanded orthodontically for one year; 30 patients withoutorthodontic banding were used as controls; brackets werebonded to teeth with a filled flowable composite resin. Thepapillae were removed surgically from patients and controlsand examined both to evaluate morphological alterations andusing immunohistochemistry to examine biological alterations.Associations between protein expression patterns anddevelopment of clinicopathologic parameters during follow-up were examined. Results: No case showed morphological alterations visible by microscope. Of the 69 banded patients, 4(5.80%) were positive to p53, 2 exhibited positivity for p63expression in the basal and suprabasal layers and positive (2.90%). P16 was positive in onepatient (1.45%). Of the control cases, no subject was positivefor any of the biomarkers (0.00%). Conclusion: The significance of this positivity, together with histology, andwhether these may serve as biomarkers to predict the risk ofdeveloping oral lesion (dysplasia, oral cancer) is still an openquestion. From this study it appears that, although the detailsof the mechanisms leading to cell death, genotoxicity, andcell-cycle delay are not fully understood, resin monomers mayalter the functions of the cells of the oral cavity. 429 DETECTION OF MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE OF ACUTE CHILDHOOD LEUKEMIA BY FOLLOWING WT1 GENE EXPRESSION IN THE PERIPHERAL BLOOD Edina Magyarosy and Erzs\u00e9bet R\u00e1s\u00f3 Tumor Progression Department of the National Institute for Oncology, Budapest Cytomorphology and Southern blot technique are not sensitive enough to detect minimal residual disease and to diagnoserelapse, and the different DNA markers, which are detected byother PCR techniques are present only in 20-30% of childhoodleukemias. Several authors are of the opinion that monitoringWTgene expression in the peripheral blood can be used to monitor the progression of the disease, to detect minimalresidual disease and to diagnose relapse early. The WT1 gene has two splice regions and four different isoforms, which mayplay different roles in the disrupted expression of all WT1isoforms. WT1 gene expression in the bone marrow and in the peripheral blood in leukemia patients is well known in theliterature, but the expression of WT1 isoforms has not beeninvestigated yet. The aim of our study was to investigate if monitoring WT1 gene expression in the peripheral blood was an appropriatemethod to monitor the progression of acute childhoodleukemias. In the course of the study, the peripheral blood of27 newly diagnosed, 17 previously diagnosed and 21nonleukemic children was tested for WT1 gene expression. Twenty consecutive pediatric patients were included in thisstudy for the analysis of the peripheral blood samples and theinitial diagnosis of ALL for WT1 isoforms expression. In agreement with the literature, we found that all ALL cases except one expressed the WT1 gene (23/24, 96%). The level of WT1 expression did not correlate to the ratio of the blast cellsin the peripheral blood. The initial high rate of WT1 positivity(23/24) became low (~21%) at the end of the phaseof the therapy (day 15: 7/24, day 33: 5/24), although remissionoccurred in all the patients under treatment except one. Twenty patients were followed for 12 months following induction therapy and 16 of them were further monitored forthe second year (14-21 month). Clinical relapse occurred intwo cases during the first year where the WT1 expression atANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3392the periphery was maintained for 11-15 months and both patients died. On the other hand, there was no WT1 gene expression found in the peripheral blood of non-leukemichematological diseases, except myelodysplasia. We were the first to examine the expression of different WT1 isoforms in the peripheral blood of children and weobserved that the WT1 pattern is constant. We found that the5 patients in the low-risk group expressed the 17AA(+) WT1isoform, but 2 patients had presence of 17AA(-) The expression rates of 17AA(+) or 17AA(-) were thesame in the medium risk group. This point of view wasintermediate between the low-risk and high-risk group; nooverexpression of 17AA(-) or 17AA(+) were observed. In twoALL cases, the suspicion of mutation in the WT1-17AAregion arose, because we did not find PCR products in the17AA region, but there was WT1 positivity in the KTS region. Our results suggest that WT1 assays alone are not sufficient, but combined with the detection of other, widelyused DNA markers, are useful to detect minimal residualdisease. Following WT1 gene expression levels in initially WT1-positive children enables us to diagnose relapse early,before it would be detectable with other existing methods. 430 PRO AND CONS FOR CA-125 MONITORING IN THEFOLLOW UP MANAGEMENT Sven MahnerUniversity Medical Department of Gynecology and Gynecologic Oncology, 20246 Hamburg,Germany Despite radical surgical and chemotherapeutic treatment of ovarian cancer, the majority of patients develop recurrentdisease within two to three years. Because of this highlikelihood of disease progression, most women are closelymonitored after completing treatment. In case of diseaserecurrence, serum concentration of the tumor marker CA-125usually rises 3-4 months prior to the development ofsymptoms or clinical and radiological signs of relapse.Although a cure of patients with relapsed ovarian cancer israrely possible, it is still unclear whether an early reinductionof therapy could yield extended survival. Potential benefits of an early treatment of recurrent disease could be the possible delay of symptoms and improvedsurvival. The toxic side-effects and decreased interval withouttreatment in an otherwise asymptomatic patient are potentialdisadvantages. Depending on the duration of response to previous therapy and the length of the treatment free interval, patients shouldbe counselled on the advantages and disadvantages of serialmeasurement of CA-125 during follow up.431 CRITICAL FUNCTIONS OF HUMAN BILIVERDINREDUCTASE IN INSULIN/IGF-1 AND MAPKSIGNALING: POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS INTREATMENT OF DIABETES AND CANCER Mahin D. MainesDepartment of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, NY 14642, USA Degradation of heme to bilirubin involves (BVR). In addition to its reductaseactivity, recent studies have revealed a diverse and expansivespectrum of functions of the human BVR, that is unmatchedby any other protein. The wide assortment of structuralfeatures of hBVR underlies its function in multiple capacitiesin the cell . In this presentation, the current understanding offunctions of hBVR that are highlighted below will bediscussed. bZip an and anchor protein for translocation ofPKC enzymes and transcriptional factors within cellcompartments, and a kinase-kinase for activation of PKCs.Activation of the MEK/ERK/Elk-signaling cascade is amechanism for relaying mitogenic and stress stimuli for geneactivation. MEK1 is the proximate kinase for activation ofERK1/2, and nuclear targeting of ERK1/2 is obligatory forElk1 transcriptional activity. Formation of a ternary complexbetween hBVR/MEK/ERK is essential for activation of ERKby MEK, and for transport of activated ERK into the nucleus,wherein another ternary complex is formed betweenhBVR/ERK/Elk that results in Elk1 activation and inductionof gene expression. hBVR, its variants and small fragmentshave demonstrated ability to modulate cell signaling and,hence, the wide range of functions that are regulated byprotein kinases that include growth, differentiation, genetranscription and metabolism. hBVR is nearly as effective asIGF in activating MEK-1-ERK axis, while eight-residuepeptides, one flanking P 165 and another containing S230 block the activation of ERK by IGF and PKC-, by TNF-,respectively, suggesting their utility as effectors of cell cycleprogression and cell differentiation. Furthermore, becauseseven-residue peptide, KYCCSRK, can specifically bindhematin, it offers a rational approach to design compounds,based on the ligand-binding property, for delivering heme orsynthetic heme analogues to inhibit hBVR substrate, BV , and its product,BR, display notable effects in the cell. BV is an inhibitor ofkinase and NF- B activities, while BR is a quencher ofAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3393oxygen free radicals. BV inhibits NF- B, and hBVR reverses this inhibition. This finding has the likely potential ofproviding a foundation for therapeutic intervention ininflammatory diseases and cancer that may be attained bypreventing reduction of BV . On the other hand, by increasingBVR levels the beneficial functions of NF- B might be augmented. In addition, the cytoprotective of BR againstoxidative stress and free radical-linked diseases, as well as itscytotoxicity, are now amply documented. Conclusion: Regulation of glucose uptake, induction of HO-1, and cytokineand Toll-like receptor signaling are therapeutic Because hBVR blocksfree radical-promoted apoptosis, regulation of its activitypresents a novel drug development strategy to prolong cellsurvival. Given the finding that hBVR-based 7or 8 residuepeptides can effectively modulate cell-signaling networks, theybear the promise of developing into powerful tools forinhibiting or potentiating transmission of extracellular stimulithat control gene expression and cellular functions and tocombat diseases that are associated with disruption of normalkinase-mediated functions such as diabetes and cancer .Asadditional functions of hBVR in cell signaling are uncovered,the prospect of the utility of hBVR-derived structures intherapeutic settings becomes increasingly more realistic.Studies were supported by NIH grants ES-012187 and ES-004066. 432 CURCUMIN SYNERGIZES WITH COLON CANCERTHERAPEUTICS: A STRATEGY TO ELIMINATECANCER STEM CELLS Althea A. Elliott, Bhaumik B. Patel, Deep-Shikha Gupta, Vivek Sengupta and Adhip P. N. Majumdar John D. Dingell V A Medical Center, Karmanos CancerCenter, Department of Medicine, Wayne State UniversitySchool of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA Despite the use of surgical resection and aggressive chemotherapy, nearly 50% of patients with colorectalcarcinoma develop recurrent disease, highlighting the need forimproved therapies. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) or 5-FU plusoxaliplatin (FOLFOX) of colorectalcancer chemotherapeutics, but produces incomplete response,resulting in survival of cells (chemo-surviving cells) that oftenleads to cancer recurrence, which could partly be due toproliferation of colon cancer stem cells. It is becomingincreasingly evident that a cancer treatment that fails toeliminate cancer stem cells may allow regrowth of the tumor.The current treatment strategy for recurrent cancer consistsmainly of aggressive screening, which is in itself costly,potentially morbid, and controversial. There is also a cost ofadditional toxicities, some of which are even fatal. Therefore, validation of a non-toxic agent that could improve upon thecurrent chemotherapeutic regimen would be highly desirable. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), active ingredient of turmeric ( Curcuma longa ), used in South Asian cuisine, with no discernable toxicity, inhibits the growth oftransformed cells and colon carcinogenesis at the initiation,promotion and progression stages in carcinogen-inducedrodent models. Curcumin has also been shown to prevent thedevelopment of adenomas in the intestinal tract of Min+/-mice, a model of human familial adenomatous polyposis. In aPhase I clinical trial, curcumin was found to be effective ininhibiting the growth of a variety of tumors. The presentinvestigation was, therefore, undertaken to examine whetheraddition of curcumin to FOLFOX will be a superiortherapeutic strategy for colon cancer chemo-surviving cells, inpart by eliminating colon cancer stem cells. Forty-eight hour treatment of colon cancer HCT-116 or HT- 29 cells (which contain 30-40% colon cancer stem cells) withFOLFOX (25 M 5-FU+0.625 M oxaliplatin) resulted in 60-70% cell survival, accompanied by a marked activation of IGF-1R and minor to moderate increase in EGFR, HER-2, as wellas AKT, COX-2 and Cyclin-D1. However, inclusion ofcurcumin in continued FOLFOX treatment for another 48 hgreatly reduced survival of these cells, compared to thosesubjected or not subjected to continued FOLFOX treatment(control). These changes were accompanied by concomitantreduction in expression and activation of EGFR, HER-2 andIGF-1R, as well as expression of down-stream signalingeffectors such as AKT, COX-2 and Cyclin-D1. Moreover, 48 htreatment of chemo-surviving colon cancer cells withthe combination of curcumin and FOLFOX markedly reducedthe cancer stem cell population, as evidenced by their failureto form colonies, and a marked reduction in CD166 expression. In conclusion, our data suggest that inclusion of curcumin to conventional chemotherapeutic regimen could be one of theeffective strategies to prevent the emergence of chemo-resistant colon cancer cells by markedly reducing/eliminatingthe cancer stem cells. 433 FUNCTIONALISATION OF APTAMERS FOR THEDEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE CANCERTHERAPEUTICS V Khan1, N. Courtenay-Luck2 and S. Missailidis1 1Department of Chemistry and Analytical Sciences, The Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA; 2Antisoma Research Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, UK Introduction: Aptamers, short oligonucleotide therapeutic, diagnostic and imaging agents, possess great affinity andANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3394selectivity for their targets. However, they are limited in terms of application due to their rapid renal clearance anddegradation from nucleases in the blood. Thus, it is oftennecessary to incorporate appropriate modifications forachieving their full withappropriate fluorescent can respectively. Variouschemical modifications, such as PEGylation, can improve theirpharmacokinetic properties and retain aptamers longer incirculation, making them suitable for therapeutic applications.We now present a range of chemical modifications on ourtumour-targeting aptamers that have allowed us to developthem as diagnostic or therapeutic agents. Methods: The functionalisation of aptamers entails a covalent reactionbetween the fluorescent label, chelator or polyethylene glycol(PEG) polymer modified with an activated functional groupand the previously selected aptamers in an aqueous solutionat optimal pH and temperature. It is, however, possible toloose affinity to the target following extensive modification tothe aptamer backbone or coupling to various agents.Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), flowcytometry and cell cytotoxicity assays were carried out,following chemical modification, to determine the modifiedaffinity and efficacy of the purified aptamer-conjugate for theirtarget and ensure that modified aptamers retain theirtherapeutic properties. Results and Conclusion: Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a polymer varying in size and comprised ofpolymerized ethylene oxide monomers, has become a popularagent for modifying physiochemical and pharmacokineticcharacteristics of therapeutic biological macromolecules.Conjugating therapeutic biological molecules to PEG hasmany positive attributes for clinical utilisation. The overallincrease in the molecular weight of the targeting moleculeenhances its residential and circulatory time within the body,thereby reducing renal clearance, which can be improved fromhours to days, hence improving therapeutic efficacy. Otheradvantages include lower immunogenicity, increasedprotection from enzyme degradation and reduced toxicity.Similarly, the coupling of appropriately chosen fluorescentmoieties can offer valuable immunoassay developmentpotential for the identification and quantification of the targetbiomarker in biological media. 434 INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RESTRICTION:PERINATAL PARAMETERS ASSOCIATED WITHFUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE METABOLICSYNDROME Ariadne Malamitsi-Puchner and Despina Briana Neonatal Division, 2nd Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Athens, 76, Vas. Sophias Ave,11528 Athens, GreeceIntrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is the failure of the fetus to achieve his/her intrinsic growth potential, due toanatomical and/or functional disorders and diseases in thefeto-placental-maternal unit. IUGR results in significantperinatal and long-term complications, including developmentof insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome in adult life. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis suggests that intrauterine malnutrition leads to adaptational changes of theendocrine/metabolic mechanisms (programming), in order tosecure fetal survival. In this respect, in IUGR fetuses, bloodflow redistribution takes place, resulting in reducedmass/impaired function of pancreatic -cells. Moreover, IUGRinfants present with permanent changes in adipose tissuemetabolic and hormonal functions. Adipose tissue regulateswhole body metabolism, by secreting various hormones,named adipocytokines. The latter play a major role in themechanisms linking obesity to insulin resistance/metabolicsyndrome and were recently implicated in intrauterine growth. A number of recent studies from our group explored the implication of adipocytokines (leptin, adiponectin, visfatin,resistin and apelin -also expressed by placenta) infetal growth, by investigating and comparing circulatingconcentrations of these hormones in IUGR and appropriate forgestational age (AGA) fetuses and neonates. The relationshipof the circulating concentrations of the above adipocytokineswith respective insulin ones was also studied. Our results, particularly referring to the novel adipocytokines indicate that resistin and apelin concentrationsdid not differ between IUGR cases and AGA controls and didnot correlate with respective insulin ones, possibly indicatinglack of direct involvement in perinatal insulin resistance andadipogenesis. In contrast, visfatin concentrations were higherin IUGR neonates, possibly implying increased visceral fatsstores, as well as predisposition to insulin resistance. In thisrespect, visfatin may serve as an early marker with prognosticvalue for later development of insulin resistance/ metabolicsyndrome. However, circulating insulin concentrations werelower in IUGR cases, possibly indicating reduced -cell massand/or impaired -cell function. Furthermore, concentration ofvisfatin and apelin are high in the fetus, possibly due toplacental expression. On the other hand, the fetus per se may contribute to its circulating resistin concentrations, as the latterdid not decline after birth. 435 EPIGENETIC CHANGES IN WILMS' TUMOURS Anthony R. Dallosso, Anne L. Hancock, Laxmi Chilukamarri, Sally Malik, Keith W.

We have extended our studies with a genome-wide methylation analysis of WT and foetal kidney purified by 5-methyl-cytosine immunoprecipitation.Putative targets for epigenetic deregulation in WTs were thenvalidated by COBRA analysis and gene expression quantifiedusing real-time PCR. We report identification of in Wilms' tumour. WTs displayextensive hypermethylation of a large cluster of paralogousgenes in this region. Further, on a distinct genetic locus, weshow activation of gene expression associated withhypomethylation of GLIPR1 . Our data show that WTs exhibit a wide range of epigenetic abnormalities, includinghypermethylation, hypomethylation and loss of imprinting. 436 GLIOMA CELLS AND MORPHOLOGICALDIFFERENCES Yoshinobu Manome and Michiko Watanabe Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of DNA Medicine Research Center for Medical Sciences, JikeiUniversity School of Medicine 6-8-27 Nishishinbashi,Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan 105-8461 Introduction: In vivo glioma grows three-dimensionally and spreads continuously by infiltrating the surrounding tissues. Incontrast, cultured glioma cells lose their three-dimensionalconformation and cease their proliferation when they reachconfluence. In addition, vital cellular functions that are presentin tissues or organs might be overlooked with ordinary 'culturedish-based cell cultures. From this viewpoint, we attemptedto establish a three-dimensional culture that mimics the localenvironment within the human body. We applied the method tohuman glioma cells and investigated their features. Materials and Methods: Bio-adaptable and degradable gelatin was meshed and Three malignant glioma celllines, T98G, KNS42, cells (1\u00d710 4cells/100 l of DMEM) were attached to the 5-mm cubes of the scaffold. Cells werethen further cultivated for 5 to 10 days. Specimens wereexamined by SEM, TEM, stereoscopy, and light microscopy.Results: Morphological examination of the three-dimension culture revealed features that were barely detectable inconventional cell culture. Steric cell-to-cell connections were observed throughout the culture and the culture showedcharacteristics of in vivo glioma cells. When the three gliomas were compared, each cell line presented a different form.U118MG cells were unpiled and attached to the scaffold withnumerous fiber formations, whereas KNS42 cells aggregated,adhering to each other, thereby leading to the formation ofbuilt balloon-like structures. T98G cells showed anintermediate appearance. Discussion: Glioma cells grew three- dimensionally in the current culture. There were differencesbetween the two- and three-dimensional cultures. Cell linesused for the study were representatives of standard gliomas.Although these cells are frequently used for manyexperiments, their features were quite different. This becameevident only after using our culture. Under suchcircumstances, we conclude that three-dimensional culturesmight be useful for further investigation of gliomas. 437 PARSTATIN: A NEW CRYPTIC ANTI-ANGIOGENICPEPTIDE Michael E. Maragoudakis and Nikos E. Tsopanoglou Department Pharmacology, Medical of Patras, Patras, Greece Thrombin, the serine protease best known for its pivotal role in haemostasis, has been proposed to play an important role inthe initiation of angiogenesis by a mechanism mostlyindependent of its coagulant activity and more dependent onsignaling via the protease-activated receptors (PARs). PARsconsist a novel family of G protein-coupled receptors, whichare activated by proteolytic cleavage of their N-terminalextracellular domain. PAR-1 is the first member of this familyto be cloned in which proteolytic cleavage at the R 41/S42bond by thrombin aminoacid peptide and unveils atethered peptide ligand with the recognition sequenceSFLLRN. Despite the wealth of information relating to therole of thrombin and PAR-1 in physiology and disease states,a potential biological role of cleaved peptide remainsunknown. We evaluated the effect of the 41-aa cleaved peptidein human endothelial cells as well as in in vivo and ex vivo and in vitro angiogenesis models. We have designated this fragment of PAR-1 as \"parstatin\". Exposure of endothelialcells to parstatin resulted in a concentration-dependentinhibition of serum-mediated proliferation, as well as ofbFGF- and VEGF-induced growth. Consistently, parstatinblocked the serum-, bFGF- and VEGF-triggered Erk1/2activation. In contrast, no was cells treatedwith EGF or heparin-binding EGF. Growth inhibition ofendothelial cells by parstatin was further confirmed by flow-cytometric cell cycle analysis. In addition, the AnnexinV/propidium iodide 3396that the inhibition of cell growth is likely associated with induction of apoptosis. Parstatin increased the percentage ofendothelial cells in early and late apoptotic stages in aconcentration-dependent manner. Parstatin also triggered theactivation of caspase 3 and the induction of poly (ADP-ribose)polymerase cleavage to its signature 85-kDa fragment.In addition, the apoptotic effect of parstatin presence of caspase inhibitor Z-V formation in in vitro and fibrin angiogenesis model and suppressed both the basicangiogenesis and that stimulated by VEGF or bFGF in rataortic rings and in chick chorioallontoic membrane model in vivo. We have also shown that parstatin acts as a cell- penetrating peptide, exerting its biological effectsintracellularly. These results provide a plausible evidence for anegative role of PAR-1 cleaved peptide in angiogenic cascadeand suggest parstatin as target for developing anti-angiogenicagents with potential therapeutic application in cancer andother angiogenesis-related diseases. 438 CONSTITUENTS OF CARPOBROTUS EDULIS INHIBIT P-GLYCOPROTEIN MDR1 96 1349-008 Lisbon,Portugal; Szeged, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s u. 6, Hungary; 4Department of Medical Faculty of Medicine, University of Szeged, H-6720 Szeged,D\u00f3m t\u00e9r 10, Hungary Multidrug resistance is a major health problem that affects the therapy of cancer (eukaryotic cells) and MDR infectionscaused by Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, etc. Our findings suggest a new approach for the therapy of MDR cancer and bacterialinfections that involves the use of these compounds asadjuvants to conventional therapies and have the potential toincrease the usage of existing antibiotics that have fallen bythe wayside due to MDR causes. The methanolic extract of Carpobrotus edulis reverses resistance of mouse lymphoma cells that carry the human mdr1 gene to chemotherapeutic agents and increases the killingactivity of Staphylococcus aureus infected macrophages (1, 2). The aim of the present work was the identification of thecompound(s) responsible for the MDR reversal activity. A bioassay guided purification protocol was performed, testing the extracts, fractions and pure compounds for theirability to inhibit the p-glycoprotein (the efflux pump responsible for the multidrug resistance of this cell line) ofmouse lymphoma cells containing the human efflux pumpgene mdr1 . assay was performed following extrusion or retention of rhodamine 123 inside the cancer cells, by flowcytometry. The compounds were isolated from the chloroform soluble fraction of the methanolic extract by means of multistepchromatographic separations, including CC, VLC, CPC, PLCand HPLC.

The efflux pump inhibitory activities of some of these compounds against MDR mouse lymphoma cell wereevaluated.Ana Martins was supported by 2003. TENSIN FAMILY METASTASISSUPPRESSOR DOWN-REGULATEDIN Dept. for Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Malm\u00f6, SE-205 02,Malm\u00f6; 2Ume\u00e5 University, Department of Surgical and Perioperative Sciences, SE-901 85, Ume\u00e5; 3Lund University, Dept. of Laboratory Medicine, Section for Pathology, University Hospital Malm\u00f6, SE-205 02, Malm\u00f6,Sweden Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common form of kidney cancer in adults. In RCC, transformation anduncontrolled growth of epithelial cells occurs as a result ofmultiple molecular changes, part of which can be due to lossof tumor suppressor proteins. The Tensin family ofintracellular proteins (Tensin1, -2, -3 and -4), are thought tomediate signal transduction of cell motility and growth and actas important links between the extracellular matrix and thecytoskeleton. Dysregulation of Tensin proteins has previouslybeen implicated in various human cancers. Thus wehypothesize that at least some of the Tensins are novel tumorsuppressors that may be dysregulated in RCC. Aims: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the significance of all fourAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3397Tensin isoforms in a study of human kidney cancer subjects. Methods: Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was used to humankidney samples, normal (n=48) vs.RCC (n=223). We also screened various human cancer cell lines for Tensin mRNA aswell as protein expression by Western blot. Moreover, weperformed immunohistochemical analysis of Tensin3 inhuman kidney tumors and generated Tensin3 expressingcells for migration assay. Results: Tensin2 and Tensin3 expression were found to be low or largely absent at bothmRNA and protein levels in a panel of diverse human cancercell lines. Messenger RNA expression of all four Tensin geneswas significantly lower in human kidney tumors as comparedto normal kidney tissue. Correlation studies revealedexpression of the Tensins to correlate positively amongst eachother, whilst they correlated negatively with tumor grade, butnot tumor size. Immunohistochemical analysis revealedTensin3 to be present in the cytoplasm of tubular epithelium innormal human kidney sections, and 40% of patient kidneytumor sections analyzed in microarrays showed Tensin3expression to be low or absent. Overexpression of Tensin3 inhuman kidney 293 cells resulted in a significant reduction inmigration capacity versus mock-transfected cells. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the expression of all Tensins isdownregulated in human kidney tumors and that loss ofTensins may lead to uncontrolled cell migration duringmetastasis. Furthermore anticancer therapies may benefit frominducing up-regulation of Tensins side-effect. 440 REGULATION OF C/EBP BY HYPOXIA ANDESTROGEN Experimental and clinical studies showed that both estrogen (E 2) and hypoxia (H) were involved in tumour development and progression. First, we undertake a study to determinewhether these factors could interact to modulate geneexpression using a microarray approach. We screened thetranscript levels of over 8,000 genes in the estrogen receptor(ER) positive T-47D human breast cancer cell linemaintained O 2or at 1% O2with or without E2co- treatment. Treatment by E2 or hypoxia alone altered the expression of 26 and 9 genes, respectively, whilst theexpression of 31 genes was modulated by H-E 2combination. Of the 31 genes modulated by the H-E2 combination, 21 of them were found to be down-regulated. Microarray data wasvalidated for 19 by quantitative real-time PCR and a goodcorrelation noted (r 2=0.8). Five out of these 19 genes were assayed for protein expression by Western blot and a goodcorrelation was found between mRNA and protein levels. Statistical analysis showed that the gene expressionmodulation by the combined H and E 2treatment was additive in most cases. Interestingly, the transcription factorCCAAT/enhancer binding protein- (C/EBP), involved incontrol of cell differentiation and proliferation, was found tobe down-regulated by hypoxia and E 2. Therefore, we examined the mechanism by which the down-regulation byhypoxia and by E 2takes place. Using the specific RNA polymerase II inhibitor 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole (DRB), the mRNA stability and without E 2co- treatment. Hypoxia and the H-E2combination but not E2alone reduced the half-life of the C/EBP mRNA by ~30%.C/EBP gene promoter studies indicated that hypoxia but not E 2repressed the transcription of the gene and identified a hypoxia response element (-522; -527 bp) which binds to HIF-1 as essential for down-regulation of C/EBP transcription in hypoxia. Immunocytochemical analysis showed thatC/EBP was localized in the nucleus at 21% O 2with or without E2co-treatment, but was mostly cytoplasmic under 1% O2in the presence or in the absence of E2. Knockdown of HIF-1 by RNAi restored C/EBP to normal levels underhypoxic conditions. Immunohistochemical studies of 10tumour samples did not show any colocalization of C/EBPand GLUT1 (used as a marker for hypoxia). Taken together,these results show that hypoxia downregulates C/EBPexpression in breast cancer cells by several and post-transcriptional effects. Thedown-regulation of C/EBP mediated by HIF-1that by the H-E 2combination is mainly due to hypoxic effect. This justifies further examination of C/EBP as a possibletherapeutic target in breast cancer with large hypoxic regions. 441 ROLE OF 2B4 (CD244) AND CS1 (CD319) KILLER CELL-MEDIATED KILLING CELLS Porunelloor A. Mathew and Stephen O. Mathew Department of Molecular Biology and Immunology and Institute for Cancer and Blood Disorders, University ofNorth Texas Health Science Center, 3500 Camp Bowieblvd., Fort Worth, TX, 76107, USA Natural killer (NK) cells are components of the innate immune system and form the first line of defense against variouscancer and viral infections. NK cells have the ability to killcertain cancer cells and their function is regulated by a delicatebalance between activating and inhibitory signals receivedthrough cell surface receptors. 2B4 (CD244) and CS1(CD319, CRACC) are members of the signaling lymphocyte-activation molecule (SLAM) family of receptors expressed onANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3398NK cells. Activation of NK cells through surface 2B4 or CS1 enhanced the killing of several tumor cells including K562 andDU145 prostate cancer cells. Studies using 2B4gene knockout mice revealed an in vivo role for 2B4 in rejection the 2B4 and CS1monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were more effective in killingDU145 prostate cancer cells than unstimulated NK cells.Understanding the expression and function of these receptorswill shed more light on how these receptors stimulate NK cellsto effectively target and kill cancer cells.

In vitro antiproliferative effect tested on ML-2 cell line was, however, negative. This enzyme in comparison with mungbean nuclease (PhA) (3) and (BS-RNase) was in vivo a little less effective on the melanoma tumours, however, moreeffective on melanoma in comparison to black pine pollennuclease (PN) (4). The most antitumorous and antiproliferativeeffects were observed on prostatic carcinoma after intravenousapplication of TBN1 conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG) for its stabilization, suggesting selective action of TBN1 oncancer cells in vivo . It was found that TBN1 exhibits lower side-effects, e.g.aspermatogenesis of ICR mice, relative to other nucleases studied. As the most important fact, it wasfound that immunosuppressivity caused by TBN1 was almostzero in comparison to the high MCL immunosuppressivitycharacteristic. As detected by immunofluorescence microscopy and by biochemical methods, TBN1 penetrates tumor cells withinseveral hours after its application. The following biochemicalproperties that could be essential for the specific nucleaseaction on tumors are characteristic for purified TBN1. Maturenuclease TBN1 is a glycoprotein ~36 kDa. It has a pI of 5.42and a pH optimum of 5.9 for double-stranded (ds) DNA and6.3 for single-stranded (ss)RNA and to destroyhuman 28S, 18S, 7S and 5.8S RNA in vitro, as as dsRNA producing oligo and mononucleotides. The enzyme showsmaximum activity around 60C suggesting its high thermo-and structural stability. Hence, TBN1 can act on variouscellular RNA species, genomic DNA, as well as on RNAinduced during posttranscriptional gene silencing. Moreover,3'nucleotidase activity of TBN1 can dephosphorylate somenucleoprotein receptor(s) or other cellular components. This CULTIV PRIMARY MAMMARYEPITHELIAL CELLS FROM BREAST CANCER PATIENTS, BRCA1/2 CARRIERS, AND HEALTHY CONTROLS: USEFUL MODEL FOR BREAST CANCER RESEARCH Eva Matouskova 1,2, Bursikova1,2, Jan Biochemistry and Experimental Oncology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague, Prague 2,121 08; 2Prague Burn Centre, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague, Prague 10, 100 00, Czech Republic In vitro cultured primary mammary epithelial cells (MECs) from oncological patients and healthy women represent one ofthe best models for studies of malignant transformation. WeAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3399have developed and optimized a feeder layer technique for cultivation of human MECs. More than 200 primary MECcultures were established from normal and malignant tissue ofthe mammary gland. Among them, 26 cell populations fromthe mammary gland of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers were prepared. Spontaneous immortalization occurred in twocell populations. The first one, EM-G3 cell line, was derivedfrom primary breast carcinoma tissue and exerts characteristicsof mammary progenitor cells. Recently, a second cell line fromMECs has been established. Primary cells and cell lines werecharacterized by proliferative activity, morphology, dynamicactivity (time-lapse MECs used fordevelopment of the \"Non-destructive Test of Cellular Activity\"that can be used for individual tumors' chemosensitivity testingand for screening of new potentially antitumor drugs. Theclonal cell line EM-G3 was able to partially differentiate in vivo as well as in vitro . It represents a unique spontaneously immortalized clonal cell line evidently derived frompremalignant breast cancer progenitors. The study ofdifferences in biological behavior between BRCA1 mutation-carrying MACs and BRCA1 -wt MACs in vitro allows us to trace effects of BRCA1 haploinsufficiency in early stages of mammary cancerogenesis in BRCA1 mutation carriers. The work was supported by grant NR 8345-4 from the GrantAgency of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic. 444 TELOMERE MAINTENANCE MECHANISMS INMESENCHYMAL TUMORS Toshihiro Matsuo School of Biomedical Sciences,Hiroshima Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima734-8551, Japan Background and Aim: Telomere maintenance is regarded as an important mechanism in evading senescence in tumor cells,and two types of telomere maintenance have beendescribed in tumors: lengthening of telomeres Approximately85% of engage a mechanism to maintain stabletelomere length by telomerase activity. ALT is characterizedby a heterogeneous pattern of telomere length, usually rangingfrom very short to abnormally long, and a substantialproportion of some types of sarcomas have been reported tohave elongated telomeres consistent with ALT in the absenceof telomerase activity. Therefore, sarcomas are distinct fromcarcinomas in that a substantial portion of them use the ALTmechanism to maintain their telomeres. We review the role oftelomere maintenance mechanisms in bone and soft tissuetumors, including our recent results of an analysis of the clinical significance of telomere factors. Recent findings: The prevalence of ALT varied greatly among different soft tissuesarcoma subtypes and the proportion of ALT also differedamong previous reports. In addition, the frequency oftelomerase activity expression in mesenchymal tumors differedamong previous reports. The telomere maintenancemechanism has recently emerged as a prognostic factor forsarcomas, although some of the data are controversial. Our findings: In giant cell tumors of bone, telomere length correlated with roentgenographic grade due to frequency ofcell division, and high telomerase activity indicated theaggressiveness. In desmoids tumors, decreasing telomerelength correlated with tumor size due to increased duration ofproliferation in the tumor, and tumor aggressiveness. Insarcomas, ALT is a very significant prognostic risk factor forsarcoma patients. In ALT-negative sarcoma patients,telomerase expression is a significant prognostic risk factor.Summary: Although recent studies indicate a positive correlation between the telomere maintenance mechanism andtumor aggressiveness in mesenchymal tumors, there aredifferent and controversial data among previous reports.Therefore, further study is necessary to clarify telomeremaintenance mechanisms in bone and soft tissue mesenchymaltumors. 445 PYRUV ATE KINASE TYPE M2: A TARGET OF DIFFERENT ONCOGENES WITH HIGHTHERAPEUTIC S. Mazurek 1,2, 2ScheBo Biotech AG, Giessen, Germany; 3Institute for Biomedical Aging Research of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Innsbruck, Austria; 4Institute for Medical Radiation and Cell Research, University of W\u00fcrzburg, Germany; 5Department of Physiological Sciences, Spain Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the last glycolysis, the dephosphorylation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate,and is responsible for net ATP production within the glycolyticpathway. Tissues with different metabolic functions expressdifferent isoenzymes of pyruvate kinase (type M1, M2, R or L,respectively). All proliferating cells, i.e. normal proliferating cells, embryonic cells, adult stem cells and tumor cells inparticular, express pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (M2-PK, PKM2), which plays a key role in the regulation of theWarburg effect. M2-PK may occur in a highly activeANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3400tetrameric form, with a high affinity to its substrate PEP, which favors the breakdown of glucose to pyruvate and lactatewith production of energy. It may also exist in a nearlyinactive dimeric form with a low PEP affinity, which channelsglucose carbons into synthetic processes, which debranch fromglycolytic intermediates, i.e. nucleic-acid, amino acid and phospholipid synthesis. In tumor cells, the dimeric form ofM2-PK, termed Tumor M2-PK, is always predominant and isfavored by direct interaction with various oncogenes. The E7oncoprotein of the human papilloma virus type 16 binds toM2-PK. pp60v-src kinase, the serine of M2-PK. The effect of A-Raf on the quaternary structure of M2-PKis secondarily influenced by the amino acid metabolism(glutamine, serine and alanine) of the individual cell line. Thephysiological function of the interaction of M2-PK withHERC 1 is still unknown. However, the tetramer: dimer ratio of M2-PK may fluctuate in tumor cells depending upon the concentrations of signalmetabolites, e.g.fructose 1,6-P2 which induces a re-association of the dimeric of M2-PK to the tetrameric form. The M2-PK isoenzyme, with its ability to switch between a highlyactive tetrameric and inactive dimeric form, is an importantmetabolic adapts tumor metabolism to varyingnutrient supply. Peptide aptamers which re-association of M2-PK to the tetramericform thereby reducing ATP levels and tumor cell proliferation.(www.metabolic-database.com). 446 PYRUV ATE KINASE TYPE M2: AN IMPORTANTREGULATOR OF THE WARBURG EFFECT WITH DIAGNOSTIC S. 1,2, Giessen; and Endocrinology, Veterinary Medicine, University of Berlin, 7Institute for Laboratory Diagnosis, Helios Hospital, Berlin; 8Institute for Occupational and Social Medicine, University of Giessen, Germany Proliferating cells - particularly tumor cells - express a special isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase termed type M2 (M2-PK,PKM2) which plays a key role in the regulation of the glycolytic flux rate and the Warburg effect. Pyruvate kinasecatalyzes the dephosphory-lation of phosphoenolpyruvate(PEP) to pyruvate and is responsible for net ATP productionwithin the glycolytic pathway. M2-PK may occur in a highlyactive tetrameric form and a nearly inactive dimeric form. Thetetramer:dimer ratio of M2-PK determines whether glucosecarbons are converted to pyruvate and lactate with theproduction of energy (tetrameric form), or are channeled intosynthetic processes which debranch from glycolyticintermediates, such as nucleic acid, amino acid andphospholipid synthesis. (http://www.metabolic-database.com). In tumor cells, M2-PK was found to be mainly in the dimeric form which has therefore been termed Tumor M2-PK.Immunohisto-logical studies of various tumors withmonoclonal antibodies (Clone DF4, ScheBo Biotech, Giessen)which specifically recognize the dimeric form of M2-PKrevealed a heterogeneous distribution of Tumor M2-PK inprimary tumors, whereas their metastases are alwayscharacterized by homogeneously large amounts of Tumor M2-PK. The dimeric form of M2-PK is released from tumors intothe patients' blood, most likely by tumor cell necrosis. To quantify Tumor M2-PK in EDTA-plasma samples, a sandwich ELISA (ScheBo Biotech, Giessen) based on twomonoclonal antibodies which specifically recognize the dimericform of M2-PK has been developed. In accordance with theimmunohistological results an increase in Tumor M2-PK inEDTA plasma samples, and a correlation with tumor stage, wasfound for renal cell carcinoma, thyroid, lung, breast, cervical,ovarian, pancreatic, gastric and colorectal cancer, as well asmelanoma. When taken together these results show that TumorM2-PK is an organ-unspecific marker, which reflects themetabolic activity of the tumors. A major application forTumor M2-PK in EDTA plasma is patient follow-up to and relapses during therapy. 447 1,2and Jo Nijs1,2 1Department of Vrije Universiteit Brussel(VUB); 2Division of Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy, Department of Health Sciences, University College Antwerp (HA), Belgium Background: Cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are both characterised by fatigue and severe disability. Fatigue isthe hallmark of CFS, and fatigue is a common symptomexperienced by people undergoing treatment for cancer.Although cancer is a well-known and recognized disease andAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3401CFS is rather unknown and underestimated, the fatigue is not the only link between the two diseases. By comparing the twodiseases we might gain more insight into the physiopathologyand the cause of some common complaints. Methods: Based on our own findings and on literature results the intracellular immune dysfunctions in CFS will beexplained, the hypothesised relation with fatigue will beelucidated and finally the link with cancer patients will bemade. Results: Both in cancer and in CFS, the immune system has shown important and partly overlapping changes. One ofthe major intracellular immune dysfunctions in CFS is thederegulation of the RNase L antiviral pathway. Thisderegulation may lead to channelopathies that in turn mightbe responsible for some of the CFS symptoms. Also in cancerpatients abnormalities in the RNase L pathway are alreadydocumented. The R462Q variant of RNase L, having about 3-fold reduced catalytic activity in vitro , is the most prevalent genetic marker for prostate cancer. Malfunctioning of naturalkiller (NK) cells ( i.e.decreased natural killer cell cytotoxicity) has long been recognised as an important factor in thedevelopment and reoccurrence of cancer, and has beendocumented repeatedly in people with CFS. Besides thesemajor interfaces disturbed apoptotic mechanisms and oxidativestress or excessive nitric oxide may play a role in the twodiseases and in the common symptom fatigue. With regard tothese immunological abnormalities prudence is called forduring the rehabilitation of these patients. Exercise is currentlyrecommended as a conservative intervention for both fatiguedcancer patients and CFS patients, but based on literaturefindings and our own results we know that too vigorousexercise may worsen the immune system and the complaintsin CFS patients. The exercise response to intensive activity incancer patients is less understood. On the other hand, it is wellknown that moderate exercise has beneficial effects on theimmune system and may even have preventive effects oncancer in all disease stages. Therefore physical rehabilitationshould be carefully balanced. Conclusion: Despite the high mortality rates in cancer, cancer and CFS present severalsimilarities. The immunological abnormalities, such as aderegulated RNase L pathway, reduced NK cytotoxicity,increased oxidative stress etc are present in both diseases.These anomalies may be responsible for some of the commoncomplaints, like fatigue, and should be considered in thephysical rehabilitation of these patients. 448 CURRENT STANDARDS IN PSYCHOSOCIAL CANCER CARE Anja MehnertDepartment of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistr. 52 - S35, 20246Hamburg, Germany Over the past thirty years, psychosocial cancer care has become an integral part of cancer treatment in many countriesaround the world, a development that has been accompaniedby research findings and meta-analyses showing thatpsychosocial care enhances the well-being and quality of lifeof cancer patients. This increasing integration is reflected inthe rising number of new institutions for psychosocial care,the increase in research programs, the large number ofscientific publications and conferences, as well as in theincreased acceptance of psychosocial oncology amongmedical professions, cancer patients and the general public. First approaches to offer cancer patients psychological help in various European countries started in the middle of the1970s. Experience in these approaches demonstrate that inmost cases major problems in understanding and acceptancearose. Medical doctors and nurses expressed their criticalattitudes towards psycho-oncology. Only very few clinicalinstitutions reported a successful implementation ofpsychosocial interventions. There were various reasons for theproblems of implementing psychosocial services into clinicalpractice. Knowledge about the relevance of psychological andsocial factors for the development and the course of diseasessuch as cancer were not as widespread as today among healthcare professionals. Thus, the understanding of disease wasstrongly determined by biological models. Furthermore,medical health care professionals often showed a lack ofwillingness to let new professions such as psychologists orpsychotherapists participate within the care of patients. Since then, the situation has substantially changed. Comprehensive models of diseases and treatment are prevalentamong the general population, as well as among health careprofessionals. Psycho-oncological interventions and programshave gained increasing interest, addressing various aspects ofcancer survivorship such as psychological comorbidity,psychosocial care needs and return to work in cancer survivors.One major factor that contributes to this development is thewell-established psycho-oncological research. Nevertheless,psycho-oncological services are not well implemented in manyhealth care institutions and facilities for cancer patients. Today,as important as the above mentioned historical barriers is thelack of personal and financial resources to meet the psycho-oncological needs of cancer patients. 449 PATIENT-TO-PATIENT AND INTRA-PATIENT SUB-SAMPLING V ARIATION IN GENE 1, Belousov5, Medicine, of 4Institute of Pathology, University of Heidelberg; 5Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany We assessed the influence of tumor cell composition on gene expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) analyzingpatient-to-patient and intra-patient variations. Four differentsites of individual tumors from 20 patients undergoingresection for primary lung cancer were used to establish thegene expression pattern captured by Affymetrix HG-U133Plus 2.0 arrays. Inter-patient (patient-to-patient) and intra-patient (tumor site to tumor site) variability of geneexpression were determined in an uni-variant and multi-variate setting using linear mixed effect model approach andpartial least squares regression, respectively. The majority ofprobe sets revealed consistently larger differences inexpression among the patients than seen within the differenttumor sub-samples of the same patient. Considering the 0.6%of the probes sets which showed sensible tumor sitevariability, gene ontology analysis revealed that these geneswere 'at random'. No association to TNM status, tumorstage, or other study co-variates wasdetected. A small number of genes were identified to beassociated with tumor cell or stroma tissue content. Inconclusion, expression profiles based on single tumor tissuepieces from NSCLC patients are representative of the entiretumor, if viable tumor cell content is equal to or greater fiftypercent. 450 ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND Medical School and Teaching Hospital, Olomouc, and Department ofOncology and Radiotherapy, Charles University MedicalSchool and Teaching Hospital, Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, CzechRepublic Cancer and the complications of atherosclerosis represent two leading causes of death in the industrialized nations. Cancerand atherosclerosis share risk factors and commonly affectthe same individuals. A causal link in the pathogenesis ofthese two disorders that would exist in addition to the sharedrisk factors ( e.g. age or smoking) is a matter of dispute. Inflammatory response, both local and systemic, plays animportant role in the progression of both atherosclerosis andcancer. For example, systemic inflammatory responseresulting from chronic infections that is reflected in increasedserum concentrations of C-reactive protein has beenpostulated to play an important role in the progression ofatherosclerosis. Advanced/metastatic cancer is also commonly associated with systemic inflammatory response and elevationof serum C-reactive protein, but poor prognosis of patientswith advanced/metastatic cancer might have prevented theclinical manifestation of accelerated atherosclerosis in thisgroup of patients. The progress in the therapy of some tumorsin the past decades may lead to unmasking of the effect ofsystemic inflammatory response associated with advanced/metastatic cancer on the progression of atherosclerosis.Moreover, the toxicity of anticancer therapy may result in theprogression of atherosclerosis. The clinical data so farindicate increased incidence of cardiovascular disorders insurvivors of childhood cancer or germ-cell tumors that isassociated with a history of chemotherapy. The data on morecommon adult tumors are more scarce. Hormonal therapymay have an adverse effect on the risk factors ofatherosclerosis. However, the adverse effect of aromataseinhibitors, now commonly used in the adjuvant therapy ofbreast carcinoma, on serum lipid concentrations may reflectthe effect of tamoxifen withdrawal rather than the action ofaromatase inhibitors themselves. More pronounced adverseeffects on the progression of atherosclerosis could beexpected from the use of drugs targeting the vascularendothelial growth factor or its receptors, but these drugswere introduced only recently and are now used almostexclusively in patients with incurable metastatic tumors. Inconclusion, we are just beginning to appreciate the extent towhich advanced/metastatic cancer and/or anticancer therapycauses progression of atherosclerosis. With improved therapyof more common tumors, a causal link between cancer andatherosclerosis mediated by inflammatory response maybecome obvious. The impact of new biologic agents on theprogression of atherosclerosis has yet to be determined. 451 CHEMOTHERAPY RESISTANCE IN GLIOMAS M. Mellai , di Monza/University of Turin, Vercelli, Italy Tumor cell resistance to radio - and chemotherapy is the major bias in tumor treatment. The mechamisms are todaytopics of intense study. In its clinical applications, MGMT (O 6 - methylguanine DNA methylatransferase) is very important.Promoter hypermethylation of the MGMT gene blocks theremoval of methyl groups from the O 6position of guanine produced by alkylating agents. Methylated tumors show betteroutcome in comparison with unmethylated ones. Methylationcan be assessed by Methylation Specific PCR (MSP) or byimmunohistochemistry and it is used today in association withTemozolomide.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3403In the absence of functional MGMT, an important additional mechanism of resistance to alkylating agents isDNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) deficiency. This pathwayfunctions as a mismatch excision repair leading to additionalDNA double strand breaks and apoptotic cell death in cellslacking MGMT activity. Alternative mechanisms involve Nucleotide and Base Excision Repair pathways (NER and BER, respectively). Thelatter refers to the Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1)enzymes which are activated by DNA damage. The ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) genes are responsible for the multidrug resistance (MDR) to the topoisomeraseinhibitors VP-16 as well as to vincristine in a number ofcancers. Our experience in gliomas is that unusual nucleic acid structures called G-quadruplexes (G4) play important biological roles, either atthe DNA or RNA level. G-quadruplexes result from thehydrophobic stacking of guanine quartets (Figure); eachquartet being a planar association of 4 guanines (or guanineanalogs (1)) held together by 8 hydrogen bonds. A cation(typically K +) is located between two quartets and forms cation-dipole interactions with 8 guanines. I will present some of the properties and applications of G4 structures in areas ranging from nanotechnology (2),biotechnology to medicinal chemistry. Two quadruplex-relatedcompounds (a G-rich oligonucleotide and a G4 ligand) arecurrently in II clinical trials. G4 structures are verystable under physiological conditions and it is likely thatnature designed proteins such as helicases or chaperones tocontrol their formation. Quadruplexes may be involved in telomere regulation. The 3' G-rich telomeric overhang from a variety of speciesmay adopt a G-quadruplex structure. We analyzed severalseries of G4 ligands that recognize the human telomericquadruplex and were initially considered as telomeraseinhibitors. However, we demonstrated that inhibitory effectof such molecules has been overestimated and that G4ligands rather constitute a different class of biologicallyactive compounds (3, 4). Finally, RNA sequences may alsoform quadruplexes. The transcribed telomeric repeats(TERRA) and the RNA component of telomerase (calledhTERC or hTR) may form very stable intramolecularguanine Presentation of a G-quartet, with four coplanar guanines. 1 Gros J, Avino A, Lopez de la Osa J, Gonzalez C, Lacroix L, Perez A, Orozco M, Eritja R and Mergny JL: Chem Comm,2008, 2 L, Teulade-Fichou MP and Mergny JL: Angew Chem Int Ed 57, 4858, 2008. 3 De Cian A, Cristofari G, Reichenbach P, OF ANTICANCER IMMUNITYIN OF CANCER PATIENTS Giusy MessinaPsychological Service, Policlinico Maggiore Hospital, University of Milan, Italy It is long known that the psychospiritual status may influence tumour growth and the prognosis of the neoplastic disease.However, only with the development of psychoneuro-endocrinoimmunology (PNEI) has it been possible tocharacterize the neuroimmunochemical mechanismresponsible for the influence of the psychospiritual conditionon tumour growth, namely through the modulation of theimmune system, which appears to be able to control cancer ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3404cell proliferation. Anticancer immunity is stimulated by IL-2 and IL-12, whereas it is inhibited by IL-10 and IL-6.According to recent advances in tumour immunobiology, atpresent the most important cell suppressing the anticancerimmunity is the T regulatory lymphocyte (T reg), which mayidentify CD4+CD25+ cells. At present it is possible to monitorthe clinical history of a neoplastic disease by evaluating notonly tumor marker concentration but also theimmunobiological status of cancer patients by measuringimmune parameters related to anticancer immunity, such asIL-2, IL-12, lymphocyte count and the different lymphocytesubpopulations. In particular, it has been observed that low IL-6 and IL-10, a low number of lymphocytes and T-helperlymphocytes (CD4) and an increased number of T reg isassociated with poor prognosis. Stress, chronic pain,depression and anxiety, which have a negative influence on theprognosis of cancer, appear to act through the opioid system,whose activation may suppress anticancer immunity. On thecontrary, pleasure and spirituality may stimulate the anticancerimmunity through the activation of the pineal gland and thebrain endocannabinoid system. Thus PNEI may allow us toexplain the overall clinical evidence shown by psycho-oncological studies. However within the great number ofpsychological variables, spirituality has to be considered asbeing different from the psychological profile. The spiritualitywould act through the pineal gland and the brainendocannabinoid system, whereas the psychological statuswould be mediated by the opioid system. Several tests havebeen used to investigate the psychological profile of cancerpatients but according to our experience the most appropriatepsychological examination could be represented by theRorschach's test, because of rational objectivity. In contrast,at present the investigation of spirituality remains difficult,since most questionnaires proposed up to now are generallylimited to the investigation of religious practice. We haveperformed several studies to investigate the differentpsychological profile of cancer patients in relation to theirpsychoneuroendocrinoimmune status. The psychologicalprofile was investigate by the Rorschach's test and the spiritualstatus was analyzed by a special spiritual test. We performedfive main studies, obtaining the following relationships: i) lownumbers of lymphocytes and T-helper lymphocytes solid tumour and suppression ofspiritual and sexual sensitivity; the study was carried out in 60patients, 30 of them showed a metastatic disease. Colon, lungand breast cancer were the most frequent tumours in ourpatients. ii) Low efficacy of IL-2 immunotherapy and lowlymphocyte response to IL-2, occurring in cancer patients,were associated with anxiety and/or loss of sexual identity.The study was performed in 30 patients with renal cancer. iii)A low number of lymphocytes was associated with alterationin the circadian rhythm of cortisol and hypercortisolemia incancer patients with a low spiritual profile. The study wascarried out in 30 patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. iv) An abnormally high percent of T-regulatorylymphocytes (CD4CD25) in patients with solid tumour wasassociated with a self-punishment' status. The study was carriedout in 40 patients with locally limited or metastatic neoplasm. v)Lack of surgery induced-hyperprolactinemia in operable breastcancer patients was associated with suppression of the maternalbehaviour. The study was performed in 30 women. These results would suggest the possibility to investigate the psychoneuroimmune basis of the overall psychologicalprofile, characterizing cancer patients during the clinicalhistory of their disease. Further studies by investigating thebrain endocannabinoid system through the detection of theblood concentration of the main endocannabinoid agent,anandamide, will clarify the neurochemical alterationresponsible for the progressive loss of pleasure occurringduring TREATMENT AND CANCER Samina Alam, Brian Bowser and Craig Meyers Department of Microbiology and Immunology, H107, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey,PA. 17033 USA One of the major goals of our laboratory is to identify factors and their inherent targeting mechanisms which affectprogression of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associatedcervical cancers. Two types of cofactor studies are currentlyunderway in our laboratory which have addressed theseissues. The first set of studies deals with the development oftherapeutics for cervical as well as other types of cancer.Epidemiological studies indicate a negative correlationbetween adeno-associated virus type 2 (AA V2) infection andthe incidence of HPV associated cervical cancer. Theoncosuppressive properties of AA V2 is linked to the abilityof this virus to perturb cell-cycle progression by decreasingcellular proliferation rates and mediating growth arrest. Oneof the hallmarks of HPV infection is the abrogation of keycell cycle regulatory proteins. We utilized HPV infectedhuman keratinocytes as well as normal human foreskinkeratinocytes, which are natural hosts for both AA V2 andHPV . Cultures death,as determined by DNA laddering. Cell death could becorrelated with an increased percentage of cells with S-phaseDNA content, concurrent with AA V2 Rep protein expression.Simultaneously, pRb protein levels were stabilized in itshypophosphorylated form and HPV E7 oncoproteinAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3405expression was severely diminished. In addition, other cell lines infected with different HPV types from both low- andhigh-grade lesions were also sensitive to AA V2-induced celldeath. Interestingly, HPV-negative carcinoma lines, includinga squamous cell carcinoma line, the MCF-7 breast cancerline, and the PC3 prostate cancer line, also underwentapoptotic cell death following infection with AA V2. In sharpcontrast, primary foreskin keratinocytes infected with AA V2were resistant to apoptosis. The ability of AA V2 toexclusively target deregulated cells indicates its potential forbeing developed as an anticancer agent in gene therapyprotocols. The second set of studies is also based on epidemiological studies which suggest that HPV-infectedwomen who smoke face an increased risk for developingcervical cancer. We are the first laboratory to demonstrate amolecular link between exposure of HPV-infected tissue tocigarette smoke carcinogens and its effect on the viral lifecycle. Benzo[ a]pyrene (B aP) is a well-characterized cigarette smoke carcinogen and has been found to beconcentrated in the cervical mucus. HPV genomeamplification was enhanced at low concentrations of B aP, whereas higher concentrations induced significant increasesin the synthesis of infectious virus. We have also studiedhost cell cycle and differentiation gene expression, and havecorrelated changes to the increase in viral genomes andproduction of infectious viral particles. Since most HPVinfections are spontaneously cleared, our data suggests thatBaP induction of increased virion synthesis and genome amplification give rise to an increased viral load, affectingthe persistence of the viral infection and level of oncogeneexpression. 455 METHYLATION PROFILE OF hMLH1, MGMT, APC AND CDH1 GENES IN GREEK PATIENTS WITH ADENOCARCINOMA Christina I. 1, School, University of Athens; Athens; 2Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, Medical School, University of Athens; Athens; 3Second Department of Propedeutic Surgery, Medical School, University of Athens; Athens, Greece Introduction: Colon cancer is a common malignancy usually arising from a benign neoplasm which is developedinto adenocarcinoma through a certain histologicalprogression sequence. Genomic instability and epigeneticalterations - with hypermethylation of cytosine in CpG islands in the promoter of certain genes- play an importantrole in carcinogenesis and tumour progression of this typeof cancer. Epigenetic changes conduce to cancer formationthrough the transcriptional silencing of certain genes. Theaim of this study was to analyze the promoter methylationof genes related with mismatch repair as hMLH1; repairgenes like MGMT which interferes in the repair of O 6position of guanine by removing alkyl like CDH1 which encodes epithelial cadherinpreventing cells from growing and dividing in anuncontrolled way to form a malignant tumour. Materials and Methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from 28 colon cancer patients (14Male/14Female), with mean age 64years. DNA was then subjected to chemical modificationwith sodium bisulfate and followed by Methylation SpecificPCR (MSP) amplified specific sequences. PCR productswere in UV . The methylation results wereassociated with patients' gender and age, tumours'histological grade and stage. Results: Promoter methylation for hMLH1 gene was observed in 1 out of 28 (3%), forMGMT in 15 out of 28 (53%), for APC in 5 out of 28(18%) and for CDH1 in 24 out of 28 (86%). In 15 out of28 (61%) cases methylation in 2 or more of the examinedgenes was noted. Methylation profiles were also associatedwith clinicopathological characteristics of the colon cancerpatients. A statistically significant association betweenmethylation of CDH1 gene and Dukes' stage (stage A, B,C vs.D; p=0.002) was found. Moreover, an association (although not statistically significant) between methylationstatus in two or more genes with either tumour histologicalgrade (well and moderately vs.poorly differentiated) or Dukes' stage (stage A, B, C vs. D) was also noted ( p=0.055 and p=0.063, respectively). Conclusion: Our data confirmed alterations in the methylation status of hMLH1, APC andMGMT genes in colon cancer, although no significantassociation was noticed with any of the examinedclinicopathological parameters. Additionally, the promoterof CDH1 gene was found to be very frequently methylated,being related with Dukes' stage. Furthermorehypermethylation in two or more genes seemed to berelated with tumour characteristics. By expanding ourresearch effort in the examination of methylation statusduring the whole procedure from normal tissue to earlyadenoma and carcinoma formation, we may furtherdelineate whether methylation can be used as a possibletarget therapy in colon cancer, since demethylation canrestore gene expression.This work and Christina I. 3406456 and Toxicology, University of Athens, Athens; 2First Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of Athens, Athens, Greece; 3Department of Pathology, Institut Curie, Paris, kinase (FAK), a non-receptor kinase protein, acts as an early modulator of integrinsignaling cascade, regulating basic cellular functions. Intransformed cells unopposed FAK signaling has beenconsidered to promote tumor growth, progression andmetastasis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate theclinical significance of FAK expression in human benign andmalignant thyroid lesions. Design: FAK protein expression was assessed immunohistochemically in formalin-fixed,paraffin-embedded thyroid tissues from 116 patients withbenign (46 hyperplastic nodules and 9 Hashimoto thyroiditis)and malignant 5 follicular and 1anaplastic thyroid carcinomas) lesions. Immunohistochemicalevaluation was based on both staining intensity and theamount of positive stained cells within thyroid lesion, gradedin a two step scale as weak or no staining and moderate orstrong staining. Statistical analysis was performed to comparethe expression of FAK protein between benign and malignantthyroid lesions, as well as between Hashimoto thyroiditis andhyperplastic thyroid lesions within benign subgroup. In thesubgroup of malignant thyroid tumors, FAK proteinexpression was statistically analyzed in relation to TNM stageand tumor proliferative capacity, assessed by Ki-67 labelingindex. Results: FAK protein expression was characterized as weak or no staining in 83 (72%) and moderate or strongstaining in 33 (28%) out of 116 cases. In malignant thyroidlesions, FAK protein expression was characterized as weak orno staining in 35 (57%) and moderate or strong staining in 26(43%) out of 61 cases. In benign thyroid lesions, FAK proteinexpression was characterized as weak or no staining in 48(87%), moderate or strong staining in 7 (13%) out of 55 cases.The level of FAK protein expression was statisticallysignificantly higher in malignant thyroid lesions comparedwith benign ones ( p=0.001). In malignant thyroid lesions, FAK protein expression was statistically significantlyassociated with the presence of nodal metastasis ( p=0.047). Additionally, a borderline association between FAK proteinexpression and tumor cells' proliferating capacity was noted(p=0.065). Regarding the benign thyroid lesions, FAK protein expression was not statistically significantly associated withhistological type, in order to provide a distinct discriminationbetween Hashimoto thyroiditis and hyperplastic nodules.Conclusion: The current data confirm the expression of FAK protein in thyroid lesions that can significantly distinguishbenign from malignant cases, being also associated withdisease stage (N) and proliferative capacity in thyroidmalignant cells. Further studies are needed in order todelineate the clinical importance of FAK expression in thyroidneoplasia and its possible use as a target for future therapyapplications. 457 ANTICANCER PROPERTIES AND MDRMODULATORY EFFECT OF PLANT POLYPHENOLS AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH MEMBRANE Krystyna Ljubljana,Slovenia; 3CECF/iMed. UL, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Lisbon, Av. das For\u00e7as Armadas, 1600-083 Lisbon, Portugal Many compounds of plant origin have been identified to be interesting for potential application in cancer prevention orchemotherapy. Such agents were found among flavonoids andstilbenes. In broad in vitro and in vivo studies, the ability of plant-derived polyphenols to interact with different cellulartargets was revealed. Resveratrol (trans-3,4,5'-trihydro-xystilbene) influences many cellular signaling pathways andaffects all three stages of carcinogenesis. In this work theeffect of several stilbenes (resveratrol, its analoguepiceatannol, and piceatannol derivatives) and some flavonoidson activity of ABC multidrug transporters and potassiumchannels Kv1.3 was examined. Recently the role of potassiumchannel activity in cancer has emerged. Several of thecompounds studied were found to be potent potassium channelinhibitors. Strong inhibition of membrane transporters and ionchannels was often observed for hydroxy-, methoxy-, acetoxy-and prenyl- derivatives in relation to the parent compounds.Piceatannol, naringenin and some of their derivatives were themost active inhibitors of MRP1 multidrug transporter. Theinfluence of plant polyphenols on integral membrane proteinssuch as MDR transporters and ion channels can be mediated atleast in part by non-specific membrane effects. Flavonoids andstilbene interactions with lipid bilayers was determined byfluorescence and ESR spectroscopy. Simulation of theAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3407experimental ESR spectra and application of GHOST condensation method were applied to study the effect ofpolyphenols on membrane domain structure. The significanceof interaction of studied phytochemicals with membranetransporters, channels and lipid bilayer for their anticancerproperties was discussed. Antiproliferative properties of the compounds were tested in sensitive and doxorubicin-resistant, P-gp overexpressing coloncancer cell lines LoV Tangeretin,natural polymethoxylated flavone and 8-prenylnaringenin mosteffectively inhibited cell growth both in sensitive and resistantcancer cell lines. Antiproliferative action was compared withpro-apoptic properties of the compounds. 458 SEX STEROID-ACTIV ATED NON GENOMICSIGNALLING AS A TARGET FOR HORMONEDEPENDENT CANCER THERAPY A. Migliaccio , G. Castoria, L. Varricchio, A. de Falco, M. Di Domenico and F. Auricchio Department of General Pathology. II University of Naples. Via L. De Crecchio, 7 - 80138 - Naples, Italy In human mammary and prostate cancer cells, steroid hormones and EGF trigger association of the androgenreceptor (AR)-estradiol receptor (ER- or -) complex withSrc. This interactions activates Src and drives the cell into theG1-S phase progression. This suggests that such an interactioncan be targeted to control cancer cell growth. In view of this, we identified the AR sequence responsible for the androgen receptor/Src interaction and synthesized a 10amino acid peptide derived from this sequence, which inhibitsthis interaction. Treatment of human prostate or mammarycancer cells (LNCaP or MCF-7, respectively) with nanomolarconcentrations of this peptide prevented the androgen- orestradiol-induced association between AR or ER and Src. Thepeptide also inhibited the Src/Erk pathway, cyclin D1expression and DNA synthesis in steroid-stimulated LNCaPand MCF-7 cells, without interfering with receptor-dependenttranscriptional activity. Similarly, the peptide prevented the S-phase entry of LNCaP and MCF-7 cells treated with EGF aswell as mouse embryo fibroblasts stimulated with androgen the peptide did not inhibit S-phase entryor cytoskeletal changes induced by EGF treatment of AR-negative prostate cancer cell lines. The interest of thesefindings is highlighted by the fact that the peptide stronglyinhibited the growth of LNCaP xenografts established in nudemice. The AR/ER/src association induced by steroid hormones and EGF was also abolished in whole cells and in vitro by a six amino acid peptide, which mimics the sequencearound the phosphotyrosine residue in position 537 of ER-. This sequence is homologous to that surrounding the phosphotyrosine 443 of ER. The phoshorylated peptide,at of the Src-mediated EGF action on DNAsynthesis was detectable in human mammary cancer cellswhich did not express ER (MDA-MB231), peptide, in antagonists, did not interfere in ER- orAR-dependent transcriptional activity. Nevertheless, itmarkedly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cell xenograftsinduced in estradiol-treated nude mice. Both peptidesrepresent the first example of specific inhibitors of steroidreceptor-dependent signal transducing activity. Moreimportantly, these findings suggest that inhibition ofassociation of steroid receptors with Src or other signallingeffectors may have therapeutic applications for patientswith hormone-dependent tumors. 459 THERAPEUTIC AND DIAGNOSTIC APPLICATIONS OF APTAMERS IN CANCER S. MissailidisDepartment of Chemistry and Analytical Sciences, The Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, MK5 7AS, UK Aptamers were first described in 1990, and during the past 18 years they have found a number of applications, as researchtools or as therapeutic and diagnostic entities in the fightagainst disease. Aptamers are single stranded RNA or DNA molecules selected through evolutionary processes for high bindingaffinity and exceptional specificity against a variety oftargets, including enzymes, cell surface receptor proteins,cytokines and chemokines, antibodies, as well as smallorganic compounds. Although the majority of work onaptamers has not focused on cancer, one of the earlyaptamers against the VEGF has recently received FDAapproval against Macular Degeneration, as a PEGylatedpreparation, and has been in clinical trials against tumourangiogenesis. Aptamers against novel angiogenesis targetshave also been prepared by our group and are currently inpreclinical testing. Some aptamers have demonstrated directtherapeutic effect due to their apoptotic potential, resultingfrom blocking pathways. dimeric G-quadruplex oligo, has shown greattherapeutic potential in phase I clinical trials and has nowentered phase II trials for treatment for acute myeloidleukemia and renal cancer. An aptamer against an epithelial ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3408tumour cell marker developed by our group, has also shown great therapeutic potential on a 6 day treatment regime(results presented), as has an anti-HER3 aptamer. With theexception of nucleolin aptamer, most therapeutic aptamers have been PEGylated, toincrease their circulation time. These include the PDGF, thetenascin-C and our MUC1 aptamers, currently in variousstages of clinical development. Furthermore, aptamers haveunique properties as delivery vehicles and have beensuccessfully coupled to small chemotherapy agents, such asthe aptamers against neutrophil elastase, or to appropriatechelators loaded with radionuclides, exemplified by ownMUC1 aptamer work. The later can function both asimaging agents in medical imaging using gamma camera,allowing fast clearance from the system and good tumourlocalisation and penetration or PEGylated, as therapeuticradiopharmaceuticals when loaded with a beta emitter, suchas Re188 in the treatment of breast and bladder cancer.Finally, the unique binding properties of aptamers are beingutilised in the development of medical sensors, for targetssuch as PSA, MUC1 and others, where current detectionlimitations have restricted application. Aptamers remain a complicated field in terms of intellectual property, with strong control of intellectual property by twoUS companies, which has deterred the pharmaceutical industryfrom actively developing in this field. However, as the field isabout to open in the next few year, more and more aptamersare being developed therapeutically or diagnostically. 460 DYSTROGLYCAN FUNCTION IN PROSTATE CANCER Andrew Mitchell 1, Simon Cross2, Freddie Hamdy2 and Steve Winder1 Departments of 1Biomedical Sciences and 2Academic Urology, Section of Oncology, University of Sheffield, UK Prostate cancer (PCa) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western world. In its most aggressive forms,there is rapid growth and metastasis during which cells detachfrom the primary tumour and migrate within the blood andlymphatic system to form secondary tumours. Dystroglycan (DG) is a ubiquitously expressed cell adhesion molecule that provides a link between theextracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton. It is importantfor cell motility, polarity and possibly transduction. Wehave examined the function, distribution and localisation ofDG in several PCa cell lines including LNCaP, PC3 andDU145. We found that DG is extensively modified duringincreases in cell confluency in vitro , through both MMP- in glycosylation anchorage-independent growth assays andTranswell invasion studies revealed that colony-forming and invasive capabilities of PCa cells are significantly affected bychanges in DG levels. Reduced DG levels promoted growth insoft agar, whereas increased DG promoted invasion.Immunohistochemically, there was significant immunoreactivity within PCa primary tumour samples.However, in metastatic PCa samples from bone, in 5 sampleswith reduced DG levels in the primary tumour, DG levels wereincreased at the secondary site. DG would therefore appear tobe important for maintaining normal epithelial structure.Reduction in DG levels possibly contribute to the early stagesof cancer progression, however DG might need to be re-expressed in order for tumours to metastasise and establish atsecondary sites. Further investigations will help betterunderstand the complexities and role(s) of DG in PCa and alsoaid in elucidating the mechanism(s) and consequences of DGalteration in the disease. REGULATORY OF Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555, USA; 2University of Occupational and Environmental Health School of Medicine, Iseigaoka, Kitakyushu, Japan Resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents is the major failure for chemoprevention of cancer. Multidrug resistanceoften occurs due to enhanced expression of p-glycoprotein(p-gp)/MDR1, the product of multidrug resistance gene,MDR1 . MDR1 belongs to a family of exporters which mediate efflux of a variety of xenobiotics including cancerchemotherapeutic drugs. MDR1 overexpression oftenobserved in tumor cells contributes to failure of cancerchemotherapy. The mammalian AP-endonuclease (APE1/Ref-1), a central enzyme involved in repair of oxidative basedamage and DNA strand breaks, has a second activity as atranscriptional co-regulator when it complexes with anumber of transcription factors, including AP-1, p53 andNF-B and regulates their function viaredox-dependent and -independent mechanisms. APE1 overexpression, oftenobserved in tumor resistance tovarious anticancer drugs; its down-regulation sensitizestumor cells to such agents. Because the drug resistance ofmany tumor cells could not be explained by APE1's DNArepair activity which can not repair the DNA lesionsAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3409induced by such drugs, APE1's transcriptional regulatory function must be involved in drug resistance. We haveshown that APE1, preferably in acetylated form, stablyinteracts with the Y-box-binding protein-1 (YB-1), andenhances its binding to the Y-box element, leading to Enhanced MDR1 level due to expressionof WT APE1, its critical role in YB-1-mediated geneexpression and thus drug resistance in tumor cells. Asystematic increase in both APE1 and MDR1 expressionwas observed in non-small cell lung cancer tissue samples.Thus our study has established the novel role of acetylation-mediated transcriptional regulatory function of APE1,making it a potential target for drug sensitization of tumorcells.

It is well established that double-strandbreaks induced by ionizing radiation are mainly repaired bynonhomologous end-joining, whereas homologousrecombination plays a critical role in the repair of replication-associated DNA breaks. Because defects in these pathwayslead to chromosome aberrations ranging from translocationsto aneuploidy, altered repair pathways are assumed tocontribute to tumor initiation and progression. Rad51 and itsassociated proteins are major players at early stages ofhomologous recombination. Because the breast cancersusceptibility protein BRCA2 directly associates with Rad51,impaired homologous recombination is assumed to contributeto tumor development in BRCA mutation-associated cancer.In addition, Rad51 and BRCA2 are functionally associatedwith other protein complexes. Among the complexes, Rad51paralogs are involved in homologous recombination byassisting Rad51 functions. A link of Rad51 paralog withchromosome instability has been proposed from theobservations that the frequency of aneuploidy is increased intheir mutant cells. To understand the mechanism underlyingchromosome instability induced by defective homologousrecombination, we have generated colon cancer cell lines in which each Rad51 paralog is deleted. This study revealed thatimpaired centrosome integrity plays a role in chromosomeinstability induced by Rad51 paralog mutations. Moreover, weshow that the p53-dependent checkpoint plays a role in themaintenance of genome integrity in cells deficient in Rad51Bor Rad51C BREAST YOUNG ARAB WOMEN Fawziah M.A. Mohammed 1, Fatma Al-Yatama1, Anwar Al-Banaw1and David T. Lincoln2 1Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Kuwait University, Kuwait; 2Entity Systems, Independent Research Foundation, Chapel Hill, Australia Breast cancer is characterized by a long history and marked heterogeneity in growth rates and clinical manifestations.In Europe and USA, occurence peaks between the ages of60-65 years, with only 14% occurring below the age of 40years. In contrast, in Gulf Arab women the mean age is48.7 years and the peak occurrence of breast cancer is atthe age of 45-50 years. A significant proportion of 26% ofbreast cancer occurs below the age of 30 years and theincidence is increasing. Only 14.1% of breast cancer inArab women occurs above the age of 60 years. Breastcancer patients younger than 30 years have a worseprognosis than older patients. There are highly significanttrends for the prevalence of poor prognostic features (Grade3) histology, extensive intra-ductal component, lymphaticand vascular invasion to decrease with increasing age. Inthis study, we evaluated the expression of the HER-2/neuoncoprotein in breast cancer of young Arab women. TheHER-2/neu gene codes for a putative transmembrane protein, similar in structure to the epidermal growth factorreceptor (EGFR). A total of 122 patients were selected. Theaverage size of the tumours was 5.6 cm, the majority ofcases (76.2%) were invasive ductal carcinoma. Theamplification/ overexpression of paraffinwax embedded breast tumour tissues was analyzed byimmunohistochemistry using antiserum for presence of theHER-2/neu protein. A chemical detection system wasapplied to identify the antibody. A high degree ofimmunoreactivity indicated overexpression of this protein.From the 122 breast cancer cases investigated, 70 caseswere positive, with different degrees of intensity rangingfrom weak (27 cases), moderate (23 cases) to strong (19cases). The most intense HER-2/neu expression of the 70ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3410total positive cases were found in ductal carcinomas (16 cases) and infiltrating ductal carcinomas (14 cases). Somecases (n=8) showed a correlation between the stronglypositive HER-2/neu protein expression and the lymph nodeinvolvement. Only 6.8% of all cases investigated wereGrade I well differentiated tumours, 41% were Grade IImoderately differentiated and 22% were Grade III. Inconclusion, the results of this study show that the degree ofexpression of HER-2/neu oncoprotein may prove to be anadditional prognostic marker of breast cancer, particularlyin young women. This applies in the histological diagnosisof ductal AGENTS FROM LINUM GRANDIFLORUM LEA VES Magdy M.D. Ming Chen2, Lin Zhai2and Nabaweya A. 1Pharmacognosy Department, National Research Center, Dokki-12311, Cairo, Egypt; 2Department of Clinical Microbiology, University Hospital of 20, DK-2200Copenhagen N, Denmark The fractions of the leaves of Linum grandiflorum showed in vitro anticancer activity with IC50 against EL4(Murine Leukemia) cell line at 60 and 250 g/ml respectively, using a standard high-flux anticancer-drugscreening method. A bioassay guided fractionation was usedto find out the active constituents, which resulted in theisolation of 10 compounds from the MeOH fraction classifiedas: 5 flavone glycosides (one novel EL4at 500 g/ml respectively, and cyanogenic glycosides (one fraction three lignans and identified as podophyllotoxin,deoxypodophylotoxin and 6-methoxypodophyllotoxin withIC 50against EL4at 90, 35 and 100 g/ml respectively. The obtained results revealed the potent in vitro anticancer activity of Linum grandiflorum leaves and may suggest that the isolated active compounds could be used as anticancer agents.465 INHIBITION OF CARCINOEMBRYONIC ANTIGEN RELEASE FROM COLORECTAL CANCER TO PREVENT CRC-LIVER METASTASIS Naghibalhossaini F. and P. Mokarram Department of Biochemistry, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Zand Street, Shiraz, Iran Background: Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) blood levels are found in a wide variety of epithelialneoplasms. CEA normal function(s) and its relevance tomalignant transformation are not clear. Recent studies showthat CEA might have an instrumental role in cancerprogression and human colon cancer liver metastasis. Thelatter function has been suggested to be facilitated bysoluble CEA through induction of cytokine production byKupffer cells. We were the first group to provide evidencefor CEA release from human colon cancer cells by anendogenous GPI-PLD enzyme. Previous studies have shownthat purified GPI-PLD can be inhibited by micromolarconcentrations of phosphatidic acid (PA) andlysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Therefore, blocking CEArelease from cells using inhibitor Methods: was seeded into four-well plates(200,000 cells/well in 250 l medium) and allowed to growto sub-confluence. Then they were incubated in freshDMEM medium FBS CP were used at doses of10-100 M. The cells were incubated at 37C for 4-8 h in ahumidified incubator. The media of controls werereplenished with media without chemicals. The cell culturemedia from a duplicate set of wells was collected after every2 h of incubation. The effect of inhibitors on the secretion ofGPI-anchored proteins was determined by measuring CEA,and alkaline cell culture supernatantby ELISA. The non-GPI-anchored CA19-9 tumor markerlevel in medium was also measured as a control. Results: LS-180 treatment with 20-100 M concentrations of DP andCP reduced the release of CEA and ALP ( p<0.05). No measurable alteration was observed at 10 M PAconcentration. A 19-57% decrease in CEA and ALPsecretion was observed after 4-8 h continuous exposure ofLS-180 cells to PA. Conclusion: GPI-anchored CEA and ALP, but not TM-anchored CA-19-9, release is inhibitedefficiently by micromolar concentration of PA. Sincesecreted CEA acts as a signaling molecule that promotesliver metastasis, PA inhibition of CEA release from cancercells may have therapeutic application to prevent CRC-livermetastasis.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3411466 THERMODYNAMIC PROSPECTS of Medical Microbiology and Immunobiology, University ofSzeged; 21st Department of Pathology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary; 3Applied Mathematics, Faculty of Science UTS and School of Physics, University of Sydney; 4Key Centre for Health Technologies, UTS, Sydney, Australia; 5Unidade de Micobacterias, UMM, Instituto de Hygiene e Medicina Tropical, Lisboa, Portugal During tumor growth there are many differences between the healthy tissue and growing tumor, including metabolic,structural and thermodynamic differences. The healthy statetends towards \"entropy minimum\", the cancerous onetends towards \"entropy maximum\" by disrupting normalstructures and functions invading host tissues based ondifferent energy conservations and entropy productions.Indefinite growth of tumor cells can be inhibited bychemotherapy combined with resistance modifiers, but kineticresistance of a solid tumor may needs an alternative solutioninvolving thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics does not exclude changes in the direction of components of entropy flow fromtumor to the normal tissues under special conditions. Entropyproductions due to various dissipation mechanisms based ontemperature differences, chemical potential gradient, chemicalaffinity and exerted field as driving forces are promising toolsto be calculated as potential targets for tumor demarcation.The relative importance of various terms of entropy production(migration of electric charges, the flow of matter, chemicalreaction, heat transport) were compared as driving forces intumor-host relationships through numerical estimation.Different entropy production rates between two kinds of cellsdetermine the direction of entropy flow among correspondingtissues. The entropy flow carries the harmful information of acancerous cell, propagating its toxic action to normal cells.Some inhibitors of quorum sensing-like signal transmissionbetween tumor and normal cells can block the informationflow. External forces (ultrasound and electric fields) enhance entropy production of normal cells above cancer andconsequently can reverse the direction of entropy flow. Theentropy difference between exponential growth phase andGompertzian phase is a possible target to eliminate tumorcells. From topics in this review, new theories on the reduction of entropy production and negative entropy in-flow are nowcreated in various biomedical fields, which may contribute totherapy. 467 MDR INHIBITORY ACTIVITY OF NEW JATROPHANE Moln\u00e1r2and J. Hohmann1 6; 2Department of Medicine, University of Szeged, H-6720 Szeged,D\u00f3m t\u00e9r 10, Hungary In continuing our search for biologically active new compounds from Euphorbiaceae species, four newjatrophane-type diterpene polyesters have been isolatedalong with known methanolextract of Euphorbia esula . The inhibition of efflux activity of the isolated compounds was determined bymeasuring the accumulation of the substrate analoguerhodamine in tumor cells. The isolation was carried out byVLC, CPC, preparative TLC and HPLC. The structureelucidation compounds was by NOESY measurements.Structural investigations compounds arepenta-, polyolsacylated with acetic, benzoic, and nicotinicacids. Four compounds are new natural products, twocomponents were isolated earlier from Euphorbia salicifolia (1, 2) and one is identical with a diterpene obtained previously from E. peplus (3). The effect of the isolated diterpenes on the reversal of multidrug resistance in MDR-1 gene-transfected L5178 mouse lymphoma following extrusion of rhodamine 123 inside thecancer cells, by flow cytometry. Verapamil was used as apositive control. As a result of our investigations it can bestated that almost all of the tested compounds are able toincrease drug accumulation and display a significantconcentration dependent effect. These results providedfurther information for the characterisation of the structuralrequirements Morbini Department of Pathology, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy Despite the huge amount of research done in the last decade on markers predictive of response to therapy and on target-specific drugs, only a few agents have so far been approvedfor target-based therapy of different malignancies, none ofwhich involves the central nervous system, and a limitednumber of response predictors have been introduced intoclinical practice. On the verge of research for prognostic and predictive factors, pathologists' role has evolved in the last decade fromshe/he who provides a histological classification to a highlyinteractive player in the therapeutic decisions. Theidentification, by a constantly increasing range of moleculartechniques, of predictive factors and potential targets in thetumor tissue is becoming the first step of the therapeuticapproach for many tumor types and locations. Pathologists arealso involved in ongoing research for new molecules andtargets, in all fields of cancers research, including centralnervous system tumor. A review of all recent data on thesubject would require a lot of space, but MGMT and EGFRplayed so far the foremost role in the research of predictiveand targetable pathways in GBL. MGMT is a DNA repair protein that counteracts DNA damage induced by alkylating agents. In the majority of GBL,only one copy of the gene is left after chromosome 10 loss, andit can be epigenetically silenced by promoter hypermethylation.MGMT inactivation is responsible of GBL sensitivity totemozolomide, and its assessment has been proposed as astratification criterion for therapy with alkylating agents. EGFR is the transmembrane receptor of epidermal growth factor, and is the target of two FDA approved classes ofinhibitors: monoclonal antibody cetuximab, targeting theextracellular receptor domain, approved for the treatment ofintestinal adenocarcinomas, and small molecules gefitinib anderlotinib, which inhibit the intracellular ATP-binding domainof the receptor, and are used for the treatment of non smallcell lung cancer. GBL have been largely demonstrated to overexpress EGFR, mainly due to polisomy or gene amplification, as observed inbowel cancers, but also to mutations in EGFR gene, givingorigin to the prognostic factors for GBL. Phase I and IIclinical trials with small molecule EGFR inhibitors failed toshow survival gain with respect to standard treatment withradiation and temozolomide. However, the presence of anintact downsteam signally pathway for EGFR seems to be necessary to confer inhibitor sensitivity to EGFR amplified ormutated tumors 469 CONTROL OF ANTI-TUMOR CD8 +T-CELL RESPONSES David J. MorganDepartment of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, University Walk, Bristol, BS8 1TD, UK Priming of na\u00efve tumour-specific CD8 through direct interaction with metastatic tumours in thetumour draining lymph nodes (TDLN), TDLN. However, the nature of CD8+T-cell response resulting from such interactions is determined by the overall level of T-cell activation. In thesteady state, it was considered that high levels of T-cellactivation tended to result in productive CTL responses toforeign antigens; whereas low levels of activation resulted inabortive responses leading to T-cell tolerance induction.However recent data, from our laboratory, has determined thatthe overall response following priming is, in fact, underdynamic control by a combination of several signals deliveredthrough: the T-cell receptor TcR (signal 1), through receptorsof costimulatory molecules and other accessory molecules(signal 2), as well as through several other molecularinteractions, which collectively are referred to as signal 3.Critically, we have determined that altering the level of anyone of these signals can result in a shift in the balance of theoverall response between either abortive or productiveactivation. Based on these findings, we therefore suggest thattolerance induction and the formation of effective anti-tumourCTL responses actually represent discreet clinical readoutsamongst a broad range of different CD8 +T-cell responses. 470 THE STUDY OF MANGANESE, CHROMIUM ANDOXIDATION STATUS IN BLADDER CANCER A. Movahedian , Mazdak, N. Mirkheshti, F. Yazdekhasti, E. and Z. Shamszadeh Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Isfahan Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, School ofPharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan Universityof Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran It seems that chromium (Cr) and manganese (Mn), by the mechanism of affecting oxidative status in cells, can play animportant role in cancer induction. We decided to study theserum concentration of Mn and Cr and malondialdehydeAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3413(MDA) as a biomarker of lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as an antioxidant marker, inpatients with bladder cancer, as compared with healthyindividuals. This case-control study was conducted on 52 patients with bladder cancer and 58 healthy volunteers after being matchedby their age, sex and smoking habits. Fasting samples werecollected and serum concentration of Cr, Mn, MDA and TACwere determined by spectrophotometric methods using the t-test. MDA ( p<0.001) and Cr concentration ( p<0.05) were significantly increased in bladder cancer patients. There wasa significant decrease in Mn ( p<0.001) and TAC ( p<0.001) of patients in comparison with healthy individuals. 471 STANDARDIZED TISSUE AND BLOOD BANKING -PREANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGH QUALITY GENE AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION PROFILES T. Muley 1, C. Trasch\u00fctz1, H. University of Heidelberg; 3Institute of Pathology, University of Heidelberg, Germany The identification of new prognostic factors, potential genes for targeting therapy, as well as genes that might causeresistance to chemotherapy are present goals in lung cancerresearch. The actual developments in molecular biologyrequire high quality bio materials such as tumor tissue, serum,plasma or biopsy samples, since the quality of results directlydepends on the quality of materials. Currently, all necessary infrastructural requirements to achieve these goals have been installed and tested at ourinstitution. Standard operation procedures have beenimplemented to provide the surgeons, pathologists andtechnicians with sampling protocols, ensuring high qualitysamples of tumour tissue and normal lung tissue pairs fromeach surgically treated patient. On average, 300-350 patientsper year undergo surgical resection for primary lung cancer atour institution. In brief, immediately after the tumour resection, representative pieces of tissue are macro dissected by anexperienced pathologist from both the tumour and the distantnormal lung tissue and cut into 16-20 pieces of 0.5 cm length.The pieces of tissue are distributed into sterile cryo tubes andimmediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Long-term storageis performed at 80C. The time between resection andfreezing is usually less than 30 min. In addition, in selectedpatients further tissue probes (pleural, lymph nodes, metastaticsites etc.) are withdrawn and prepared in an identical manner. A piece of tissue is withdrawn from the freezer and cut into several 10 m slices in a cryostat device before RNA, DNAor protein extraction and subsequent analysis. The first and lastcryo-section of a series are Hematoxilin/Eosin-stained andanalysed for tumor, stroma, necrosis and parenchyma contentby two experienced investigators. Only tissues with greaterthan 50% viable tumor cell content enter RNA extraction andsubsequent microarray analysis. RNA, DNA, and hybridisationproducts are analysed for integrity (RNA integrity numbers>8.0) and amount by capillary electrophoresis (AgilentBioanalyzer) and micro photometry (Nano drop). Basic patient data together with data of the freezing conditions are stored in a tissue bank data file. The inclusionof respective identification items (pseudonymized) allows us tocombine tissue bank data to prospective data collected in thevarious data bases of our institution, i.e. tumour documentationfiles, documentation of surgery, laboratory data files, tumourbiology/pathology data bases and postoperative follow-up files. Taken together, standardized sample collection, sample preparation and data management is required to producereliable high quality gene expression results which might infuture guide new therapeutic approaches in lung cancertreatment. 472 BIOMARKERS FOR ASSESSING POTENTIALCARCINOGNEIC EFFECTS OF CHRONIC ARSENICEXPOSURSE IN INNER MONGOLIA, CHINA Judy L.

Chronic arsenic exposure has been associated with carcinogenic,cardiovascular, neurological and diabetic effects in humansand has been of great public health concern worldwide. In2001, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted anarsenic standard of 10 g/l from 50 g/l in drinking water.However, there are still great uncertainties on the health effectsof arsenic at low doses. Due to the lack of appropriate animalmodels for extrapolation to human risk, research needs includea better understanding of the mechanisms of arseniccarcinogenesis and assessing health effects of arsenic inhumans at low dose. The major modes of action (MOA)proposed for arsenic effects in humans are increasing oxidativestress, altering signal transduction pathways, inducing DNAand chromosomal damage, affecting DNA repair, promotingcell proliferation, and DNA methylation. The objectives of thisresearch were to apply biomarkers to assess arsenic exposureand cancer risks and identify biomarkers useful for assessingarsenic effects in humans. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3414The residents of Ba Men in Inner Mongolia have been exposed to a wide range of arsenic concentrations viawell water and showed adverse health effects. This population provides uswith an opportunity to assess the relationships between arsenicexposure and health effects. Based on the proposed MOA, weselected biomarkers to assess potential carcinogenic effects ofarsenic in the Inner Mongolia population. A total of 324 BaMen residents, exposed to arsenic viawell water ranging from non-detectable levels to 826 g/l of arsenic participated in thisstudy. Samples of well water, urine and toe nail were collectedto assess arsenic exposure and investigate metabolic profiles inurine. Human buccal cells and blood samples were collectedand the health effects investigated were arsenic-related dermaleffects, DNA fragmentation, micronucleus frequency forchromosomal damage, and mRNA expression of the genes(OGG1 and ERCC1 ) responsible for DNA repair of and human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) for cell proliferation. The results showed significant associations between arsenic exposure and increase in DNA damage, micronucleus frequencyand gene expression of OGG1 and ERCC1 and hTERT . This paper will report the results of these studies and provide someinsights into arsenic MOA and human dose-response data.

Chemopreventiveeffects of garlic have been attributed to its oil-soluble as diallyl sulfide, but their underlying molecular mechanismsremain largely unresolved. In the present study, we observedthat DATS inhibited the growth of human breast carcinoma(MCF-7) cells to a greater extent than did the other allylsulfides as determined by the MTT assay. DATS also inducedapoptosis in MCF-7 cells, which was throughaccumulation of reactive oxygen species subsequentactivation phosphorylation Aberrant upregulation of COX-2 hasbeen frequently observed in several types of cancer cells andis considered as a molecular target for cancerchemoprevention. Topically applied DATS inhibited the 12- O- tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate dorsal skin of female ICR mice. DATS inhibitedthe DNA binding activity of AP-1 which is one of keytranscription factors regulating the inflammation andexpression of COX-2. DATS inhibited TPA-inducedphosphorylation of Akt and that suppression of COX-2expression by DATS in TPA stimulated mouse skin ismediated by blocking the PI3K-Akt and JNK signaling.Topical application of DATS protected against mouse skincarcinogenesis induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene plus TPA. In addition, DATS strongly inhibited DNA bindingactivity of NF- B compared with other allyl sulfides in human mammary epithelial (MCF10A) cells treated with TPA. DATSinhibited the transcriptional activity of NF- B, phosphorylation of I B, and activity of IKK. Inhibition of NF-B DNA binding activity and IKK activity by DATS were blunted by addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and the reducing agent dithiothreitol. 474 CLINICAL WNT-INDUCEDSECRETED 1-1-1Honjyo, Kumamoto City, USA Background: Wnt-induced secreted protein-1 (WISP-1/CCN4), a member of the CCN family, has been studied in severalcancers. However, the correlation of WISP-1 expression withclinical features of esophageal squamous cell carcinomaremains unknown. Patients and Methods: The expression of WISP-1 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissues from 105 cases of esophageal squamous cellcarcinoma. The effect of WISP-1 on esophageal carcinomacell growth was examined by cell proliferation assay usingWISP-1 transfectants. Results: In vitro , WISP-1-transfected esophageal cells significantly increased proliferationcompared to their parent cells. Immunohistochemical analysisshowed that WISP-1 positive cases were closely associatedAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3415with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, stage and worse prognosis. Conclusion: WISP-1 may play a important role in tumor growth and development of esophageal squamous cellcarcinoma. 475 THE HAMSTER BUCCAL POUCHCARCINOGENESIS Tamil Nadu, India Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a common malignancy worldwide, is an important contributor to theoverall international cancer burden. Squamous cell carcinomas(SCCs) induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene (DMBA) in the HBP reiterate many of the features observed in humanOSCCs. The major risk factors associated with human oralcancer such as tobacco, betel quid and alcohol promote HBPcarcinogenesis. SCCs induced by DMBA in the cheek pouchof Syrian hamsters are morphologically and histologicallysimilar to human OSCC. Like human oral carcinogenesis,HBP carcinogenesis is a multistep process that involvessequential progression from hyperplasia to invasive carcinomathrough varying degrees of dysplasia. In addition, HBPtumours express several biochemical and molecular markersthat are also expressed in human OSCC. Multiple signalingpathways are dysfunctional in both human and hamsterOSCCs. In particular, cell proliferation, apoptosis andangiogenesis are intricately interlinked malignanttransformation of the by DMBA. The HBPcarcinogenesis model is the best-known animal system forintervention by chemopreventive agents because of easyaccessibility for examination, and follow-up of lesions. Anumber of synthetic and natural products have beendocumented to exhibit chemopreventive efficacy in the HBPmodel. Chemoprevention studies in the HBP model can serveas a crucial link in the potential efficacy assessment ofcandidate agents for oral cancer prevention and therapy. 476 ORAL CANCER AND ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITHSALIV A, CIGARETTE SMOKING AND FREERADICALS - PREVIOUS FINDINGS AND FUTURE TSPO-RELATED DIRECTIONS R. NaglerDepartment of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Oral Biochemistry Laboratory and Salivary Clinic, RambamMedical Center and Faculty of Medicine, Technion-IsraelInstitute of Technology, Haifa, IsraelOropharyngeal (OP) cancer, which is usually squamous cell carcinoma, is the most common head and neck malignancyand accounts for 2-4% of all new cancer cases. It is primarilyinduced by exposure to tobacco. The paradigm of cigarettesmoke (CS)-induced OP cancer pathogenesis is based on theassumption that a constant direct attack by various CScarcinogens causes widespread accumulating cellular andDNA aberrations in the OP mucosal cells, in turn eventuallyresulting in malignant transformation. However, there is neverdirect contact between CS and the OP mucosa. Saliva, bathingthe mucosa from the oral cavity to the larynx, alwaysintervenes, and CS must first interact with saliva before itreaches the mucosa. The current study investigated the role of saliva in the pathogenesis of OP cancer. A synergistic effect of CS andsaliva on oral cancer cells was demonstrated. Thissynergism is based on the reaction between redox activemetals in saliva and low reactive free radicals in CS, whichresults in production of highly active hydroxyl freeradicals. Thus when exposed to CS, salivary behavior isreversed and the saliva loses its antioxidant capacity andbecomes a potent pro-oxidant milieu. The devastating roleof CS-borne aldehydes was demonstrated as well. Basedon these results and on our recent reports demonstratingthat CS destroys various salivary components, includingprotective ones such as peroxidase, the most importantsalivary antioxidant enzyme, a comprehensive view of thepivotal role of saliva in the pathogenesis of CS induced OPcancer is suggested. 477 EFFECT OF mTOR INHIBITOR ON HUMANOSTEOSARCOMA CELL LINES Osamu Nakamura , Hitora, Rapamycin (mTOR) is the downstream of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Itplays an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis.Rapamycin is commonly used as an immunosuppressor,however, it also has an inhibitory effect on mTOR. Severalauthors have reported the antitumor isinvolved in transcription andtranslation, leading to cell cycle arrest, antiangiogenesis, andapoptosis. We examined the expression of mTOR-gene, andthe inhibitory effects of Temsirolimus, a selective mTORinhibitor, in human osteosarcoma cell lines. Materials and Methods: Cell lines and reagents. Three human osteosarcoma (2008) 3416used. KTHOS was previously established in our laboratory. All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's Modified EagleMedium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich, bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich). The cell lines were maintained humidified 5% CO 2atmosphere. expression of mTOR. Total RNAs were eluted by selective binding to a silica-gel-based membrane using anRNeasy Mini Kit&reg; (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA).Reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA was performed byusing Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Madison,WI). mRNA of mTOR After PCR amplification, 8 laliquots of the PCR products electrophoresed in a 2%agarose gel, followed by ethidium bromide dye. The inhibitory effect of mTOR inhibitor. determined using AqueousOne Solution were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates. After24 hours (h), the medium was refreshed with 1% FBScontaining Temsirolimus at various concentrations. After 24and 48h, the medium was removed and washed withphosphate buffered saline, then refreshed with fresh mediumcontaining MTS reagent. The optical density was measuredat 490 nm using an automatic microplate reader after 2 h offurther incubation. The percent viability of each well wascalculated. At least three independent cultures wereperformed for each study. Results: The mRNA of mTOR was strongly expressed in all cell lines. Temsirolimus inhibitedthe cell proliferation of all 3 human osteosarcoma cell linesin a dose- and time-dependent manner. Conclusion: These results suggest that through the mTOR dependentintracellular signaling pathway, mTOR- targeting agentsbecome an IMATINIB MESYLATE EFFECTS ON CELL AND MIGRATION Ranza 1, G. Mazzini2, A. Facoetti3,4and R. Nano1,4 1Department Istochem. and Cytometry Section, Pavia; 3Department Physics, University of Pavia; 4INFN Pavia, Italy Glioblastoma is a highly malignant brain tumour with limited therapeutic options, a high recurrence rate and mortality.Therefore the search of improved treatment is urgentlyneeded. The fundamental insight into signal transduction generated during the past decade is being translated into a newgeneration of specific inhibitors. These drugs can be veryselective in action and may provide opportunities forglioblastoma treatment. One of these new drugs is imatinibmesylate (STI571), a small molecule, inhibitor of PDGFreceptor, implicated in carcinogenesis. In glioblastoma cell lines (T98G and A172)were analysed for their sensitivity to treatment with imatinibmesylate (kindly provided by Dr E. Alessandrino). Inparticular, we have focused our attention on the analysis ofthe effects on cell proliferation and migration after imatinibtreatment. Our results show that STI571 is able to inducegrowth arrest in the G 0/G1phase of the cell cycle at all concentrations tested already 24 hours after treatment andapoptosis after 48 hours at 20-30 M. Moreover, we haveseen that the imatinib treatment determines an evidentdecrease of migrating cells. These data suggest that at lowconcentrations STI571 could act as a cytostatic agent but athigh concentration it behaves mainly as a cytotoxic agent. 479 EFFECT OF IMATINIB MESYLATE (STI571) ONASTROCYTOMA 1, F. Pasi1,3, A. Ottolenghi2,3and R. Nano1,3 1Departments of Animal Biology, and 2Nuclear and Physics, University of Pavia; 3INFN Pavia, Italy Imatinib mesylate is a small molecule of the c-Abl, c- Kit, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosinekinases that is approved for the treatment of chronic myeloidleukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors and is underinvestigation for several other malignant tumors. Malignantastrocytomas are brain tumours with an extremely poorprognosis that are usually treated with surgery and/orradiotherapy. Recently, we have found that imatinib is able toinduce a growth arrest in G 0/G1phase of cell cycle in astrocytoma cells, suggesting a possible cytostatic effect ofthis new drug. In this study, we focused our attention on thepotential role of imatinib (kindly provided by Dr E.Alessandrino) in radiotherapy of astrocytoma by determiningthe response of human malignant astrocytoma cell lines(MOG-G-UVW and T98G) to combination treatment withimatinib and -rays. The effect of irradiation with and withoutimatinib pre-treatment on cell survival was tested withclonogenic assay. Our results demonstrate that PDGFR inhibition by imatinib only partially decrease the viability of glioblastomaAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3417cells, but in combination with -irradiation there is a significant increase of this effect. In particular, we havefound that low-concentrations of imatinib are able tospecifically enhance the radiosensitivity of astrocytomacells. These results suggest that imatinib may have clinicalutility as a radiosensitizer in the treatment of humanastrocytoma. 480 IMMUNOBIOLOGICAL ASPECTS and Microbiology, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy Today various findings indicate that a multifactor strategy is the best strategy for treating cancer. Immunotherapy couldbe a role in this fight as evidence suggests that the immunesystem has a role in the control of malignant growth andmetastasis. Whether the immune system can target tumourshas been debated for nearly a century. Variousinvestigations, clinical trials and animal based studies haveproduced important scientific knowledge for thedevelopment of a really effective immunotherapy Actuallyimmunotherapy could be a promising approach for thedevelopment of integrative therapies for cancer. Cancerimmunotherapy has progressed towards clinical applicationsand various approaches have been developed, such asadoptive transfer of tumour specific cytotoxic Tlymphocytes and the administration of tumour-associatedantigens-component vaccine, genetically modified tumourcell-based vaccine, TAA-coding DNA vaccine on TAA-delivered dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccine. Compared to adrug delivery system, which delivers the optimal amount ofdrug to the target site and subsequently elicits its effect via a chemical compound or by biologic macromolecules suchas plasmids, a cell based system which uses smart cellsexisting in the body is a potentially, not yet completelystudied, approach. It requires a precise knowledge of theimmune network that involves cytokines, chemokines,effector function of leukocytes subsets such as NK and Tcytotoxic cells Many scientific centres in the world studied the immunological aspects of tumour-host interactions andexperienced therapeutic trials. The data obtained from thesestudies are now an important source for further strategies In some cancers as glioblastoma, a chemo- and radio- resistant tumour, immune recruitment could be a basis todevelop new approaches. It is necessary to focus studies onthe tumour-host relationship between and on cytokines thatregulate these relationships in the micro environment.481 DEVELOPMENT OF ANTICANCERNANOPARTICLES TO ENHANCE SELECTIVITY,APOPTOSIS, IMAGING, AND THERAPY Arutselvan Natarajan , Mirick, Gerald L. DeNardo and Sally J. DeNardo Radiodiagnosis and Therapy, University of California Davis Medical Center, 1508. Alhambra Blvd, Sacramento, CA -95816, USA Objectives: oxide gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been widely usedto target cancer cells when suitably modified with molecular-targeting ligands and/or apoptosis-inducing agents. Anticancermonoclonal antibodies, to NPs and GNPs to andcirculation time to enhance the cancer-targeting effect andspecificity for imaging and therapy. We have developed aseries of cancer-targeting multifunctional nanoparticles(MNPs) to enhance the ligand concentration in tumor cells forimaging, therapy, and to induce apoptosis. MNPs werecharacterized by PAGE, transmission electron microscopy(TEM), cellulose acetate plasma The firstthree have been used for animal studies. They were>90% monomeric by PAGE and CAE. The amount ofanticancer agents conjugated to each NP was 3-10 g/mg miRNA-GNP waseffectively transfected into cells to kill cancer cells in vitro . Conclusion: Four anticancer MNPs were generated, characterized and evaluated their cancer-targeting effect.PK and WBAR demonstrated 20 tumor in mice. MiRNA-conjugated GNPsenhanced the apoptotic effect in cancer cells by >30%compared to miRNA alone. Development of imaging andtherapy strategies for these novel anticancer MNPs areongoing. 482 EXPRESSION, MUTATION, AND FUNCTION OF TYROSINE KINASE ANDANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3418DOWNSTREAM TARGETS IN HUMAN BRONCHIAL EPITHELIAL CELLS AND LUNG CANCER Viswanathan Natarajan and Ravi Salgia Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL-60637, USA Lung cancer is a devastating illness and usually occurs as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, incidence of 85%) andsometimes as small cell lung cancer (SCLC, incidence of15%). Even with the best therapies with chemotherapy,radiation therapy, and surgery, we have not made considerablestrides in overall survival. The prognosis for NSCLC is 16%over 5 years and 6% for SCLC. Most recently, novel targetedtherapies have come to fruition in lung cancer. As anexample, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) hasbeen targeted with small molecule inhibitors such as gefitinibor erlotinib, or with an antibody against EGFR such ascetuximab. Even with this novel target, the response rate isstill only 15%. Thus, we had to find other molecular targetsfor lung cancer. The MET receptor tyrosine kinase has beenshown to be important in cell proliferation, growth,angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis for a number oftumors. We have shown that MET and its activated form (p-MET against the juxtamembrane domain-pY1003) areoverexpressed in lung cancer tumor tissues (as compared toadjacent normal lung tissues). The ligand for MET is thehepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and can be either expressedin the stroma or the tumor tissues. Expression of MET intumor tissue microarrays was quantified in a 4-tier scoresystem as negative (0), weak (1+), moderate (2+), or strongstaining. In lung cancer, forty percent (16/40) of lung cancertissues overexpressed MET. In the tissue microarray, 20%(1/40) had no (0), whereas analyzedmutations/single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MET in lung cancer, and have identified novel mutations in thesemaphorin (SEMA) ligand-binding domain and thejuxtamembrane (JM) domains and not the tyrosine kinasedomain. In determining the JM domain function, we showthat there was activation of the downstream target paxillin(focal adhesion protein). MET activation also led todownstream signaling with signaling through the focaladhesion proteins (such as paxillin), PKC pathway, and AKTpathway. This was true both for normal human bronchialepithelial cells and lung cancer cells. We are currentlyinvestigating the therapeutic inhibition of MET in lungcancer, and show that small molecule inhibitors such asSU11274 and PHA665752 lead to a decrease in cell growth as well as a decrease in angiogenesis for the mouse model.In summary, the MET pathway is important and will be acrucial therapeutic target in lung cancer.

NaujoksPharma Research Consulting Comm. V ., Square de Meeus 37 - 4th Floor, 1000 Brussels, Belgium All cancer therapies developed so far suffer more or less from two main problems: i) induction of severe side-effects and ii)induction of tolerance to the respected drug. Multiple attempts to cope with these problems resulted in the development of target-specific therapeutics. Mostsuccessful are monoclonal antibodies (mab) and kinaseinhibitors. Both drug concepts helped to improve cancertreatments, but benefits fade after 3 to 12 months due risingdrug tolerance. In addition, it turned out that there are indeedside-effects to be coped with. Another target associated with new hope was the tumor vasculature as a non-tumor tissue, but with vital functions forthe tumor. Several approaches using small molecules faileddue to the complex biology; monoclonal antibodies ( e.g. Bevazicumab - rhuMAb-VEGF) however made it successfullyto the clinics. But here also, side-effects do require specificattention. A totally different approach used a simple physical- chemical interaction to target the neovasculature of tumours.Based on an observation that cationic liposomes exhibit apreferential binding to activated or proliferating endothelialcells, a new system of target-specific delivery of drugs andcontrast agents was developed. Tumor-specific binding wasdemonstrated in various preclinical models and in a diagnosticPhase I study in bladder carcinoma patients. Subsequentlytherapeutic studies in various indications demonstratedtherapeutic effects at doses which were well tolerated.Surprisingly, it could be shown that prolonged treatmentimproved therapeutic benefits rather than showing inductionof tolerance. In a Phase II study in pancreatic cancer, a newdrug, EndoTAG 1 (formerly LipoPac) demonstrated aprolonged survival compared to that with best standard oftreatment. However this experimental drug so far fails to meetthe standard requirement for successful drugs as the treatmentrequires infusions of 4 litres or more over several hours. Inaddition, preparation of the infusion requires specificinstructions of the respective hospital pharmacy to dissolve the Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3419lyophilised product. Pharmaceutically, the production process is not optimized either. This presentation will outline the approach taken to develop such a promising drug from a prototype formulation to a drugmatching the day to day requirements of a cancer care unit andthe new technology to meet pharmaceutical productionrequirements. Progress achieved to date: Drug volume reduced to 15%; the encapsulation efficacy of therapeutic drugs in cationicliposomes could be greatly enhanced using differentcompositions and lipids. Infusion reactions and overall tolerability could be significantly improved by adding an outer layer to theliposomes; thereby creating a new kind of nanoparticle whichhas no tendency to form aggregates when injected into theblood. A new way to stabilise these nanoparticles allows for both better scaling-up of production and better reconstitution of theresulting powder as a drug for infusion. Preclinical results with this new nanoparticle will be presented. 484 QUANTITATIVE STUDIES OF THE CELLULARIMMUNE RESPONSE IN CERVICAL CANCER B.S. Nedergaard Aarhus University Hospital; 4Stereology and Electron Microscopy Laboratory and MIND Center, University of Aarhus, Denmark Using stereology we presented a method to obtain basic biological data on the in situ cellular immune response towards cancer. We estimated the density and frequency ofimmune cells of 10 different phenotypes in cone biopsies frompatients with stage I cervical squamous cell carcinoma(APMIS 115: 1321-1330, 2007). Using this method, we performed a study to investigate differences in the primary in situ cellular immune response between patients with and without relapse of stage IB cervical squamous cell carcinoma.We found significantly lower densities of CD3+, CD4+ andCD8+ cells (both intra- had relapse (Gynecologic Oncology 108 (2008)106-111). To validate the results, a cohort study including 102patients treated for cervical squamous cell carcinoma stage IBand IIA between 1990 and 2000 at Aalborg Hospital, Denmarkwas carried out. The in situ cellular immune response was investigated with respect to densities of T-cells (CD3+), peritumoral tissue. We found an increase in the density of both CD3+ and CD8+ cells to decrease the hazardratio for relapse of disease. The decrease in hazard ratio washighly significant for both intra- and peritumoral cells. Thelargest decrease in hazard ratio was found for peritumoralCD3+ cells and it was 0.27 when increasing the cell densityfrom 795 to 2043 cells/mm2 (25 to 75 percentile). Accordingto this study, a low density of particularly peritumoral CD3+cells is associated with increased risk of relapse in squamouscell cervical cancer (BJC 97: 1135-1138, 2007). 485 EXPRESSION OF THE TMPRSS2:ERG 2Clinical Physiopathology, Unit of Andrology,3Critical Care Medicine and Surgery, Unit of Urology, University of Florence, Italy; 4Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA; 5Istituto Toscano Tumori, Florence, Italy The TMPRSS2:ERG fusion is a common recurrent chromosomal aberration in prostate cancer. Some data suggestthat ERG expression is higher in less aggressive prostatecarcinomas, while others show an association betweenTMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene and more aggressive disease. Weassessed the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion status in tumour samplesfrom 84 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy from 1998to 2000. Sixty patients had surgery alone (group A), while 24patients received androgen ablation therapy for 3 monthsbefore surgery (group B). The presence of the TMPRSS2:ERGgene fusion product was demonstrated by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 84% of group A patientsand in 54% of group B patients ( p=0.01). The levels of TMPRSS2:ERG and ERG, measured by means of real-timequantitative PCR, did not show significant association withclinicopathological characteristics of the tumours, except fora negative correlation of ERG overexpression with Gleasonscore (R=0.457; p=0.0001), observed in group A alone. The lower proportion of group B patients harbouringTMPRSS2:ERG fusion suggests that androgen ablationinhibits the expression of TMPRSS2:ERG, underscoring thekey role of androgen-mediated transcription control of thegene fusion. Differently to group A, group B patientsexpressing the fusion gene experienced earlier biochemical(PSA) recurrence ( p=0.007). In this specimen set, we observed that tumours in which androgen ablation prior to surgery failsto suppress expression of the fusion gene have a greater risk ofANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3420recurrence. Further studies in larger cohorts of tissue are under way to confirm these findings. 486 DENDRITIC CELL-BASED IMMUNOTHERAPY:INFLUENCE OF THE 53, 37115 Duderstadt;Department of Immunology, University of G\u00f6ttingen,Germany Especially in advanced stages of cancer, common therapy strategies show insufficient results accompanied by a reducedquality of life due partly to strong side-effects. Today, one ofthe most promising innovative therapy approaches in treatmentof various types of human cancer is a specific immunotherapywith dendritic cells. Several groups have shown thatimmunotherapy with monocyte-derived dendritic cells(MoDC) loaded either with tumor-cell-lysate, known tumor-specific peptides, or with specific RNA or DNA can induce aclinical antitumor response in patients with various types ofcancer accompanied by fewer side-effects and goodtolerability. Nevertheless, most of the treated patients fail torespond to the therapy. The ineffective clinical antitumorresponse to a dendritic cell-based therapy may be partly due toan inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Severalinvestigations showed increasing evidence of a strongassociation between chronic infection, inflammation andcancer development as well as in tumor progression. Many ofthe same inflammatory mediators that are secreted by woundsare found in the tumor microenvironment. It is known that alsotumors themselves can change the immunological balance intoan inflammatory microenvironment leading not only topromotion of tumor growth but also to inhibition of anefficient immune response and thus resulting in anunsuccessful immunotherapy based on dendritic cells. Besides several cytokines which promote an immune suppressive microenvironment, such as for example IL-10,regulatory T-cells (T-reg) play an important role in regulationof an immune response. An increase of regulatory T-cells isoften found in cancer patients and may limit the antigen-specific immune response. To reduce these T-reg cells to anormal range, a metronomic chemotherapy should beconsidered as pretreatment prior to an immune therapy withdendritic cells, which may enhance the antigen-specific CD-8-T-cell response. Moreover, an anti-inflammatory treatmentshould be accompanied by a noninflammatorymicroenvironment, which can promote DC activation and canenhance tumor immunity as well as the clinical antitumorresponse. An efficient induction of a clinical antitumor response requires, beside a change of the immune suppressivetumor-associated microenvironment, a polarization of MoDCin a TH1 direction. However, less IL-12 and high IL-10production by the MoDC favoring a TH2 immune responserather than a TH1 response is often found in cancer patients.Culture conditions with supplement of certain TLR ligandscan signal the presence of infection (\"danger signal\") and mayovercome the possible defective MoDC of culture conditions with sequential supplementation of asynthetic lipopeptide and LPS, we are able to change an IL-12/IL-10 production profile <1 to an IL12/IL-10 productionprofile >1, which favours a TH-1 response. Furthermore weshow that activation of the Toll-like receptor 3 by adding (polyI:C), to the cultures as well as NDV can lead to DC, whichare able to produce IL-12 p70 at a higher level than IL-10. TheIL-12/1L10 ratio seems to be correlated to the clinicalresponse. Thus, addition of TLR agonists can effectivelyimprove the maturation status as well as the TH1-polarisationof MoDC. Taken together, a successful dendritic cell basedimmunotherapy requires more information on the cancercharacteristics to define the appropriate patient. 487 RADIONUCLIDE BASED TUMOUR TARGETING OF CD44-POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER Marika NestorUnit of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University,Uppsala, Sweden CD44 is one of the most complex molecules in all biology. It is a multistructural and multifunctional cell surface moleculeinvolved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and signaltransduction. Alternative splicing can theoretically generatehundreds of CD44 isoforms, and posttranslationalmodifications further enrich the structural variability of themolecule. CD44 is essential to multiple biological functionsof normal cells, but is also crucial to many tumour cellactivities. Malignant cells often express unique patterns ofCD44 isoforms, and CD44 is one of the most commonmarkers used for isolation of cancer stem-like cells. Thismakes it a highly interesting candidate for selective cancertargeting. We have assessed the CD44 isoform CD44v6 for radionuclide based tumour targeting of head neck cancer.Radionuclide conjugates were created using the anti-CD44v6chimeric for therapeutic use insquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. A combination of theAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3421anti EGFR-antibody cetuximab and211At-cMAb U36 was also evaluated to further improve the therapeutic efficacy. Resultsproved the astatinated conjugate to be most efficient,demonstrating a specific and dose-dependent cytotoxicity.Cetuximab influenced the therapeutic efficacy, but did notmediate the same reaction in all cell lines, demonstrating thewide variability of SCCs. Finally, the conjugates 124I-cMab U36 U36 were evaluated for diagnostic use in tumour bearing mice. Results were promising, with favourablebiodistributions and good visualizations in micro-PET andplanar gamma camera, respectively. 488 NEW UNDERSTANDINGS OF CANCER ANDPROLIFERATION FROM NANOGENOMICS AND NANOPROTEOMICS Claudio NicoliniNanoworld Institute, University SS.Apostoli 66, 00100 Rome, Italy A new approach for cancer research is emerging from nanogenomics (1) and nanoproteomics (2) as interplay ofbioinformatics, mass spectrometry and biomolecularmicroarrays proceeds to a previously unforeseeable level. Wesummarize here its major features with a few key applications,such as the cell cycle progression of human T lymphocytes(3), the reverse transformation of CHO-K1 hamster fibroblasts(4), human organ transplant (5) and cancer (2, 4). While investigation of the whole CHO-K1 proteome during c-CAMP reverse transformation appear problematic by 1D or2D SDS PAGE, HPLC and MALDI-TOF after a subcellularfractionation in four distinct fractions (4), nanogenomics (1)and nanoproteomics (2) allow the study of an immensenumber of genes and/or proteins with only one experiment andcan therefore draw unique picture of the whole genome andproteome. The huge volume of data arising from pangenomicand panproteomic microarray experiments may often increaseexperimental complications and difficulties in the analysis.Despite the power of combined ab-initio analysis and experimental analysis (1) genomics does however suffer manypitfalls and only functional proteomics, called nucleic acidprogramable protein array detecting the human proteinsproduced by genes directly in a mammalian milieu during theassay (2), represents the long-term answer to the basicmolecular understanding and to the clinical control of humancancer, mainly in the Label-Free approach jointly developedwithin the framework of an ongoing cooperation betweenHarvard Institute of Proteomics and Genova NanoWorldInstitute. These microarrays are produced by printing the proteins of interest on the array using methods designed to maintain theintegrity and activity of the protein, allowing hundreds to thousands of target proteins to be simultaneously screened forfunction using a wide range of gene collections.

Cross and Enik\u00f6 K\u00e1llay Department of Pathophysiology, Medical University Vienna, Austria Epidemiological and experimental studies emphasise the importance of adequate vitamin D and calcium intake forprevention of colorectal cancer. The active vitamin Dmetabolite 1,25-(OH) inANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3422differentiation and apoptosis of several cells, having a strong anti-proliferative effect. In the colon 1,25-(OH)2D3bound VDR regulates also the expression of key detoxifyingenzymes, contributing to the elimination of mutageniccompounds. In early colon tumuorigenesis, expression of theenzyme catalysing synthesis of the active vitamin D 3, 25 hydroxyvitamin D 1 hydroxylase (CYP27B1) is increasedwhereas that hydroxylase CYP24A1 is verylow. In advanced tumours it is vice versa the expression ofCYP24A1 is highly elevated. Calcium might support local,colonic 1,25-(OH) 2D3accumulation by regulation of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 expression and thereby affecttumour progression. In this context we analysed the expressionpatterns of Cyp27b1, Cyp24a1 and, the detoxifying enzymeCyp3a11 in the colon mucosa of mice fed either low or highcalcium diet. In parallel we measured 1,25-(OH) 2D3levels and apoptosis with respect to functional relevance of the obtainedmRNA profile. Mice fed with low calcium exhibited highCyp24a1 mRNA levels in the right colon. At the same site,expression of Cyp27b1 was also upregulated, but only infemales. This was accompanied by an increased level of 1,25-(OH) 2D3and by increased apoptotic activity. The same gender preference was observed for the Cyp3a11 expression in theright colon: in females Cyp3a11 was upregulated by lowdietary calcium.Our data suggest that in healthy colon mucosa the adverseeffects of low nutritional calcium could be counteracted byenhanced synthesis of 1,25-(OH) 2D3. This might be responsible for increased apoptosis and possible improvementof detoxification. Those defence mechanisms against tumourdevelopment appear to be restricted to the right colon and aremore effective in females. 490 INFLAMMATION AND INFLAMMATORYPROCESSES IN TUMOR ANGIOGENESIS ANDMETASTASIS, 5Istituto Clinico Humanitas, Milan, Italy It is now clear that components of the innate immune system are one of the driving forces of tumor angiogenesis. Thissuggests that these cells may be effective targets for therapiesaimed at curbing tumor progression, however their potentialhas yet to be fully explored. For example, the angiogenesisinhibitor angiostatin, identified by functional assays in vivo , appears target immune cells. isunable to exert angiogenesis inhibition in the presence offunction blocking antibodies to IL-12 or in mice with gene-targeted deletions of either the IL-12-specific receptor IL-12R2, or the IL-12 p40 subunit. In vitro treatment of human macrophages with angiostatin alone induced mRNAsignificantly to elevate synthesis of the two IL-12 subunits, asdetermined by real-time PCR. These data indicate thatmacrophages are a primary target of angiostatin and place theimmune system at a central fulcrum in the regulation ofangiogenesis in vivo . Furthermore, they indicate that endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors appear to function bytargeting immune cells rather than endothelial cells, whichindicates these cells are attractive targets for combination anti-angiogenic therapies. Our studies on the mechanisms of cancer chemoprevention compounds, indicate that a key and common activity is a blockof angiogenesis, a concept known as angioprevention. We havealso found compounds, gallate and xanthohumol, ofteninhibit the NF- B pathway, a central molecular hub for inflammation. Since synthetic oleanane triterpenoids havebeen observed to inhibit the NF- B pathway, we investigated the anti-angiogenic potential of a series of synthetictriterpenoids, including CDDO, CDDO-Im and the inhibited angiogenesis, CDDO-Me showed remarkable potency while being well tolerated in vivo, effective at doses as low as 0.003 mg/kg of body weight. In addition to the NF- B axis, CDDO-Me and related triterpenoids also inhibit STAT and TGF signaling. Theparticularly potent anti-angiogenic activity seen in vivo suggests that CDDO-Me may be interacting with an entirenetwork of molecular and cellular targets, rather than at asingle molecular locus or in a single cell type. 491 THE EFFECT OF ANDROSTENEDIONE ONPROLIFERATION OF OV ARIAN EPITHELIALCANCER F. Karami-Tehrani3 Departments of 1Clinical Biochemistry and Genetics, School of Medicine, Medical Sciences/Universityof Tehran, Tehran; 3Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modarres University, Tehran, Iran Introduction: Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of gynecological cancer mortality, and more than 85% of thismalignancy arises from the ovarian surface epithelium. TheAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3423etiology of epithelial ovarian cancer and the mechanism of its progression are poorly understood, but there is increasingevidence that reproductive hormones regulate the growth ofovarian cancer cells. Epidemiological studies have revealedthat high levels of androgens are implicated in increasing therisk of ovarian cancer. The aim of this study was to determinethe proliferation of ovarian cancer cells in response toandrostenedione which is the main androgen of the ovary.Materials and Methods: Ovarian carcinoma cells (OVCAR3) cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS in 24- and96-well plates and allowed to adhere for 24 hours. Then thecells were switched to medium supplemented with dextran-coated charcoal-treated FBS in the presence or absence of10 -5-10-9M 4-Androstene-3,17-dione. Cellular proliferation was assessed by means of MTT assay and cell counts withhemocytometer and trypan blue. Results: The proliferation of ovarian cancer cells was significantly increased byandrostenedione in a time-dependent manner, and all appliedconcentrations of androstenedione resulted in significantlyhigher numbers of cells than the untreated control.Conclusion: We have demonstrated that androgens can cause an increase in proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. 492 NBS1 GENE MUTATIONS AS A CANCER RISK of Sciences, Poznan, Strzeszynska 32, Poland MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1 (MRN) complex is involved in DNA repair and cell cycle checking signaling. NBS1 being apart of MRN complex plays an important role in genomestabilization. Molecular variants of NBS1 gene may therefore constitute a cancer risk factor. Homozygous mutation657del5 of the NBS1 gene is responsible for the majority of Nijmegen breakage syndrome. Several studies have focusedon searching for an association between NBS1 gene mutations and cancer incidence. Heterozygous carriers of theNBS1 657del5 mutation have been shown to have an increased risk for breast cancer, melanoma, colon and rectumcancer. Other studies have found no association betweenNBS1 gene mutations Hodgkins's or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The aim of the study was to analyze thefrequency of a panel mutations of NBS1 gene by screeningall 16 exons of this gene along with polymorphismsexamination. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood of 135children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 270 womenwith breast cancer, 176 patients with larynx cancer, 93 withsecond primary tumors of head and neck, 131 with colorectalcarcinoma and 1274 healthy individuals. I171V mutation ofNBS1 gene was the most frequent and has been found in 23 patients compared to only 8 in healthy individuals. Othermutations of the NBS1 gene have been observed in lower frequencies. Genotyping data from the six polymorphic lociin NBS1 gene, were used to impute haplotypes. Two of the evaluated haplotypes were associated with significantlyincreased leukaemia risk ( p=0.0038 and p<0.0001). Our results suggest that some specific haplotypes of the NBS1 gene may be associated with malignancies. Since DNA wasalso isolated from non-malignant cells, all mutations foundin cancer patients appeared to be of germinal origin. It canbe concluded that I171V mutation of NBS1 gene is associated with predisposition to malignancies and NBS1 allele I171V may be a general cancer susceptibility gene oflow or middle risk.

These have been found to have anticarcinogenicpotency in different settings, such as inhibition of cellproliferation and inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis e.g. metabolic pathway with lipoxygenase (ALOX) andcyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. The seed extracts offenugreek can also be of help in chemoprevention. In our experimental set up we examined the anti- inflammatory effect of fenugreek on fatty acid metabolizingenzymes (ALOXs and COXs) in AKR/J exposed to carcinogen dimethylbenz[]anthracene (DMBA). We alsodetermined the gene expression pattern of enzymes involvedin arachidonic acid metabolism based on detecting the mRNAexpression in various tissues (lung, liver, spleen and kidney)in four groups of mice. Two groups were fed with a normaldiet (control) and two of them consumed fenugreek-containingdiet, and each group received DMBA treatment. All groupswere autopsied on the 7th day, 24 hours post carcinogenicexposure, and mRNA from target organs was isolated. Geneexpression did not change in the tissues of mice on thefenugreek diet in comparison with mice on a normal diet incontrol group. DMBA exposure increased the expression of ALOX12 mRNA in the liver, lung and spleen of the mice consumingANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3424fenugreek, but in the kidney, fenugreek diet suppressed gene expression to a normal level. ALOX15 gene expression was increased by carcinogen in all organs examined, but in theliver, lung and kidney fenugreek consumption reduced theelevated gene expression to a normal level. ALOX5 gene expression was increased by 2.5 to 4-fold in all organs due tocarcinogen exposure; the inhibitory effect of fenugreek wasdetected only in the liver and kidney. The expression of COX1enzyme (exception of spleen) increased in response to DMBAexposure in all examined organs and the fenugreek dietsuppressed gene expression independently of carcinogenexposure. The increased expression of COX2 in response toDMBA was suppressed by fenugreek in all of the four tissuesexamined. The arachidonic acid metabolism pathway is one of the possible targets of specific molecular prevention therapy.According to the literature, prostate, lung, and other cancercell lines express ALOX5, with a metabolism that leads tothe formation of a variety of metabolically active productswith different roles in carcinogenesis. Fenugreek can be asupplementary factor in chemoprevention. 494 PROTEASES AND COLLAGEN-DERIVEDANGIOGENESIS TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT Pia Nyberg and Tuula Salo Department of Diagnostics and Oral Medicine, Institute of Dentistry PO Box 5281, FIN-90014 University of Oulu,Finland It has become clearly evident that tumor growth does not just depend on the carcinoma cells, but instead various celltypes, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, as well asextracellular matrix (ECM) components affect the outcome.The ECM is both a backbone and a barrier for cells as wellas a storage place for biologically active molecules.Therefore proteases cleaving ECM component are cruciallyimportant. Proteases can be or destructivein cancer. We have studied tumor-associated trypsin-2 thatis a protease that correlates with the Trypsin-2 increases metastasis formation byactivating other downstream proteases as well as bydisturbing tight junction molecules. The turnover of ECMliberates many biologically cryptic molecules from collagen IV and XVIII, respectively. Theyinhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth, but theirmechanisms are not completely known. It is important tonote that even though the collagen-derived endogenousangiogenesis inhibitors are molecules of about the samesize, come from similar parent molecules and have sequence homologies, they function viadistinct mechanisms, bind different cell surface receptors, and affect angiogenesis andthe tumor microenvironment in distinct ways. We affects endothelial cell proliferation,migration and apoptosis viaintegrin 11. Here we aimed to elucidate how arresten and endostatin affect the behaviourof aggressive oral carcinoma cells and normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts. We have previously shown thatendostatin inhibits the activity of matrix metalloprotease-9(MMP-9). Here we show that arresten has quite the oppositeeffect: it increases gelatinase (MMP-9 and -2) production byoral carcinoma cells and normal and carcinoma-associatedfibroblasts. Furthermore, arresten increases oral carcinomacell migration, whereas endostatin inhibits carcinoma cellmigration. However, in an organotypic model, arresteninhibits the invasion of carcinoma cells. In conclusion, ourdata demonstrates how different the effects of collagen-derived angiogenesis inhibitors can be in the tumormicroenvironment despite of the similar effects onendothelial cells. When designing treatment strategies forcancer, the effects on all the components of the tumormicroenvironment need to be elucidated. The organotypiccarcinoma models are a great tool to achieve this goal. 495 RADIONUCLIDE DETECTION OFNEUROENDOCRINE , Institute for Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia Aim: The aim of the study is the detection of primary and metastatic neuroendocrine tumors using 111In pentetreotide (OctreoScan), which is a long-acting analog of somatostatin.Patients and Methods: A total of 30 patients was investigated. Scintigraphy of the whole body, (andtomography 360/6 if necessary) was of 111MBq the group with 12 neuroendocrine carcinomas of unknown origin, there were 10 true positive (TP) findings (6with liver metastases, one with liver, lung, and bonemetastases, one with liver and mediastinal lymph nodemetastases and 2 with liver and retroperitoneal lymph nodemetastases), while 2 were false negative (FN) (poorlydifferentiated with retroperitoneal metastases). In6 patients scintigraphy influenced further patientmanagement. From the group of 12 pancreaticAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3425neuroendocrine tumors, in 8 neuroendocrine pancreatic carcinomas, there were 6 TP (4 with liver metastases) and 2FN (poorly differentiated). In 2 patients with pancreaticgastrinomas findings were TP, while in 2 patients withinsulinoma one was TP and in the other TN. In 6 patientsscintigraphy influenced further patient management while in4 only contributed. From the group of 6 neuroendocrine lungtumors there were 4 TP (4 patients with bronchial carcinoid,two with liver metastases and the other two with liver, lungand bone metastases), in 1 patient with atypical lungcarcinoid after surgery, findings were TN, while in one withneuroendocrine lung tumor (ACTH secreting) it was FN(small mediastinal tumor. In 2 patients scintigraphyinfluenced further patient management while in 2 onlycontributed. Because of the high uptake ofradiopharmaceutical, and widespread metastases, six patientswere indicated for radionuclide therapy with 90Y-DOTA TATE, and three of them received it. Conclusion: Preliminary results show that scintigraphy of neuroendocrinetumors is a useful method in diagnosis, staging and followup of the patients suspected to have neuroendocrine tumorsin the lungs. It is also helpful in the appropriate choice oftherapy, including radionuclides. 496 PARASPORIN, A NEW University, Fukuoka; 2Biotechnology and Food Research Institute, Fukuoka Industrial Technology Center, Kurume; 3Fresenius Medical Care Japan K.K., Tokyo, Japan Bacillus thuringiensis was first isolated in 1901 from Japan as a silkworm pathogen. It produces proteinaceousparasporal inclusions during sporulation. The strong and specific insecticidal activity. Thismakes B. thuringiensis an environmentally safe agent for control of medically and agriculturally important insectpests. Earlier studies, however, have also demonstrated thatB. thuringiensis strains with non-insecticidal inclusions are more widely distributed than insecticidal ones. Mizuki et al. (1999) first reported that strong cytocidal activities againsthuman cancer cells are often associated with the non-insecticidal inclusion proteins. Subsequently, we obtained acytocidal protein gene, leading to the establishment of a newfunctional protein group, parasporin (Mizuki et al. , 2000). Currently, parasporin is defined as \"parasporal proteinsproduced by B. thuringiensis and related bacteria that are non-hemolytic but capable of preferentially killing cancercells.\" At present, parasporin (PS) is classified by its amino acid identity into four subgroups, PS1 to PS4, consisting of a totalof 13 proteins. PS1 and PS3 have structural features of three-domain insecticidal Cry proteins. PS2 and PS4 are small-typeparasporins with no structural similarity to the known Bacillus parasporal proteins. PS1 is synthesized as an 81-kDa precursorprotein that is proteolytically converted into an activeheterodimer of 15 and 56-kDa polypeptides. It exhibitsspecific toxicity against uterine cancer cells (HeLa) but is notactive on normal uterus smooth muscle cells (UtSMC) andnormal T-cells. PS1 induces extracellular Ca 2+ subsequent apoptotic cell death of susceptiblecells. The PS2 precursor of 37 kDa is changed into a 30-kDaactive form through proteolysis. The protein is not toxic tonormal hepatocytes (HC) but is highly T-cells (Jurkat). oligomerize and form pores in therafts of cell membrane of the susceptible cancer cells. Theprecursor of PS3, an 88-kDa protein, is converted into a 64-kDa active protein by protease. PS3 has a structural similarityto the insecticidal three-domain Cry proteins. It exhibitspreferential numbers cells,including myeloid leukemic cells (HL60). The mode of actionof PS3 is less characterized, while poreformation seems to bekey action of this protein. PS4 is a small-type parasporin, a31-kDa precursor and a 27-kDa active form. The protein exertscytotoxicity on colon cancer cells (CaCO-2) and leukemic T-cells (MOLT-4), but not on normal T-cells. It is very likely thatPS4 molecules, like PS2, oligomerize and form pores incancer cell membranes. Elucidation of the origin of thespecificity associated with PSs is currently under way, and theidentification of specific receptors, if any, may lead to the useof these unique proteins for medical purposes. 497 IRINOTECAN IN THE TREATMENT OF Oliva Presidio Sanitario Gradenigo, Torino, Italy In the last five years the introduction of the so called \"biological drugs\" has moved the attention of the researcherson this new kind of compounds. This is probably due to newmechanisms of action, new fields of interest, new toxicities,new drug combinations. Irinotecan is an S-phase-specific derivative of camptothecin which interferes with DNA replication and cell division byinhibiting topoisomerase-I. It has demonstrated antitumoractivity against metastatic colorectal cancer. Irinotecan is aversatile drug, it can be administered at different doses everyANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3426three weeks, every two weeks and following weekly schedules. It has a well known spectrum of toxicities, that arenot cumulative and that can be mostly predicted and treated.Adverse events most frequently recorded were neutropenia,acute cholinergic syndrome, fatigue, nausea and vomiting,delayed diarrhea and alopecia. It has been approved by FDAfor the first line treatment of colorectal cancer since 1997 andremains stil nowadays one of the three fundamental cytotoxicdrugs for this disease. The mechanism of action and singleagent efficacy of IRI, combined with the apparent absence ofany cross resistance with FU provided the rationale forcombining IRI with FU and Folinic Acid as the first linetherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Irinotecan has thus been tested in combination with the infusional Fluorouracil (FU)/Folinic Acid (FA) schedule atdifferent dosages and different intervals of administration.Vanhoefer et al. tested IRI in a weekly setting in combination with the AIO German FU/FA schedule in a phase I study. Theyreached the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of weekly IRI at100 mg/m 2in association and recommended further studies with a lower dose (80 mg/m2). Ducreux associated IRI with the FU/FA de Gramont schedule and defined the recommendedbimonthly dose of IRI at 180 mg/m 2. In a large phase III study by Douillard et al. this association was statistically superior to the de Gramont regimen alone in terms of response rate (34.8%vs.21.9%), time to progression (TTP) (6.7 vs.4.4 months) and survival (17.4 vs.14.1 months). From that time the fact that Irinotecan combination with FU/FA significantly increasesresponse rates, TTP and survival in patients with metastaticcolorectal cancer has become always more evident. The other effective drugs in Colorectal cancer are FU and Oxaliplatin. Following the results of the well known \"Mosaic\"study, the Oxaliplatin's use has progressively moved toward theadjuvant setting. Moreover Oxaliplatin is a \"one bullet gun\"and its use is strongly conditioned by its cumulativeneurotoxicity. Its use is restricted to the adjuvant setting or firstline treatment. However, the improvements in the results of thetreatment of advanced disease lead patients to receive also threeor more different lines of chemotherapy in this setting.Therefore, patients with advanced colorectal cancer will receivetherapies mostly based on the combination 5FU (or oralfluoropyrimidines) plus Irinotecan, variously administered. In our phase II study we choose to combine the weekly schedule of IRI (80 mg/m 2) with a 28 days protracted venous infusion of FU. This resulted in an active combination with amild toxicity profile. 52 pts were accrued in the trial. Werecorded 5 Complete Responses (9.6%) and 15 PartialResponses (28.8%) with an overall response rate of 38.5%(95% C.I. 25% to 52%). Moreover, we had 17 patients withStable Disease (32.7%) for a disease control rate of 71.2%(95% C.I. 58% to 84%). We detected a median PFS of 8.2months (95% C.I. 6.1 to 10.1 months) and an OS of 16.3months (range 4-58+ months, 95% C.I. 14.8 to 17.9 months).In our daily Clinical Practice we usually prescribe the Wi- Fi regimen also to patients already treated with one line ofchemotherapy not containing Irinotecan (mostly FOLFOX orOxaliplatin plus Capecitabine). Data from this second lineslighty differ from the first line results both for response rateand overall survival. Interesting data regarding similarsymptoms and free survival are available. Thus resection was judged not feasible before therapy. Thirteen patients (25%) underwent surgical resection for theirmetastatic disease after 4 to 6 courses of chemotherapy.Although in only 10 cases resection was consideredmacroscopically radical. After the resection of their metastaticdisease patients received at least two courses of Wi-Fi with aIV stage adjuvant purpose. In this setting a phase IIIrandomized trial by M. Ychou et al. has recently been reported. The Authors randomised pts with completelyresected liver metastases, to receive 12 courses of FU/FAaccording to DeGramont schedule versus 12 courses ofFOLFIRI. Primary endpoint was Disease Free Survival. Nodifferences were observed in the DFS between the two arms,adjusted or not for important prognostic factors. The role ofIrinotecan in the adjuvant setting has been established in a lotof large randomized clinica trials. Neither the Saltz's trial(CALGB C89803) nor the ACCORD-2 and the PETAC-3trials were able to find significant differences between FU/FAbased chemotherapy and FU/FA plus Irinotecan regimens. In our study the toxicities recorded were mild and a median number of 5 courses of chemotherapy was administered.However, 11 patients had to interrupt the treatment because oftoxicity. 4 of them had problems related to central venouscatheter. In three cases the patients developed a deep venousbrachial or jugular thrombosis and one patient had rupture ofthe venous catheter. In this latter case, the subsequentprocedures to recover the broken part induced the patient todecide to stop the treatment. In our opinion, the problems withthe venous catheters are a field in which the substitution of theprotracted infusion of FU with oral fluoropyrimidine couldresult in a better cost-effectiveness ratio. However, the recentdata from the BICC-C study, a randomized trial comparing thestandard FOLFIRI regimen to irinotecan and bolus FU/FA(IFL regimen) and to an association of IRI plus capecitabine,reports the control arm to be superior in terms of responserate, PFS and OS with a better toxicity profile. These findingswere confirmed in the EORTC study 40015 in which C. H.K\u00f6hne et al. compared the classical FOLFIRI regimen versus a Capecitabine plus Irinotecan schedule called CAPIRI. Bothregimens were randomly assigned to a therapy with celecoxibor placebo. The trial was prematurely closed because of anunexpected number of deaths unrelated to disease progressionbut it was possible to establish that both TTP and OS wereshorter for CAPIRI than for FOLFIRI. These findings canreaffirm the importance of the infusional FU-based therapieseven in the era of oral fluoropyrimidines.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3427In our opinion the Wi-Fi combination is an active schedule that well matches with the weekly administration of Cetuximab.A phase II study of the combination Wi-Fi plus Cetuximab hasalready started in our Department. On the basis of recentadvances in the use of Cetuximab we decided to reserve thistreatment to patients with wild-type K-RAS disease. A lot of trials established that Capecitabine is at least active as infusional FU. On the contrary why Irinotecan seems towork better when combined with FU than when associatedwith Capecitabine? Irinotecan works well in the advancedsetting but it does not seem to be equally active in the adjuvantsetting, either stage II-III or stage IV . 498 V ARIOUS POSSIBLE METHODS FOR INDUCINGUROTHELIAL TUMOURS IN AND MICEUSING CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS P.A. Oliveira CECA V , Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes and Alto Douro, 5001-801 Vila Real, Portugal The bladder is one of the most common sites for the appearance of cancer in the urinary tract. Bladder tumours aremanifestations of a multifocal disease whose natural historyhas not yet been completely elucidated. Animal models providea system that can enhance our understanding of basic biology.To induce the development of urothelial tumours, it is essentialto select correctly the model that is most analogous to theclinical settings so that observations can be readily transferredto clinical studies for validation. Over the past few decades,research efforts have focused on the development of rodentmodels that permit the reproducible induction of bladder cancerwith minimal or no induction of at this, and when administered viathe appropriate route, at the appropriate dosage and in the appropriate strain ofanimal, all produce a high incidence of bladder tumours. Bymonitoring responses to chemical carcinogens usingexperimental models, it has been possible to identify many ofthe mechanisms through which tumours develop and toevaluate new therapeutic strategies. In our oral communication,the various possible methods for inducing urothelial tumoursin rats and mice using chemical compounds, the spectrum ofhistological lesions observed in each model and the results ofmy recent research will be presented. 499 CHEMO-PREVENTION OF: PROSTATE CANCER: THE RATIONALE BEHIND DESIGN OF PILOT STUDIESTim Oliver , Attila Lorincz and Jack Cuzick Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University London, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M6BQ, UK 12 years ago one of us (TO) first proposed the hypothesis that prostate cancer was caused by a life-time of \"sub-clinical\"prostatitis. The article also speculated on the basis of the firstresults from use of intermittent hormone therapy that short-term (1-3 months) androgen blockade given at age 45 (to theone third of the population known from post mortem studies tohave latent prostate cancer at that stage) could be a veryeffective form of chemo-prevention. The hypothesis was basedon a considerable paucity of hard facts and mainly rested onthree borderline significant aetiological similarities in commonbetween prostate and cervix cancer - i.e., risk of malignancy was increased by 1) early onset of sexual activity, 2) reducedby circumcision, and 3) increased in Afro-Caribbean's. Furthersupport came from the observation that 1 in 5 patients withadvanced metastatic prostate cancer treated by intermittentandrogen blockade (IAB) survived for prolonged periods (5 ormore years) without further need for treatment. Subsequently,studies on a cohort of predominantly 25-35 year old SouthAfrican Gold miners demonstrated a correlation between bothearly initiation of sexual activity and evidence of chlamydialinfection with increased PSA levels and provided additionalsupport for the hypothesis that repeated episodes of minorsexually transmitted diseases (STD) might cause lastingdamage to the prostate. The subsequent demonstration byothers that at the age of 45 those with a PSA above the medianlevel had a 3.75 higher risk of death from prostate cancerprovided further evidence of the value of PSA as a screeningtool for prostate cancer detection. However, it also raisedquestions whether this is because PSA level also reflects thedegree of persistent sub-clinical prostatitis and that isassociated with cancer development rather than a directmeasure of existing prostate cancer. Today, with five reviews in major journals, the concept of chronic inflammation of the prostate as a major cause ofprostate cancer has become mainstream. The failure toassociate a single major pathogen with cause, unlikehelicobacter gastritis in stomach cancer, has so far resulted infew therapeutic endeavours and led to the conclusion that theassociation is multi-factorial including non-specific infections,autoimmunity and dietary/environmentally acquired chemicaltoxins. The demonstration in a rat model that intra-urethral E. coli leads to the development of proliferative inflammatory atrophy and also Prostatic Intra-epithelial Neoplasia (PIN) hasdemonstrated how a non-specific infection can become amajor driving force in the clonal development of this disease. This presentation will review supporting data prior to focusing on the major paradox of medical therapy ofANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3428prostate cancer, ie that PSA testing leads to over diagnosis and thus active monitoring to select those in need of radicaltreatment is acceptable. However, a recent meta-analysis ofimmediate vs deferred androgen blockade randomised trialshas shown survival advantage though an unacceptableburden of side effects for immediate treatment. The pastyear has seen the publication of the first results from TheInternational Study of IAB for Carcinoma of the Prostate (ISICaP ) Group that has undertaken an individual patient data meta-analysis of IAB studies This has provided the firstsolid evidence that short course (3 months) IAB offers apotentially safe alternative to continuous anti-androgentherapy. More importantly from the point of view of thechemo-preventative potential of short course treatment, thisanalysis has also demonstrated that a higher proportion ofearlier cases remain progression free for 3 or more years offtreatment. In addition good progress has been reported indevelopment of urine and semen based tests for diagnosingprostate cancer. Based on these observsations and recognition of the high cancer risk of PSA positive biopsy negative individualspossible chemo-prevention protocols for such patientscombining short term anti-androgens, anti-Cox 2s and highdose Vitamin D are under consideration. The rationale behindthese proposals and their design will be reviewed 500 MULTIPLE MYELOMA - CHEMOKINE NETWORK:CCL27/ CTACK - A NEW Innrain 66, A 6020 Innsbruck; 2Institute of Pathology at the Private Medical University Hospital Salzburg, M\u00fcllner Hauptstrasse 48, A 5020Salzburg; 33rd Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and InfectiousDisease at the Private Medical University Hospital Salzburg,5020 Salzburg, Austria Multiple myeloma is a still incurable B cell neoplasm characterized by the monoclonal expansion of plasma cells inthe bone marrow. The physical interaction of multiplemyeloma cells with compartments of the bone marrowmicroenvironment has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of thedisease. In detail, promotion of tumor growth and survival,angiogenesis or the homing of the malignant clone aresustained by the bone marrow milieu. Chemokines havecurrently been shown to be major players in shaping the tumormicroenvironment of multiple myeloma cells.Investigating the bone marrow supernatants of multiple myeloma patients we found the chemokine CCL27/ CTACKdistinctly produced. This chemokine, which has so far onlybeen correlated with skin associated tumors, was significantlyupregulated in myeloma bone marrow compared to MGUSpatient samples. Additionally its expression could becorrelated with the stage of the disease. Immunohistochemicaldata revealed that myeloma plasma cells as well as endothelialcells are the major source for the production of this protein. Due to the known implications of the chemokine network in multiple myeloma, we started to reveal the possible role ofthis chemokine in tumor biology. What we found so far wasthe induction of some tumor promoting qualities. In detail thechemokine CCL27 induced the migratory capacity ofmyeloma cell lines, augments their susceptibility to IL-6 -amajor growth factor for myeloma tumor cells- and enhancesproliferation. An alternative way of myeloma cells to progress is the modulation of immune cell subsets in order to favour thetumor. With regard to the supporting role of dendritic cells inmyeloma disease, and since they are the most potent antigenpresenting cells inducing T cell responses, we focused on thiscell subset. Monocyte derived dendritic cells - differentiatedand matured in the presence of CCL27- exhibited a reducedcapacity to activate T cells and this correlated with reducedcytokine production on the T cell side. Further these dendriticcells exhibited an impairment in migrative behaviour but at thesame time induced proliferation in our myeloma cell lines. To summarize, we found that the myeloma cell produced chemokine CCL27 exerts tumor progressive effects: In detailwe found an induced migratory capacity, augmentation of thesusceptibility to IL-6, and enhanced proliferation on themyeloma cells themselves. Concerning the effects on immunemodulation, an impairment of dendritic cell function whichresults in decreased T cell activation potential and theimpairment of dendritic cell migration could be observed.All these findings led us to the conclusion that targetingCCL27 would be a potent tool for future antitumor therapies. 501 DAMAGE OF HORMONAL FUNCTION AND BONEMETABOLISM IN LONG-TERM SURVIVORS OFTESTICULAR Elisabeth Cancer Institute, Bratislava, SlovakRepublic; 2Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses, Masaryk University, National Health Information Center; Bratislava, Slovak Republic;Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 34294Cancer Research Academy Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic; Bratislava, Slovak Republic Background: Improved survival of testicular cancer patients during recent years has led to rising interest on the diseaseconsequences of the whole organism. Not only the tumoralone, but also its treatment may have an impact on a patient'shormonal status and bone metabolism. The aim of this studywas to assign the hormonal profile and complete osteologicexamination into algorithm of follow-up not only in patientswith bilateral disease, but also in patients with unilateraltesticular tumor. Patients and Methods: During the period of 11/2005-6/2008, we examined 828 patients diagnosed withtesticular cancer after a mean follow-up of 87 months (range9-260). Of these 776 patients were with unilateral (group A)and 52 with bilateral (group B) disease. Each patient wasexamined for hormonal profile (serum testosterone and resorption - C-terminalcross-linking telopeptides of type energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) wasperformed on a Holoxic Explorer machine, focused onmeasurement of the hips and lumbar spine bone mineraldensity (BMD). Results of the osteological examination andhormonal profile examination analyzed for associationswith therapy following orchiectomy (orchiectomy alone,chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy)and with the time interval since the primary therapy. All keyanalyses were carried out separately for unilateral and bilateraltumors. Standard univariate statistical techniques were used totest the differences between groups of patients (ML chi-squaretest, one-way ANOV A). Unconditional logistic regression wasused to relate potential risk factors to osteopenia and/orosteoporosis. All odds ratio estimates were adjusted forpatient's age at the time of examination. Results: Group A: 776 patients with unilateral testicular cancer were followed-up for amean 83 months (9-244) since therapy and were on average 39years old (range 24-57) at the time of examination.Testosterone deficiency (<10.0 nmol/l) was 385 patients 384 patients (49.5%). Serum calciumlevels were in all cases normal. Group B: 52 patients withbilateral testicular cancer were followed-up for a mean 160months (range 21-322) (average follow-up related to the 2ndtumor was 68 months, range 1-242) since the beginning of thetherapy and were on average 41 years old (range 24-58).Testosterone deficiency was observed in 43 patients (82.7%).Increased level of serum LH was observed in 42 patients(80.8%). Increased S-CTx was observed in 33 patients(63.5%). DEXA showed osteopenia and/or osteoporosis in 38patients (73.1%). Serum calcium levels were in all cases normal. Influence of age at examination and time toexamination: Age at the time of examination was significantlyincreased in patients with osteoporosis (on average by 7 years)both in unilateral ( p<0.001) and bilateral ( p=0.022) tumors. The risk of osteoporosis increased with time since primarytherapy (OR 1.08, p<0.05) and furthermore significant time cut-off points were found both for unilateral tumors (>8 years,OR 1.27) and bilateral tumors (>10 years, OR 3.90). Inbilateral tumors, time >10 years since 2nd testicular cancerdiagnosis was proven as an additional component increasingrisk of osteoporosis (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.07-7.61). Influence ofprimary therapy: In unilateral disease, applied CHT and/or RTincreased significantly age-adjusted risk of osteopenia and/orosteoporosis (ORs ranged from 1.28 to 2.96). Application ofradiotherapy further specifically increased spine BMD impairment (OR 1.31; p<0.05). Radiotherapy was also significantly associated with increasedTST and decreased LH levels at the time of examination inunilateral disease. In bilateral tumors, no significant associationbetween therapy and risk of osteoporosis was found. This canbe explained by highly significant risk potential of cancerbilaterality itself. Bilaterality reached highly significant oddsratio ( p<0.001) for + osteopenia (2.77; 95% CI 1.47-5.19).Conclusion: Examination of the hormonal profile and testosterone replacement therapy may be recommended as animportant aspect of a patient's follow-up not only in bilateraldisease (without consideration of the patient's sexual life), butalso in patients with unilateral testicular cancer. The importantpart of a standard examination algorithm should also be anosteological examination to prevent osteopenia or evenosteoporosis development. Particular attention should be paid topatients treated by radiotherapy. 502 FUNCTIONAL STUDIES OF S100A6 University Hospital Solna, 171 76 2Department of Biotechnology, Royal Institute of Technology, KTH, Roslagstullsbacken 21, 106 91Stockholm, Sweden We previously used proteomic profiling to identify S100A6 as a protein up-regulated in response to DNA damage. Ourstudies also showed that S100A6 was expressed in a p53-dependent manner and that the post-translational modificationpattern 3157-3556 (2008) 3430following irradiation. We and others have shown that S100A6 is overexpressed in a number of different tumor types. Theconnection between S100A6, cancer, p53 and DNA damagingtreatment inspired us to investigate the cellular functions ofS100A6 in depth. As the functions of S100 proteins are believed to be through interactions with other proteins and regulation of these targetproteins functions, we used proteomics to discover novelS100A6 interacting proteins. Immunoprecipitation using anS100A6 specific antibody was proteomic analysisof the S100A6 precipitate using nano-LC MALDI-MS/MS.Using this approach we discovered Ubiquilin-1 as a novelS100A6 interacting protein. To further investigate the function of S100A6 we generated stable S100A6 shRNA expressing lung cancer cell lines. Thesecell lines were then used in proteomics experiments toevaluate the effect of S100A6 silencing on the cellularproteome. Using this approach we were able to showconnections of S100A6 with regulation of protein degradation,and in addition S100A6 silencing increased the cellularsensitivity to ionizing radiation. 503 PRO AND CONS FOR of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Charite Medical University, Germany The treatment of recurrent disease in ovarian cancer patients is an important aspect in the overall management. Ovarian cancerpatients who do not respond to their initial chemotherapy orwho relapse after achieving a response are generally incurable.Treatment goals after failure of first-line treatment for ovariancancer are: (a) controlling or preventing disease-relatedsymptoms, (b) maintaining quality of life with choosing aneffective treatment with low toxicity potential and (c)prolonging progression-free survival. In contrast to the situationin previously untreated patients in whom prospectiverandomized phase III trials have established the currentstandard, in patients with recurrent disease there have been fewrandomized trials that have clearly demonstrated a survivaladvantage for a particular drug or regimen. In addition, a seriesof agents have been shown to have clinical activity in recurrentovarian cancer, including topotecan, pegylated liposomaldoxorubicin, gemcitabine, and oral etoposide. It has also beendemonstrated that re-treatment with a platinum drug and taxanehas been associated with significant clinical activity in patientswith \"sensitive\" (treatment free interval >6 months) recurrentdisease. The role of antihormonal therapy is unclear. Howeverevidence-based treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer willrequire prospective randomized trials comparing efficacy, toxicity and quality of life. 504 ROLE OF DNA CONTENT ANALYSIS ANDIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY IN THE EV ALUATION OF THE solid tumour affecting young children. Its histological diversityleads to difficulties in predicting the outcome. Materials and Methods: Image analysis cytometry and immunohistochemistry with a selected panel of antibodieswere performed in 23 cases of WT considered intermediaterisk tumours according to the revised International Society ofPediatric Oncology (SIOP) working classification of renaltumours of childhood. In this series, a tumour was consideredaggressive according to its propensity for metastases or itsrecurrence. Results: Out of the 14 non-aggressive WT, 4 were found to be diploid and 10 were aneuploid, including 6 thatwere heterogeneous for DNA-ploidy. All the tumourspresented a low proliferative index and were negative for p53and p57kip2 immunostaining. Out of the 9 aggressivetumours, all were aneuploid and 4 were found to beheterogeneous for DNA-ploidy. They all presented a highdegree of cell proliferation and 7 were positive for p53immunostaining. Only two were positive for p57kip2 marker.The only fatal case revealed an aneuploid-homogeneous DNA-ploidy analysis, was p53- and p57 kip2- positive and presented a high cell proliferation index. Conclusion: A significant correlation between the presence of focal DNA-aneuploidy inWilms' tumours and adverse prognosis was not established,but some immunohistochemical markers may be useful for theclinical evaluation of these tumours and to help in predictingthe risk of unfavourable local treatment modality and therefore aims at the treatment of localized tumours.Experimental interstitial radiosurgery produces well definedAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3431small volumes of tissue necrosis which develop centrifugally from the implant and which are subsequently removed bymacrophage activity. The perifocal toxicity is attributed tosecondary effects, namely temporary changes in capillarypermeability and regional cerebral blood flow. The damagedcapillary surface area product increases with the square of theradius of the irradiated volume. The combination of temporaryperifocal vasogenic edema and reduced blood flow in relationto volume limits the application of radiosurgery in the brain. The clinical application requires the direct temporary placement of single or multiple radioactive sources in the formof seeds into the tumor volume. Tumour volume and targetvolume ideally are identical. Tissue inhomogeneities are ofminor concern. The dose administered is confined with a steepdose gradient when compared with standard radiotherapy.Radioactive sources such as Iodine-125 (I-125) deliver thedose at low-dose rate with+ radiosurgicalprocedures, interstitial radiosurgery requires a preciseknowledge of the relationship between the energy of theradioactive source, the radiation dose, the volume treated andthe subsequent response of normal tissue surrounding thelesion. Only a small subgroup of patients with low-gradegliomas are appropriate candidates for interstitial radiosurgery,namely those with circumscribed tumors with only limitedspread of tumor cells into the periphery. For this subgroup,which usually comprises not more than 25 % of all low-gradegliomas, interstitial radiosurgery competes with surgicalresection. Interstitial radiosurgery is due to hypothalamic hamartomas withless invasiveness and side-effects compared with open surgery. 506 A REVIEW ON FIRST-GENERATION HEPOXILINANALOGS (PBTs) AS CANCER THERAPEUTICS Cecil R. Pace-AsciakProgramme in Physiology and Experimental Medicine, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 1X8(primary address) and Department of Pharmacology, Facultyof Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario,Canada M5S 1A8 In this review, the utility of stable first-generation analogs (PBT) of the hepoxilins in controlling the growth of neoplasticcells is discussed from in vivo xenograft animal studies (nude mice) and from in vitro studies. The PBTs cause apoptosis of solid tumors in leukemic (human CML) and human breastcancer animal models in vivo with a threshold effect at 1.2 mg/kg in the CML model. The compounds are well toleratedeven at doses 10\u00d7above threshold, are stable and have long-term efficacy (up to 50 days) after an 8-day treatment. This delay in tumour growth can be doubled if treatment is carriedout during two interrupted 8-days periods. The PBTs areactive in vitro on several human neoplastic cell lines tested derived from chronic myelogenous cervical cancer(HeLa). The PBTs have no effect on normal cells (3T3-L1 andsmooth muscle). The PBTs are effective in causing apoptosisof K562 cells that were resistant to Gleevec. These studiespoint to an effective PBT base structure which may allowmodification to afford second-generation compounds withimproved pharmaceutical properties as cancer therapeuticswith minimal or no side-effects.Supported by the Ontario Cancer Research Network (OCRN). 507 FORTY YEARS WITH SERUM CANCER MARKERS.A RETROSPECTIVE AND PROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS Michel Pag\u00e9 Faculty of Medicine, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada The first serum cancer markers, such as alphafoetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen, described more than forty years agoare also present at various developmental stages of the foetus orthe embryo. Following the enthusiasm of the first reports onthe sensitivity and specificity of these markers, elevatedconcentrations of these proteins were soon reported in certainbenign diseases. Many new markers, such as CA 125, CA 15.3,CA 19.9, were developed following the advent of monoclonalantibodies and these are still in use today. Prostate-specificantigen (PSA) was rapidly accepted as a serum marker for thiscancer. After a few years of experience with these markers, itbecame evident that these assays were neither specific norsensitive enough to be used for cancer screening but they couldbe used efficiently for the follow-up of treated patients.Recently developed markers are now intended for individualtherapy. More recently, serum proteins and peptides have beenanalyzed by protein array or MALDI-TOF-MS to obtain aprofile and predict the outcome of targeted therapies. With theadvent of these new technologies, the clinician may not onlyconfirm a diagnosis but may soon be able to plan the besttreatment and predict the most probable outcome. 508 BIOTINYLATED CISPLATIN-LOADED PAMAMDENDRIMERS FOR Lerma Rangel College Pharmacy, Texas A&M Health Science, Center, Kingsville, Texas-78363, USAANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3432Objective: Biotin, also known as vitamin H, is a growth promoter of cells and biotin levels were found significantlyhigher in cancer cells as compared to normal tissue. Rapidlyproliferating cells need higher amounts of biotin. Wehypothesized that conjugation of biotin to polyamidoamine(PAMAM) dendrimers and their use as carriers for cisplatintherapy would provide targeted therapeutic effect and reducethe side effects of cisplatin. Cisplatin-loaded biotinylateddendrimers of different generations were used and theirencapsulation efficiency, in vitro release profile and in vitro cellular uptake were studied. Materials and Methods: Dendrimers were biotinylated using Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin.Cisplatin was loaded into the reaction wasseparated by column chromatography. Encapsulationefficiency and in vitro the dendrimers was studied in A2780 and CP70 celllines using HPLC. Statistical analysis of the data wasperformed using ANOV A and p<0.05 was considered biotin-dendrimer (G4 was 3 fold higher than free cisplatin (IC50-106.21 M), validating our hypothesis that these conjugateddendrimers can be used for targeting ovarian cancer withminimum amount of cisplatin required to elicit desiredcytotoxic activity. In vitro cellular uptake experiments in CP70 showed significantly higher cisplatin levels as compared tocisplatin ( p<0.01). 509 A NOVEL 1Laboratory Laboratory and Advanced Biotechnologies, IRCCSSan of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy Cancer development and progression is a multi-step process based on the accumulation and clonal selection of somaticmutations in key cancer-related genes, corresponding to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressorgenes. One of the most well studied cellular genes involved inthe pathogenesis of human cancer is the K-ras proto-oncogene,which encodes a 21-kDa GTP-binding protein that controls themechanisms of cell growth and differentiation. Point mutationsin the K-ras gene lead to uncontrolled stimulation of ras-relatedfunctions by the altering p21 ras protein-related pathway.Mutations in the K-ras oncogene are frequently found inhuman cancers, such as colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer,lung adenocarcinoma, gall bladder cancer, bile Activating mutations occur in hot-spots mainlyof codons 12 and 13. These mutations may be predictive ofdrug response and can also indicate prognosis. In particular,recent publications have shown that the successful treatment ofmetastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), using monoclonalantibody therapies such as Panitumumab is directly linked tothe oncogenic activation of the K-ras signaling pathway. In ourlaboratory, molecular analysis of K-ras is routinely carried outon genomic DNA extracted by paraffin-embedded after microdissection. and 2 of amplified by PCR using specific primers for theK-ras gene and then sequencing analysis is performed. Here,we report a case of a patient with mCRC, who referred to ourlaboratory in order to evaluate K-ras somatic cancer mutations.Molecular analysis performed on paraffin-embedded samplesshowed a mutation in the first exon of the K-ras gene(CAG>TAG), that determines a premature stop signal at codon22 (Gln22Stop). Such inactivation of K-ras gene is amechanism not reported before, suggesting a possibleinvolvement of other genes or epigenetic factors. Indeed, allmutations reported in literature, to date, are hot-spots missensepoint mutations at codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117, while recently anovel 15-bp insertion, resulted in tandem duplication of codons62-66, was reported. There are no other reports that describemutations of K-ras gene resulting in a premature stop signal.These data help to clarify the importance to evaluate K-rasmutation, in order to identify not only the molecularmechanisms of cancer progression but also subjects who arelikely to benefit from targeted therapies and to avoid costly andpotentially toxic treatments in non-responder patients.Partially supported by Grant LILT - Lega Italiana per la Lottacontro i Tumori. 510 IS BREAST CANCER AN INTEGRAL BHD-RELATED TUMOR? R. Palmirotta 1, A. Savonarola1, Biotechnologies, IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana, Rome; Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 34332Unit Of Skin Histopathology, IRCCS San Gallicano a predisposing multiple, small papules on the face, neck, andupper thorax after the age of 25 years. These lesions, called\"fibrofolliculomas\" (FFs), are histologically classified asbenign hamartomas of the hair follicle. The by mutations in the gene(also known as BHD-OMIM607273) which encodes a tumor-suppressor protein. Numerous mutations have been describedin the FLCN gene, the most frequent occurring within a C8tract of exon 11, resulting in a truncated folliculin; this \"hotspot\" mutation has been found in the germline of 44% BHDpatients. This hypermutability is probably due to a \"slippage\"in the DNA polymerase during DNA replication, resulting ingains or losses of repeat units, as happens for other genescausing cancer predisposition. However, recent reports suggestthat all translated exons might be mutated. The main phenotypic manifestations related to this disease, as reported in the literature, are lung cysts leading topneumothorax, and an increased risk for renal neoplasia. Alsodiscussed is the genotype/phenotype correlation betweenFLCN mutations and risk of colon cancer. While some reportsdescribe this correlation, a recent risk-assessment study ofBHD-affected patients concluded that a diagnosis of BHDconferred a 7-fold increased risk of developing renal neoplasiaand a 50-fold increased risk of spontaneous pneumothorax butno increased risk of colon polyps or colon cancer. Other reports describe additional phenotypic manifestations in BHD-affected individuals, including lipomas, angiolipomas,parathyroid adenomas and parotid oncocytomas. Among the BHD-affected families referring to our Institutions, we selected two families; genetic counseling wasperformed in order to obtain family trees and molecularanalysis of the FLCN gene was performed. The proband of thefirst family had a history of breast cancer at the age of 44 andof colon cancer at the age of 56; molecular analysis showedthe occurrence of a frameshift mutation, not previouslyreported, located in exon 9 (1345delAAAG) of the FLCNgene. 1345delAAAG was associated with a wide variety oftumors, including stomach, colon and parotid cancer found inother family members. The proband of the second family hada history of breast cancer at the age of 42; molecular analysisshowed the occurrence of a missense mutation in exon 12(G1788A). Studies are currently ongoing to assess theoccurrence of a possible \"second hit\" somatic mutation inbreast cancer tissues. To date, there are no reports describinga possible association between germline FLCN mutation andrisk of breast cancer. The genes so far associated withhereditary forms of breast cancer are BRCA1 and BRCA2,while a small fraction of risk can currently be attributed togermline mutations in other genes, such as p53, mismatch repair genes, ATM, PTEN and LKB1. Our data, in associationwith the early age of onset of breast cancer in patients withmutations in the FLCN gene, suggest for the first time thepossible association between germline FLCN mutation andrisk of breast cancer.Partially supported by Grant LILT - Lega Italiana per la Lottacontro i Tumori 511 ALL TRANS-RETINOIC ACID REVERSES THEPROTUMORAL EFFECT OF HEPATOCYTEGROWTH FACTOR ON THE HIGHLY METASTATICS4MH RABDOMYOSARCOMA CELL LINE Teodoro Palomares , Roberto Sanisidro, Ignacio Garc\u00eda-Alonso and Ana Alonso-Varona Departments of Surgery and Radiology and Physical Medicine, and Cell Biology and Histology, School ofMedicine and Dentistry, University of the Basque Country,Leioa, Vizcaya, Spain Purpose: We previously demonstrated the tumour-enhancing effect derived from hepatic resection of liver metastases,which could be exerted through growth factors (GF) relatedwith liver regeneration, such as hepatocyte growth factor(HGF). The aim of this work was to study the role of HGF onthe growth of the highly metastatic S4MH rabdomyosarcoma(RMS) cell line, and to analyze the possible preventive effectof all- trans -retinoic acid (ATRA) on the HGF pro-tumour effect. Materials and Methods: The poorly differentiated and highly metastatic S4MH RMS cell line was used. Cells werecultured in 24-well microplates at a density of 10 4cells/well in the presence or absence of different concentrations (5-40ng/ml) of HGF, in order to determine the optimalconcentration of HGF on cell proliferation. Afterwards, ATRA(10 -6M) or the control solvent was also administered every 48 h to cells cultured in presence of HGF, and thechemopreventive effects of ATRA on the pro-tumour effect ofthis GF was analyzed. Proliferation was measured by using ahaemocytometer. Results: HGF significantly enhanced cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner up to a doseof 10 ng/ml. Higher concentrations were toxic. In the presenceof 10 ng/ml of HGF, the number of cells at 24 and 72 h were1.3 and 1.2 times higher than in control cultures. The increasein proliferation rate induced by HGF was mainly apparent inthe first 24 h of culture (1.3 times higher than that of thecontrols); afterwards, this rate was similar in HGF and controlcultures (proliferation rate close to 2.5 at 48 and 72 h). ATRAsignificantly reduced (1.3- and 1.2-fold at 24 and 72 h,respectively) the growth of S4MH cells. Moreover, ATRA alsosignificantly reduced the pro-tumour effect of HGF; thus, withrespect to cells cultured with HGF alone, ATRA treatmentANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3434reduced cell proliferation 1.8- and at 24 and 72 h, respectively ( p<0.05). Conclusion: These results suggest that ATRA could be a useful chemopreventive agent to prevent thepro-tumour effects of HGF on RMS.This work has been supported by grants of the University ofthe Basque Country/EHU, Basque Government and the Jes\u00fasGangoiti Barrera Foundation. 512 L-2-OXOTHIAZOLIDINE-4-CARBOXYLATEREVERSES TUMOUR GROWTH-PROMOTINGEFFECT OF THE FACTORS HGF, Caram\u00e9s and Ana Alonso-Varona. Departments of Surgery and Radiology and Physical Medicine, and Cell Biology and Histology, School ofMedicine and Dentistry, University of the Basque Country,Leioa, Vizcaya, Spain Purpose: Gluthathione (GSH), the most prevalent intracellular non-protein thiol, is involved in the growth factor-inducedproliferative activity. The present study investigated the effectof manipulation of GSH using the cysteine prodrug L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (OTZ) on the response of coloncancer cells to growth factors (GF). Materials and Methods: A highly metastatic human colon cancer WiDr cell line wasselected. Cell were seeded in 24-well microplates at a densityof 10 4cells/well and allowed to grow for 24 h. The cells were treated with OTZ for 4 h. Afterwards, the cells were exposedto hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), vascular endothelialgrowth factor (VEGF) and growth factor measured by using a haemocytometer. In theGSH assay, the cells were stained with 100 Mmonochlorobimane and the GSH content was determinedusing the CytoFluor-2350 system. Results: The three GFs significantly enhanced cell proliferation. In the presence of 7.5ng/ml of HGF, 10 ng/ml of VEGF and 25 ng/ml of EGF, thenumber of cells at 48 h was 1.7, 1.2 and 1.2 times higher,respectively, than in control cultures. Whereas exposure ofcells to VEGF and EGF resulted in a 50% reduction in GSHlevels after 1 h of incubation and increased them at 2 h (50%increase compared with control cells), the addition of HGF for2 h produced a significant GSH depletion (30%) and a 45%increase after 4 h compared with non-exposed cells. However,treatment with 5 mM OTZ produced a 42.6% reduction in thecellular GSH content after 4 h of incubation and a 1.3-foldreduction in the growth rate. Moreover, exposure to OTZabrogated the pro-tumour effects of the GFs. Thus, OTZtreatment reduced by 1.6-fold the growth rate of cells in thepresence of HGF and VEGF and by 1.4-fold in the case ofEGF with respect to untreated cells at 72 h. Conclusion: OTZis capable of reversing the growth-promoting effects of GFs. This fact could be important in the design of therapeuticstrategies involving intracellular GSH level modification as amechanism for tumour cytotoxic drugs. 513 CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURALCHROMOSOMAL ABNORMALITIES ANDHEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES Anna D. PananiCritical Care Department, Medical School of Athens University, Cytogenetics Unit, vangelismos spital,Athens, Greece Over the past four decades, it has become clear that acquired recurrent chromosomal changes are associated with specificmalignant diseases. Among acquired structural chromosomalabnormalities, reciprocal translocations have been identifiedin a variety of malignant diseases, mainly including leukemias,lymphomas and sarcomas and they have been implicated inthe etiology of the neoplastic process with involvement ofspecific genes. On the other hand, it is now well recognizedthat certain constitutional chromosomal aberrations confer atumor predisposition. The observation that constitutional structural chromosomal aberrations are associated with a predisposition to cancer hasled to a two-hits hypothesis for cancer development. The firsthit is a constitutional abnormality involving a specific geneand the second hit is an acquired inactivation of the otherallele by mutation or other genetic change. Investigations offamilies with hereditary cancer and constitutionalchromosomal abnormalities have been key observationsleading to the molecular identification of specific genesimplicated in tumorigenesis, such as the loci involved inretinoblastoma patients with 13q deletion and the loci inWilms tumor patients with 11p deletion. Large studies havebeen reported on the incidence of constitutional chromosomalaberrations in patients with hematological malignancies, butthey could not confirm an increased risk for hematologicalmalignancy among carriers of structural chromosomalchanges. However, it is of particular interest that constitutionalstructural chromosome aberrations with breakpoints similar toleukemia-associated specific reportedin with hematological malignancies. This mightindicate that the constitutional anomaly itself probably plays arole in the neoplastic process. There is substantial discussion in the literature about mechanisms involved in constitutional structuralchromosomal abnormalities. The documentation of morepatients with hematological malignancies and constitutionalstructural chromosomal changes could be of majorimportance. Most importantly, the molecular cloning of theAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3435chromosomal breakpoints involved in constitutional rearrangements in patients with hematological disorderscould give useful information on the genetic eventsunderlying constitutional anomalies contributing to isolationof genes important in the development of the neoplasticprocess. 514 THE GROWTH INHIBITORY EFFECTS OFCADMIUM AND COPPER , Mortaza Bayesteh and Isfahan Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences,Isfahan, Iran Background: Cadmium chloride is an important occupational and environmental pollutant but under certainconditions can also be anticarcinogenic. Copper is anessential trace element. Moreover it was shown thatapoptotic potential of copper is associated with its ability togenerate reactive oxygen species. The aim of this study wasto determine the ability of cadmium chloride and copperchloride to cause cell death in a human breast cancer cellline (MDA-MB-468). Methods: MDA-MB-468 cells 2/95% air. The cells were plated in 96-well plates. After 24 hours, different concentrations of cadmiumchloride and copper chloride were added to plates whichwere then incubated for 48 and 72 hours. MTT cell viabilitytest was used to study the cytotoxic effects of cadmium andcopper. Results: Exposure of monolayers to different metal concentrations (1-1000 M) for different times showed asignificant decrease ( p<0.05) of viable cells when compared with that of controls in a dose-dependent manner; asignificant cytotoxicity was observed at 200 M forcadmium chloride at 48 hours and 1 M at 72 hours. Forcopper chloride, significant cytotoxicity was best observedat 1000 M at 48 hours and 1 M during 72 hours. Themaximum synergic cytotoxic effect was observed at 0.5 Mcadmium chloride and 0.5 M copper chloride during 72hours exposure. Conclusion: In this study it has been shown that there is differential sensitivity of the cell line to theantitumor activity of cadmium chloride and copper chloride.The results of the present study also indicated that thecytotoxic effect of copper chloride is somewhat less thanthat of cadmium chloride. This may be due to vitalphysicological role of copper, none of which are known forcadmium as yet. In other words, copper is used for naturalconsumption by the cells also. Altogether, these findingsmay suggest a new view on the mode of action and possible application of trace elements in cancer treatment. 515 THE ROLE OF THE GROWTH FACTORPLEIOTROPHIN AND ITS RECEPTORS IN TUMOR University of Patras, Patras GR26504, or heparin binding growth associated molecule, isan 18 kDa growth factor that has high affinity for heparin,and together with midkine forms a family of structurallyrelated heparin binding growth factors. The two proteinsshare 45% homology in their amino acid sequence andmany, but not all, biological activities. The first describedbiological activity of PTN is stimulation of neuriteoutgrowth and a role in the growth and maturation of brain.PTN also induces proliferation of several types of cells, isinvolved in a variety of processes in bone formation, seemsto play a critical role in chondrogenesis and participates innormal spermatogenesis and fertility. Screening of varioushuman tumour cell lines and tumour speciments of differentorigin revealed that PTN is expressed ofcancer, as gliomas, melanomas, meningiomas,neuroblastomas, choriocarcinomas, leukemias and cancer ofpancreas, prostate, stomach, colon, breast, ovaries and lungs.Concerning the biological activity of PTN in cancer, thereis ample evidence that it is a tumor-promoting factor,enhancing tumor cell proliferation, migration, anchorage-independent growth and angiogenesis in vivo or in vitro . PTN receptors are also up-regulated in a plethora of tumorsand are being tested as targets for anticancer therapy. Wehave recently identified 3integrin as an important mediator of PTN-induced endothelial and tumor cellmigration and the molecular mechanisms involved in thispathway, as well as its involvement in tumor growth andangiogenesis are being investigated. We are also working onthe regulation of PTN expression, as well asstructure-function relationships, knowledge that could leadto identification of new target(s) and the possibledevelopment of new therapeutic tools. This research project is co-financed by E.U. European SocialFund (75%) and the Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, Evanston, IL, USA and University of Manchester, UK Numerous studies have confirmed the value of the bioreductive compound NLCQ-1 as a tumor hypoxia-targeting agent and as an enhancer of radiotherapy,radioimmunotherapy and chemotherapy. In addition, studiesusing rat liver microsomes have suggested a role forcytochrome p450 reductase (P450R) in NLCQ-1bioactivation. As human tumor levels of P450R areheterogeneous and not substantially elevated versus those of normal tissue, exploitation of P450R in a therapeutic contextrequires a gene therapy-based approach unless other enzymesoverexpressed in tumors, such as inducible nitric oxidesynthase (iNOS) can be exploited in the activation of NLCQ-1. Therefore, in our recent studies we investigated the effectof in tumors overexpressing P450 to prevent tumor-micrometastasis, alone or incombination with radiotherapy was evaluated. Finally, wehave investigated the effect of NLCQ-1 against resistant,latent TB-bacilli, since andexposed to h) cytotoxicity was inmice bearing subcutaneous KHT tumours (250 mm 3). Tumors were irradiated with a single dose of 25 Gy whereas NLCQ-1was administered 72 h post-radiotherapy (10 mg/kg/day \u00d7 the lungs 21 dayspost radiotherapy. Antitubercular activity was evaluated inH37Rv bacteria by using the luminescence-based low oxygenrecovery assay (LORA) and toxicity was assessed cellsby using the MTT assay. Improved iNOS transfected cells, suggesting a therapeuticadvantage of combining NLCQ-1 with gene therapy. NLCQ-1proved very efficacious in the metastatic studies, with 7/9animals showing no visible signs of lung metastasis and inaddition it improved tumor local control. Finally, NLCQ-1 wasselectively active against latent TB mycobacteria, normallylocalized in the lungs. These data suggest that NLCQ-1 notonly can prevent metastatic lesions in the lungs as an adjuvantto radiotherapy but also can be beneficial in combination withgene therapy and in the treatment of latent tuberculosis. 517 LIPID CORE MICELLES FOR IN VIVO WHOLE BODY TUMOR TARGETING AND IMAGING A. Papagiannaros , D. Chovatia, J. Upponi, P. Shah, A. Kale, Mongayt, W. Hartner, T. Levchenko and V . Torchilin Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Center for Pharmaceutical Biotechnology and Nanomedicine,Northeastern University, 312 Mugar Life Sciences Building,Boston, MA 02115, USA Introduction: Whole body in vivo imaging of nanoparticles, macromolecules, quantum dots and living cells can be carriedout in the near infrared region of the spectrum and offersresults with high sensitivity and precision. This method'sadvantages over more conventional techniques, such as the useof radioisotopes, include easier handling, improved versatilityand cost effectiveness. This IR whole body imaging isnoninvasive, and the images are captured in real time. Thequantification of the bio-distribution of the micelles was onlysemi-quantitative at best, due to the intense scattering andabsorption of the fluorescence. The aims of the study are touse near infrared whole body imaging to visualize andquantify the bio-distribution of nanoparticles, and to developnanosized contrast agents for the detection of cancer anddisease sites with high sensitivity and precision. Materials and Methods: Micelles encapsulating Near Infra Red emitting Quantum dots (Qdot800) or Alexa 750-PE were produced andtheir size distribution was estimated by dynamic lightscattering (Beckman Coulter N4). Actively targeted quantumdot micelles were also produced by conjugation of antibody 2C5 to PEG-PE. Tumorbearing animals (1.5\u00d710 64T1 cells, s.c., right flank) were anesthetized and micelles or quantum dots were injected viathe tail vein. Mice were visualized in a Kodak IN VIVOIMAGE STATION FX (excitation filter 720 nm, emission 790nm). The fluorescence from the lipid nanoparticles wascompared with commercially available formulations. Imageswere analyzed using the Kodak Molecular Imaging Softwareor NIH ImageJ. Results and Discussion: Tumor fluorescence in mice injected with the quantum dot micelles was higherthan the commercially available pegylated quantum dots, sothe images were sharply contrasted. The signal form the lipidcoated quantum dots maximized within one hour from theinjection while the fluorescence from commercially availablepegylated quantum dots reached similar levels after four hours.Overall the signal of the lipid QD micelles was higher while todose is half. The variability of the bio-distribution was smallerin the case of the lipid coated nanoparticles and the cost wasalso smaller. The lipid contrast agent seems to accumulate tothe tumor, liver, spleen and kidneys. The results of thequantification for the micelles were similar to those previouslyreported using radioisotopes. The actively targetedAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3437nanoparticles accumulation to the tumor was double that of the non targeted quantum dot micelles, producing even moresharp images at one hour after the injected. Alexa encapsulatedmicelles contrast was high enough to localize readily thetumor within one hour, but afterwards the contrast of theimages decreased due to a high abdominal signal, due to thesecretion of the lipids. Conclusion: We have developed an optical molecular imaging system in the near infraredspectrum for the in vivo visualization of nanoparticles bio- distribution and for the imaging of tumors. The activetargeting of the quantum dot immuno-micelles in metastatictumor models is under investigation.This work was supported by NIH grant RO1 EB001961 toProf. V .P. Torchilin. We thank Prof. M.

The hospice movement from Great Britain hasinfluenced German medicine since the 1970s. In this \"decadeof ignorance\" nothing more happened in Germany. In the1980s, the \"decade of the pioneers\", the first department forPC of a hospital started in Koeln in 1983 and the first hospiceopened in Aachen in 1986. In the following \"decade ofestablishment\", as in other European countries, many hospicesand PC services started working and developed. For example,the outpatient PC project \"Home Care Berlin\", a specialisedmedical PC service working since 1994, cares for more than athousand patients every year. Data and experiences of thisservice are presented and compared with data frominternational PC services. In 1994, the German Society of Palliative Medicine was founded, the first professorship in PC was founded in 1999.In this time, the civic hospice movement started in Germanyand the number of hospices and PC units in hospitals grewrapidly. In the last year, the government passed a bill for reformation of the health care system. Part of this bill was theacceptance of PC as a part of obligatory health insurance.Now, very different models are developed to provide andimprove PC in the country. One model, the Home CareSachsen Association, is presented with first data. Conclusion: After a quarter of a century PC in Germany is still developing.Nationwide provision has still not been achieved. Models forPC differ regionally and structurally. Current strategies aimedat standardising the concepts have to be reconsidered.519 A MOUSE MODEL OF HUMAN HEAD AND NECKSQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA THROUGH THE SOMATIC ACTIV ATION OF Biomedicine,CIEMAT. Ave. Complutense 22, E28040 Madrid, Spain Akt/PKB is a key element in the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway that is overactivated in many tumor types including head andneck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Here we show thattransgenic mice expressing a constitutively active form of Aktin the basal layer of stratified using the K5 promoter sequences (K5MyrAkt), developpretumoral lesions and carcinomas in situ in the oral cavity which resemble human oral dysplasias and in situ carcinomas. However they do not progress into advanced aggressivecarcinomas due to the induction of p53-dependent senescence.Accordingly, a transgenic mouse line in which active Akt iscombined with the somatic deletion of the TP53 gene in stratified epithelia (p53 F/FK14Cre;K5myrAkt mice) develops malignant aggressive oral tumors. These tumors displaymultiple molecular and histopathological characteristics thatphenocopy human oral SCC and can be followed through in vivo imaging by PET. Overall, these models should help in understanding the pathogenesis of human HNSCC and willlikely prove useful tools for preclinical testing of therapiestargeting the Akt and p53 signaling pathways. 520 TP53 LOSS IN EPIDERMIS GENERATESAGGRESSIVE METASTATIC TUMORS ANDPROVIDES A GENOMIC Ave. Complutense, 22, E-28040 Madrid, Spain Squamous cell carcinomas represent the most aggressive type of non-melanoma skin cancer. Here we report that using theCre-loxP system, loss of p53, but not pRb, in epidermis leadsto the development of spontaneous tumors, whose occurrenceis severely accelerated in doubly deficient mice. The tumorsare aggressive, undifferentiated and display a hair follicleANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3438origin. Moreover they also display a high metastatic potential to the lungs. Using expression profiling and statistical toolsfor transcript set enrichment analysis, we performed a cross-species comparison of epidermal p53-deficient models andhuman cancer samples. The results demonstrated that themouse p53 tumors recapitulate molecular features of p53-mutated human cancer samples, undifferentiated andaggressive human tumors from different anatomical locations,and human embryonic stem cells. In addition, wedemonstrated that mouse p53-deficient primary tumors containmolecular determinants for metastatic progression, which hasallowed us to develop a 40-gene predictor for human breastcancer clinical outcome. Our gene profiling analyses validatemouse p53 tumor models as tools for preclinical tests oftargeted therapies against human aggressive tumors. Moreover,we demonstrated that animal models with aggressive cancercan be used to develop genomic predictors and D. Pikazis Department of Pathophysiology, Oncology Unit, Athens University School of Medicine, Laikon General Hospital,Athens, Greece Objectives: We aimed at examining whether patients with RF- positive rheumatoid arthritis and absence of clinical orlaboratory evidence of a neoplastic disorder could have\"falsely\" elevated levels of some commonly applied serumtumor markers. Methods: Patients fulfilling the American Rheumatology Association (ARA) diagnostic criteria forrheumatoid arthritis entered the present study. Data werecollected for patients with rheumatoid arthritis who hadincreased indices of ovarian cancer (CA-125>33 U/ml)without the presence of cancer. Moreover, data were alsocollected for the following variables: RF-test, CRP, and serumtumor marker levels; CEA, and CA-19.9 measured by ELISA.Relationships between ordinal variables were studied with theuse of Spearman non-parametric tests. Results: Fifty-three consecutive patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria ofrheumatoid arthritis were entered; 45 women and 8 men, witha median age 51 years (range, 23-58). The associationsbetween Ra-test and CRP with CEA, non-significant relationships were detectedbetween Ra-test, CRP and any of the tumor markers. Twopatients (3.8%) had high values of CEA and 7 patients(13.2%) of CA-125. There was one patient (1.9%) found withhigh value of CA-19.9 index. No significant relationship wasdetected between Ra-test and CEA, CA-125 while a near significant correlation was found between CRP and CA-125(p=0.08). No significant relationship was detected between Ra-test and CEA, CA-125, CA-19.9. None of the patientsincluded in the present study developed cancer after aminimum period of 3-year follow-up. Conclusion: The present report raises the issue of serum tumor marker, in particularCA-125, false elevation in the presence of circulating RFs.However, none of the patients appear to develop cancer afteradequate follow-up. It is expected that future studies shouldattempt to develop methods eliminating RF binding. 522 STUDY OF CYTOKINES BYSTANDER SIGNALLINGIN HUMAN GLIOBLASTOMA CELLS AFTEREXPOSURE TO GAMMA L. Mariotti2,3, A. 1Department of Animal Biology, University of Pavia; 2Department of Nuclear and Theoretical Physics, University of Pavia; 3INFN Pavia, Italy Radiation-induced bystander effect is defined as the induction of biological effects in cells that are not directlytraversed by radiation but are receiving signals from theirradiated cells that are in close proximity to them. Althoughthe bystander effects have been well described over the pastdecade, the precise mechanisms of the process remainunclear. Soluble extracellular factors which are releasedfrom irradiated cells are involved in bystander responses andin particular cytokines are considered to be good candidatesfor signalling between irradiated and non-irradiated cells.The aim of this study was to investigate the modulation ofintercellular communication, mainly mediated by alterationof cytokine release into the culture medium and of itsreceptor expression in human glioblastoma cells (T98G)after exposure to gamma radiation. For this purpose, weused the ELISA technique to characterize the time-anddose-dependence of concentration of IL6, IL8 and TGF inthe culture medium of sham irradiated and irradiated cells.In parallel, the expression of the corresponding cellmembrane receptors was evaluated by immunocyto-chemistry both in irradiated glioma cells and in cellscultured with medium collected and filtered from irradiatedcultures. The results suggest that gamma radiation affectsthe release kinetic of cytokines, each with particularfeatures, from irradiated cells and the receptor profiles inirradiated and bystander cells.

Eachyear in Europe about 45,000 deaths are caused by kidneycancer. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common (80-85%) primary cancer of the kidney and 40% of patients withclinically localized RCC develop local recurrence or metastaticdisease. Current research projects cover genetic and proteinexpression profile of various histological subtypes, as well asmolecular profiling (prognostic and predictive) of individualtumors aimed for patient selection. Hence, to tailor thediagnosis for future tailoring of the treatment is one of the maingoals. Moreover, the increase in detection of small (<4 cm)tumors incidentally identified in asymptomatic patients with aDSS of 95% raises the question of the real aggressiveness ofsmall renal tumors. The main histotypes of RCC will bepresented as well as the role of immunohistochemistry. The anatomical prognostic factors encompass: 1) Tumor size: key component of the TNM staging system, remains one of themost important prognostic factors (4 cm: threshold for partialnephrectomy); 2) Perinephric/sinus fat involvement: portends aworse prognosis, but renal sinus fat involvement is associatedwith sarcomatoid differentiation and a higher risk of pT3a/M1: clear);4) Venous extention (RV or IVC): high risk 5) poor prognosis; 7)Number of metastatic sites, rather than actual location, Metachronous metastases a 4) Tumor necrosis; 5) Collecting systeminvasion; 6) Microvascular invasion. Weak points of each ofthese factors will be discussed briefly. Molecular abnormalities in RCC involve proliferation, survival and tumour angiogenesis. Alterations in the VHL gene are the most common genetic abnormalities in RCC and leadto increased angiogenesis. The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway isactivated by signalling through multiple cell surface receptors,leading to increased cell proliferation and survival. Thephosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway includessequential activation of several kinases and is also involved insignalling through many growth factor receptors. Activation ofthe PI3K pathway also leads to increased cell survival. Mutation of the VHL gene is a common genetic change that leads to RCC. Inactivation of VHL leads to dysregulation of the VEGF pathway. As a consequence of VHL gene mutation, the VHL gene product complex is disrupted and does not bind to HIF, allowing accumulation of HIF1-a and HIF2-a. Thisresults in the transforming growth factor-alpha 4. These factors act toinduce whose pathologic basis will be discussed,endothelial cell stabilisation, autocrine growth stimulation andorgan-specific metastasis. 524 NEW A VENUES FOR CANCER RESEARCH FROM PROTEIN NANOCRYSTALLOGRAPHY Eugenia PechkovaNanoworld Institute University of SS.Apostoli 66, 00100 Rome, Italy As a result of cooperation between the Nanoworld Institute and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble,after the initial discovery of the atomic structure of humankinase CK2alpha (1-4) we have introduced new furtherdevelopments in protein nanocrystallography, appearing tohave profound potential impact in cancer research (5-9). First of all, new details in protein crystal topography appear evident in conjuction also with AFM experimentations. Theobtained images point to the existence of clear domains in thecrystal 3D organization, quite pronounced and different in sizeand number between the classical protein crystals and thecrystals grown by LB (Langmuir-Blodgett) proteinnanotemplate. This result is furthermore in perfect accordancewith that obtained by laser cutting of the correspondingprotein crystals down to the nanosize and along the crystaldomains. X-ray diffraction with highly focused synchrotronradiation down to 500 nm diameter strikingly provides uniqueand detailed atomic structure information in proteinmicrocrystals down to the submicron size in several modelsystems, opening new avenues in protein crystallography. With radiation damage being the most critical issue for protein structure determination under the intense synchrotronradiation, LB crystals were indeed confirmed as the moststable to radiation damage in a wide range of model systems.Crystals grown by nanotemplate still diffract at goodresolution even after several steps of X-ray \"burning\", whilethe classic crystals decay very quickly at the same exposure.Finally due to this encouraging result, the LB method has alsobeen successfully adapted to the EMBL advanced roboticssystem for protein crystallography and to the study of yetunsolved protein systems such as ribosomal proteins.

Several studies have shown that theincidence and mortality rates of intrahepatic CC are rising, andthose of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are declininginternationally (1). To date, radical surgery is the only therapyoffering a potential cure for CC patients, whose prognosis isgenerally poor with survival limited to few months (2). Atpresent, the lack of a sensitive and specific early diagnosticmarker is an important reason why CC has a fairly latepresentation. CC is classified according to its anatomiclocation into intrahepatic and extrahepatic, and, according toWHO classification, the term CC is used exclusively forcarcinomas of intrahepatic origin, while tumors should be considered extrahepaticbile duct carcinomas (3). Recently the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan divided intrahepatic CC into three morphological types: mass-forming (MF), periductal infiltrating (PI) and intraductalgrowth (IG) (4). MF type is characterized by the presenceof a spherical mass with a distinct border in the liverparenchyma, PI type presents tumor infiltration along thebile duct, occasionally involving the surrounding blood vessels and/or hepatic parenchyma, IG is characterized bypapillary and/or granular growth into the bile duct lumen.PI type of CC presents a significantly higher frequence ofperineural invasion, lymph node metastasis and extrahepaticrecurrence than the MF type (5). The 5-year survival ratesof patients with IG tumors or with MF tumors issignificantly better than those of patients with MF plus PItumors PI type alone (6). Extrahepatic CC can further be subdivided into four types based on its location according to the Bismuth classification:type I, tumor involves the common hepatic duct distal to thebiliary confluence; type II, tumor the biliary duct; plus the left hepatic duct; type IV ,multifocal or tumor involves the confluence and both the rightand left hepatic ducts (7). Although the entire biliary tree is at risk, tumors involving the bifurcation of the hepatic duct (Klatskin tumors) are themost common and account for 40% to 60% of all cases (8).Hilar cholangiocarcinoma as a specific entity was firstdescribed by Klatskin in 1965 and it has a PI type growth.Hilar invasive-type cholangiocarcinomas have been the sclerosing or PI type is themost common. Our aim was to find a sensitive and specific marker which could be detected in patient serum and be correlated with thetumor burden. Boonla C et al. (9) recently showed that MUC5AC mucin is present in significant concentrations inserum from patients with CC. MUC5AC is a secretory mucinnormally expressed by the surface mucous cells of the humanstomach and in the bronchial tract. In a recent report (10),MUC5AC resulted significantly correlated with neuralinvasion and advanced CC investigated MUC5AC in intrahepatic CC and extrahepatic CC and found that it has a different expressiondepending on the type of growth in PI type, MF type and PIplus MF type. Our results suggest that MUC5AC is a specificprognostic marker and these three morphological type of CChave different immunophenotypes. Moreover MUC5AC issignificantly a more pattern perineural invasion. MUC5AC is expressed in severebiliary epithelial dysplasia, so if it could be part of acarcinogenetic pathway should be investigated. Moreover, ourresults also suggest that both intrahepatic PI type andextrahepatic CC are probably the same pathology but arise indifferent locations. Further studies are needed to understand ifthis different expression may be an epiphenomenon ofdifferent carcinogenetic patterns between PI type and MF typeof CC.

In addition, 1,25(OH) 2D3 potentiates the effects of many antitumour agents. Platinumdrugs are commonly used as anticancer agents. Thedevelopment of new platinum-based agents and clinicalcombination studies has resulted in a growing interest ofplatinum-based cancer chemotherapy. These drugs act by thealkylation of DNA forming platinum-DNA adducts, leading tothe interruption of essential cellular processes, and ultimately to cell death viaactivation of apoptotic pathways associated with DNA damage. Aim and Methods: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of 1,25(OH) 2D3on the sensitivity of human colon (SW480-ADH and HCT116) and lung (A549)cancer cells to oxaliplatin and cisplatin, which are respectivelyused in the clinic against these neoplasias. Global DNA damagewas evaluated using the comet assay. The expression andlocalization of two DNA damage markers (H2AX and 53bp1)were studied by immunofluorescence. We performed cellproliferation and viability assays using different drugconcentrations to calculate the IC 50. Known 1,25(OH)2D3target genes (E-cadherin, p21CYP21, c-MYC) and two apoptosis markers (PARP and active caspase-3) were evaluated byWestern Blotting (WB). We also performed flow cytometryanalysis to study the putative effect of 1,25(OH) 2D3, oxaliplatin, and their combination on the cell cycle. Results: We observed that 1,25(OH)2D3moderately increased DNA damage caused by oxaliplatin (20 M) in SW480-ADH cells (% tail DNA -vehicle = 4.6\u00b11.7 vs. 1,25(OH) 2D3= 3.0\u00b11.2; p<0.001). According andTalalay using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO),1,25(OH) 2D3Pre-treatment slightly increased sensitivity of SW480-ADH cells to oxaliplatin (IC50vehicle vs. 1,25(OH)2D3 = 1.3 vs. 0.8 M) and of A549 cells to cisplatin (IC50=8.9 vs. 4.4 M). However, 1,25(OH)2D3increased the survival of SW480-ADH cells treated with oxaliplatin at concentrations of20 and 30 M (% cells = 13.4\u00b11.4 vs. 21.4\u00b11.5 and 10.8\u00b10.3 vs. 15.9\u00b10.8, respectively). No differences were observed for HCT116 cells. 1,25(OH) 2D3did not change the expression and/or localization of the studied proteins by WB orimmunofluorescence. In SW480-ADH cells, pre-treatment with1,25(OH) 2D3diminished apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin (10 and 20 M), as observed by a reduction in the sub-G1 fractionin flow cytometry analysis (% cells = 10.5 vs. 2.7 and 12.8 vs. 7.2, respectively). Conclusion: 1,25(OH) 2D3Treatment slightly increased global DNA damage and the sensitivity of SW480-ADH and A549 cells to oxaliplatin (10-30 M)1,25(OH) 2D3increased survival of SW480-ADH cells. Altogether, these findings show that 1,25(OH)2D3may modulate the action of platinum anticancer drugs in humancancer cells, which merits further investigation. 527 and Helen Papadaki Department of Medicine, University of Patras, Patras, 26500, GreeceANTICANCER of the Wnt signalling pathway, regulating cell growth/survival. Activationof this pathway is caused mainly by mutations that stabilize-catenin, allowing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm, thentranslocate to the nucleus and activate genes such as survivinand cyclin-D1. Survivin belongs to the inhibitors of apoptosisand current studies suggest its implication in both control ofapoptosis and regulation of cell division. Cyclin-D1 is aregulator of G1/S-phase progression and its overexpression islinked to the development and progression of cancer. Aim: The investigation of the correlation between -catenin, survivinand human - and cyclin-D1 was performed in 69 cases ofHCC and adjacent normal liver tissue. Results: Normal liver showed diffuse membranous staining of -catenin inhepatocytes. In contrast, cytoplasmic and -catenin was found in 42 (60.9%) and 33(47.8%) out of 69 HCCs respectively. Loss of (76.8%) HCCs tumors showed moderatemembranous staining. In normal liver, survivin and cyclin-D1 was detected. Activation of -cateninwas observed in our cases of HCC, while loss of membranousstaining probably implies its role in tumor invasion. Thenuclear localization of survivin and cyclin-D1 in tumor cellsreflects their role in cell proliferation. In our study we failed tofind an association between expression of -catenin withsurvivin and cyclin-D1. The fact that overexpression not correlate with survivin and cyclin-D1, probablysuggests that another pathway works in humanhepatocarcinogenesis. 528 MULTIPLE CELLULAR MECHANISMS INPROSTATE CANCER Liao Persson Division of Experimental Cancer Research, Department ofLaboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, LundUniversity, University Hospital, 205 02 Malm\u00f6, Sweden Once prostate cancer becomes hormone refractory, cancer cells may rapidly gain the ability to invade and to metastasizeto lymph nodes and distant organs. The progression throughhormone-dependent to hormone-refractory and metastatic prostate cancer is poorly understood. Cyclin A1 is a cell cycleregulator that has been implicated in the progression ofprostate cancer. We assessed protein and mRNA expression ofcyclin endothelial and MMP-9 in primary malignanttumor and adjacent benign prostate tissue samples from 482prostate cancer patients. Prostate cancer samples had significantly higher cyclin A1 protein and mRNA expression than adjacent benign tissues.There was a significant correlation between expression ofcyclin A1 and that of MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF, whichhave previously been found to influence cancer cellinvasiveness. In addition, the effects of altered cyclin A1expression in PC3 prostate cancer cells were studied via transient transfection and viral vector infection.Overexpression of cyclin A1 in PC3 prostate cancer cells waslinked increased invasiveness, whereas inhibition of cyclinA1 expression viashort hairpin RNA expression led to a reduction of invasiveness. We further tested the impact ofincreased cyclin A1 expression in tumor invasion andmetastasis in a mouse model of prostate cancer. We found that80% of mice carrying PC3 cells overexpressing cyclin A1 hadlymph node, liver, and lung infiltration, whereas all mice withtumors expressing control vector were free of liver and lungmetastases and only one had lymph node metastases. Inconcert with androgen receptor, cyclin A1 increased VEGFand MMP2 promoter expression. Our results suggest thatprostate cancer invasion is promoted by cyclin A1 viathe alteration of the expression of specific signalling proteins andextracellular proteins. Furthermore, our findings that cyclinA1 regulates the expression of a growth factor signalingmolecule (VEGF) and extracellular proteases (MMPs) andpromotes and uPA(urokinase-type plasminogen activator)suggest that cyclin A1 may be key of tumorinvasion and metastasis.

For that reason we neednew tests with better parameters. PCA3 is a prostate-specificnon-coding mRNA that is highly over-expressed in prostatetumor cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate thediagnostic potential of PCA3 for PCa diagnosis. Materials and Methods: We examined altogether 199 patients. In the group of patients with suspicion of PCa we collected one tissuespecimen core for PCA3 expression examination. Accordingto the histologically verification patients had benignprostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 12 patients prostaticintraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and 84 patients prostate cancer.Total RNA was isolated and PCA3 and PSA expressionquantified using Q RT PCR method. The PCA3/PSA mRNAratio distribution was determined for both subject groups. Theassess the ability of the PCA3 assay to predict biopsyoutcome, the % biopsy positive was determined for differentPCA3/PSA ratio ranges and PCA3 Ct. Results: In our study, the fraction of specimens yielding sufficient RNA for RT PCRanalysis was only 75%. It was found that the levels of mRNAexpression of PCA3 (Ct) were significantly higher ( p<0.045) in patients with prostate cancer than in patients with benignprostatic hyperplasia. We found also statistically significantdifferences in the levels of mRNA expression of PCA3 (Ct)between patients with benign PCA3 assay for prostate cancer seems to be useful for early detection of prostate cancerand also for differential diagnosis between patients with BPHand patients with prostate cancer.Supported by the grant IGA NR/8918-3 and the researchproject VZ MSM 0021620819. 530 CALCIUM, VITAMIN AND William B. Grant2and Heide (SUNARC), P.O. Box 641603, San Francisco, CA 94164-1603, USA A low vitamin D status and inadequate calcium intake are important risk factors for various types of cancer. Ecologicalstudies using solar UV-B exposure as an index of vitamin D 3 photoproduction in the skin found a highly significant inverseassociation between UV-B and mortality in fifteen types ofcancer. Of these, colon, rectal, breast, gastric, endometrial,renal and ovarian cancers exhibit a significant inverserelationship between incidence and oral intake of calcium. Inaddition, lung and endometrial cancer as well as multiple myeloma are considered calcium- and vitamin D-sensitive.Studies on tissue-specific expression the CYP27B1 -encoded 25-hdroxyvitamin D-1-hydroxylase and of the extracellularcalcium-sensing receptor (CaR) have led to an understandingof how locally produced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3(1,25- (OH)2D3) and extracellular Ca++act jointly as key regulators of cellular proliferation, differentiation and function. Thus,impairment of anti-mitogenic, pro-apoptotic and pro-differentiating signaling from the 1,25-(OH) 2D3-activated vitamin D receptor (VDR) and from the CaR in vitamin D andcalcium insufficiency has been implicated in the pathogenesisof the aforementioned types of cancer. 1,25-(OH) 2D3and calcium interact in modulating cell growth in different ways:(i) Signaling pathways from the VDR and the CaR convergeon the same downstream elements, e.g.of canonical Wnt pathway; (ii) high extracellular calcium modulates extra-renalvitamin D in favor of higher local steady-stateconcentrations of 1,25(OH) 2D3; (iii) 1,25(OH)2D3may up- regulate expression of the CaR and thus augment CaR-mediated anti-proliferative responses to high extracellularCa 2+. This can explain why combined supplementation is required for optimal chemoprevention of cancer by calciumand vitamin D. 531 CELLS AND TUMORANGIOGENESIS S.O. , T. Seifert, C. Huber, P. Stoelting H\u00e4matologie/Onkologie, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum S.-H.- Luebeck, Germany Endothelial cell linings in the vessels of most tumors largely derive from non-malignant circulating progenitor cells.Autologous somatic endothelial precursors, procured bymarrow aspiration or apheresis, may be used to introducetherapeutic principles into tumors. We have studied endothelial development in cultured E14 murine embryonic stem cells (ECS), which provide a uniquehomogeneous cell system for studying early vasculogenic celldifferentiation in vitro , and mapped the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on these cells (Seifert T,Peters SO et al. Differentiation, 2008). After removal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) a high proportion (36percent) of undifferentiated state ESCs show positivity ofcharacteristic endothelial differentiation patterns in embryoidbodies (EB) kept in culture for up to 30 days in differentiationculture medium, with or without supplemental VEGF.Directly after preculture and at day two in unsupplementedculture ELISA analysis showed no endogenous VEGF,ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3444therafter VEGF levels rise. Early vasculogenic development and expression of selected genes were characterized usingflow cytometry for specific antigens and quantitative RT-PCR. VEGF supplementation lead to qualitative EB vessels, activation of vasculogenesis-relatedgenes (CD31, CD144 and and temporarydownregulation of the VEGF receptor gene flk-1. VEGFsupplementation did not produce measurable changes in theendothelial cell fractions as judged by surface antigenpresence. This shows that that early ESCs may undergoendothelial differentiation through VEGF-independentpathways, whereas endothelial cell patterns in EBs arecytokine-dependent and fully stimulated by endogenouscytokine levels. Studies to characterize these pathways inembryonic and adult systems are underway. Translation ofthese results may enable us to manipulate adultheamangioblasts for tumor angiogenesis. Another line of studies showed that JC and WEHI tumors transplanted into female mice displaying complete marrowchimerism, after receiving male bone marrow cells can serveas a murine experimental model to study manipulated andcultured endothelial precursors in vitro (Stoelting, Peters SO et al. Anticancer Research 2008). Using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of adjacent cuts of the tumors,assigning CD31 and Y-chromosomes as markers gender originof the perivascular endothelial cells can be determined. Highproportions of male cells can be found in the perivascularendothelial cell linings of JC (60\u00b14%) and WEHI (67\u00b14%)tumors after implantation into normal male mice and inmarrow chimeric female mice. This model allows for the studyof in vitro treated marrow on tumorangiogenesis. We also explore the potential of (PR3), which is responsible for a chronic vasculitis of small blood vessels in case ofWegener's Granulomatosis, to provoke inflammatory reactionswithin tumors. Others have shown that both overexpression ofPR3 respectively it's subunit PR1 generate a neutrophilicinflammation In blood stem cells of patients suffering fromchronic myeoloid leukemia. We isolated and introduced a pre-pro-form of PR3 into a pTracer -SV40 plasmid experiments using human embryonic kidney cellline HEK-293, which was established from a human primaryembryonal kidney transformed by adenovirus type 5 (Ad 5),using Nanofectin transfection kits (PAA) we observedtransfection efficiency (rates) 85% after 14days judged by fluorescence-microscopical registration ofGFP-including cells. For transfections of CD 133 positiveprogenitor cells obtained after apheresis of peripheral bloodstem cells mobilized after chemotherapy and G-CSFstimulation, we used the Amaxa Nucleofector device using anAmaxa programm. Here we observed GFP positivity in 60-70% of the viable cells after ten days in 3 differentexperiments. Analysis of the expression of plasmid-carriedproteins is currently under way. We conclude that a pre-pro-form of PR3 may be transfected into HEK cells and CD133 positive precursors. 532 ESTABLISHMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OFTHREE NOVEL CELL University of Graz, of Human Genetics, Medical University of Graz, Graz; 3Core Unit of Biomedical Research, Division of Laboratory Animal Science and Genetics, University of Vienna,Himberg; 4Research Institute for Electron Microscopy and Fine Structure Research, Technical University of Graz, Graz; 5Department of Pathology, Medical University of Graz, Graz; 6Medgen.at, Vienna; 7Department of Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria Carcinoids are uncommon neoplasms derived from enterochromaffin (EC) cells of the neural crest. They havemalignant potential and their incidence is steadily increasing.The only curative treatment option is surgery. We have focusedon cultivation of these human neuroendocrine tumors (NET)as the most relevant models for the study of potential modesof therapy. Only few cell lines from human carcinoids havebeen established so far, among them our earlier established cellline, KRJ-I (1). The reason for the rare success in establishingcarcinoid-cultures is due to the small amount of tissue availableand the low mitotic activity in primary cultures. We havesuccessfully established three continuously growing cell linesfrom tissue obtained from a metastatic human carcinoid of theterminal ileum: P-STS was derived from the primary tumor, L-STS from a lymph node metastasis, and H-STS from a livermetastasis. Immunocytochemical characterization proved themaintenance of characteristic neuroendocrine properties. Theultrastructure of the cells demonstrated the presence ofneuroendocrine granules in the cytoplasm. Transplantation ofthe cell lines into SCID-mice proved their tumorigenicity.Cytogenetic analyses were done and mutation screening of P-STS excluded a MEN1 -gene-associated genetic predisposition. Our data delineate the novel cell lines P-STS, L-STS and H-STS as neoplastic EC cell lines and demonstrate their utility asin vitro - and in vivo- models of small intestine carcinoids. 1 Pfragner R et al: Int J Oncol 8: 513-520, 1996.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3445533 GAL3BP REGULATES D'Annunzio\", University Italy Background: 90K/Mac-2 secreted glycoprotein originally identified in the supernatant of a breast cancer cellline (1). High serum and tumor tissue levels of the proteinare associated with a shorter survival and a reduced responseto chemotherapy in patients with different types ofmalignancy (2-6). Although the role of 90K/Mac-2 BP is notfully understood, it plays an important role in cell-cell andcell-extracellular matrix adhesive processes thanks to itsbinding to galectin1, -3 and -7 (2) and to several proteins ofthe extracellular matrix like collagens, fibronectin andnidogen (7). However, it is still not clear how the pro-adhesive features of 90K/Mac-2 BP affect tumor growth andprogression. To address this issue, we generated andcharacterized a 90K/Mac-2 BP knocked-down clone ofMDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line. Methods and Results: A stably 90K/Mac-2 BP silenced clone of MDA- MB-231 was obtained by siRNA. The level of expression of90K/Mac-2 BP, evaluated at the mRNA and protein level byReal time PCReaction and ELISA respectively, was reducedby about 80% as compared to the mock transfected cells. Ascompared to controls, silenced cells showed no significantdifferences in terms of doubling time, indicating that90K/Mac-2 BP is not involved in cell proliferation; on theother hand, silenced cells exhibited a xenografted in nude mice did not differ fromcontrols in terms of growth rate, but produced a significantlyhigher number of lung metastases. Although preliminary,these data seems to indicate 90k/MAC-2 BP as an importantmolecule involved in tumor dissemination at least in breastcancer.1 Koths K, Taylor E, Halenbeck R, Casipit C and Wang A: Cloning and characterization of a human Mac-2-bindingprotein, a new member of the superfamily defined by themacrophage scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain, J N, Rubistein M and Schlessinger J: Purification andcharacterization of a 90 kDa protein released humantumors and tumor cell lines FEBS 319: (Mac-2 BP) correlates with distant metastasis andpredicts survival in stage I non-small cell lung cancerpatients.

Paderewskiego 4, 93-509 Lodz, Poland Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is a standard care in patients with breast cancer and patients with skin melanoma. Apart from useof SNB in our everyday clinical practice, in the Departmentof Surgical Oncology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland,numerous studies on special aspects of sentinel node biopsyprocedure were conducted. In these studies, authors werefocused mainly on (1) safety of medical staff, performingSNB; (2) possibility of the use of imprint touch cytology inassessment of SNB status in (3) ex vivo use of SNB technique; and (4) the use of SNB technique in special clinical situations. In order to assess the safety of medical staff performing SNB in patients with breast cancer and in patients with skinmelanoma, authors measured the absorbed doses of radiationto the hands of medical staff. During lymphoscintigraphy andduring surgical procedure on different parts of hands ofmedical staff, a total of 57 highly sensitive thermoluminescentdosimeters were placed. Altogether, 2065 measurements wereperformed during 35 procedures. The results revealed that themaximum recorded dose during the study was 1900 timessmaller than the current one-year dose limit recommended bythe International Commission on Radiological Protection. To assess whether the reliability of imprint touch cytologyANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3446(ITC) of sentinel nodes in skin melanoma patients allows intraoperative decisions to be made regarding simultaneousradical lymphadenectomy we performed a study on 148sentinel nodes removed from 85 skin melanoma patients. Wefound that ITC of sentinel nodes is a reliable method. The riskof overtreatment due to false-positive results of ITC of sentinelnode was absent in our study. We performed ex vivo blue-dye SN mapping in postmastectomy specimens to assess whether mainlymphatic tract leading from periareolar plexus to SN iscompletely removed during mastectomy. We assumed that ex vivo identification of SN may be possible only if entire lymphatic tract leading to sentinel node is removed within thepostmastectomy specimen. Our experiment revealed that theuse of transverse skin incision during modified radicalmastectomy may not be a best choice for breast cancerpatients; when the transverse incision was used, we were ableto identify sentinel nodes only in 31% of cases. We considered the use of SNB in a patient with five synchronous primary skin melanomas, a special clinicalsituation. The patient underwent excisions of all five primarytumors along with five simultaneous sentinel node biopsies.We successfully identified lymph flow from all skin areas tothree different lymph node basins and successfully retrievedsix sentinel nodes from these basins. In our opinion, this caseillustrates that performing multiple sentinel node biopsies inpatients with multiple primary skin melanoma is possible. 535 BRAIN METASTASES IN OV ARIAN and Jalid and Obstetrics, Division Virchow Klinikum,University Medicine of Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1,13353 Berlin, Germany Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality in the field of gynecologic oncology. Central nervous system (CNS)involvement however is rare in presentation and seems to beassociated with a very poor prognosis. Clinical as well asautopsy studies in the last decades have confirmed the rarity ofoccurrence of brain metastases in ovarian cancer, but severalauthors have recently observed a sharp rise in incidence. Whilemost authors attribute this increase of CNS involvement toprolonged survival achieved through advances inchemotherapy and surgical management, others see it resultingfrom improved imaging or chemotherapeutic impairment ofthe blood-brain barrier. Brain metastases from ovarian cancercan present with a panel of often unspecific symptoms whichusually results in a late diagnosis of CNS relapse, sincecerebral imaging is not part of the routine follow-up. Even serum-CA-125 levels, a valuable tool in predicting recurrenceof distant disease, was shown to be incapable of reliabledetection in regard to metastatic brain manifestation, leavingthe clinician with the need for close patient observation forneurological symptoms in order to diagnose brain metastasis atan early stage. While some reports only indicate the presenceof extracranial disease at CNS relapse and time from diagnosisof ovarian cancer to development of brain metastases asprognostic factors for survival, other studies demonstrate thenegative impact of multiple cerebral lesions on survival, whencompared to single brain metastases. Though great efforts havebeen made to develop multimodal therapeutic strategies tochallenge the rising incidence of brain metastasis in ovariancancer, CNS involvement is still related with a very poorprognosis. It was shown that a multi-modal approach,combining surgical resection with radiation therapy and evenchemotherapy promises the best prolongation of survival anddid result in long-term remissions in a few cases. But thisaggressive strategy is not applicable to all patients, often dueto overall status or inaccessibility of brain metastases to theneurosurgical approach. In these cases stereotactic radiationtherapy or gamma-knife-surgery is recommended by manyauthors to remove single metastatic brain lesions. Thesetechniques should be further discussed as an alternative forwhole-brain radiation therapy, as several studies expand its useto other indications such as multiple lesions and withpromising results. Based on our large multicenter studyincluding 73 patients with brain metastases from ovariancancer, we will discuss predictive and prognostic factors aswell the current best treatment. 536 EXPLOITATION OF THE BIOLOGICAL FEATURESOF BRAIN TUMOURS IN PURSUIT OF NEWTHERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES: IN VITRO STUDIES Geoffrey J. Pilkington , Samantha A. Murray, Samantha Higgins, Kathryn Fry, Laura Donovan, Suzanne Birks, Zaynah Maherally and Naif Alsiweheri Cellular and Molecular Neuro-oncology Group, Cellular and Molecular Medicine Research Division, Institute ofBiomedical and Biomolecular Sciences, School of Pharmacyand Biomedical Sciences, University of Portsmouth, StMichael's Building, White Swan Road, Portsmouth PO12DT, UK Primary, malignant brain tumours are among the most therapeutically-resistant of all cancer. This resistance is aconsequence of the unique biological properties whichcharacterise them. The blood-brain barrier (B-BB) poses aspecific obstacle to chemotherapy, while neoplastic glial cellsare particularly efficient at repairing DNA damage breaksAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3447caused by both chemo- and radiotherapy. In addition, the ability of glioma cells to diffusely invade the contiguousnormal brain adds to this resistance. During invasion, tumourcells transiently arrest from the cell cycle, rendering themrefractory to radiotherapy. Moreover, while certain cytotoxicdrugs can reach the major tumour mass by virtue ofdisruptions of the B-BB, cells which have invaded deep intothe brain are protected from them since they are invested inregions of intact B-BB. Tumour resistance is also thought tobe facilitated by the existence of small populations of self-renewing stem cell-like cancer cells (SC-LCS) within glialtumours. There is increasing evidence that this population ofcells are also highly migratory and thus may contribute to bothresistance and local dissemination. To contribute to thecomplexity surrounding neurological tumours, in addition toprimary brain tumours, the brain is a fertile site for the growthof secondary tumours, indeed up to a quarter of all tumourswill spread to the central nervous system at some stage. In order to study this complex biological picture we have established - from human cells and under human serumsupplementation conditions - three-dimensional live cellmodel systems of both tumour invasion and the B-BB (forstudies on cancer cell metastasis to the brain). We have alsosegregated CD133-positive SC-LCSs by use of AutoMACSimmunobead separation from early passage, biopsy-derivedglioblastoma and studied their complex behaviour, lineageproperties and response to microenvironmental factors. Wehave used these cells and the above models to investigate fourputative therapeutic targets: CD155 (poliovirus chondroitinsulphate proteoglycan), which may provide a means of eitherselectively killing tumour cells or inhibiting their invasiveproperties. We have also examined the tumour cellmitochondrion as a possible target for enhanced therapeuticeffect by way of tricyclic drug mediated apoptosis. We believethat each of these approaches may carry potential for futureclinical studies. 537 EPIDEMIOLOGY OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY AND CANCER MORTALITY Stefan PilzDepartment of Internal Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and Nuclear Medicine, Medical University of Graz,Auenbruggerplatz 15, 8036 Graz, Austria There is growing evidence that vitamin D exerts anticarcinogenic effects. Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation,which is required for vitamin D production in the skin, wasfound to be inversely associated with cancer incidence andmortality. Recent studies have largely but not consistentlyshown that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels, which are considered to be the best indicator of vitamin Dstatus, are a significant risk factor for cancer mortality.Circulating 25(OH)D levels were also associated withimproved overall survival in colorectal and lung cancerpatients and vitamin D deficiency was observed in patientswith autoimmune, infectious and cardiovascular diseases.Significant seasonal variations in 25(OH)D levels and theassociation of vitamin D deficiency with reduced physicalactivity are, however, possible sources of confounding inepidemiological studies. Randomized controlled trials aretherefore urgently needed to evaluate whether vitamin Dsupplementation reduces cancer incidence and mortality. Theoptimal 25(OH)D levels for human health, that should beachieved by vitamin D supplementation, still remain to beelucidated but there exists a wide consensus that every adultshould have 25(OH)D levels of at least 30 ng/ml. 538 CHARACTERIZATION OF NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER USING 3Thoracic Surgery and 4Clinical Genetics at Lund University Hospital, Sweden Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world and, although diagnostics and therapeutics have improvedduring the past two decades, the overall 5-year survival rate isstill below 15%. Eighty percent of all lung cancer is of thenon-small cell type (NSCLC) and of these, about one fourthare stage I-IIIA tumors and thus accessible for surgery. The 5-year survival after successful resection is approximately 50%,but the outcome is heterogeneous, even within the sameclinicopathological stage. Development of new techniques in molecular biology, such as efficient characterization of tumors at the gene level withsubsequent correlations to diagnostics and prognostics, istherefore of great importance. However, our knowledge ofgenomic imbalances in lung cancer and the oncogenicconsequences of these alterations are still limited. The use of whole-genome tiling resolution bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) microarrays allows forcharacterization of DNA copy number changes at a resolutiononly limited by the number of BAC clones used for the arrays.In the present study, 32,433 overlapping BAC clones coveringthe whole genome were used, implying that the tumor DNAcould be analyzed with an average resolution of 70 kbp. ThisANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3448is, to our knowledge, the first study using this approach on clinical specimens of primary lung cancer. Freshly frozenbiopsies of primary NSCLCs were obtained from patientsoperated in 1989-2003 at the Lund University Hospital,Sweden. In all, 62 early stage primary NSCLCs (48adenocarcinomas and 14 squamous cell carcinomas) wereprofiled to allow for subclassification, identification ofrecurrent changes, and search for candidate genes. Alterationswere observed in all chromosomes and the tumors displayedcomplex DNA copy number profiles with numerous gains andlosses. Frequent amplifications and homozygous deletionswere observed in regions harboring oncogenes and tumorsuppressor genes, respectively. Thus, the use of whole-genometiling resolution BAC microarrays is applicable foridentification of Immunology and 3Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA; 2Center for Molecular Medicine and Department of Biological Sciences, College of Sciences, Old DominionUniversity, Norfolk, V A and 4Department of Gynecologic Oncology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,USA Alpha/beta TCR+ T-cells recognize primarily peptides in association with self-MHC, whereas, most V1+ T-cellsrecognize whole proteins, and most V2+ recognizephosphoantigens, lipids, and other ligands, both in manner. We examined whether clonally expanded TCR+ T-cells are present in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes(TIL) and PBMC from patients with EOC. VI, VII, V1 andV2 TCR transcripts were amplified from TIL and PBMC bytwo sided V region subgroup specific PCR, followed bycloning and sequencing. Sequencing analysis revealed thepresence of substantial proportions of identical copies of VI(in 8 of 12 patients; 67%), VII (in 9 of 11 patients; 82%),V1 (in 6 of 6 patients; 100%), and V2 (in 4 of 7 patients;57%) TCR transcripts in TIL from patients with EOC. - and-chain TCR transcripts were also clonally expanded in thePBMC from patients with EOC (in all 3 patients examined). Incertain patients identical TCR transcripts were clonallyexpanded in both PBMC and TIL from the same patient.These - and -chain TCR clonal expansions were very strong and statistically significant. T-cells are comprised of a verylarge number of different T-cell clones, each expressing adifferent TCR. Because of their large numbers, the probabilityof finding by chance substantial proportions of individual TCRtranscripts in an independent sample of T-cells is negligible.The appearance of multiple identical copies of TCR transcriptsmust be the result of specific antigen-driven proliferation andclonal expansion of individual T-cell clones. Full length copiesof clonally expanded - transcripts wereconstructed by four-segment ligation expressed into beta-chainnegative mutant Jurkat T-cells (which stain positive with anti-granzyme B antibody) using a retroviral expression system.Expression of the TCR was determined using an anti-TCR mab. These transduced Jurkat T-cells (i) inducedapoptosis viacaspase-9 activation on ovarian tumor cells; and (ii) exhibited strong cytolytic activity against ovarian tumorcells. These results provide the basis for the development ofnew approaches for TCR+ T-cell immunotherapy. 540 COMBINATION IMMUNOTHERAPY:NEUTRALIZATION OF THE TUMOR ESCAPE ANDIMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE MECHANISMS MAY BEREQUIRED FOR CLINICALLY EFFECTIVE TUMORV ACCINES AND ADOPTIVE IMMUNOTHERAPYAPPROACHES (AN OVERVIEW) Chris D. PlatsoucasCenter for Molecular Medicine and Department of Biological Sciences, College of Sciences, Old DominionUniversity, Norfolk, V A, USA Tumor cells have been very appropriately called masters in disguise and deceit from detection and destruction by the cellsof the immune system. Tumors employ a variety ofmechanisms to achieve this purpose. These mechanisms arecollectively designated as tumor escape mechanisms and havebeen shown to be active in patients with a variety of cancers.Although substantial progress has been made in identifyingtumor antigens, in determining their molecular structure andcharacteristics and in developing tumor vaccines, they havebeen so far in general ineffective for the treatment of patientswith cancer. These cancer vaccines induced biologicalresponses in as many as 50% of the patients, but objectiveclinical responses in less than 4%. In contrast to cancervaccines, adoptive immunotherapy approaches, which involvethe transfer to the host of large numbers of in vitro grown activated autologous T-cells able to destroy the tumor, havebeen shown to be effective and induce objective clinicalresponses in 50-70% of patients with metastatic melanoma.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3449The effectiveness of both cancer vaccines and adoptive immunotherapy approaches is substantially hindered by tumorescape mechanisms, which include: (i) increased numbers andproportions of CD4+CD25+ immunoregulatory suppressor T-cells (Tregs) at the tumor site and the peripheral blood.Reduction of the Tregs in patients with cancer using ONTAKresulted in significantly increased responses to tumor vaccines.Extensive lymphodepletion is required for effective adoptiveimmunotherapy approaches, and may involve reduction ofTreg, and other tumor escape mechanisms (see below); (ii)increased numbers and proportions of tumor-associatedmacrophages/monocytes; (iii) production ofimmunosuppressive factors, such as TGF-beta and IL-10, bytumor cells and mononuclear cells (non-malignant cells)infiltrating the tumor or present in the peripheral blood; (iv)increased expression of cell surface molecules (PD-1 andCTLA-4) inhibitory of the effector function of co-stimulatory moleculeson tumor cells; (vi) downregulation of HLA class I expressionon the surface of the tumor cells. We believe that thesimultaneous neutralization of several of these complex andhighly effective tumor escape mechanisms is very likelyrequired for the development of clinically effective cancervaccines and for increasing the effectiveness of adoptiveimmunotherapy approaches. 541 THE PROMYELOCYTIC LEUKEMIA PROTEIN:FROM Tr. 17. listopadu 1790, 708 52 Ostrava 8; 2Institute of Pathology and Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Medical Faculty, Palacky University, Hnevotinska3, 775 15 Olomouc; 3Institute of Biology and Genetics, 2nd Medical Faculty of Charles University, V \u00davalu 84, 150 00 Prague-Motol; 4Institute of Biophysics, Palacky University, Hnevotinska 3, 775 15 Olomouc, Czech Republic The PML (promyelocytic leukemia) gene encodes a multifunctional protein involved in antiviral response,transcription control, induction of apoptosis, growth arrest,cellular senescence, and DNA damage repair. We have founddown-regulated PML protein expression in about one fifth ofcolon cancer and one third of breast cancer tissues. Breastcancer tissues from germline BRCA1 gene mutation carriers rarely down-regulate the PML protein, suggesting a functionalrelationship between the BRCA1 and PML proteins. There areseveral proteins both bound in PML nuclear domains andinvolved in the BRCA pathway activated in response to double-strand DNA damage. This also suggests there might befunctional association between these systems. This couldexplain why breakage of some proteins of the BRCA pathwayleads to an increased sensitivity to infections and also otherclinical aspects. We are going to present a hypothesis on theessence of potential cooperation between PML nucleardomains and the BRCA pathway and its possible biological,clinical and evolutionary consequences. We have studied the PML gene in patients with hereditary or familial breast and colon cancer, colon polyposis andstomach cancer in order to test a hypothesis that germlinePML gene mutations might predispose to cancer. We found a single nucleotide substitution in the alternatively spliced exon7b, c.1710+1355G>C (p.A570+232>P570+232) in about onethird of patients with colon cancer and/or colon polyposis andthe majority of patients with gastric cancer (the results werestatistically significant). We suggest a new hypothesis on thepathogenesis of these tumors. In conclusion, it is highly probable that an important interplay exists between PML nuclear domains and the BRCApathway. Germline carriers of the c.1710+1355G>Csubstitution in the alternatively spliced exon 7b of the PML gene are at an increased risk of gastrointestinal polyposis andcancer.

A characteristic property of malignantcells is their high rate of glycolysis. Normal cells depend onoxidative phosphorylation to synthesize ATP, but even in thepresence of oxygen, cancer cells exhibit an increased capacityfor lactate production. The enhanced rate of aerobic glycolysiscorrelates in general with the degree of malignancy. Althoughthe production of ATP viaaerobic glycolysis is inefficient, this selective adaptation may be a mechanism of survival for tumorcells under conditions of poor vascularization. Normal adult human red blood cells (RBC) generate energy almost exclusively through the metabolism of glucoseprimarily viathe Embden-Meyerhof pathway and the pentose phosphate shunt. These pathways produce the cellular energycrucial to RBC survival and maintenance of proper cellfunction. Malignant cells show an increased glucose uptake in vitro and in vivo . This process is thought to be mediated by Gluts, the human erythrocyte glucose transporter, theANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3450expression and activity of which is regulated by oncogenes and growth factors. In our previous work, we have describedthe new Re-Pt antitumor system, where cisplatin and clusterrhenium compounds were used against Guerin's carcinomadevelopment in rats. In this work, we present Glu levels andsome types of Hb in blood under influence of the Re-Ptsystem with the use of three rhenium substances. The following Cluster rhenium compounds (T8) cells. A single intraperitonealadministration of cisplatin at the dose of 8 mg/kg was madeon 9 day after the tumor inoculation. The intraperitonealadministration of the Re1-3 at the dose of 7 M/kg inliposome forms began on day 3 after the inoculation of thetumor cells and was repeated every 2 days until day 21.Concentrations of red blood cells and their morphologicalforms were measured. Fetal Hb (FHb) and glycosylated Hb(HbA1c) were by column liquid chromatography. Investigations of the Hb heterogeneity showed that in the blood of animals of T8 + cisplatin group the concentrationof HbA1c was much higher (up to 7%) than in the controlgroup (4.2-4.5%). In some cases, where the inhibition of thetumor by cisplatin was not so strong, we observed thepresence of FHb (0.3%), which was almost absent in theother groups. Higher level of HbAc1 is known to appear inRBC and plasma of the patients with some types of cancer.FHb is an established serological indicator of cancer.

Furtherinvestigation of Hb heterogeneity in this model may lead topropositions of markers for the effectiveness of anticancertherapy. 543 GAMMA-GLUTAMYLTRANSFERASE OF CANCERCELLS AT THE CROSSROADS OF REDOXREGULATION, TUMOR PROGRESSION, DRUGRESISTANCE AND DRUG TARGETING A. Pisa, Italy; 2Radiation and Oxidative Stress Group, Department of Cancer Studies and Molecular Medicine, University ofLeicester, UK; 3UNSW Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) is often significantly increased in human malignancies and its role in tumorprogression, invasion and drug resistance has been repeatedly suggested (Pompella et al : Curr Opin Pharmacol 7: 360, 2007). Previous studies have repeatedly documented a role ofGGT in cellular redox balance, through the production of alow but persistent oxidative stress (see e.g.Paolicchi et 2002). When overespressing cells were incubated in the presence of GGTsubstrates and a source of catalytic iron, increased levels ofDNA damage were observed (Comet assay). Thisphenomenon was suppressed by specific GGT inhibitors suchas ABBA, as well as by iron chelator DFO and antioxidantsBHT and Trolox C. Interestingly, higher levels of basal DNAdamage were observed in GGT-overexpressing cells ascompared to low-expressing ones. These results suggest thus arole of GGT expression per se in tumor progression. On the other hand, GGT has been implicated in cancer drug resistance as it participates in the reconstitution of cellularglutathione and related antioxidant/antitoxic defences.However, more complex effects of GGT expression can takeplace, both intra- and extracellularly. In fact the enzyme canplay as a factor both in drug resistance and drug sensitivity, asdocumented by the results of our latest studies: i) Theprotective of GGT against cisplatin with GGT-derived thiolmetabolites, leading to formation of adducts which are far lesscell permeable (Franzini et al: Eur J Cancer 42: 2623, 2006); ii) On the contrary, in the case of 4-[ N-(S-glutathionyl- acetyl)amino] phenylarsinous acid (GSAO) - a promising anti-angiogenic drug - cell membrane GGT activity acts as asensitizing factor. The gamma-glutamyl residue of GSAO isin fact cleaved the surface of GGT-expressing cells, thusproducing the metabolite GCAO. The latter is transportedacross the plasma membrane, and eventually reacts with itsmitochondrial targets (Dilda et al : 2008, manuscript submitted). This information can also explain GSAO kidneytoxicity at high doses: GGT is in fact expressed at high levelsin tubular epithelia; iii) Recent observations highlight NO andNO-donor agents ( e.g. S -nitroso-glutathione, GSNO) as chemosensitizing agents, capable of Des As GGT possesses the selective ability tometabolize GSNO - thus releasing its NO load - itsexpression may well be exploited to target NO to GGT-expressing tumor cells. We have investigated the kinetics ofGGT with respect to GSNO using our innovative fluorimetricmethod \u00aebased on copper decomposition of nitrosothiol metabolites and reaction of released NO with 4,5-diaminofluorescein (Angeli et al : Arch Biochem Biophys 2008, in press). The results indicate a K mof GGT for GSNO of ~0.4 mM, comparable with the Kmvalue for glutathione, which confirms the feasibility of using GSNO as an efficientpro-drug in order to perform selective NO treatment of GGT-Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3451expressing tumors. Future studies will substantiate the applicability and usefulness of such an approach to therapy. Supported by University of Pisa, Istituto Radiumhospitalet HF, Oslo; 2Department of Physics, Oslo University, Norway After Garland and Garland in 1980 reported that the mortality of colon cancer increases with increasing latitude andhypothesized that this may be explained by induction ofvitamin D by solar radiation, a large number of studies havebeen devoted to this association. Multiple approaches havebeen chosen, from ecological studies to randomized clinicaltrials. Eventhough some studies have shown no correlation,most of them support the concept that a good vitamin D statusis anticarcinogenic by either reducing the risk of developingcancer or preventing cancer progression. Our main finding isthat prognosis of a number of cancer forms in Norway isdependent on season of diagnosis. Generally, diagnosis insummer and autumn leads to the best prognosis. Most likely,this can be explained by the higher concentrations of vitaminD we observe in serum in summer and autumn than winterand spring. Solar ultraviolet radiation, UV , is believed tocontribute by up to 90% of the circulating levels of vitamin D,the rest being obtained from diet. Vitamin D, activated throughhydroxylations, has anti-cancer properties. Some of themolecular and genetic mechanisms behind its biologicalfunctions are known, while some remain unclear. The annualprevitamin D photosynthesis is larger in the southern part ofthe country than in the northern part. Due to climaticdifferences, the real sun exposure of people can be differentfrom the ambient ones. We investigated this by determiningthe incidence rates of squamous cell carcinoma, which arerelated to the real UV exposures. These are a factor of aboutthree larger in south than in north. Unexpectedly, there wereno significant differences in survival for different latitudes andannual UV exposures. This may be due to the 20% highervitamin D intake in North Norway than in South Norway. Wefound that over a larger range of latitudes (from Scandinavia toAustralia), the ratio of death rates to incidence rates (a crudemeasure of survival) decreases with decreasing latitude. Theepidemiological evidence together with the biologicalknowledge of the anticancer effects of vitamin D shouldprompt more studies aimed at defining an optimal vitamin Dstatus and the safest ways to achieve this. 545 CHROMOGRANIN A M. Prazakova , O. Topolcan, L. M. Pesek, M. Casova and J. Safranek Faculty Hospital and Medical School in Pilsen, E. Benese 13, 305 99 Plzen, Czech Republic Aim: To find out the rate of CgA serum level positivity in patiens with lung cancer, colorectal and prostate cancer.Materials and Methods: Serum levels of were assessed using immunoradiometric analysis (IRMA) with commerciallyavailable assay kit from Schering - CIS BioInternational(France). Groups of patients: i) Control group - 57 patientswith no history and no evidence of cancer disease at the timeof serum examination; ii) Patients with malignant disease ofthe lung (I-III stage) - 90 patients at the time of primarydiagnosis (prior to any treatment) 112 patients with non smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC) during follow-up; iii) Patients withcarcinoid tumor - 18 patients; iv) Patients with prostatecancer; v) Patients with non-tumor disease - renal failure,chronic liver failure. Results: The group of patients with lung cancer had significantly higher serum levels of CgA incomparison to the control group (p 0,001). Serum values ofCgA in patients with progression were significantly higherthan those in patients with remission and in the control group,we did not observe any statistically significant differencebetween the control group and the group of patients incomplete remission. During the follow-up period, remissionvalues were significantly different from levels examined at thetime of primary diagnosis (p 0.001) and from the values ofCgA in patients with progressive disease (p 0.001). CgAserum levels were elevated above cut-off levels in 56% with SCLC, 43% of patients with non-small cell lungcancer and in more than 80% of patients with carcinoidtumors. CgA serum level changes correlated with therapyeffect, as demonstrated in several case reports. False highervalues of CgA could be seen in patients with chronical liverfailure and renal failure. It appears that chromogranin valuescorrelate with prognosis in the case of prostate cancer,colorectal cancer and breast cancer. Conclusion: Chromogranin A serum levels could be used in the diagnosisof lung cancer of a neuroendocrine character. Based on thisstudy, CgA seems to be a helpful parameter for the follow-upand therapy monitoring of these diseases.

We previously showed thatcertain tyrosine kinase antagonists, thecatalytic activity of cellular I).Therefore, it may be assumed that erlotinib exerts itsanticancer by also inhibiting topo I. Purified extract-derived topo I were added to topo I reactionmixture in the presence or absence of erlotinib (10 -4-10-12 M). Here we show that erlotinib inhibited the DNA relaxationactivity of purified topo I as well as topo I derived from breastcancer (MCF7) and prostate cancer (PC3) cell lines. To examine the effect of erlotinib on the cellular topo I, MCF7 and PC3 cells were treated with different doses oferlotinib and the effect on topo I was determined. Erlotinibtreatment significantly reduced the cellular DNA relaxationactivity of topo I but did not affect the level of topo I protein.Examination of the mode of action revealed that erlotinibreduced the DNA-binding ability of topo I. The MCF7 cellsdemonstrated a relatively high resistance to treatment witherlotinib, and with camptothecin (CPT), a topo I inhibitor,administered separately. A combined treatment based onerlotinib and CPT increased the anticancer effect of CPT aswell as the CPT-mediated inhibition of topo I activity. The results of this study show that topo I is a novel target of erlotinib and suggest that a combination of erlotinib with topoI inhibitors may demonstrate an effective anticancer treatment. IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE A sphingolipid analogue, is a immuno- suppressive drug - an agonist sphingosine 1-phosphate(S1P) receptors. Recently we identified sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1)/S1P pathway as a therapy target in prostate cancer.In the current study, we demonstrate that FTY720 canradiosensitize prostate cancer in cell and animal models. FTY720 induced apoptosis in several hormone- and radioresistant prostate cancer cell lines. FTY720 treatmentinduced a sustained inhibition of SphK1 and a decrease in theintracellular S1P content. Enforced expression of SphK1 inprostate cancer cells rendered them resistant to FTY720. In vitro sub-lethal concentrations of FTY720 dramatically fluorescent cells were treated with FTY720 with or without -irradiation.FTY720 demonstrated a synergy with -irradiation (notablythrough SphK1 inhibition), significantly tumor asdemonstrated by fluorescent in vivo imaging. In conclusion, FTY720 can sensitize prostate cancer cells to radiotherapy both in vitro and in vivo , through inhibition of SphK1 and modification of intracellular levels of lipid secondmessengers. 548 THE SK1/S1P PATHWAY POTENTIALDIAGNOSTIC/PROGNOSTIC MARKER INPROSTATE Maria Naymark, Lysann Sauer, Jonathan Waxman and Dmitry Pshezhetskiy Department Imperial College London, London,UK The sphingosine kinase-1/sphingosine-1-phosphate (SK1/S1P) pathway regulates several fundamental processes areintegral to cancer pathogenesis (cell proliferation, resistanceto apoptosis, angiogenesis and the pro-inflammatoryresponse). In the current study using a prostate cancer model,we hypothesize that elevation of SK1/S1P can serve as apotential diagnostic/prognostic marker. In a preclinical study on 30 prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, we have demonstrated thatSK1 is strongly up-regulated in human prostate tumours incomparison to non-tumour controls. SK1 elevation correlatedwith the Gleason score and the advanced stage of the disease.In several patients, prostate cancer cells obtained from knownlymph node metastases had elevated activity of SK1 incontrast to the cells in the primary tumour providing a linkbetween the SK1 activation and acquiring of the metastaticpotential. Mice xenografted with human prostate cancer cellshad increased levels of blood serum extracellular S1P incomparison with mice not bearing prostate tumours. treatment, serum levels of S1P fell in parallel withthe reduction of tumour volume. Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3453In this study, for the first time we demonstrate that the SK1 activity and expression are correlated with the onset,progression and metastasis of human prostate cancer.Additionally, using an animal prostate cancer model we showthat the levels of secreted S1P correspond to the tumourburden, which provides a rationale for proposing S1P as anovel tumour marker assessable in blood serum. Although notprostate specific, when combined with other methods, theSK1/S1P test may have a significant diagnostic and prognosticvalue. 549 ESCAPE FROM FAILSAFE PROGRAMS BY TWIST Lyon Cedex 08, France A major obstacle to the expansion of abnormal cells with aberrant proliferative potential is the induction of innatedefense mechanisms that initiate the cellular failsafeprograms of senescence or apoptosis. The mechanisms bywhich pre-cancerous cells escape these protective barriersremain to be determined. Recently, we identified the Twistproteins as potential early drivers of tumorigenesis (1).Twist1 and Twist2 proteins are highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix have importantregulatory functions during embryogenesis. Twist1 and/orTwist2 overexpression is a frequent event in multiple solidhuman tumors including many types of carcinomas as wellas sarcomas, pathways,thereby preventing apoptosis and oncogene-inducedsenescence (1, 2). Strikingly, in epithelial cells, the failsafeprogram escape facilitated by Twist1 or Twist2 coincideswith complete epithelio-mesenchymal transition (EMT), aprocess associated with the acquisition of stem cellproperties and invasive potential (1, 3). Collectively, theseobservations suggest that some metastatic capabilities ofcancer cells can be acquired during malignant conversion asa side-effect of the inactivation of primary failsafemechanisms. 1 Ansieau S, Bastid J, Doreau A, Morel A: Induction of EMT by twistproteins as a collateral effect of tumor-promotinginactivation of premature senescence.

ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3454551 of Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal Clinical and molecular similarities between canine mammary tumours (CMT) and human breast cancer have been described.Clinically, the similarities are very strong: spontaneoustumours, hormonal aetiology, age of onset and identicalclinical course of the disease. The clinical characteristics thathave an impact on the clinical outcome are also identical:tumour size, growth rate, lymph node invasiveness and clinicalstage. In both species, the search for prognostic factors to define those patients with higher risk of developing recurrence ordeath due to the tumour is essential. Nevertheless, nowadaysas far as human medicine is concerned, the goal is to identifyprognostic factors that could be used as therapeutic targets tosupport a better outcome in the clinical management of theneoplastic disease. Moreover, in this area, CMT seems tomimic human breast cancer. In fact, some of the recentlyestablished prognostic factors are molecular targets of newanticancer therapies acting as predictive factors that canidentify patients which might benefit from specific anticancerdrugs. Clinical and molecular data that support CMT as a model to study human breast cancer are analysed in this review.Additionally it is shown that some recent molecular targets inCMT may be seen as indicators for similar research to beperformed in the corresponding human disease. 552 C. Lopes2 1CECA V , Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Vila Real; 2Institute of Biomedical is an epidermotropic Langerhans cell histiocytosis which occurs mostly in youngdogs. The regression phenomena, to which it is associated,makes it an attractive system for analysis of Langerhans cellhistiocytosis behaviour and could be regarded as a uniquemodel to understand the pathogeny of the enigmatic diseaseof human Langerhans cell histiocytosis.In order to contribute to the understanding of the CCH regression, 93 tumours were analysed. We evaluated theimmunoexpression of MHC class II molecules and E-cadherinin tumoural cells. MHC class II were also Inflammatory infiltratewere also analysed (CD3, CD79 In the study of the immunocytochemistry of MHC class II antigen, visualized by light microscopy and by electronicmicroscopy, two principal patterns of MHC class II antigensexpression were observed: a focal juxtanuclear to endosomal lysosomalcompartments, a rim-like staining in the cell peripheryassociated to membranes outlines. The first occurred,principally, in tumours with poor lymphoid inflammatoryinfiltrate and the second in tumours with abundant lymphoidinflammatory infiltrate, either by T-lymphocytes or B-lymphocytes. These findings seem to reflect different phasesof MHC class II biosynthesis during activation/maturation ofnormal Langerhans cells. intensity of the immunoreaction to E-cadherin decreased with lymphoid infiltration. The decreased of E-caherin expression was also associated with a membranarexpression of MHC II molecules. This data suggests that pathological Langerhans cells in CCH appears in an immature state in early lesions andundergo a maturation process, characterized by an increase ofmembranar MHC class II molecules and a decrease in E-cadherin expression. In the regression lesions these cells had amature phenotype and could interact them self with B and T-lymphocyte. CCH is a dynamic lesion that changes itsphenotype and determines its own regression. In dogs and humans, Langerhans cell histiocytosis has a distinct clinical behaviour. In dogs, regression is the naturalcourse of the process. However, in humans, only a limitednumber of lesions undergo regression.

Branchetta22, Croatia Background: Various kinds of tissue disintegration lead the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to activation of adaptive pathwaysknown as the ER stress response, which is directed to correctionof unfolded proteins, to the activation of proteasome-dependentAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3455ER-associated degradation of the misfolded proteins and to activation of protein translation that modulate the polypeptidetraffic into the ER. A crucial role in these events is played bygp96, which acts not only as a molecular chaperone, but also asan adjuvant, able to induce the specific immune responseagainst some self and foreign antigens. Materials and Methods: To illustrate the multipotential functions of gp96 in this study,we investigated its participation in conditions of: 1) normalgrowth (liver in CIN lesions (gradus I-III) it wascorrelated with the intensity of the neoplastic process. Results: Tissue expression of gp96 was highly up-regulated in fetal andadult rapidly proliferating tissue (regenerating liver and inseveral fetal organs), at the fetoplacental barrier, in injuredtissues after autoimmune attack (on astrocytes, microglia andneurons in the brain and spinal cord during EAE), as well as indysplastic areas of cervix (on hyperplastic epithelial cells,vascular epithelia, and glandular epithelium). Kinetic studiesmade in the model of liver regeneration also showed that gp96-overexpression in the liver and thymus was followed bymaturation of dendritic cells, accumulation ofCD3 intermediate/NK1.1+/CD69+cells in the liver and CD4+CD25+Fox3+cells in the liver and thymus, as well as by augmentation of NKT- and NK-mediated cytotoxicity in theliver and in the spleen. Conclusion: The data imply that during the disturbance of morphostasis and structural integrity of thecell gp96 may protect the cells against the proteotoxic damageand serve as a natural adjuvant for chaperoning of antigenic selfor oncogenic peptides into the immune surveillance pathways,contributing during the normal growth to survival of cells andreestablishment of self tolerance, and in pathological growth toboth development of cancer and initiation of antitumourimmune response.

Renewed interest in the lymphaticsystem began less than 10 years ago and was based on theintroduction of some specific markers of lymphatic endothelialcells (LECs). Various human tumors preferentially metastasizeby a lymphatic route and lymphovascular invasion is knownfor years as an element that accurately predicts lymph nodemetastasis. On the other hand, the intimate mechanism/s bywhich tumor cells initially enter LVs is largely unknown. Inthis context, there are several questions ( Q) to be answered regarding tumor lymphangiogenesis. Q1: How specific are LEC markers? The most frequently used LEC markers are VEGFR3, LYVE-1, Prox-1, andpodoplanin. It was shown that in postnatal life, these markersare expressed by LECs and not by blood vessel ECs. Theyhave no absolute specificity, as their expression was reportedin some normal and pathological cells/tissues. Q2: Can LVs be found in tumors? The best results were obtained with D2-40 that recognizes an epitope of podoplanin.Peritumoral LVs were found in a large variety of tumors andintratumoral LVs were reported in SCC, melanoma, urothelialand gastric carcinoma. In patients with breast cancer, specificidentification of LVs increased detection of lymphovascularinvasion from 11 to 26%. Q3: Du tumor associated-LVs preexist or are they newly formed? Do they have proliferative potential? Proliferating LECs prognostic impact? Present data are controversial. LMVD correlates with the risk for metastasis in SCC, melanoma,endometrial, uterine cervix, pancreatic and gastric carcinoma.No correlation was found in cases with hepatocellular andductal pancreatic carcinoma, and divergent results wereobtained for breast cancer. Q5: What is the status of the main lymphangiogenic factors (VEGF-C/D) and of their specific receptor (VEGFR3)? All data strongly support the major role of the VEGF-C -VEGFR3 axis in induction of lymphangiogenesis. VEGF-Cmay be tumor cells themselves by activatedmacrophages. VEGF-C overexpression in tumors induces LVhyperplasia. Q6: What is the significance of LECs specific markers expression by tumor cells? The best example is represented by podoplanin expression in mesothelioma, angiosarcoma,Kaposi sarcoma, seminoma, diffuse gastric carcinoma,mastocytoma, and some tumors of the brain. Podoplaninexpression by tumor cells is usually associated with invasionand progression and in some cases is useful in the differentialdiagnosis. Could it be a potential therapeutic target? Atpresent, the answer is no, because it is also expressed by manynormal cells.ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3456Q7: Can lymphangiogenesis results in experimental models using anti-VEGF-C, anti-VEGFR3, or rapamycin showed the reduction in the rate oflymph node metastasis and a decrease in LMVD. Therefore,attractive targets for cancer therapy could be both LVs andsome tumor cells. 555 COMPARATIVE THERAPEUTIC AND ADJUV ANTEFFECTS OF CURCUMIN AND TURMERICFORCE AGAINST HUMAN A. Resek, E. Escolan and S.J. SW 62nd Avenue, Miami, FL 33155, USA Curcumin, the 214 apoptosis-associated genes studied in cancer cells, wefound that 104 genes were altered by curcumin. Despite itsanticancer effects, one of the major problems with thetherapeutic use of curcumin is its poor biological availabilityand limited efficacy. Our studies have also shown thatcurcumin and doxorubicin combination treatments havesynergistic cytotoxicity, with combination index values lessthan 1 in human leukemia cell lines. These two compounds incombination induced increased G 2/M arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells. While DOX treatment up-regulated NF- B in both CEM and CEM/VLB cell lines, inhibited theNF-B turmeric rhizomes that is marketedas a nutraceutical by New Chapter Inc., VT, USA. It contains45% turmerones, 11% curcuminoids and other of turmeric, unlikecurcumin. TF is equally cytotoxic in tumor cell lines with IC 50 values ranging from 6.7-12.6 g/ml. MDR cells do not haveany resistance towards lymphocytes aregenerally protected against this agent. TF inhibits NF- B activity and IL-8 expression leading to induction of apoptosisin tumor cell lines. TF showed better cytotoxicity thancurcumin in two pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (Bx-PC3 andPanc-1), with mean IC 50 values of 1.00 and 1.22 g/ml, respectively. Gemcitabine, which is currently used as standardchemotherapeutic agent against pancreatic cancer, has an IC 50 value of 0.03 ug/ml, although the higher concentration (50g/ml) was unable to induce not more than 60% cell death.When the cytotoxic data were analyzed by CalcuSyn software,gemcitabine and TF combination showed strong synergism,with combination index (CI) values of 0.216 and 0.236 inBxPC3 and Panc-1 cell lines, respectively. Flow of DNA content using propidium iodide stainingshowed that TF induced G 2/M block and a sub G0/G1 population in a dose-dependent manner. Data on cell cycle arrest and annexin-V staining confirmed the involvement ofapoptosis on cells. Both gemcitabineand TF down-regulated NF- B activity and the combination treatment showed a higher degree of inhibition than eitheragent alone, although the NF- B mRNA level remained the same in all treatment groups. Our in vitro studies indicate that TF can be used as a single agent or an adjuvant withgemcitabine for the treatment of pancreatic carcinomas. SinceTF contains other molecules, especially turmerones, andrepresents of raw turmeric, TF betterthan curcumin and more biologically available. STUDIES Children's Hospital, Miami, FL 33186, USA Polysaccharides are known immune stimulants, of which beta- glucans have received considerable attention.

RR1activated NF- a time- and dose-dependent manner and this modulation is associated with degradation of I- B- thus facilitating the translocation of NF- B into the nucleus. RR1- induced NF- B activity peaks at 8 h of RR1 stimulation while I-B alpha degradation occurred within 1 h of stimulation. RR1-induced NF- B activation occurred through TLR6 signaling as evidenced by the synthesis of IL-8 in TLR6-transfected HEK293 cells. These results show that the novel(1,4) -D-glucan from T. cordifolia activates the immune system through the activation of macrophages that occursthrough TLR6 signaling, NF- B translocation and cytokine production. Our preclinical studies indicate the potential useof RR1 as an adjuvant against human malignancies which maywork through modulation of native immunity. 557 MDA-7/IL-24: A NOVEL GENE DRUG FOR HUMAN CANCER THERAPY 1Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030; 2Introgen Research Institute, Houston, Texas 77030, USA The melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7 (mda-7), also known as interleukin-24, is that belongs to the interleukin-10 (IL-10)family. MDA-7/IL-24 encodes a protein of 206 amino acids(a.a) in length and has limited homology (19%) with IL-10protein, and appears to function antagonistically to IL-10.MDA-7/IL-24 protein, unlike or modifications andexhibits phosphorylation, glycosylation and ubiquitination.The modifications are frequently reported for tumorsuppressor proteins and regulate function and potency.Glycosylated MDA-7/IL-24 is secreted and binds to twoheterodimeric receptors, termed type 1 and type 2 IL-20receptors (IL-20R1/IL-20R2 or IL-22R1/IL-20R2). Detectionof endogenous MDA-7/IL-24 protein has not been reported todate in tumor cell lines (>60 lines evaluated). However,immune cells upon stimulation with PHA, LPS or IL-2 familycytokines potently induce expression of MDA-7/IL-24 proteinor and monocytes. Studies have shown that mRNA but not the protein product of mda-7 is detectable in human lung cancer and melanoma cell lines. Additionally, an inverse correlation between MDA-7 protein expression and cancer progression and patientsurvival has been reported in both lung cancer and melanoma, suggesting MDA-7/IL-24 is a novel tumor suppressor protein.Further evidence was provided in preclinical studies whenexogenous expression of MDA-7/IL-24 protein usingadenovirus and nanoparticles selectively killed human cancercells both in vitro and in vivo , with little to no effect on normal cells. Additionally, MDA-7/IL-24, when combined withchemotherapy, radiation therapy or biological therapies,demonstrated enhanced killing of tumor cells. The molecularmechanism of tumor cell killing is cell-type dependent andculminates in apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, MDA-7/IL-24 showed antiangiogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo which was enhanced when combined with otherantiangiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab (avastin). All ofthese features classify MDA-7/IL-24 as a tumor suppressorprotein-cytokine and a promising cancer drug. Preclinical studies in our laboratory have focused on investigating the role of secreted MDA-7/IL-24 protein onanticancer activity, molecular mechanisms and the contributionof receptor-mediated cell death. Analysis of receptorexpression by RT-PCR and Western blot in human lines. Treatment of tumor cells with MDA-7/IL-24 protein showeddose-dependent and time-dependent killing of receptor-positive, but not receptor-negative cells. Furthermore, blockingstudies using neutralizing antibodies to the receptors or MDA-7/IL-24 protein resulted in abrogation of the killing effect.Molecular analysis showed transient activation of STAT-3upon ligand binding to its receptors. These results showedMDA-7/IL-24 protein kills tumor cells in a receptor-dependentmanner. However, the requirement of type 1 or type 2 IL-20receptors varied and was observed to be cell-type dependent.Treatment of receptor-positive normal cells with MDA-7/IL-24 protein showed no cell killing, suggesting intracellularsignaling following ligand-receptor binding is different innormal and tumor cells. Similarly, treatment of receptor-positive human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs)and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) withthe protein in vitro inhibited differentiation, tube-formation, cell migration and invasion. The antiangiogenic activity wasmediated protein inhibited tumor angiogenesis, resultingin delay of tumor growth. Thus, secreted MDA-7/IL-24protein is selective for receptor-positive cells and kills onlytumor cells while sparing normal cells. The sensitivity ofreceptor-positive tumor cells and resistance of receptor-positive-normal cells to MDA-7/IL-24 appears to be regulatedby differences in the intracellular signaling followingligand-receptor interaction and warrants further investigation. A Phase I clinical trial testing an adenovirus-based mda-7 (Ad-mda7; INGN241) gene drug for cancer therapy showedpatients tolerated the drug well with no significant toxicity,ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3458with clinical responses observed in few patients. In conclusion, MDA-7/IL-24 with potent tumor killing activities is a novelcancer drug that warrants further clinical testing. 558 VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES (VLPS) CARRYINGTUMOUR-ASSOCIATED Stockholm, Sweden Vaccines based on virus-like particles (VLPs) have recently come into special focus by the use of VLP-based vaccinesagainst human papilloma viruses (HPV). However, thisapplication of VLPs is just one of many possible uses forVLPs both in the field of tumour prevention and as vaccinesagainst different viruses. Another type of application is toutilize VLPs as antigen carriers for different tumour antigens,both of viral and non-viral origin for the use as tumourvaccines in preventive or therapeutic settings. We haveconstructed VLPs based on different types of murine the single injection of these Her2PyVLPs efficientlyimmunized against a Her2-carrying tumor in a transplantablemodel and against the development of mammary cancer inmice transgenic for mutated rat neugene. We have further improved the immune response by loading Her2PyVLPs intodendritic cells (DCs) together with the in vivo response and confers protection against Her2 carrying tumours also in a therapeutic setting. 559 A NEW ANTI-TUMOUR V ACCINATION STRATEGY:ADENOVIRAL VECTOR ENCODING INV ARIANTCHAIN University of Copenhagen, Institute of International health, Immunology, Microbiology, The Panum Build.22.5, Blegdamsvej 3c, 2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark Antigen-specific immunotherapy is an attractive strategy for cancer control. In the context of antiviral vaccines, adenoviralconstructs have emerged as the most favourable means forimmunization. For this reason, we have selected an innovativeapproach that combines the use of this vector system withanother successful approach, namely linkage of the relevant antigen to the invariant chain (Ii). To test this vaccinationstrategy we used a mouse model system, in which a an epitopeof the glycoprotein (GP33-41) of a virus (lymphocyticchoriomeningitis virus (LCMV)), works as a tumourassociated antigen (TAA). Mice (C57BL/6) vaccinatedprophylactic with adenovector expressing GP linked to Ii (Ad-Ii-GP) were completely protected against growth of B16.F10melanoma cells expressing GP33-41. Furthermore, a singletherapeutic vaccination 5 days after tumour challenge delayedtumour growth by approximately 14 days compared toirrelevant vaccination. This tumour control was as good as aprophylactic or therapeutic \"vaccination\" with infectious virus.Therapeutic vaccination with the linked construct wasmoreover significantly better than vaccination with anadenovector expressing GP only (Ad-GP). The improvedtherapeutic vaccination efficiency of the linked vaccineappeared to be due to an increased TAA specific CD8 T cellresponse. Furthermore, vaccination experiments using micedeficient in expression of IFN, perforin, or both, indicatedthat the improved vaccination efficiency is dependent on IFN,which reduces cell cycle entry of the melanoma cells. Incontrast, perforin was redundant in otherwiseimmunocompetent mice, but not in IFN deficient mice. Tumour regression was followed by regained tumour growth, and this correlated with a contraction of the tumour specificCD8 T cells. To delay this contraction, and thus to furtherimprove the therapeutic efficiency of the vaccine, we combinedthe vaccination with agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies to provideadditional DC activation, and with anti-CTLA-4 toblock CTLA-4 interaction with ligands on the APCs. Togetherwith an additional Ad-Ii-GP vaccine booster, these antibodytreatments improved the vaccination efficiency significantly, andabout one third of the vaccinated mice became long-term non-progressors. From this we conclude that combination of a strongCD8 T cell inducing anti-tumour vaccine and antibody therapyinhibiting key immunosuppressive circuits might be a way toimprove current protocols for immunotherapy of cancer. 560 MICRORNA MIR-16 LINKED TO THEDEVELOPMENT AND OF B-CELLMALIGNANCIES IN THE NZB MURINE MODEL OFCHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA Erica 1, Coffman1, Helen Fernandes1, Gerald Marti2and Elizabeth Raveche1 1University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey - Newark, NJ 07103; 2NIH, Bethesda, MD 20812, USA The NZB mouse serves as a de novo model for CLL and in vivo imaging has been performed by CT and MRI to observeAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3459splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Alterations in the 13q14 genomic region containing microRNAs miR-15a and miR-16-1 have been found in human CLL, resulting in the deletion ordown-regulation of these miRNAs in 60% of patients. Wefound the development of CLL in NZB backcrosses waslinked to a point mutation in the 3' flanking region of mir-16-1, similar to the one described in human CLL. In ex vivo NZB lymphoid tissue, as well as in an NZB-derived in vitro malignant B cell-line (LNC), the levels of mature miR-16 aredecreased by half relative to levels in non-NZB control strainspleens or lymphoid cell lines. Lower expression of miR-16results in increased expression of miR-16 target genes, suchas CCND1 (cyclin D1), contributing to uncontrolled tumor growth. When NZB malignant B-cells are separated by cellcycle phase (by elutriation), and then transfected withexogenous miR-16, lower proliferation is observed and anaccumulation in G0/G1 phase with the most sensitive phase inthe S/G2 fraction. In addition, when miR-16 was added backto LNC, the cyclin D1 levels decreased, returning to thenormal range. Spleens and lymph nodes from NZB andcontrol mice were sorted by FACS into conventional B220bright B-cells or malignant B220 null B-1 cells. Both sourcesof NZB B-cells had lower miR-16 expression relative toC57Bl/6 purified B cells. Interestingly, among NZB B cells,the malignant B-cells had higher expression the non-malignant B-cells (B220 bright). In addition,spleens, peritoneal cells and lymph nodes from old NZB miceexhibited a dramatic increase in the 'side population' presentrelative to young NZB and control mice, suggesting anincrease in cancer stem cells as NZB mice age. Our datafurther support that the miRNA, miR-16, has an important rolein the development and progression of B-cell malignancies.The presence of the increased 'side population', reduced miR-16 levels, and the miR-16-1 3' flanking mutation inNZB present clues to CLL development. 561 AGE-ASSOCIATED INCREASE IN CANCER STEMCELLS DETECTED AS THE SIDE POPULATION INTHE NZB MODEL OF Gerald Marti2 1University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey - Newark, NJ 07103; 2NIH, Bethesda, MD 20812, USA As NZB mice age they develop a malignant clonal expansion of B-cells and serve as a de novo model of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Analysis of the spleens fromold NZB mice demonstrated the presence of a uniquepopulation of cells that are able to efflux the DNA-bindingdye, Hoechst 33342, and are referred to as the side population (SP). The SP was lost in the presence ofverapamil, which prevents efflux of Hoechst and defines theSP. In addition, most of these SP cells expressed cell surfacemarkers of stem cell progenitors such as c-Kit and/or Sca-1.The percentage and absolute number of SP cells in spleen,lymph node, peritoneal cavity, blood and bone marrow of old(12-month) NZB was increased when compared to young (1-to 3-month) NZB. By contrast, old DBA/2 and C57Bl/6control mice, which do not develop leukemia, had low levelsof SP cells in all the organs tested. The increase in SP cellsin old NZB mice correlate with the development of CLL andthe SP cells may be cancer stem cells which are resistant toapoptosis. To further study the SP, the spleen cells from old NZB mice were sorted into non-SP and SP cells and subjected tomicroRNA(miR) analysis by qRT-PCR. Previously, we hadshown the development of CLL in NZB backcrosses waslinked to a point mutation in the 3' flanking region of mir-16-1. A similar mutation in the 13q14 region of human CLLcontaining the mir-16-1 has been described by others. In thepresent studies, we found that the sorted NZB SP cells hadlower expression of miR-16 when compared to the non-SPcells. Decreased miR-16 in the NZB SP population resultedin increased expression of miR-16 target genes in the NZBSP cells, many of which could contribute to uncontrolledtumor growth and failure to undergo apoptosis. Our datafurther supports that miR-16 has an important role in thedevelopment and progression of B-cell malignancies. Thepresence of the increased 'side population' in old NZB tissuesources suggest that these cells may be a target for theelucidation of new strategies to control CLL growth. 562 HORMONAL CHANGES AS POTENTIALBIOMARKERS OF PROGNOSIS IN HEAD ANDNECK SQUAMOUS CELL CANCER Tim\u00e1r and M. K\u00e1sler National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary Background: Head and neck squamous cell cancer (SCCHN) is characterized by rapid progression and poor prognosis. Themost reliable prognostic factors are tumor (T) and node (N)stage. There is some evidence that circulating hormone levelsmight predict prognosis in SCCHN. The aim of this studywas to assess hormone levels in 289 male patients andevaluate them in association with the clinical parameters.Methods: Age, primary tumor site, tumor stage, histologic grade, and levels (PROL) operated for cancer of the oral cavity, oro-, andhypopharynx and the larynx in one cancer center wererecorded. The median follow-up was 37 months (19-71).Results: Age <46 years vs. older ( p=0.0055), stage I-II vs. III (p=0.014), and stage III IV (p=0.0004), vs. were of prognostic importance. Of the hormones studied,lower than normal levels ( p=0.02), TE/SHBG (p=0.0031) and DHAS In multivariate analysis of all cases,T stage, N stage and grade proved to be independentprognostic factors, PROL level had borderline significance(p=0.07). In the N0 stage subgroup PROL ( p=0.0013), the subgroup histology ( p=0.0004) and TE (p=0.0053) emerged as independent prognostic factors by multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Our results suggest that abnormal levels of some circulating hormones in head andneck cancer predicts worse survival, therefore hormonalimbalance cannot be excluded to have a role in the courseand/or development of HNSCC. 563 A NEW CANCER RESISTANT MOUSE MODEL (SR/CR) Klaus RieneckUniversity Hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark The SR/CR mouse model of cancer resistance was fortuitously discovered by Cui and co-workers (2003). Thismouse strain has been shown to be resistant to varioustumour cell lines, which cause cancer in other mouse strainsinto which they have been administered. The mouse modelconstitutes an opportunity to attain insight into the interplaybetween cancer and the innate immune system. Through amore detailed immunological and genetic examination of thismouse model, novel anti-tumour immunological mechanismsmay be unravelled. What makes the SR/CR mouse unique in cancer research is its ability to specifically target and kill a number of differentinjected cancer cells, and thereby prevent the cancerdevelopment without harming normal host cells. The tumourresistance of the SR/CR mouse has been shown to be mediatedby three innate immune cell populations, i.e. neutrophils, NK cells and macrophages. The SR/CR phenotype is mice by adoptive transfer and established tumoursin wild-type mice will regress following transfer of these threecell types from SR/CR mice. Furthermore the lifespan of the SR/CR mouse is normal without any signs of autoimmunity. The genetic basis of thisphenotype is unknown but the phenotype is heritable as a mendelian trait. It is intriguing that older SR/CR mice, whichare injected with cancer cells for the first time, will developcancer and will regress completely after two-three weeks. In summary the phenotype of the SR/CR mouse points to the importance of innate cellular immunity as a mediator ofone or more significant anti-cancer mechanisms. 564 BREAST CANCER AND CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS M. France Death of most patients is caused by metastatic spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to distant organ. Somedata indicated that approximatively 10 6tumor cells per gram of tumor tissue per day shed into the blood stream (1).Tumor cell shedding is an early event in tumorogenesis (2). A great number of cells move to the circulation but only a minority of them can form metastasis. One of 40 cells give riseto micrometastases and 0.01% proliferate into.Macrometastasis (3). In the blood stream a large fraction ofcirculating tumor cells (CTCs) die quickly, ano\u00efkis being one ofthe major factors. To move to the circulation, tumor cellsundergo the phenotype switch, \"Epithelial to mesenchymaltransition\" (EMT) and then acquire mobile propensities (4).These CTCs are out of cell cycle and do not proliferate.Unrestrained CTCs' proliferation give rise to transition\" andangiogenesis. Although metastasis formation from CTCs is a highly inefficient process, as breast tumor size increases, theirnumber in the blood increases and a fraction of them canevolve to a full-fledged metastasis (5). From 25,000 CTCs inthe whole blood, 625 are candidate to give rise to amicrometastasis and at least 2 of them will be the origin of ametastasis. This could explain that the presence of CTCs inprimary and metastatic breast cancer is associated with poorprognosis (6). CTCs can be considered as new markers in oncology, but before introduction of their detection into clinical use, muchwork remains to be done. A major requirement is thestandardization of detection systems (the different methodswill be discussed) and the establishment of an agreement onthreshold values. Another crucial step is the definition ofoptimal multi-markers assays, as no single ideal markerexists for CTCs detection. The choice of markers should takeinto consideration the cancer stem cell markers. In the nearfuture, the establishment of the clinical usefulness of CTCsdetection in oncology will be a challenge.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 34611 Butler P and Gullino PM: Quantitation of Fodstad O: Detection and clinical importance of micrometastatic J Natl Cancer Inst91: 1113-1124, 1999. 3 Luzzi KJ, Mac Donald IC, Schmidt EE et al : Multistep nature of metastatic inefficiency: Dormancy of solitarycells after Li\u00e8vre M,Thomas C et al: Generation of breast cancer stem cells through epithelial-mesenchymaltransition.

Inrecent years its use has been extended to the optimizationradiation therapy treatment planning, with the aim ofimproving patient outcome. The radiopharmaceutical which ismost often employed is the glucose analogue 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG). Several studies reported the usefulnessof FDG-PET for RT target volume determination, particularlyin non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The use of FDG PETdemonstrated to change the RT planning also in head and neckcancers, lymphoma and esophageal cancer. These applicationsare possible thanks to the use of integrated PET/CT images,acquired according to radiotherapy treatment position. BesidesFDG other radiopharmaceutical can be used, like 11C-cholinefor prostate cancer and 11C-methionine for brain tumors. Someissues are of particular importance in order to have an accuratetreatment planning. In particular, the optimization of imageswithin the RT planning system and the rules implemented forcontouring tumor volumes are the most critical issues. The use of FDG PET in RT planning for some different types of cancer is now implemented in many centers inEurope and US, using different protocols for imaging and contouring. The advent of PET-CT hybrid imaging not onlyrevolutionized the medical imaging, but also gave rise to anew and accurate method to increase accuracy of RTplanning system. Although available data demonstrated theuse of PET-CT in RT planning is able to modify the CTbased RT planning in a high percentage of cases, no data areyet available to demonstrate that this change has an impacton patients outcome. In Humanitas we are currently usingPET-CT as an aid to RT planning in NSCLC and braintumors with promising results. The presentation will showthe general needs for an effective use of PET in radiationplanning and our experience in the field. 566A ALTERED Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warszawa; 2Rzeszow University of Technology, Faculty of Chemistry, Rzeszow; 3Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warszawa, Poland Thymidylate synthase (TS; EC 2.1.1.45), a N5,10-methylene- (meTHF)-assisted Possible phosphorylation of TS in cultured rat cells, previously (Samsonoff et al: J Biol Chem 272: 13281- 13285, 1997), prompted us to examine this in more detail. TSpreparations from various sources, all highly purified in thepresence of phosphatase inhibitors, included L1210 parentaland FdUrd-resistant forms, as well as mouse, rat, human andTrichinella spiralis recombinant enzymes. They were analyzed, following SDS-PAGE, with the Pro-Q \u00aeDiamond Phosphoprotein Gel Stain, and all were found to include a lowproportion of phosphorylated forms. However, MS analysis ofthe SDS-PAGE bands did not reveal any phosphorylated aminoacid residues. By contrast, MS analysis of IEF fractions of TSpreparations from parental and FdUrd-resistant mouseleukemia L1210 cells, whose differing sensitivity toinactivation by FdUMP and its analogues was previously foundnot et phosphorylation of Ser10 and Ser16in the resistant, but not the parental, enzyme. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3462Each of the four recombinant TS preparations, expressed in bacterial cells, was separated into phosphorylated andnon-phosphorylated fractions, using metal oxide/hydroxideaffinity chromatography on Al(OH) fractions corresponding to 1% of the phosphorylated form exhibited a 3- to 4-fold lowerV maxapp, but unaltered Kmappwith either substrate or cofactor relative to the non-phosphorylated form, and ability torepress translation (catalyzed by a rabbit reticulocytepreparation) of its own (as well as luciferase) mRNA.Surprisingly, MS analyses did not reveal the presence ofphosphorylated amino acid residues in any of the fractionsinvestigated. In striking contrast, 31P NMR spectroscopy clearly demonstrated the presence of phosphorylated residuesin the phosphorylated enzyme fractions, and their absence innon-phosphorylated. Further analyses of the 31P NMR spectra (including their time-dependent changes followingacidification), and comparison with those of syntheticphosphoramide derivatives of basic amino acids (Lys, Argand His), and commercially available phospho-serine,phospho-threonine and phospho-tyrosine, revealed thepresence of phosphorus in a pointing modification of histidine residue(s). Biological nitration of protein tyrosine residues, which may lead to modulation of protein function, is associatedwith many diseases, including cancer, and is correlated withintensified NO biosynthesis. Human, mouse andCaenorhabditis elegans recombinant TS preparations, each incubated in vitro in the presence of NaHCO 3, NaNO2and H2O2, underwent nitration of tyrosine residues, resulting in a distinctly diminished rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction.The V maxappvalue was 2-fold lower when 1 tyrosine residue per monomer was nirated (with human or C. elegans TS) or 2 tyrosine residues per monomer (with cofactor (meTHF) or inhibitor (5-fluoro-dUMP)was apparent. Supported by Rode Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warszawa, Poland Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) plays an important role in de novo nucleotide biosynthesis, and thus DNA replication, its expression growing at the entrance to the S phase of thecell cycle. Inhibition of DHFR results in cessation ofthymidylate and purine synthesis, ultimately evoking cytostatic effect (Schornagel DHFR inhibitor, has been used in cancerchemotherapy for nearly 60 years, its chemotherapeuticeffectiveness being hindered by resistance to the drugunderlain by various mechanisms. DHFR translational auto-regulation is assumed to constitute one of the mainmodalities of MTX resistance (Schmitz et al : Cancer Met Rev 20: 33-41, 2001). Treatment of human adenocarcinoma C85 cells with 1 M MTX was previously demonstrated tocause growth arrest in G1 phase of the cell cycle (Dbrowskaet al: Eur J Pharmacol 555: 93-99, 2007). The present study was aimed at regulation of DHFR expression in the contextof MTX treatment outcome. Patterns of DHFR expression, determined by real-time PCR and Western blot techniques, and specific activity, werefollowed in C85 cells treated with 1 M MTX for 48 h. Theinfluence of MTX on putative DHFR translation auto-regulation was monitored using a reporter system where 89-nt long DHFR region (designated L-region), identifiedelsewhere as sufficient to compete with full length DHFRmRNA for binding to DHFR protein (Ercikan Abali et al : Biochemistry 36: 12317-12322, 1997), was placed at the 5' end of the gene coding the reporter protein, EGFP. Twosublines were constructed by stable (Clontech the5' end of EGFP applying cytometry andfluorescence microscopy. During 48 h exposure of C85 parental cells to 1 M MTX, and the following 96 h growth in the regular medium, DHFRmRNA level remained unchanged. The enzyme protein levelshowed a slight (1.5-fold) increase, considered negligible andpointing to a general change in translation attributed to theoutcome of MTX treatment, rather than specific influence ofMTX on DHFR translation, as similar slight increase (1.2-fold) was also noted for EGFP level in pEGFP-C85 cellstreated with the same dose of MTX. Enzyme specific activitydropped 2.2-fold in cells exposed to 1 M MTX for 48 h withno further drop apparent following subsequent 96 h growth inregular medium. Compared to pEGFP-C85 cells, L-pEGFP-C85 cells demonstrated a considerable decrease in EGFPexpression, assayed by fluorescence intensity studies, whenboth sublines were grown in the regular medium. Howeverupon exposure to 1 M MTX for 48 h, an 8-fold increase inEGFP fluorescence was observed for L-pEGFP-C85 cells,similar to a 5-fold increase found for pEGFP-C85 cells. Conclusion: Analysis of DHFR expression in human adenocarcinoma C85 cells exposed to 1 M MTX for 48 hdemonstrated that the resulting G1 growth arrest isassociated with a negligible increase in DHFR protein levelAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3463and ~2-fold decrease in DHFR specific activity, the latter apparently resulting from MTX tightly binding to DHFRmolecule that persists in crude extract preparation. A distinct(8-fold) increase of EGFP fluorescence intensity in MTX-treated L-pEGFP-C85 cells confirmed the previouslypostulated suitability of employing EGFP as a reporter forimaging cellular response to MTX treatment, identified asG1 growth arrest. The present study demonstrates that theG1 phase cell cycle arrest of C85 cells, caused by MTX,does not involve any specific DHFR expression regulation. 567 AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO CANCER PROTEOMICS Karin D. Rodland , Cheryl Baird, David Camp, Richard D. Smith and Richard Zangar Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352, USA An exciting new trend in cancer research is the use of mass- spectrometry based proteomics to discover new protein-basedbiomarkers for early diagnosis, therapeutic response, andprognosis that promise to revolutionize management ofpatients with cancer. However, biomarker discovery effortsare impeded by analytical limitations in sensitivity andthroughput of proteomic methods to define the complexityof the human plasma or tissue proteome. The most effectiveprogram to discover protein biomarkers requires teamscience, an integrated informatics platform, identification andquantitation of candidate biomarkers in disease tissue, andstandardized procedures for analyzing candidate biomarkersin bodily fluids. We have developed a tiered approach tobiomarker discovery that leverages unique instrumentation,including highly powerful mass atPNNL. is achieved through customdesigned, high-throughput, quantitative sandwich ELISAmicroarray analysis. Antibody pairs can be readily generatedthrough the use of a novel yeast surface display system forrecombinant antibodies developed at PNNL. These tools arecurrently being applied to problems in breast, ovarian,prostate and liver cancers, as well as other chronic diseases. 568 PROTEOMICS STRATEGIES FOR MARKERDISCOVERY IN LUNG CANCER M. Hagmann1, Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg; 2Thoraxklinik Heidelberg, Heidelberg;3Patholog. Institut, University Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the Western population and 30% of all cancer deaths are causedby lung cancer, making it the number one killer among allcancer-related diseases. Today, less than 35% of lung cancercases are diagnosed at an early stage and despite many recentachievements in imaging technologies, there is noappropriate screening tool available. To fill this diagnosticgap, accurate, non-invasive diagnostic markers in body fluidsindicating early-stage disease would fulfil an urgent medicalneed. We are actively seeking such markers combiningseveral proteomics technologies. Despite many recent technological advances, especially in the field of mass spectrometry (MS), none of the currentlyavailable proteomics technologies offers the possibility toidentify a comprehensive proteome of a given sample.Instead, it is necessary to combine several prefractionationmethods with different MS technologies. Here, we presentour approach to identify new potential marker candidates forlung cancer from tissue. This approach includes conventionaltwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) andidentification of proteins by MALDI-MS as coupled to ESIMS. by affinity chromatography onpreparative 1-DE gels. After marker discovery programs applying proteomics technologies, it is of utmost importance to validate thefindings with orthogonal methods. We apply immunoblotanalyses, as well as immunohistochemistry to scrutinize thevalue of the identified marker candidates. Using thesetechnologies it is possible to assess the potential of theidentified marker candidates in a larger panel of lung cancertissue samples as well as in other malignancies. For the most promising candidates, highly sensitive immunoassays were developed to assess their presence inblood. Subsequently, we analyzed panels of well-characterized clinical blood samples of lung cancer patientsand healthy controls. Data on the diagnostic performance ofselected marker candidates will be presented. 569 ASSOCIATION BETWEEN INFLAMMATORYMEDIATORS, D-DIMER LEVELS AND V ASCULARENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR P. Ferroni2and F. Guadagni2 Department of Laboratory Medicine and Advanced Biotechnologies,IRCCS San Raffaele, Rome, Italy Cancer cells release procoagulant activities responsible for thrombin generation and platelet activation. Plateletactivation by thrombin, in turn, causes release of vascularendothelial growth factor (VEGF) a potent angiogenic factoressential for tumor growth and metastasis. It is also knownthat tumor cells and/or tumor-associated leukocytes mayproduce inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha. The release of inflammatory cytokines is also involvedin activation of the fibrinolytic/ coagulation system. Basedon these observations, a model has been proposed in whichdisturbance of the anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic stateof endothelium by tumor cells would be responsible forplatelet activation and release of angiogenesis-related factors.Thus, aim of this study was to investigate whether acorrelation exists between inflammation, coagulationactivation and VEGF release in patients withadenocarcinoma. Plasma VEGF, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and D-dimer levels were analyzed in 68 patients with lung (n=32,63\u00b18 years), colon (n=20, 62\u00b117 years) or breast (n=16,54\u00b112 years) adenocarcinoma treated at the \"Tor Vergata\"Clinical Center. Thirty-four unrelated healthy controls (65\u00b18years) recruited from the same geographical area as thepatients, served as controls. Written informed consent wasobtained from each subject. The results obtained showed thatmedian p<0.0001) patients were found in 63% of lung compared to 31% of breast, 20%of colon adenocarcinoma and 4% of controls ( p<0.0001). to further analyze the relationship between VEGF and clinical and laboratoryvariables of adenocarcinoma patients, multiple regressionanalyses including age, gender, histological diagnosis, tumorsize, node involvement, presence of distant metastasis, D-dimer, TNF and IL-6 levels were performed. Final modelsby that levels p=0.003) and D-dimer found between plasma VEGF, TNF-alpha and D-dimer levels, suggests that the hostinflammatory response to cancer cells, and/or their released products, as well as tumor-derived cytokines, could beresponsible for an activation of the fibrinolytic/coagulationpathway and subsequent platelet VEGF release in patientswith adenocarcinoma, especially of the lung.Partially supported by Grant RFPS-2006-7-342220 by theItalian Ministry of Health. 570 ROLE OF PHARMACEUTICAL EXCIPIENTS INTHE TAMOXIFENE ACTIVITY ON Section of Pharmacology, and 2Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy Pharmaceutical excipients are substances used in the commercial formulation of a drug to improve the efficacy ofthe active agent. Oral administration of the non-steroidalanti-estrogen tamoxifen is the treatment of choice formetastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.Tamoxifen shows a fairly good oral bioavailability combinedwith large inter-individual variations and few side-effects. With the aim of improving tamoxifen bioavailability andachieving the active dosage at a tumour site for a longperiod, we studied the in vitro activity of a tamoxifen formulation in calcium alginate/chitosan microparticles.Moreover, the influence of alginate mannuronic/glucuronicratio affecting a probable interaction with the cationic drugwas evaluated by comparing two types of sodium alginate(from Kelco, France, with 62% mannuronic acid and 38%guluronic Fluka, acid acid) preparation. MCF-7 and Vero cells werecultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium and treatedwith growing concentrations (from 10 to 100 M/mlmedium) of tamoxifen alone, microparticles loaded withtamoxifen, and microparticles alone as control. MTT test wasperformed on both the cultures. The results observed after 24, 48 and 72 hours showed that both types of sodium alginate improved cell growth ina dose-dependent way. Tamoxifen LD 50values were similar (38 M/ml) in Vero and MCF-7 cells only after a 24 hincubation time. The values we observed after 48 and 72 hshowed a higher toxicity on Vero cells (LD 50=10 M/ml) with respect to MCF-7 cells (25 M/ml). Interesting resultscame from the comparison between the two types ofmicroparticles loaded with tamoxifen. Microparticlesreleased the drug after 48 hours and LD 50were significantlyAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3465changed both with respect to the drug alone and, in particular, to the type of alginate. When and 10 M/ml on MCF-7 cells, thus showing a stronger activity of theformulation on both cells, but with a lower cytotoxicity onVero cells. In conclusion these preliminary results confirm that the microparticle formulation of tamoxifen can be useful inimproving its bioavailability but we outline that thetherapeutic dosages must be revised according to theexcipients employed in the formulation since their link to theactive compound can dramatically change both drug activityand toxicity. 571 MORPHOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR EVENTSAT THE ADV ANCING EDGE OF COLORECTALCARCINOMAS IN HUMANS C.A. RubioGastrointestinal and Liver Pathology Research Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Karolinska Institute andUniversity Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden The mechanisms whereby colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC) invade the extracellular matrix (ECM) remain elusive.In a series of studies, we found at the growing edge of CRC,dilated neoplastic glands, some with a layer of flat tumorcells, and some lacking one or more groups of consecutivelylining tumor cells (called glandular pores, GPs). Through theGPs, the retained glandular material was siphoned offdirectly into the juxtaposed ECM. The substance secreted bythe tumor cells, rich in proteolytic enzymes, disrupted theparatumoral anatomy of the ECM. To remodel the defectiveglands, the malignant cells, proliferating from the tip of thefree borders of the pores, invade the enzymatically disruptedmatrix to achieve glandular continuity. We reported a similarsequence of events in colonic carcinomas in rats and in CRCin baboons. The sealing of the GPs permits the intraglandularaccumulation of new proteolytic material, a mechanism thatreplicates a new wave of host invasion at the invading front,thus ensuring a stepwise but everlasting tumor progressionin untreated patients. In recent studies, we found thatlaminin-5, an adhesion-migration macromolecule isfrequently overexpressed in the tumor cells at the free endsof the GPs, indicating increased production of laminin-5. Aclose interaction between this adhesion-migrationmacromolecule, PG formation and the local progression ofcolonic carcinomas seems to occur. In more recent studies,we found that the flat tumor cells in the neoplastic glands atthe advancing edge failed to express the proliferation markerKi-67 but expressed mutated p53 protein. This paradoxical biological behaviour of tumor cells may be connected withthe subsequent formation of glandular pores and stronglysuggests that the arrested cell proliferation at the advancingtumor edge of CRC occurs independently of p53 mutation. It is suggested that at the advancing tumor edge of CRCs,two independent molecular systems exist, one supervisingcell proliferation and the other actively transferring themutated p53 protein to daughter cells. These mechanisms ofaction would also explain the clinical appearance ofmetastasis many years after the surgical \"curative\"eradication of colorectal carcinomas, conveyed by\"awakening\" dormant cells. 572 ASION BY TUMOUR: LET'S GETBACK TO THE \"ROOT\" OF THE PROBLEM Gaurisankar Sa 1, Tanya Das1and Charles S. Tannenbaum2 1Division Medicine, Bose Institute, Kolkata, India; 2Department of Immunology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA Immune dysfunction is well-documented in cancer patients, and likely contributes to tumour evasion. Often tumourtargets and directs T-cell function to escape fromimmunosurveillance. This dysfunction includes loss ofeffector T-cells, type-2 cytokine bias and T-regulatory (T reg) cell expansion. To account for immune escape by tumours,multiple mechanisms have been proposed including tumour-induced T-cell apoptosis. However, the molecules involvedin these processes still remain controversial. We observedthat tumour-shed various soluble factors play critical role insuppression of anti-tumour immunity. One of the factors wasprostaglandin E 2, which severely affected cytokine receptor chain-mediated Jak-3/Stat-5a-signalling in T-cells resultingin T-cells also that tumour-shedganglioside-induced oxidative-stress perturbed NF- B, thereby, leaving T-cells vulnerable investigation revealed up-regulated to the decreased T-cell activation and Th-1 typeof immune response. The true therapeutic benefit of the use of plant products, especially acceptable dietary components, such as curcumin,has opened new horizons in cancer prevention andtreatment. We observed that this yellow pigment of the spiceturmeric not only regressed cancer, but also rejuvenatedintrinsic defense machineries of the host, which becomejeopardized during cancer. In fact, the entire immunedysfunction could be ameliorated by curcumin, indicatingthat this phytochemical has ability to restore Jak-3/Stat-ANTICANCER 3157-3556 regulation of TGF- in cancer cells and thus preventedtumour-induced loss of T-effector cells and reversed type-2cytokine bias. The active component in the root of turmericcould re-educate the cellular signalling components andblocked immune evasion by tumor. Curcumin, therefore,may have a possible therapeutic potential in cancer patientsin whom the immune capacity is affected not only by thedisease itself, but also by the treatment measures. Thus,modern medical research seems to confirm the ancientwisdom that therapy of many diseases may reside in thisinexpensive M. Analoii3 1Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, 2Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, 3Isfahan Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, IsfahanUniversity of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran Background: Taxol is one of the cytotoxic drugs used for a wide range of cancers, but has some problems such as lowpermeability through the cell membrane and high price.Statins with low side-effects can potentially be used ascytotoxic agents acting with different mechanisms. In thisstudy, synergic cytotoxic effects of co-administration of taxoland cell line wereevaluated. Materials and Methods: The MDA-MB-468 cells were cultured on RPMI medium. The cytotoxic activity ofco-administration of taxol and atorvastatin were screened at0.1, 1 and 2 M and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 M,respectively. Cytotoxic activity of taxol 24 h after incubationof cells with atorvastatin was screened, using MTT method.Results: Atorvastatin had no effect on cells at a low concentration (0.25 and 0.5 M), but growth was inhibited100% at high concentrations (8, 16 and 32 M). Synergiccytotoxic effect was observed when taxol was added 24 hafter incubation of cells with atorvastatin. It has been shownthat there is differential sensitivity of different cell lines toantitumor activity of statins. The results of the present studyindicated that the MDA-MB-468 cell line has a lowsensitivity to low concentrations of atorvastatin. Conclusion: Consistent with findings of other studies, the results of thepresent study indicated that addition of Taxol 24h afterincubation of cells with atorvastatin had MDA-MB-468 by at least 20%. Consequently itmay be possible to USING H. Sadeghi-Aliabadi , M. Minaiyan Dabestan Isfahan Research Center of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran Background: Doxorubicin is a broad spectrum antitumor antibiotic in the treatment of cancers. Its dose-dependentcardiotoxicity is the most serious side-effect causing drugwithdrawal from hard chemotherapeutic regimens. Statinshave been shown to be cytotoxic in concentrations that arehigher than effective doses for hypercholesterolemiatreatment (40 mg/day). Co-administration of andchemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin was shown tobe synergic. By this protocol, lower dose of cytotoxic agentcan be used, and, hence, reduce the risk of cardiotoxicity. Inthis study, the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin andsimvastatin co-administration (in combination or alone) onHeLa tumor cell line were evaluated. Materials and Methods: HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI medium and cytotoxic effects of different concentrations of doxorubicinand simvastatin either alone or in combination wereevaluated, using assay. Briefly, after seedingcells (3\u00d710 4cell/ml) in 96-well plates and 24 h pre- incubation, compounds were added and plates wereincubated (37C, 5% CO 2). After 72 h, 20 l MTT solutions were added and incubated for another 3 h. Media werereplaced with 150 l of DMSO and absorbance was read at540 nm using ELISA plate reader. Finally, cell survival wascalculated as compared with control (100% viable cells).Results: Results showed that simvastatin at low concentration (0.25 M) seems to be a growth stimulator (cell viability112%, p<0.05), although at a concentration of 2 M or more, cell viability was reduced by at least 20% ( p<0.5). Doxorubicin (0.1, 1, 2 M) reduced cell survival between 40to 83%. Co-administration of two compounds at highesttested concentrations (2 M) after 72 h killed 97% of cells(p<0.05). Incubation of cells with simvastatin after 24 h with doxorubicin seems to be a more effective protocol than theconverse (14-76% cytotoxicity versus 12-61%). Conclusion: Between 3 tested protocols in these studies, co-administration of doxorubicin and simvastatin after 72 hincubation showed the highest cytotoxicity against HeLacells. On the other hand, incubation of cells withdoxorubicin, 24 h prior to addition of simvastatin was moreeffective. Co-administration of drugs for longer periods oftime might help apoptosis more than each drug alone orincubation with one compound prior to other one.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3467575 TUMOR SPECIFICITY AND TYPE OF CELL DEATHINDUCED IN ORAL SQUAMOUS CELLCARCINOMA CELL LINES BY NATURAL ANDSYNTHETIC COMPOUNDS Hiroshi SakagamiDivision of Pharmacology, Department of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Sciences, Meikai University School ofDentistry, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan This is the review of our recent study on the tumor specificity and the type of cell death induced by more than 1,000 naturaland synthetic compounds, using human normal oral cells(gingival fibroblast, pulp cell, periodontal ligament fibroblast)and human oral squamous as doxorubicin, showed the highesttumor-specificity, but this was mostly, but not completely,related to the expression of mdr1 mRNA expression in the target cells. Most of the lower molecular weight flavonoidsand monomeric tannins showed little or no tumor specificity.On the other hand, oligomeric tannins showed slightly highertumor specificity. There was no clear-cut relation between thetumor-specificity of caspase or internucleosomal DNAfragmentation) or autophagy (accompanying the formation ofautophagosome, and occasionally secondary lysosomeengulfing broken organelles). However, ,-unsaturatedketones showed weak tumor specificity except for 3-arylidene-1-(4-nitrophenylmethylene)-3,4-dihydro-1 H-naphthalen-2-ones that showed comparable tumor specificity with anthracyclines.Nocobactins, mycobactin-like siderophores, also showedhigher tumor specificity, but their cytotoxicity chelation with iron.

A semi-empirical molecular orbital method may be useful to estimate the most stable structure of candidate compoundsand explore compounds with greater tumor specificity. 576 LARYNGEAL CARCINOMA IN MOSUL AbdulMuhsen Y . Saleem and Muna Muneer Mosul General Hospital, Mosul Medical College, Mosul, IraqLaryngeal carcinoma is a common malignant tumor among Asian races. Laryngeal carcinoma is regarded as thecommonest upper aero-digestive tract cancer and thecommonest head and neck cancer. More than 90% oflaryngeal tumors are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Ouraim was to present data about the incidence of variouslaryngeal carcinomas in Mosul after 1991 and to comparethe results with previous studies. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was carried out at the Oncology andNuclear Medicine Hospital, Mosul Military Hospital, Al-Zahrawi Teaching Hospital and Alrahma Private Hospital,over an eight-year period from January 1994 - December2002. Four hundred and twenty patients with laryngealcarcinoma were included in the study. Clinical data includingage and gender of the patients, in addition to the histologicalreports from the case files were collected and analyzed.Statistical analysis using Z-test concerning male and femaledistributed cancer cases was carried out. Results: There were a total of 420 patients with laryngeal carcinoma, with a maleto female ratio of 3.6:1. Of all cases, 97.2% were SCC and1.4% adenocarcinoma. The age range was 36-85 years, witha mean age of 60 years. Z-test revealed a statisticallysignificant gender difference (male vs. female, 78.3% vs. 21.7%, p<0.01) for laryngeal cancer. Conclusion: This study revealed a higher frequency of laryngeal cancer than that ofprevious studies performed in the same locality (Mosul)during the previous decade and this could be attributed to thegeneral effect of the Gulf war in 1991 and the type ofweapons used in it. There is a need for further studies indifferent parts of Iraq as to the cause of the increase inincidence of malignancy after the War of 1991. 577 EV ALUATION OF MLH1 AND MSH2 GENE MUTATIONS IN A OF IRANIAN FAMILIESWITH HEREDITARY NON-POLYPOSISCOLORECTAL CANCER (HNPCC) Mansoor Salehi and Shahnaz Amani Department of Genetics, Medical School, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan 81744/176, Iran Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer is the most common form of hereditary colorectal cancer, accounting for5 to 10% of all colon carcinomas. It is inherited in anautosomal dominant mode and caused by germline mutationsin mismatch repair genes (MMR), chiefly MLH1 and MSH2 . The lifetime risk of colon cancer in affected persons is 80%.Screening, prevention strategies and consequently treatmentoptions will be improved by understanding of the geneticbasis of this disorder. The aim of this study was to assessmutations in MLH1 and MSH2 genes in a HNPCC patients.ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3468Families fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria were selected as HNPCC families. Genomic DNA was extracted from theperipheral blood samples and germline mutations of MLH1 and sequencingtechniques. Germline mutations were found in 20 cases. Themutation rate in our study (62.5%) was higher in comparisonwith countries, such as Latvia or Taiwan. Of these mutations,14 were found in MLH1 and 6 in MSH2 genes thus MLH1 gene had a higher mutation rate than MSH2 . Eighteen out of 20 detected mutations in our population were previouslyreported and two were novel. Our results demonstrated that the mutation range, as well as genes involved in HNPCC is different from one region toother and characterizing mutations could be very helpful indiagnosis of the at-risk individuals. 578 Chemistry, University of Oulu; 3Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland Traditionally human carcinoma invasion is studied using three-dimensional organotypic culture model using rat typeI collagen gel disc with or without embedded humanfibroblasts. Since carcinoma cells behaviour depends largelyon their surroundings a more natural environment for cancercell invasion studies should be created. In this study a novelorganotypic culture model based on human leiomyoma tissuewas established. Commercial highly invasive human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line HSC-3 was cultured on top of bovinecollagen gels and on human uterine leiomyoma discs for twoweeks in the presence or absence of a gelatinase-specificpeptide inhibitor CTT-2. Uterine leiomyoma tissues wereobtained from the routine surgical treatments in the hospitaland either processed immediately or frozen for later use.Organotypic culture media samples were collected everythree days and were analyzed by radioimmunoassay for typeI collagen, Western blotting of collagenases or using gelatinzymography. The organotypic tissue discs were formalinfixed and paraffin embedded sections were studied byimmunostaining and in situ hybridization. From myoma discs a wide variety of cell types, including myofibroblasts, endothelial and inflammatory cells wereidentified. In the extracellular matrix type I, III and IVcollagen and laminins were present and synthesized by theinvading carcinoma cells. Interestingly, in myoma model,particularly using frozen-thaw discs, carcinoma cells invaded and proliferated significantly more efficiently than intraditional collagen gels with fibroblasts. The invasivepotential of the carcinoma cells and the inhibitory effect ofCTT-peptide could also be analyzed from the culture mediasamples. We have developed a novel human organotypic culture model based on human myoma tissue discs. This model ispractical and convenient for analysing easily the effects ofvarious invasion inhibiting substances on carcinoma cells. 579 THE ACTIV ATING ROLE OF SRC AND STAT3 ON HGF TRANSCRIPTION IN HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELLS Michelle R. Sam 1, Bruce E. Elliott2,3and Christopher R. Mueller2,3 1Cancer Genomics Platform, Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; 2Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, and 3Division of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Queen's Cancer Research Institute, Kingston, Ontario, Canada Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) participates in normal mammary development through tightly regulated paracrinesignaling. Aberrant regulation of HGF and its receptor Met isthought to contribute to tumorigenesis, and overexpressionof both proteins is frequently observed in breast cancer.Active Src and Stat3 are mediators of HGF/Met have demonstrated that cooperativeSrc/Stat3 signaling activates HGF transcription in mouse mammary carcinoma cells. Characterization of the HGF promoter led to the identification of a Stat3 consensus sitelocated at -95nt which was shown to be required for fullHGF transcriptional activity. To extend this work in the context of human breast cancer, activated Src and Stat3 wereoverexpressed in human epithelial cell lines and theirsignaling effects on HGF activation assessed. Results from this study demonstrate that human breast cells provide a permissive environment for HGFtransactivation mediated by activated Src/Stat3 interaction.Endogenous protein expression patterns were alsocharacterized for the proteins involved in HGF/Met signalingacross a variety of epithelial cell lines. Furthermore, use approaches to knockdown Stat3 expressionshow through interactions at the -95nt site on the HGF promoter. The generation and use of inducible Stat3 fusion proteins alsoallowed for the independent evaluation of Stat3 dimerization,activation and transcriptional regulation of the HGF/Metsignaling pathway. Results from this study support thesuggested model of a cooperative activating role of Src/Stat3Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3469signaling, and their participation in the formation of an HGF autocrine loop. This may in turn lead to sustained activationof the HGF/Met signaling pathway thereby promoting anoncogenic phenotype in human mammary epithelial cells.Better understanding of these proteins and their interactionswithin the signal transduction pathway can further aid in thetarget and design of therapeutic approaches to breast cancertreatment. 580 A NOVEL RADIOIMMUNOCONJUGATE FORPOSSIBLE USE IN THE DETECTION OF HNSCC of Otolaryngology and Head Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University,Akademiska Sjukhuset, Uppsala; 2Unit of Biomedical Radiology, and Clinical Immunology, UppsalaUniversity, Uppsala, Sweden The presence or absence of lymph node and distant metastases has a major impact on the preference of treatment in patientswith head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).Radioimmunodiagnosis could offer a more specific andsensitive diagnostic method than those available today. Ouraim was to label cMAb U36 with 111In and study the biodistribution of the labelled compound in HNSCCxenografts and selected normal organs of nude mice. We alsowanted to evaluate imaging of HNSCC using the samecompound in a planar gamma camera. Materials and Methods: In this study we used the chimeric in colorectal carcinomas, as anegative labeled emitter Indium-111 ( 111In), using the chelator of the 111In labeled cMAbU36 and huA33 conjugates were made with animmunoreactivity assay and binding studies in order todetermine the specificity of the labeled antibodies and thepresence of the antigens CD44v6 and A33 on SCC9 cells.Biodistribution and tumor imaging were conductedafter injection radiopharmaceuticals in nudemice bearing HNSCC xenografts expressing CD44v6. Results: The antibody tolerated labeling conditions very well. Theimmunoreactive fraction was very high (>95%), and blockingexperiments verified that the binding was CD44v6-specific. In vivo results demonstrated a promising biodistribution, with tumor being the only tissue to clearly accumulate radioactivitywith time. All organs had substantially lower radioactivity thanthe blood. The blood-to-tumor ratio of cMAb U36 increasedcontinuously during the study, from 0.24\u00b10.10, 6 h p.i., to 4.45\u00b11, 172 h p.i. The targeting specificity of cMAb U36 wasfurther supported by the significantly ( p<0.038) higher uptake 72 h p.i. compared to huA33. The static images of the tumorxenografts showed good visualization of the tumors.Conclusion: We have produced a novel radioimmunoconjugate targeting CD44v6, for possible use in radioimmunodiagnosisof HNSCC. The conjugate was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating no adverse effects from labeling, and a favorable biodistribution. The planar gamma camera imagesshowed good visualization of the tumors. The specific, high,and accumulating blood-to-tumor ratio indicated a favorableretention of the conjugate, a promising property for futureimaging studies. 581 POSSIBLE ROLE OF DIFFERENTIALMETALLOPROTEINASE 1 EXPRESSION IN SIGNET RING CELL AND INTESTINALCOLORECTAL CARCINOMA HISTOTYPES R. Sanguedolce 1, D. Cabibi2, Background: Signet ring cell colorectal carcinoma (SRCC) pure is an infrequent and highly malignant variant ofcolorectal cancer, while this histological component ispresent in 30% of all colorectal thymidylate synthase (TS) expression of the intestinal type of colorectal carcinoma(ICRC) to try to show the pathogenesis, aggressiveness andlow 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) responsiveness of these tumours.We found that all SRCCs had very low levels of all markersand were in the post-mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Tounderstand their high metastatic capability we assessed theSRCC expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), aproteolytic enzyme, suspected to play an important role inthe progression of various types of cancer and compared itto the ICRC one. Materials and Methods: We tested MMP1 expression immunohistochemically on formalin-fixed,paraffin-embedded samples of 32 SRCC and 70 ICRC.Differences in the distribution of the study variables, andassociations between variables were assessed by means ofthe 2test. Results: SRCC showed a high expression of MMP1 over all the invasion front of the tumour and in theneoplastic embolus, rather than the ICRC ( p<0.001). Conclusion: As MMPs seem to play important role in tumour invasion and metastasis, recently they have gained attentionas targets for new anticancer therapy strategies. MMPANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3470inhibitors have been shown to prevent tumour spread both in vitro and in vivo and to inhibit tumour angiogenesis and some of them are being developed for clinical use. In thisstudy we demonstrated that SRCCs showed a differentMMP1 expression pattern compared to ICRC, for this reasonan anti-MMP therapy should be advisable in these patientsbecause of their poor prognosis.

Many of these studies were based oncomputer modelling. Immunoinformatics is a growing sub-discipline, bridging bioinformatics and It isconcerned with modeling and computational analysis of thehuman immune response at the molecular, cellular andsystem levels. The best-established area of immunoinformatics is probably molecular level modeling, which has clinicalimplications in predicting prognosis in CLL (2) andevaluating humanized antibodies for immunogenicity (3).Predictions of peptide-MHC binding have contributed to thedevelopment of therapeutic vaccines, although this approachcannot be used in isolation (4). At the system level, the in silico mouse model has been used to predict the optimum vaccination schedule for preventing mammary tumordevelopment in ERBB2/HER-2/NEU transgenic mice (5). Recently, we have been combining these approaches by developing and implementing an integrated model of thehuman immune system in the ImmunoGrid project(http://igrid-ext.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/immunogrid/site/index.html), funded through Framework 6. An enormous amount of datarelated to the immune response at different levels is beingcollected and curated in a repository and fed back into oursimulators. Many of the calculations required arecomputationally intensive and are distributed betweensystems that our partners have access to using Gridtechnology. We are now seeking funding to develop thisbasic science into novel computational tools that will beaccessible and useful in the clinic. In this presentation, bothour current applications of immunoinformatics to cancervaccine development, and our future plans will be described. 1 Weiner LM: NEJM 358: 2664-2665, 2008. 2 al: 2008. 5 Lollini PL et al: BMC Bioinformatics 7: 352, 2006. 583 C.E. SansomSchool of Crystallography, Birkbeck College, London WC1E 7HX, UK The subject of cancer is always newsworthy and often emotionally charged. Researchers and clinicians working inthis area may be relatively fortunate in their fundingenvironment, but they have to cope with the glare ofpublicity. Cancer researchers, like all scientists, inhabit aworld of slow advances and statistical uncertainty, but it isnot unusual for such incremental advances to be reported byjournalists in glowing terms, involving clich\u00e9s such as\"boffin\" and \"miracle cure\". And in the age of the Internet-taught \"expert patient\", some patients will rapidly becomeaware of these \"breakthroughs\" and demand noveltreatments, sometimes before they have even been licensed. It is important that both basic and clinical cancer researchers take the issue of communication seriously.Unlike most scientists, who have to battle for mediaattention, cancer specialists will often be addressing a largeaudience who are not scientifically literate - who may lackthe training to interpret figures about, for example, the risksof contracting certain cancers or the benefits of a particulardrug. People are prepared to accept risks most if the hazardis familiar, if there is an associated benefit, and if they havesome control over whether they are exposed to it (1). Thismay go some way to explain why, when the connectionbetween smoking and cancer is so widely recognized, about13 million UK adults still smoke. It is also difficult forpeople to understand the complex linkages between geneticsAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3471and cancer. Those who may be at risk cannot always judge the benefits (and the reverse) of genetic tests. Within theprofessional cancer community, too, all cannot readilyunderstand each other's jargon, and even researchers andclinicians in different sub-disciplines can seem to bespeaking different languages. The traditional \"deficit model\" (2) - which would mean a one-way flow of technical information from researchers andoncology specialists to general practitioners, and thence topatients - cannot be the whole story. Generalist physicians,who lack specialist oncology training but are closest toindividual patients' experiences (3), can developcommunication skills that the specialists often lack. In thispresentation I will discuss the need for, and benefits of,improving communication between different cancerprofessionals and between those professionals and those theyseek to serve, and discuss how best to foster this importantskill. 1 Adams J: Risk.

These pumpsrecognize a wide range of drug substrates, mostlyhydrophobic compounds, but also a variety of amphipathicanions and cations. MDR-ABC proteins play an importantrole in cancer drug resistance, but also in the absorption,distribution, metabolism and toxicity (ADME-tox) of severalpharmaceutical agents. The ABCG2 transporter provides tissue protection against numerous toxic compounds and accounts for a multidrug-resistant phenotype in cancer cells. It has been documentedby us and others that ABCG2 displays a high affinityinteraction with several clinically effective small moleculetyrosine kinase inhibitors. These include Iressa signalling, andImatinib (Glivec \u00ae) which inhibits the Bcr-Abl fusion protein, the molecular basis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this study, we investigated the interaction of ABCG2with two second-generation Bcr-Abl inhibitors already in clinical trials, Nilotinib and Bosutinib. We examined theeffects of these compounds on the ATPase activity of thehuman ABCG2, on Hoechst 33342 K562 cells, overexpressing the ABCG2protein (K562/ABCG2). Our data indicate that the novel Bcr-Abl inhibitors have major differences in their interactionprofiles with ABCG2. While Nilotinib is a high affinitysubstrate and at higher concentrations is an effective inhibitorof the transporter, Bosutinib does not significantly interactwith ABCG2 at therapeutically relevant concentrations.These findings may provide important anticancer effects and ADME-Tox properties of noveltyrosine al : transporters.

Furthermore, various growth factors such as VEGFstimulate Ras and activate the MAPK signaling pathway.Therapeutics targeting anti-VEGF, Raf-1 and MEK arecurrently undergoing clinical evaluation on some humanmalignancies. We consider that MAPK signaling pathwayplay an important role in malignant bone and soft tissuetumors. We therefore examined the expression of VEGF, Raf-1 and MEK 1/2 genes and the inhibitory effects of MAPKsignaling pathway. Materials and Methods: Specimens, cell lines and reagent. We used the 20 specimens of human malignant bone and soft tissue tumors, which had beenclinically and historogically diagnosed. Three humanosteosarcoma cell used. cell lines weregrown in Dulbecco's Modified Sigma-Aldrich. U0126, and MEK1/2. Total RNAs were eluted by to a silica-gel-basedmembrane using an RNeasy Mini Kit&reg; (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA wasperformed by using Reverse Transcription System (Promega,Madison, WI). PCR agarose gel, followed by ethidiumbromide dye. The inhibitory effect of Bevacizumab and GW5074 and wereseeded in 96-well cell culture plates. After 48 hours (h), themedium was renewed and Bevacizumab or GW5074 orU0126 was added at the indicated concentrations. After 12,24, 48h, the optical density was measured. The percentviability of each well was calculated. Results: mRNA expression of , Raf-1 mRNA of Raf- 1 and MEK 1/2 was strongly expressed in all 20 specimensand all 6 cell lines. The mRNA of VEGF was expressed in all6 cell lines. The effect of Bevacizumab. Bevacizumab inhibited cell proliferation of all 6 cell lines at the viabilityof 80%. The effect of MAPK signaling pathway inhibitors. GW5074 and U0126 inhibited cell proliferation of all 6 celllines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. 10 M GW5074and 50 M U0126 inhibited cell proliferation by 50% or less.Discussion: The MAPK pathway is very important as a target of molecular therapy, because it is specific in malignanttumors. In our study, the mRNA of Raf-1 and MEK1/2 werestrongly expressed in all the specimens of malignant bone andsoft tissue tumors, and all osteosarcoma and MFH cell lines.MAPK inhibitors GW5074 and U0126 showed an inhibitoryeffect on cell proliferation. These results suggest that theMAPK signaling pathway exists in all malignant bone andsoft tissue tumors and plays an important role in theproliferation of osteosarcoma and MFH. In our study, all celllines exhibited VEGF-gene expression, and inhibition ofVEGF also decreased cell proliferation. These results suggestthat VEGF stimulate not only the vascular growth but also theMAPK signaling pathway. Thus we suggest that both VEGF,and the downstream of Ras have a relationship with thecontrol of cell proliferation in osteosarcoma and Wroclaw Medical University, Poland; 2Division of Molecular Genetics, Institute of Human Genetics, University of Tuebingen, GermanyAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3473Colorectal cancer (CRC) belongs to the group of most frequent cancers in humans. Among all cases of CRC, about75% are sporadic, 5-10% hereditary, while 15% are familial.To date, two main molecular pathways have been revealed asbeing critical in CRC: i) specific for familial adenomatouspolyposis (FAP), which is characterized by loss of functionof APC gene and thereafter chromosomal instability; and ii) specific for hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC),which is characterized by loss of function of one of themutator genes (usually MLH1 or MSH2 ), followed by microsatellite instability. These pathways are also revealedas specific for 85% and 15% of sporadic CRC, respectively. The involvement of epigenetic alternations in molecular etiology of CRC has been discussed for more then 20 years.Thereafter, much of our current knowledge on epigeneticalterations in cancerogenesis comes from studies on CRC.Two epigenetic phenomenon connected with CpG islandmethylation are observed in CRC: i) CpG island methylatorphenotype (CIMP) which is characterized by exceptionallyhigh frequency of methylated CpG islands specificallylocalized in promoter regions of a number of genes; and ii)recently discovered chromosomal domains and involves broadheterochromatin formation accompanied by hypermethylationof clusters of contiguous CpG islands within the region,demonstrating that DNA hypermethylation can span largerchromosomal regions and can lead to silencing of flanking,unmethylated genes. Recently, two LRES domains have beenreported in CRC. One at 2q14.2 by Frigola et al. (2006) and a second localized at 3p22 by Hitchins et al. (2007). It is also noteworthy that both examples of LRES are associated with transcriptional silencing of genes that thatare known to play an important role in carcinogenesis e.g. hMLH1, EN1 (Wnt signaling pathway), GLI2 (sonic hedgehog signaling pathway), (tumor suppressor) and CTDSPL (tumor suppressor). Moreover, aberrant methylation which expands thorough tumor progression ispotentially reversible, opening therefore new perspectives incancer diagnosis and therapy. Altogether these results suggest the interrelationship between MSI, CIMP and LRES in the etiology of CRC. We investigated whether these two phenotypes (CIMP and LRES) are interrelated in CRCs. Both CIMP and methylationof MLH1 gene as well as three CpG islands ( EN1, SCTR and INHBB , corresponding to three 2q14.2) were determined by methylation-specific PCR whileBRAF V600E mutation was by mutated PCR. A total of 88% of cases showedhypermethylation of at least one of the three CpG islandsalong 2q.14.2. The average number of these sites showingmethylation in CIMP+ tumors was 2.21 to -8, Mann-Whitney test).Moreover, all CIMP+ tumors showed hypermethylation of at least one of these loci in contrast to CIMP- tumors, where16% of samples remained unmethylated. The mean numberof simultaneously hypermethylated CpG islands at 2q14.2differed significantly for CIMP- and CIMP+ tumors,suggesting different effects of domain silencing in thisregion. Given that the number of hypermethylated loci at2q14.2 likely affects the range of silenced flanking genes, ahigh frequency of simultaneous hypermethylation of threeCpG islands ( EN1, SCTR and INHBB ) of CRCs. 588 E2F7 EXHIBITS Nicholas Saunders1 1Diamantina Institute for Cancer, Immunology and Metabolic Medicine, University of Queensland, PrincessAlexandra Hospital, Queensland;Departments of 2Surgery and 3Pathology, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Queensland, Australia We have previously shown that inhibition of E2F activity is essential for the initiation of squamous differentiation (1, 2).For this reason, we postulated that endogenous inhibitors ofE2F may exist that are involved in the initiation of squamousdifferentiation. In the present study, we examined thepotential role of E2F7 in regulating E2F-dependent functionsin human keratinocytes (proliferation, differentiation andapoptosis). We found that E2F7b was the most highlyexpressed splice variant of E2F7, whose expression wasrestricted primarily to proliferating keratinocytes. In a seriesof reporter assays, we were able to show that E2F7 couldinhibit E2F1-dependent proliferation markers and couldsensitise keratinocytes to subsequent differentiation stimuli.Based on these data, we propose that E2F7b is likely to be aphysiologically-relevant regulator of the initiation ofsquamous differentiation. We next went on to show thatE2F7b was a potent suppressor of E2F1-induced keratinocyteapoptosis. Combined, these data suggest that theantiproliferative, pro-differentiative activity of E2F7 isconsistent with a tumour suppressor function, whilst theantiapoptotic activity is consistent with that of an oncogene.This situation is the opposite to that reported for E2F1. Thisproposition takes on more significance when combined withour observation that E2F7b and E2F1 are in (SCC). This to SCC formation.ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3474These data would also suggest that the inhibition of E2F7 could be a novel way to induce apoptosis or sensitise SCCsto cytotoxic drugs.1 Auret MM, and Saunders NA: J BiolChem 278(31) : 28516-28522, 2003. 2 Wong CF, Barnes LM, Dahler AL, Smith L, Popa C, Serewko-Auret MM and Saunders NA: Oncogene 24: 3525-3534, 2005. 589 TREATMENT OF METASTATIC MELANOMAPATIENTS WITH TUMOR Ella Institute for Treatment and Research of Melanoma and Skin Cancer, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer 52621,Israel Background and Purpose: After the Surgery Branch/NCI (1), the \"Ella Institute\" at the Sheba Medical Center in Israel, isthe second center worldwide that successfully adopted thetumor-infiltrating-lymphocytes (TIL) technology, whichconsists of the adoptive transfer of large numbers of selectedanti-tumor reactive TIL to lympho-depleted melanomapatients. This protocol requires the generation of multipleindividual TIL cultures from one patient and the in vitro selection of TIL cultures, which specifically secrete IFNafter co-culture with melanoma cells. The establishment ofmultiple, relatively homogenic TIL cultures demands oftenprolonged culture times and many fail the selection criteria.Preclinical animal models and clinical studies have shownthat lymphocytes that spend less time in culture tend to havelonger telomeres and less-differentiated phenotypes, whichcan translate into objective response as well as persistencein vivo (2, 3). Furthermore, extended culture time leads to reduced TIL heterogeneity. Considering these facts amodified clinical protocol using \"young\" TIL, with short-term cultures was applied. This technology furthermore doesnot require the IFN selection criteria, which impact is notfully verified yet. Clinical Study: The eligibility criteria include stage IV melanoma patients, previously treated withchemotherapy and IL-2, a good performance status (PS-0,1)and no brain metastasis. Clinical Protocol: Patients receive non-myeloablative (25 mg/m 2) on days -5 to -1 to TIL infusion(day 0), followed by bolus high-dose IL-2 (720 000IU/kg every 8 h) to a maximum of 15 doses. Results: Until today, 20 melanoma patients have been enrolled to the protocol.Twelve were treated by the selected TIL protocol and 8 weretreated by the \"young\" TIL protocol. The preliminary resultsare encouraging. No treatment-related death or major toxicity(grade 3 or 4, besides from expected pancytopenia) wereobserved. All patients had neutropenic fever. Conclusion: We demonstrate that admission of this novel protocol is feasible.The preliminary results are encouraging but further clinicalstudies are necessary in order to prove the clinical benefit ofthis program.1 Dudley ME.

SchapiroDepartment of Veterinary Sciences, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 650 Cool Water Dr.,Bastrop, TX 78602, USA The use of non-human primates as models in cancer research is increasing in frequency and importance. Giventhe social and cognitive complexity of the species of non-human primates likely to be utilized in cancer-relatedinvestigations, it is of the utmost importance to refine thetechniques used to manage and handle these animals. Whilephysiological measures are often used to assess effects ofmanipulations in many experiments, behavioral factors thatmay influence these physiological measures are toofrequently overlooked. We have demonstrated thatbehavioral factors, such as social housing conditions, thetechniques used to anesthetize the animals, the techniquesused to attain blood samples, and the relocation of animalsfrom one facility to another, can all significantly alterphysiological readouts in a number of non-human primatespecies. Our data indicate that not every behavioral factorwill result in statistically significant changes in all relevantphysiological measures, but many factors will alter variablesvital for assessing disease state. One of the primary valuesof understanding the effects of behavioral factors is to refinemanagement, handling, and research techniques so as tominimize intersubject variability due to potential behavioralconfounds, especially in a Good Laboratory Practicesenvironment. By implementing behavioral refinements thatminimize variability between subjects, critical, andexpensive, experiments involving non-human primatesubjects can be conducted with fewer subjects without areduction in statistical power. Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3475591 NEOADJUV ANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN BARRETT'S CARCINOMA -PROGNOSIS AND RESPONSE PREDICTION M. Schauer , K.P. Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t Munich, Germany It has been shown that the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is increasing at an alarming rate inWestern countries. More than 50% of patients present withlocally advanced disease. In these patients, preoperativechemotherapy appears to increase the chance for a curativeresection and enhance survival in responding patients.Unfortunately Barrett's carcinoma shows a veryheterogenous behaviour in progression and response toneoadjuvant chemotherapy. Response occurs in only 50%of patients after chemotherapy with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracilor leucovorin. If patient outcome could be predictedaccurately, treatments could be tailored individually toavoid chemotherapeutic induced side-effects in non-responding patients. Prediction of the final response seemsto be possible by measuring the metabolic response by PETscans at the beginning and after two weeks ofchemotherapy. Differentiation of responders from non-responders even before starting chemotherapy might bepossible in the future using microarray technology andimmunohistology in endoscopically obtained biopsies ofthe tumor. We found a pattern of 86 genes that were at least 2-fold differentially regulated comparing responding and non-responding adenocarcinomas of the esophagus. Thepredominant genes encoded for the regulation of the cellcycle, transduction, translation, cell-cell interaction,cytoskeleton and the signal transduction. The was seen for the ephrin B3 receptor, a tyrosinkinase that is already known in other tumor entities for itsrole in cell growth, migration and invasion. The receptor isnegatively controlled by the -catenin/TCF-complex. EphrinB3 signaling couples cell contraction with cell-to-celladhesion by promoting the recruitment of E-cadherin to themembrane. In conclusion our results suggest that it could be possible to characterize patients responding to chemotherapy beforestarting the treatment using customized microarray analysis.Ephrin B3 receptor may serve as an important new biologicaltumor marker for local invasion and chemotherapy responseor even as a therapeutically relevant target. Furtherexaminations are necessary to evaluate these results and apossible therapeutic utility. 592 CROSSING THE BARRIER: FROM INTRA VENOUSTO EFFECTIVE ORAL FORMULATIONS OF CHEMOTHERAPY Jan H.M. Schellens The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, NL;Science Faculty, University Utrecht, Utrecht, theNetherlands Oral bioavailability of many anticancer drugs is poor and highly variable. This is a major impediment to thedevelopment of new generation drugs in oncology,particularly those requiring a chronic treatment schedule, a.o.the tyrosine kinase inhibitors and oral 1)cytochrome P450 (CYP, especially CYP3A) activity in gutwall and liver, and 2) drug transporters, such as P-gp andbreast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) in gut walland liver. Shared substrate drugs are affected by thecombined activity of these systems. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo models have in many cases been poorly predictive for oral drug uptake in patients because of a.o. interspeciesdifferences in CYP drug metabolism and intestinal drug-transporting systems. For this reason, we have developednovel and in part humanized systems that allow reliabletranslation of preclinical results to the clinic (Drug MetabDispos 33: 892-895, 2005; J Clin Invest 117: 3583-3592, 2007). Our previous work, also using P-gp knockout (KO) mice, already showed that P-gp has a major effect on the oralbioavailability of several drugs and that blockers of P-gp candrastically improve oral bioavailability of the importantanticancer drug paclitaxel and other drugs 2001). This work revealed, however, that apart from P-gp, other drug-transporting systems and CYP effects also determine overalloral drug uptake. Indeed, we demonstrated that blockade ofABCG2 profoundly increased the oral bioavailability oftopotecan in mice In addition, we demonstrated in four phase II activity studies that 'boosting' of the oral bioavailability of thewidely reviewed by us in TIPS 27: 17-24, 2006). More recently we demonstrated that in order to enable oraltherapy with docetaxel, the boosting agent CsA could wellbe replaced by the more effective CYP3A ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3476inhibitor ritonavir; this concept has been proven in our mouse models (Cancer Res 62: 6158-6164, 2002) and in patients (BCPT, 2007; Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2008, in press). For the preclinical and clinical studies the intravenous (i.v.) solutions of paclitaxel and docetaxel have been used, as these drugs are only available for i.v.use. However, these formulations are highly unsuitable for further oral clinicaldevelopment for practical and safety reasons and due tolimited pharmaceutical stability. For this reason, we havedeveloped a range of novel capsule formulations of docetaxeland paclitaxel that need urgently to be tested in patients withcancer. Preclinical pharmaceutical tests performed by usreveal excellent dissolution of active drug. 593 TRANSGENIC STRATEGIES TO STUDY HUMAN DISEASES Johannes SchenkelGerman Cancer Research Centre and University, Heidelberg, Germany Transgenic mice exhibit an enormous scientific potential for many purposes, including serving as a specific in vivo model for human diseases. Different techniques are used to generategenetically modified animals harbouring a gain or a loss offunction. The number of transgenic mice is increasingrapidly. Small populations, continued danger of loss, theneed to keep these mutants in stock and frequent interchangeof transgenic mice between different facilities are some ofthe major challenges for laboratory animal scientists whendealing with these unique mutants. Two transgenic mouse models for human diseases will be presented: The regulation of the human papilloma virus (HPV) 11: About 100 HPVs; are described, some of them are associated with malignant growth, others with benignproliferations. Subsequently it is of paramount interest tounderstand their regulation, but these viruses show a highhost-specificity. To study HPV-regulation in a human-free in vivo-system transgenic mice were generated carrying a reporter gene under control of the key regulatory element(URR) of HPV11. A developmentally regulated, inducible,and specific transcription was observed, but the expressionpattern in the original target (skin) was not satisfying in thishost and virus free system. To be closer to the in vivo conditions, a transgenic mouse model was establishedexpressing the virus activity influencing protein: HPV11-E2.The transgenic expression of the E2 did not lead tophenotypic changes. E2/URR11 double-transgenic mice arealready bred to study the HPV11 regulation in more detail.Signal transduction in a mouse model for neuro-degenerativediseases: Neurodegenerative diseases often result in an (excessive) neuronal cell death, leading often to a large, non-reversible injury. However, the molecular mechanisms or pathways responsible are not fully understood. The c-Jun transcription factor plays a crucial role in promoting apoptosis, inhibition of its activation might reducethe size of cell death and thus increase functional outcome.Several genetically modified mice influencing c-Jun and itspathways at various steps and were investigated in a modelfor experimental stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases.Our data suggest that attenuation rather than a complete blockof c-Jun action appears more promising for therapy of stroke. 594 ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF GLIOMAS IN RELATION WITH PROGNOSIS AND THERAPIES D. Schiffer , M. Mellai, V University of Turin, Vercelli, Italy The origin of gliomas is discussed in the light of the classic experiments of transplacental induction of tumorsby nitrosoureas in the rat and their development fromgerminative and subventricular zones. Today this originbecame a general knowledge supported by an extensiveliterature on stem cells, progenitors and precursors withthe recognition of the existence of brain tumor stem cells.Two concepts are fundamental: the relationship betweenfactors regulating cytogenesis and the genetic alterationswhich characterize tumor transformation and theimportance of epigenetic events. The possibility thatdifferentiated cells may revert to a stem cell-like status andthat undifferentiated cells may acquire the same status,assume a particular significance in tumor progression. Allthese considerations affect histological diagnosis,prognosis and therapy of gliomas, including their cellresistance. The problem becomes more complicated notonly if other characteristics of tumor malignancy areconsidered, such as cell motility and migration, but alsothe recently acquired knowledge that stem cells from SVZor hemispheric adult cells of the astrocytic lineage canmove toward the tumor or that non tumor adult astrocytescan be recruited into the tumor. To the observationsconcerning the different molecular pathways leading totumor transformation, those based on the recent use ofsiRNA and those carried out on the apoptosis/autophagysystem must be added. 595 DOWNSTREAM AKT REGULATION OFPROLIFERATION, APOPTOSIS AND AUTOPHAGY IN GLIOBLASTOMASAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3477D. Vercelli; 2DISCAF and 3Clinical and Experimental Medical Department, University of East Piedmont, Novara, Italy PI3/AKT pathway plays an important role in the process of transformation of gliomas. Under the control of growthfactors, it terminates by regulating proliferation andapoptosis. Two steps in the pathway, STAT3 and mTOR(target for Rapamycin) have been recognized as possibletargets for tumor therapy, but in human gliomas theircorrelation with proliferation and apoptosis are notcompletely known. In 64 gliomas STAT3 and mTOR havebeen investigated by molecular genetics, immunohisto-chemistry and Western blotting in relation withEGFR, S6 increased with malignancy grade, but only S6correlated with the proliferation index, whereas there was agood correlation of EGFR/EGFRvIII with AKT. Both STAT3and mTOR correlated with AKT and in the terminal part ofthe pathway S6 indicated SK1 as an important step towardproliferation. No correlation was found of STAT3 and mTORwith apoptosis, maybe for technical difficulties of itsdemonstration in tumor tissues. On the contrary, both wereinversely correlated with Beclin 1, in line with the knowledgethat autophagy is not activated in malignant gliomas. Therationale for the identification of STAT3 and mTOR astherapy targets seems to be well-grounded in human gliomas. 596 ELECTRON EMISSION FROM GENISTEIN Getoff, H. Schittl and R.M. Quint Section of Radiation Biology, Department of Nutrition Sciences, The University of Vienna, Althanstr. 14, UZA II,A-1090 Vienna, Austria Genistein (GEN; 4',5,7-Trihydroxyisoflavone) is a phytohormone with biological properties similar to those ofestradiol. It has been established that GEN showsantiangiogenetic and antitumor effects in vivo (1). Very recently it was observed that under the influence of oxidizing(OH, O 2-), as well as reducing free radicals (e- aq, H etc.), GEN features a strongly expressed antitumor ability in vitro and acts synergistically on mitomycin C (2). On the other hand it has been demonstrated that sexual hormones such as 17-estradiol, progesterone (3), as well astestosterone (4) can eject electrons from their excited singlet state in polar media. Under certain biological conditions thisability of the hormones can result into metabolites involvedin the initiation of breast and prostate cancer, respectively. The present work reports the electron ejection from in singlet state excited GEN, initiated by coefficients ( in L.mol -1.cm-1) at the absorption maxima (270 nm) it was proved that GEN has a tendency to form \"associates\"(labile GEN-complexes) at concentrations above 5\u00d710 -6 mol.L-1. On the other hand GEN possesses high reactivity towards e- aq, k(e- aq+ GEN) = 6.2\u00d7109L.mol-1.s-1(5). As a result of solvated electrons could not be hand using air-free, aqueous5\u00d710 -5mol.L-1 GEN at 30, aq) = 1.9\u00d710-3, observed, indicating that the Q(e- aq)- yield also depends on temperature. The biological consequences of the bifunctional property of GEN: electron emission and electron consumption in respectto cancer are discussed. Its bifunctional ability enables GEN tocommunicate with other systems in the organism.1 Wietrzyk J et al : Antiangiogenic and antitumor effects in vivo of genistein applied alone or combined with cyclophosphamide.

Medical Clinic, 2Institute of Pathology and 3Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Johannes Gutenberg-University, 55101 Mainz, Germany Background: The advantage of tissue microarray (TMA) is its ability to efficiently analyze large numbers of tissuespecimens in a methodologically uniform way. The reliabilityof TMAs especially with regard to clinicopathologicalcharacterizations when compared to conventionalimmunohistochemistry (IHC) was evaluated. Materials and Methods: Seventy two embedded tissue sections from lung cancer patients were stained with monoclonal antibodiesagainst the tumor-associated markers TA-MUC1 and LewisY . Three representative cores of every tumor were embeddedin a paraffin array multiblock. The IHC was evaluated by theimmunoreactive score (IRS). Results: The data for the TMA IHC and the conventional IHC were concordant (kappa80%) for both markers. Likewise, discordance (McNemar'stest) was low and sensitivity and specificity were above 80%for both markers. In the samples with high positiveexpression, the concordance increased (kappa 90%)discordance disappeared (McNemar p=1.0) and sensitivity and specificity increased above 90% for both markers. UsingCox regression models, all the clinicopathologicaldependencies were equivalent for both techniques and bothmarkers. Conclusion: Immunohistochemistry with tissue microarrays is valid and provides results equivalent toconventional immunohistochemistry with respect toexpression patterns BCL-XL, AND PP32/PHAPI IN RESECTEDNON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER PATIENTS Lars Henning Schmidt 1, Andreas K\u00fcmmel1, Martin Schuler M.2, Stefan Biesterfeld3, Andreas Taube1, Rainer Wiewrodt1 1Pulmonary Division, III. Medical Clinic, 3Institute of Pathology, and 4Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Johannes Gutenberg-University Medical Center, 55101 Mainz; 2Department of Medicine (Cancer Research), West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, 45122 Essen,Germany Deregulation of apoptosis signaling is commonly found in cancer cells. Some studies suggest that overexpression of theanti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in non-small cell lungcancer (NSCLC) is associated with adverse prognosis. This isthought to result from their function as cell death suppressorsand resistance factors in the mitochondrial pathway. Anotherimportant factor in this pathway is pp32/PHAPI, as it seems to sensitize NSCLC cells to apoptotic stimuli and thus permittingan improved outcome in patients following chemotherapy foradvanced NSCLC. However, contradicting observations havebeen described by other groups. Against this background, wehave evaluated the prognostic effect of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, andpp32/PHAPI expression in tumor samples from 87 surgicallyresected NSCLC patients using tissue microarrayimmunohistochemistry. Bcl-xL expression was immuno-histochemically detectable in 20 cases (23%), Bcl-2 in 25 cases(29%) and pp32/PHAPI in 78 cases (90%). Using Coxproportional hazards models, Bcl-xL and pp32/PHAPIexpression, normal lung function and early stage wereidentified as independent favorable prognostic factors inNSCLC patients. This contrasted the established role of anti-apoptotic proteins as resistance factors in patients receivingchemotherapy. Interestingly, impairment of lung function wasassociated with Bcl-2 expression, which may suggest abiological involvement of Bcl-2 family proteins in thepathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, whichcommonly precedes the development of NSCLC. Vedbaek, Denmark Cancer cell invasion is a multicellular process involving a heterogeneous group of stromal cells in addition to thecancer cells themselves. The fibroblasts constitute a basiccomponent among stromal cells that contribute to matrixremodeling, synthesis and degradation. In mostadenocarcinomas, the fibroblasts are found as activated andmyo-differentiated fibroblasts, found benign, pre-invasive ( in situ ) and invasive carcinomas, and thus, are not an indication of malignancyitself. However, myofibroblasts start expressing novel matrixdegrading (DCIS) to invasive breast cancer, and therefore are likely to promote thetransition to invasion by degrading basement membranecollagen and laminin. We have recently identified somemicroRNAs in cancer associated fibroblasts. MicroRNAsrepresent a new and relatively uncharacterized group of 20-24nt long RNA sequences that show great promise asbiomarkers in cancer. They can be detected in tissuesections by in situ hybridization using locked nucleic acid(LNA)-modified oligos. Although little is known about theprecise functional aspects of microRNA, they have alreadyAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3479been shown to be important regulators that influence major biological processes, including tumorigenesis. 600 MULTIPLEXED PROTEIN ANALYSIS APPLIED TO BREAST CANCER BIOPSIES Nicole Schneiderhan-Marra 1, Georg Sauer2, Helmut Deissler2and Thomas Joos1 1NMI, Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen, Markwiesenstra\u00dfe 55, 72770Reutlingen; 2Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Ulm Medical School, Frauensteige 14, 89075 Ulm,Germany One of the most promising approaches in cancer research is the identification of biomarkers that allow defining of patientsubgroups that will benefit from specific treatment schemes.Potential biomarkers or pattern of biomarkers can beidentified using a target-driven approach. Protein microarrayscan be applied to simultaneously quantify numerous targetproteins from minimal amounts of sample material. We have used the bead-based Luminex technology to develop multiplexed sandwich immunoassays to analyze aset of 54 pre-defined breast cancer relevant proteins: 113lysates of shock-frozen large core needle biopsies wereanalysed using these assays. Validation of the bead-basedimmunoassays was carried out by comparing HER2 and ERprotein expression with data obtained by the correspondingimmunohistochemical routine assessment. Concordance of the generated protein expression data sets with results of conventional immunohistochemical stainingwas demonstrated for the expression of the estrogen receptorand of HER 2. Furthermore, a set of five proteins wasidentified, which allows the prediction of nodalinvolvement. Further methodological refinement ofmultiparametric protein analyses and associated clinicalstudies will most likely lead to parameter sets which definesubgroups of patients who will benefit from specifictreatment regimens. 601 CONTEMPORARY TREATMENT OF and Raimund Winter University of Graz, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Auenbruggerplatz 14, A - 8036 Graz, AustriaOvarian cancer continues to be one of the major causes ofdeath from cancer among women in the Western world. Themajority of patients present with stage III or IV disease andthe advanced stage of disease at the time of diagnosis is the main factor contributing to the overall poor prognosis. In this review we give an overview on screening, FIGO staging, survival rates, prognostic factors and oncontemporary treatment in early and advanced ovarian cancer. In particular we report on our experience with multivisceral cytoreductive surgery in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.Additionally, we outline the role of adjuvant chemotherapy asa standard of care and the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy,intraperitoneal chemotherapy and hyperthermic intraperitonealchemotherapy (HIPEC) as possible prospective standards ofcare in patients with ovarian cancer. 602 MIGRATION STIMULATING FACTOR (MSF) AS AMEDIATOR OF EPITHELIAL-STROMALINTERACTIONS IN HUMAN TUMOURS Ana M. Schor , Ian R. Ellis, Sarah J. Jones, Stephane Perrier, Go Ohe and Seth S. Schor Unit of Cell and Molecular Biology, The Dental School, University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 4HR, UK Migration stimulating 70 kDa truncated isoform of fibronectin. It is generated from a foreshortenedpre-message produced by the transcriptional read oncofetal regulatory constitutively expressed by three cell populations (epithelial, fibroblast andendothelial) during fetal development, not expressed in themajority of healthy adult tissues, and re-expressed by bothtumour and tumour-associated stromal fibroblasts derived from distant, uninvolved sites inbreast cancer patients. Recent data indicate that the level ofMSF expression by carcinoma cells and tumour-associatedfibroblasts is inversely related to survival in patients withoral and breast tumours. Cultured fibroblasts maintain the MSF production status of their tissue of origin. We have recently developedexperimental protocols that enable us to induce MSF-producing fibroblasts to switch-off MSF expression and,conversely, to induce normal adult fibroblasts to switch-onMSF. These changes in MSF expression are hereditable(persistent in the absence of further treatment), butcompletely reversible, suggesting that the switch-on and-offof MSF expression is controlled by epigenetic mechanisms. Recombinant MSF displays a number of bioactivities of relevance to cancer development and metastasis, includingstimulation of cell invasion through 3D matrices, hyaluronansynthesis, angiogenesis and proteolytic activity. Two MSFisoforms have been cloned, and inhibitors produced byepithelial and endothelial cells have been identified. Our dataANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3480indicate that MSF acts as a paracrine and autocrine factor on three cell populations (epithelial, endothelial and fibroblasts)and its bioactivity is modulated by the type of isoformproduced, the presence of other soluble factors and thenature of the extracellular matrix in contact with the cells. 603 MYTHS AND FACTS IN THE SURGICALMANAGEMENT Guido SchumacherDepartment of Visceral-, and Transplantation Surgery, Virchow Klinikum, Berlin,Germany Indication, surgical procedures, and postoperative management has been developed during the last centuries toreach the modern standards of patient care. Since theintroduction of evidence based medicine, many clinical trialshave been performed to prove or disprove effects of certainsteps of surgical management. However, many of the actualdiagnostic and therapeutic steps have never been proven,even though their necessity and usefulness is considered tobe essential for a successful treatment. A major reason maybe the opinion of individual specialists who internationallyreport on their personal experiences as given facts. This hasa particular impact if a leading specialist is able to teachother specialists who then spread certain techniques inpatient care and surgery. The value of personal experienceappears to be valuable, since the disease and presents with avery large individual variability, which makes clinical trialsoften difficult and cause criticism. Examples of non-evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic steps are the useof certain drainages, certain anastomotic techniques,strategies for the treatment of anastomotic leakages andperitonitis and others. We will discuss important steps of theperioperative management with emphasis on the actualevidence, which is based on clinical trials or personalexperiences of specialists. 604 PRO AND CONS Lichtenegger Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Charite Medical University, Germany Despite maximal cytoreduction and adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin, a large number of patientswith epithelial ovarian cancer will suffer from tumorrecurrence within 3 years after their initial diagnosis. In contrast to the situation of patients with primary ovarian cancer the value of surgery in the salvage setting iscontroversially discussed. Two prognostic groups should be differentiated: patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer and those withplatinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The indication for surgeryis palliation to control clinical symptoms ( e.g. bowel obstruction) and to increase the progression free survival andoverall survival. Nevertheless, the pros and cons argumentsbase on retrospective data, only. Based on the availableevidence from the literature and a large series of data fromour center, all surgical aspects are discussed in detail. 605 ROLE OF BLM 110067, India Mutations in BLM helicase causes Bloom Syndrome, characterized by predisposition to all forms of cancer. Hencelack of BLM and its interactions with its partners can lead toderegulation of RAD51-mediated homologous recombination.We have demonstrated that BLM, signal transducer 53BP1 andRAD51 form a trimeric complex both in vitro and in vivo . Phosphorylation in specific domains of the three proteinsmediated this interaction. Presence of BLM enhanced theinteraction between 53BP1 and RAD51. The interactionsbetween the three proteins had functional consequences. Lackof 53BP1 decreased cell survival and enhanced chromosomalaberration after replication arrest. 53BP1 exhibited both BLM-dependent of of BLM and 53BP1 synergisticallyenhanced stress-dependent HR. These results provide evidenceregarding the cooperation between two signal transducers, BLMand 53BP1, during maintenance of genomic integrity. 606 CUTANEOUS 2, SI-1000 Ljubljana, the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3481Electrochemotherapy is a local drug delivery approach aimed at treatment with palliative intent of cutaneous andsubcutaneous high intrinsic cytotoxicity,such as bleomycin or cisplatin, at the site of electric pulseapplication. Physicochemical basis of this therapy allows prediction that electrochemotherapy has good antitumor effect on alltumor types, which was demonstrated in several clinicalstudies. The results of the clinical trial demonstrated that anobjective response rate of 85% (73.7% complete responserate) was achieved on the electrochemotherapy-treated tumornodules, regardless of tumor histology, and drug used(bleomycin, cisplatin) or route of its administration(intravenous, intratumoral). Most frequently it is used in thetreatment of multiple cutaneous metastases of melanomawhen they cannot be surgically excised due to their numberor localization. In such cases, long-term remission up toseveral years can be obtained. Electrochemotherapy can alsobe used as a cytoreductive treatment before surgical resectionin an organ-sparing attempt. Bleeding skin melanoma metastases are a common but difficult management problem. Many patients are in poorphysical condition, and therefore electrochemotherapy isvery convenient, as it is quick, outpatient-based andeffective. The effectiveness on bleeding tumors is due tovascular disrupting effect of electrochemotherapy. Theunderlying mechanism of blood flow reduction and vasculardisrupting action has been studied extensively. Inelectrochemotherapy, where endothelial cells are in directcontact with the chemotherapeutic drugs, they undergo celldeath due to the increased drug uptake. Electrochemotherapy is now a clinically acknowledged method for the treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneoustumors. Its advantages are high effectiveness on tumors withdifferent histology, simple application, minimal side-effectsand the possibility of effective repetitive treatment. 607 MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF BREAST CANCERMETASTASIS TO BONE IN AN \"ALL HUMAN\"NOD/SCID MOUSE MODEL W. Yang, P. Lam, Y . Amemiya, H. Kahn, A. Yee, C. Holloway and A. Seth Sunnybrook Research Institute, University of Toronto,Toronto, ON, Canada Background: Bone is the most common site of metastasis in breast cancer, affecting up to 80% of women with advanceddisease, leading to bone complications or skeletal-relatedevents. Current studies on the bone metastasis process have been hampered by the lack of preclinical models to evaluatenovel therapeutics and to study the biology of the disease.Materials and Methods: To create an \"all human\" mouse model that explicitly investigate the bone metastatic behaviorof human breast tumors, we first engrafted human bonefragments into the both flanks of NOD/SCID mice andsubsequently transplanted primary human breast tumor underonly left flanks of the hu-bone NOD/SCID mice. Results: We found that engrafted human bone remains functional formore than 20 weeks of implantation and that approximately30% of primary breast tumors survived and generated tumorswhen placed into hu-bone NOD/SCID mice. Afterperforming serial re-transplantation breast tumors, we observed metastasis to theopposite tumor-free human bone fragments and some hosttissues including kidney, lung and lymph nodes.Interestingly, none of the human breast tumors metastasizedto the mouse skeleton, providing evidence that species-species osteotropism is essential for bone metastasis. Geneexpression profiles using whole genome microarrays weregenerated from engrafted patient breast tumors to identifygenes that correlate with growth and metastasis. Two groupsof clinically significant genes are emerging from our ongoingresults. One group represents genes associated with thefuture biological behavior of the original patient tumors.They are found by comparing gene levels between patientbreast tumors that did and did not metastasize in the hu-boneNOD/SCID model. A second set of genes associated with themetastatic phenotype, but not necessarily predictive of thatstate, are revealed by comparing gene expression levelsbetween the original patient tumors and the tumors that formin the human bone implants and mouse tissues. In the firstgroup, relative to the non-metastatic tumor, 36 genes withsignificantly altered expression pattern were found in theprimary tumors that subsequently metastasized in the mousemodel. In the second group, relative to the original patienttumors, 205 genes were found to be significantly altered intumors that grew in first human bone implants. Of these, 183were also found in tumors that metastasized to secondinitially tumor-free human bone implants and in lungmetastases. Two of these include CSF1R which is up- regulated and IGFBP7 which is down-regulated. Both IGFBP-7 and CSF1R are important in mammary gland development and have been implicated in breastcarcinogenesis and associated with poor outcome in breastcancer patients. Conclusion: By using the \"all human\" NOD/SCID mouse model we have identified many potentialtargets that are up- or down-regulated in bone metastaticbreast tumor samples. We anticipate that our study will helpin developing breast cancer biomarkers for patients that areat high risk for bone metastasis and will be valuable forclinical diagnosis and treatment.ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3482This work was supported by the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Alliance special program grant on metastasis. 608 THE ANTICARCINOGENIC ACTIVITY OFVITAMIN D WITH AND WITHOUT IONIZINGRADIATION Shraga ShanyDepartment of Clinical Biochemistry, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, 84105, Israel Recent data suggest that besides its major role in mineral homeostasis, the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin-D 3(1.25(OH)2D3) has an anti-carcinogenic activity. However, its therapeutic use is limited, since itcauses hypercalcemia in the concentrations effective for cellgrowth inhibition. In order to overcome this limitation, thepresent study have checked two attitudes: i) The possible useof the less-calcemic vitamin D synthetic analog 1.25-dihydroxy,16-ene,24-oxo,vitamin D 3(JK-1624-3 ) and to compare its anti-carcinogenic activity, in vitro , with that of the native vitamin D active metabolite, 1.25(OH)2D3. ii) The possible use of lower concentrations of 1.25(OH)2D3in combinations with other anti-carcinogenic agents, in order toget an additive or even synergistic effects. Similarly, thecombination of vitamin D treatment with ionizing radiationwas tested in vitro on prostate cancer cells. Radiotherapy, by itself, is a common effective anticarcinogenic treatment. However, this treatment isaccompanied by many complications. The possibility thatpretreatment with vitamin D and other anticarcinogenicagents will potentiate the therapeutic effect of radiation wasassessed in the present study. Incubation of cancer cells (HL-60, HT-29, LNCaP cell lines) with JK-1624-3 revealed asignificant cell proliferation, similar to thatobtained by 1.25(OH) 2D3. These effects were found to be dose- and time-dependent. These vitamin D compoundscause a significant induction of cell cycle arrest in the G1-phase, as determined by FACS analysis. Incubations of HL- 60cells with either 1.25(OH) 2D3, or the synthetic analog, revealed a very significant differentiation to monocyte-likecells, as expressed by the increased levels of CD-11b andCD-14 in the treated cells. The combined treatment ofvitamin D, valproic acid and radiation was tested onandrogen-refractory prostate cancer cell line DU-145 . While radiation alone caused 30.6% cell growth inhibition,pretreatment with 1.25(OH) 2D3, valproic acid, or agents, revealed cell growth inhibition of 46.4%, 83.0% and87.9%, respectively. Cell cycle analysis showed that radiationfollowing the combined treatment resulted in an increase inapoptosis and cell accumulation mainly in the S-phase of cellcycle. In conclusion, the present results confirm the anticarcinogenic activity of the native vitamin D activemetabolite. These results emphasize the possible therapeuticuse of less calcemic vitamin D analogs, such as JK-1624-3.The combined pretreatment potentiates the effect of radiationand therefore may allow the use of lower concentrations of1.25(OH) 2D3, on one hand, and lower radiation doses, on the other hand. This combined treatment may be more effectivewith fewer side-effects. 609 COMBINED PRETREATMENT OF VITAMIN D ANDHISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITOR ENHANCESSENSITIVITY Soroka Medical Center and Faculty of Health Sciences,Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel Radiotherapy is known to be an effective treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). However, many complications areinvolved including rectal bleeding, erectile dysfunction andurinary incontinence. Therefore, it is important to developPCa-sensitizing pretreatments that could potentiate thetherapeutic effect of radiation, allow the use of lowerradiation doses and limit the side-effects. Toward these aims, we suggest combining the anticarcinogenic vitamin D active metabolite, 1,25(OH) 2D3, and sodium valproate (an antiepileptic drug that inhibitshistone deacetylase activity) in order to sensitize PCa cellsto radiation. The rationale of this notion is based onpreclinical studies reporting increased efficiency of radiationafter et al. , 2005). We evaluated the effect of the suggested treatment on the androgen-refractoryPCa cell line DU145. Cancer cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FCS. DU145 cells werepretreated for three days with 100 nM 1,25(OH) 2D3or 1 mM sodium valproate, or their combination. After that, PCa cellswere irradiated with a dose of 4 Gy and grown for additionalfour days. Irradiation by itself decreased sodium valproate or with a combination of both drugs reduced PCa cell growth by 46.4%, 83.0% and87.9%, respectively ( p<0.0001). Cell-cycle analysis showed that the cell growth-inhibiting effect of these treatments wasa result of increased apoptosis and altered cell-cycledistribution. Irradiation induced apoptosis and caused accumulation of DU145 cells in the S-phase and to a lesser extent in theAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3483G2/M-phase of the cell-cycle in both untreated and pretreated cells. These changes were found to be maximal inthe cells pretreated with sodium valproate alone. pretreatment with 1,25(OH) 2D3 and sodium valproate had the greatest effect in suppressingPCa cell growth. In conclusion, the results support our hypothesis that a combination of 1,25(OH) 2D3and sodium valproate is highly efficient in potentiating the anticancer activity of ionizingradiation. As such, we believe that this combinedpretreatment may provide the basis for the clinicalapplication of radiotherapy for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. 610 EFFECT OF ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ( IL-4, IL-10 ) CYTOKINE GENES IN University, Chandigarh; 2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh,India; 3Research Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, Hormozgan University of Medical Science, Iran- Bandar-Abbas. Objectives: Cervical cancer is rated the second most common malignant tumour globally and is an etiologicallylinked to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 are cytokines with anti-inflammatoryproperties. The purpose of this study was to determine therelationship of different alleles of IL-4 and IL-10 genes as passive smokers and use of oral contraceptives to risk ofcervical cancer. Materials and Methods: We investigated the association of cervical cancer with two anti-inflammatory(IL-4, IL-10 ) cytokine genes in a case-control study. The study sample comprised 200 cases of cervical cancer and anequal number of matched controls by variables number oftandem repeat (VNTR) and RFLP analysis. Results: In this study the Rp1/Rp2 genotype of IL-4 gave a borderline increased risk of developing cervical cancer (OR-1.3,95%CI-0.45-3.64, p=0.8). In the case of passive smokers, we also found a marginal increased risk of cervical cancer withACand combined non-significant association wasobserved between the use of oral contraceptives and risk ofcervical cancer with these two anti-inflammatory cytokineswith different genotypes. Conclusion: The present study suggested an increased risk for developing cervical cancer inNorth Indian female passive smokers having IL-4 Rp1/Rp2 and IL-10 (AC) genotypes. of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran Introduction: Medicinal plants have been used for the treatment of disease in many countries. Traditional medicinehas a long history in Iran. Medicinal plants are used to treatsome of cancer symptoms, such as pain, which is commonwith all kinds of cancers. The aim of this study was toexplore the medicinal plants prescribed by the traditionalherbal sellers in North of Iran, Gorgan. Materials and Methods: The study was undertaken in Golestan province in the North of Iran. We conducted open interviews with all oftraditional sellers of medicinal plants in Gorgan. All of theinterviews were tape recorded. The data were coded andcategorized as it is usual in qualitative methods. Results: The current survey revealed that thirteen medicinal plants andalso some of the vegetables and fruits such as carrot, tomatoand garlic are prescribed by the traditional sellers for thecancer remedy. Rosemary, Borage, Salix aegyptiaca are well-known plants Thistle,Common Corncokle, Fumitory, Milfoil, Quercus, and Rubraalso are recommended for a variety of cancers, such as skinand stomach cancer. Conclusion: The data indicated that the use of herbal remedies is very common. Their use seems tobe cultural, rather than attributable to decreased access tohealth care. Most herbs used pose no threat to health. Insome cases, remedies may be blended with traditionalmedical treatments to ensure better patient compliance. 612 FURTHER EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE OF THE NOVEL RHENIUM AND PLATINUM ANTITUMOR SYSTEM Natalia Shtemenko 1, Alexander Shtemenko3 Maymard, Bastia, of dichlorotetra--isobutyratodirhenium(III) (Re1) anddichlorotetra--adamantylcarboxylatedirhenium(III) (Re2)alone and together with were ofANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3484rat-specific Guerin'k carcinoma (T8). Especially good results were obtained when cisplatin was used together with rheniumsubstances introduced according to the scheme of antioxidanttherapy via a new Re-Pt antitomor system. Data onapplications of heavy metal compounds in medicine are verysignificant and a dirhenium cis-dicarboxylate compound with propionate ligands was found to be active against some typesof cancer in animal models. We found the nature of theligands situated around the cluster fragments played a role inthe phenomena. Here, the data about structure and antitumorproperties of cis-[Re 2(GABA)2Cl5(H2O)]2H2O (Re3) alone and in the Re-Pt system was shown and the possible impactof the size and nature of the acid radicals in the molecule ofthe rhenium cluster to that properties is discussed. It was shown that Re3 had its own anticancer properties in this model (stronger than that of Re1 and Re2), but enhancedcisplatin action on tumor growth less effectively than thesesubstances. Application of Re3 as a biochemical modulatorof cisplatin action was especially successful under applicationof liposomal forms of Re3 and in the majority of experiments,led to disappearance of tumor cells, and to an increase ofquantities of normal RBC forms, their stability and Hb levelin blood of tumor-bearing animals. Interaction of liposomalforms of Re3 with red blood cells in experiments in vitro showed its cell-stabilizing properties. In the models of tumorgrowth and hemolytic anemia in vivo , liposomal forms had better therapeutic effect in comparison with their solutions. The process of formation of liposomes of Re3 was investigated by the method of electronic absorption spectraand mechanism of the interaction with lipids is proposed.Encapsulation of a cluster rhenium compounds to lipidcoating may have an activation significance for the quadrupleRe-Re bond. Antitumor properties of the rheniumdicarboxylates with cis-carboxylate groups around cluster rhenium fragment may be explained first of all by theantiradical properties of the quadruple metal-to-metal bondbetween the two rhenium atoms. The binuclear cluster Re 26+- fragment is a part of these compounds and includes multiplerhenium - rhenium bonds with -component, which playsthe role of free radical \"scavenger\" by virtue of minor energy-* cleavage. The role of the ligands may be revealed bythe rate of interactions with phosphate groups of lipidmembranes and other molecules of living cells. 613 BIOMOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME ANDPERITUMORAL TISSUE Gigliola Sica Institute of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome,ItalyIn recent years, a new level of understanding into the biology of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been reached.Alterations of several tumor suppressor genes and oncogeneshave been reported to be critical to the initial steps ofneoplastic transformation. The relevance of some growthfactor pathways to the development and progression of GBMhas been recognized and significant efforts have been madeto clarify the mechanisms driving angiogenesis whichrepresents a key event in tumor growth. A possiblerelationship between GBM stem cells and neural stem cellspersisting in the neurogenic zones of the adult brain has beenhypothesized. On the contrary, a research delay occurredconcerning the biomolecular characterization of peritumoraltissue which may have relevant clinical implications due tothe peculiar growth pattern of GBM. We previously reported the presence of activated MAP kinases in tumor (1st area) and peritumoral tissue of GBM.In particular, we found that phosphorylated ERK1/2 isexpressed in tissue surrounding GBM at a distance from < 1cm to 3.5 cm from the tumor margin. No statisticallysignificant difference existed in the expression between the1st area and the surrounding tissue. Phosphorylated ERK1/2immunoreactivity was independent of the presence ofneoplastic elements and present not only in activatedastrocytes but in apparently normal glial cells also.Phosphorylated (p) JNK followed the same expressionpathway. In addition, we demonstrated that the stem cellmarker nestin is present in peritumoral tissue even if in avery low cell percentage including neoplastic cells, activatedastrocytes and again apparently normal glial cells. Finally,we reported that the ratios pJNK/nestin and (pJNK/totalJNK)/nestin in the area located at a distance <1 cm from thetumor margin have a prognostic significance in GBMpatients. Nestin was also expressed in the vessel endotheliumboth in GBM and in peritumoral tissue. Since it is believed to be a marker for endothelial cells in active proliferation, we hypothesized that a foundation ofneoangiogenesis occurred in the tissue surrounding GBM.For this reason, we studied the expression of nestin inassociation with CD105 (endoglin) in tissue localized at adistance <1 cm (2nd area) and between 1 cm and 3.5 cmfrom the tumor border (3rd area). CD105 is a proliferation-associated and hypoxia-inducible transmembraneglycoprotein abundantly expressed in proliferatingendothelial cells involved tumoral neoangiogenesis. Toquantify the degree of neoangiogenesis, the mostvascularized areas tissue (hot-spots) were nestin- or CD105-positive endothelial cell or groupof endothelial cells was counted as an individual vessel at\u00d7200 magnification. The mean value of the vessel count infive fields was considered the final value of the microvesseldensity (MVD). CD105 was exclusively expressed inendothelial cells. CD105-MVD was higher in GBM than inAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3485the peritumoral tissue, no statistically significant difference existing between the 2nd and the 3rd area. A similar trendwas observed for nestin-MVD in peritumoral areas. Apositive correlation was found for both nestin and CD105-MVD in the 2nd and 3rd areas. A correlation betweensurvival and CD105-MVD was found in the 3rd area. In fact,the median survival time was longer for patients withCD105-MVD values <8.0 compared with patients withhigher values. The survival difference was present in the firstperiod of follow-up. Our results suggest that in the peritumoral tissue a transformation occurs which is probably induced by growthfactors produced by the tumor mass and that this process issupported by an activation of vascularization. 614 DEVELOPING APTAMERS AS EFFECTIVEANTICANCER AGENTS OR RECOGNITION UNITS IN BIOSENSOR TECHNOLOGIES S.C. Simmons 1, M.N. Velasco-Garcia1, P.E.C. Brenchley2, E. McKenzie3 and S. Missailidis1 1Department of Chemistry and Analytical Sciences, The Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA; 2Renal Research Laboratories, Manchester Institute of Nephrology and Transplantation; 3Faculty of Life Sciences, Michael Smith Building, Oxford Road, University of Manchester, M13 9PT, UK Background: Aptamers are lengths of single or double stranded nucleotides, typically between 22 and 100 baseslong, which can be generated to recognise specific smallmolecules, peptides, proteins, or even cells and tissues.They have shown great potential as diagnostic andtherapeutic agents in anticancer treatment, due to their highspecificity and affinity to their target molecules. They havealso recently found a niche in the field of biosensing dueto their advantages over antibodies; being simpler tosynthesise, modify and image, as well as their reportedsuperior affinities and ease of use. Methods: Single stranded DNA aptamers were selected using a modifiedSELEX protocol to an enzymatic tumour marker ofcommercial interest, and were eluted based on their affinityfor the target. Using techniques such as ELISA,immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, aptamerswere shown to specifically recognise their target in vitro , whilst affinity constants were measured using fluorescencequenching and quartz crystal microbalance techniques.Functional assays were employed to demonstrate enzymeinhibition and inhibition of cell motility and tissueremodelling, using cell and tissue cultures to demonstratethe aptamers' antagonistic properties prior to theintroduction of any modification. Introduction of theaptamers onto screen-printed carbon electrodes offers a further practical application for easy diagnosis at healthcare point. Results and Conclusion: Sandwich ELISA's showed the initial recognition of the aptamers for the targetand our studies demonstrated that aptamers did not bind atthe same site as a polyclonal antibody raised for the target.Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence studiesshowed a specific recognition of the target by the aptamers,and compared favourably with the polyclonal antibody.Affinity constants fluorescence quenching experiments and quartzcrystal microbalance. Once applied to the screen-printedcarbon electrodes, these results will form the basis for afacilitated practical approach in the diagnosis of cancer.We thank The Open University and The University ofManchester for their support in this project. 615 CHRONOMICS OF CIRCULATING PLASMA LIPIDPEROXIDES, ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMES ANDOTHER RELATED MOLECULES IN CERVICALCANCER PATIENTS R.K.

Halberg Departments of Biochemistry, and Obstetrics and Gynecology, CSM Medical University and HalbergChronobiology Center, University of Minnesota,Minneapolis, MN, USA Background: Chronomics ( an outgrowth of chronobiology, the study of diversity in time ), is the inferential statisticalmapping, \"imaging'' of time structures in variables in andaround us, consisting of rhythms, chaos and trends i.e., of the chronome. The chronome (from chronos, time, andnomos, rule; time structure) of lipid peroxidation andantioxidant defense mechanisms may relate to preventionand curative chronochemotherapeutic efficacy andmanagement. Patients and Methods: Thirty five newly diagnosed women with cervical cancer, 30-60 years of age,and 30 age-matched clinically healthy women weresynchronized for 1 week with diurnal activity from about06:00 to about 22:00 and nocturnal rest. Breakfast wasaround 08:30, lunch around 13:30 and dinner around 20:30.Drugs known to affect the free-radical system were nottaken. Blood samples were collected at 6-h intervals for 24h under standardized conditions. Plasma (2008) and Melatonin were also determined. Results: A marked circadian variation was demonstrated for eachvariable in each group by population-mean cosinor(p<0.01). In addition to anticipated differences in overall mean value (MESOR), patients differed from healthyvolunteers also in terms of their circadian pattern.Conclusion: Mapping the broader time structure(Chronome) with age and multifrequency rhythmcharacteristics of antioxidants role in cancer chronoprevention and management ofcervical cancer. 616 OXIDATIVE STRESS AND ANTIOXIDANTDEFENCE Anil K. Rizwan Ahmad, Payal Tripathi, Raj K. and Vinod K. Singh Departments of 1Biochemistry and 2Hemato-Oncology Unit, Department of Medicine, C.S.M. Medical University,Lucknow, India Background: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder with a characteristic geneticrearrangement, the Philadelphia chromosome. Oxidativestress, a pervasive condition of increased amount of freeradicals is now recognized to be prominent feature ofvarious diseases including leukemias and their progression.The relationship between the levels of well known oxidativestress markers and antioxidants status reflect better healthindices and postures. The present study was planned toreview the role of oxidative stress and antioxidant defensesystem in and protein carbonyl (PC) status was in term of reducedglutathione (GSH) and total thiol (T-SH) and totalantioxidant status (TAS) levels in plasma of CML patients.Melatonin (MEL) level was measured in urine. Patients and Methods: The present study included 82 (male: and 70 volunteers. Out of 82 CML patients, 66were in chronic phase (CML-CP) and 16 in acceleratedphase (CML-AP). The median age of CML patients was 35years and that of healthy participants 34 years. Oxidativestress and antioxidant defense system markers in plasmawere evaluated by spectro-photometric procedures whereasMEL level was determined in terms of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin excreted in urine by ELISA kit (IBL-Hamburg). Results: There was a significant increase (p<0.05) in plasma MDA, LOOH and PC levels in CMLpatients as compared to healthy subjects. Our results also showed that plasma MDA, LOOH and PC levels weremarkedly elevated ( p<0.05) in both CML-CP and CML-AP as compared to healthy volunteers. Antioxidant defensesystem which was measured in term of reduced GSH, T-SH,TAS and MEL was found to be significantly decreased(p<0.05) in CML patients and its phases (CML-CP, CML- AP) as compared to healthy participants. During the follow-up of total 66 CML-CP patients for 12 months, 15 patientsof CML-CP progressed to the accelerated phase whereas 51patients remain in CML-CP phase. The mean plasma levelsof MDA, LOOH and PC in patients with CML-CP whoprogressed to CML-AP were found to be higher than inpatients with CML-CP who did not progress to theaccelerated phase. An elevation in the plasma levels ofMDA, LOOH, and PC was observed in CML-CP patientswho progressed to CML-AP. The antioxidant defensesystem in patients with CML-CP who advanced to CML-APwas found to be decreased than in patients with CML-CPwho did not progress to the accelerated phase. Theantioxidant defense profiles remained decreased in thoseCML-CP patients who progressed to CML-AP. Conclusion: It could be implicated that plasma MDA, LOOH and PClevels may reveal the magnitude of oxidative stress in CMLpatients whereas reduced GSH, T-SH, TAS and MELexplain the antioxidant defense system against oxidativestress. All these parameters for oxidative stress andantioxidant defense mechanism may precisely reflect theproliferative signal transduction, disease phenotype and itssubsequent disease progression. Plasma MDA, LOOH andPC may serve as indices for oxidative stress and diseaseprogression in patients with chronic myeloid leukemiawhereas antioxidant defense system plays an important rolein nullifying the oxidative stress. 617 ROLE OF PROSTATE STEM CELLS INDEVELOPMENT AND CANCER Fred Sinowatz , Rebecca Kenngott, David Lincoln and Anwar G. Al-Banaw Institute of Histology and Embryology, Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Munich, Munich,Germany The normal prostate gland displays a high degree of cellular organization. The prostatic epithelium consists of basal cell,now regarded as stem cells of normal prostate growth andfully differentiated secretory cells. The importance of thestem cells varies at different stages of life and prostatedevelopment. Prostate development in the foetus occurswhen small epithelial cell buds intrude into the stroma andeventually form a complex branched ductular structure. AAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3487hypothesis about the initiation of benign prostatic tumours (BPH), and possibly also about the beginning of neoplastictransformation, suggests that glandular budding may bereactivated in the adult prostate (Schalken and van Leenders,2003). Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men. Despite advances in the detection of early prostatecancer there is little effective therapy for patients with locallyadvanced and/or metastatic disease. The majority of patientswith advanced prostate cancer respond initially to androgenablation therapy, however most go on to develop androgenindependent tumours that are finally fatal. A similar responseis seen to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. As a result,metastatic prostate cancer remains an incurable disease bycurrent treatment strategies. Recent reports of cancer stem cells have prompted questions regarding the involvement of normalstem/progenitor cells in prostatic cancer. Although stillcontroversial, the cancer stem cell may be a target in thetreatment of prostate cancer and a thorough understandingof its biology, particularly of how the cancer stem cellsdiffers from normal stem cells, might allow it to be targetedselectively and eliminated. Recent work on immuno-phenotyping of prostate cancer support the hypothesis thatprostrate cancer arises from malignant transformation ofintermediate stem cells. In this lecture I will review themolecular mechanism of prostate epithelial celldifferentiation during development and cancer. It becomesobvious that the pattern of transcription factor expressioncontrols epithelial cell determination, where the cell isassigned a developmental fate and subsequently celldifferentiation, and where the assigned cell now emergeswith its own unique character. 618 BACKGROUND, REASONS AND BENEFITS USING THE VIENNA PROTOCOL FOR THE TREATMENT OF PAINFUL BONERECURRENCES WITH 153SAMARIUM-EDTMP H. Sinzinger1,2, S. Granegger2, K. Weiss3and J. Hiltunen2 1Institute for Diagnosis Treatment of Lipid Disorders and Atherosclerosis (ATHOS), Vienna; 2Department of Nuclear Medicine, Medical University of 3Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Hospital Wr. Neustadt, Austria In the 1980s 153Samarium-EDTMP i.v. was introduced into pain palliation of late stage cancer. It fastly becameevident that the strategy \"the earlier the better\" ispreferable. Based upon the finding that a dose of 1 mCi/kgis not more beneficial as compared to 0.5 mCi/kgconcerning bone pain palliation but significantly more affects the bone marrow, in 1996 we described the Viennaprotocol for the first time based on repeated treatments ona given schedule (Europ J Nucl Med 27: 86, 2000). Contraindication for the treatment is a platelet count<100\u00d710 3/l, a white blood cell count <100\u00d7103/l, a red blood cell count <3\u00d7106/l, haematocrit <30% and haemoglobin <12 g/l Hg. However, if an abnormally lowblood cell count is due to bone marrow suppression bytumor cell infiltration, a beneficial response and even anincrease in peripheral blood cell count after therapy hasbeen seen. Platelets are most affected by 153Sm-EDTMP treatment followed by white and red blood cells. Usually,within 3 months, the peripheral blood cell count almostcompletely returns to the pre-treatment values. Therapy is performed 5 times at 3-month intervals, followed by 6-, 9- and 12-month intervals with 5 treatmentseach. The respective treatment intervals are shortened incase of proven disease progression (scintigraphy, MRI).Blood cell count is performed 3 and 6 weeks after therapyas well as immediately before the next one scheduled.Treatment is indicated when more than 1 bone lesion and/orbone pain exists. Bone scintigraphy is performed on the dayafter therapeutic application. Repeated application clearlyshows benefits beyond pain palliation such as tumor markerdecrease and lesion regression monitored and proven byvarious imaging techniques (scintigraphy, MR). PSA after afew weeks may show a temporary increase, while in mostof the patients (71%) it decreased after 3 months. To date,however, there is no individual predictor of responseavailable. While the interindividual 153Sm-EDTMP uptake greatly varies, the intraindividual one is rather stable.Concomitant application of biphosphonates does notsignificantly affect the uptake. Bone uptake does notcorrelate with treatment response. A significantimprovement in quality of life, analgesics consumption,pain score, Karnovsky score and WHO questionnaire hasbeen documented. Variable response towards treatment indicates that early lesions are more prone to respond as compared to the onesappearing later during treatment. Even osteoclastic lesionsrespond as far as they show up positively on bonescintigraphy. Pretherapetuic dosimetry makes no sense asat short-term intervals there are signs of stunning. There issome reason to believe that concomitant statin treatmentimproves benefit as does a higher red blood cell count andhigher haemoglobin. Preliminary concomitant chemo-therapeutic and radiotherapeutic treatment data suggest thatthis design might even induce better results. Although,prospective large studies are lacking so far to define andimprove potential therapeutic benefits of this promisingapproach, preliminary data suggest 153Sm-EDTMP to be a widely underused therapeutic option.ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3488619 USING GENETIC MARKERS TO DETERMINEPROGNOSIS OF UVEAL MELANOMA Karen SisleyUniversity of Sheffield, Academic unit of Ophthalmology and Orthoptics, K-Floor School of Medicine andBiomedical Sciences, Road, Sheffield, S10RX,UK Uveal melanomas are ocular tumours affecting the iris, and choroid, and are distinctly different fromcutaneous melanomas. Their highly aggressive nature andlack of effective treatment for secondary disease, makesunderstanding their development and genetic background ahigh priority. Over twenty years ago karyotypic analysis of afew isolated cases, initially reported the consistentinvolvement of chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8. The presence ofthese chromosome changes in isolation, or sometimes inassociation, was shown early to correlate with poorprognosis; and perversely also for one chromosomeabnormality with a good prognosis. Now twenty years on thefocus of research still centres on these changes, but theapproach to studying them has changed focus and adapted toinclude molecular cytogenetics and array basedmethodologies. By combining other methods and building onthese initial studies the use of these genetic markers isproviding a highly reliable indictor of prognosis, but is 100%accuracy ever likely to be obtainable?. 620 Tsavaris HELGO (Hellenic Group of Oncology), Athens, Greece Background: Most patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma are diagnosed with locally advanced (unresectable) ormetastatic disease. The aim of this study was to investigatepossible prognostic factors of survival in such patients.Patients and Methods: Two hundred and fifteen patients were studied retrospectively. Twenty-four potential prognosticvariables (demographics, clinical parameters, biochemicalmarkers, treatment modality) were examined. Results: Mean survival was 29.0 weeks. 21.9% survived more than 36weeks. On multivariate analysis, 10 factors had anindependent effect on survival: tumour localisation,metastasis, performance status, jaundice, weight loss, Creactive protein, CEA, CA 19-9, palliative surgery and chemotherapy. Patients managed only with palliative carehad a hazard ratio of 8.94 versus those offered a combinationof palliative surgery and chemotherapy. Conclusion: Chemotherapy and palliative surgery are associated withincreased survival, and should be offered to all eligiblepatients. 621 ASPECTS OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEENLEISHMANIASIS AND MALIGNANT DISORDERS P. Kopterides, E.G. Mourtzoukou, E. Skopelitis , N. Tsavaris and M.E. (AIBS), Department of Pathophysiology, Oncology Unit, Laiko GeneralHospital, University of Athens, School of Medicine,Athens, Greece The aim of this review is to summarise the occurrence of leishmaniasis as an opportunistic infection associated withmalignant disorders and to present the available literaturepotentially linking this infection with the development ofcancerous lesions. Materials and Methods: We searched electronic databases and evaluated 37 studies involving 44patients. Results: Four different types of association between leishmaniasis and cancer were established: leishmaniasismimicking a malignant disorder, such as lymphoma;leishmaniasis arising as a difficult to diagnose and treatinfection among patients receiving chemotherapy for variousmalignant disorders; simultaneous diagnosis of leishmaniasisand a neoplastic disorder in the same tissue samples ofimmunocompromised patients; and direct involvement ofLeishmania spp. in the pathogenesis/occurrence malignantlesions, especially of the skin and mucous membranes.Conclusion: Leishmaniasis can directly or indirectly affect the presentation, diagnosis and course of various malignantdisorders and it should be considered in the differentialdiagnosis of malignancies in geographic areas where it isendemic and/or in patients with travel history to these areas. 622 72-GENE SIGNATURE PREDICTS RECURRENCE IN LUNG CANCER - RESULTS FROM THEEUROPEAN MICROARRAY CONSORTIUMAMSTERDAM-BIALYSTOK-GDANSK-HEIDELBERG Marcin Skrzypski Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland Background: Current staging methods are imprecise for predicting prognosis of early stage non-small cell lungAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3489cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to develop a gene expression profile for stage I and II NSCLC, allowing identification of patients with a high risk of disease recurrence within 2-3years after initial diagnosis. Materials and Methods: We used whole-genome gene expression microarrays toanalyze frozen tumor samples from 172 NSCLC patients(pT1-2, N0-1, M0) from 5 European institutions, who hadundergone complete pulmonary resection. Median follow-up was 89 months (1.2-389) and 64 patients developed arecurrence. A random two-thirds of the samples wereassigned as the training cohort with the remaining samplesset aside for independent validation. Cox proportionalhazard models were used to evaluate the associationbetween expression levels of individual genes and patientrecurrence-free survival. A nearest mean analysis was usedto develop a gene-expression classifier for diseaserecurrence. Results: We have developed a 72 gene expression prognostic NSCLC classifier. Based on theclassifier score, patients were classified as either high orlow risk of disease recurrence. Patients classified as low-risk showed a significantly better recurrence-free survivalin both the training set ( p<0.001; the independent validation set ( p<0.01; n=69). Genes in our prognostic signature were strongly enriched for genesassociated with immune response. Conclusion: Our 72- gene signature is closely associated with recurrence-freeand overall survival in early-stage NSCLC patients andmay become a tool for patient selection for adjuvanttherapy. 623 GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING IN NON-SMALLCELL LUNG CANCER CELLS ACCORDING TOSMOKING STATUS M. Skrzypski 1, A. Szymanowska1, R. Rosell2, Germany Background: Epidemiological and experimental studies confirm that cigarette smoking is the principal causal agentof lung cancer. It is estimated that about 2-5% of all lungcancer patients have never smoked. Knowledge onmolecular features of lung cancers not related to smokingmight lead to better understanding of their carcinogenesisand allow development of new therapeutic targets. The aimof the study was to assess the feasibility of gene expressionprofiling to delineate the surgically treated non-small celllung cancer (NSCLC) patients according to cigarettesmoking status. Materials and Methods: The study group included 25 non-smoking NSCLC patients and 45 smokerswho underwent pulmonary resection with curative intent.Analysis of expression of 27 genes (including genesassociated with smoking, kinases, hormonal receptors,growth factor receptors, transcription factors, genesindirectly involved in HPV infection pathways and other)was performed using mRNA derived from tumour tissue forthe quantitative analysis of selected genes by RT-PCR withthe use of microfluid cards (MFC). Analysis of RT-PCRwas performed with relative quantification 2 -Ct. Subunit 18S, POLR2A and ESD were used as normalization genes.Results: In univariate analysis, three genes were particularly significantly overexpressed in these tumors. After correction for theimpact of sex, histopathology, stage of disease, andmultiple comparisons, with smoking history. NSCLC non-smokers by a specific geneexpression signature. Overexpression of TGFBR2 providesthe basis for developing new targeted therapies. 624 CHARACTERIZATION OF TUMOR-SPECIFIC T-CELLS RESPONDING TO ANTITUMORMIMOTOPE V ACCINES Jill E. Slansky , Kimberly R. Jordan and Charles B. Kemmler University of Colorado Denver, Department of Immunology, 1400 Jackson Street K511, Denver, CO80206, USA Multiple approaches are being explored to activate T-cells that specifically recognize and kill tumor cells. We are usingmimotopes, peptides that mimic tumor epitopes, to activateT-cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Our ultimate goal is tocombine these mimotopes with effective adjuvants resultingin potent antitumor a T-cell clone specific for the CT26 transplantable tumor, we showed that increasing the affinity of the T-cellreceptor (TCR) for the mimotope/MHC complex canaugment antitumor immunity. However, not all mimotopesgenerate effective antitumor immunity. We have shown thatincreasing the affinity of the interaction too far also ablatesthe antitumor response. Interestingly, recent experimentsshowed that relative to vaccination with ineffectivemimotopes, vaccination with effective mimotopes generatesT-cells with a focused repertoire encoding TCR genes thatANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3490are more similar in sequence to the T-cell clone used to identify the mimotopes. One mechanism that may contribute to improved antitumor immunity is that the T-cells responding to effectivemimotopes also produce more IFN-gamma (IFN) inresponse to the tumor antigen. These results were consistentin both the spleen after vaccination and in the developingtumor as determined by intracellular cytokine assays. InIFN-deficient mice, we showed that IFN is not requiredfor an effective primary response to mimotopes as determined in a tumor protection assay and tetramer stainingof tumor-specific T-cells. However, IFN may be requiredfor an effective memory response. Specifically, mimotopes protect wild type mice, but not IFN-deficient mice, fromtumor challenge if challenged 3 weeks after the first vaccine.Thus, our future experiments are to determine the predictablesequence of mimotopes that generate a focused repertoire ofresponding CTL that produce IFN upon secondarychallenge. 625 MOLECULAR MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ANTICANCER ACTIVITY OF EDIBLE AND MEDICINAL MUSHROOMS Daniel SlivaCancer Research Laboratory, Methodist Research Institute, Indianapolis, IN; Department of Medicine, and Indiana University SimonCancer Center, School of Medicine, Indiana University,Indianapolis, IN, USA Cancer metastasis is among the major reasons for a high mortality of cancer patients. Therefore, inhibition of growth,invasive behavior and cancer-cell mediated angiogenesiswill lead to the suppression of cancer metastasis. Althoughsome of the anticancer drugs were originally identified anddeveloped from a variety of natural products, the discoveryof novel biologically active compounds is still of vitalinterest. From the total of estimated 1.5 million Earth'sfungi only 100,000 have been described. Some of thesefungi gained significant recognition as the part of nutritionor as medicinal mushrooms in the traditional Orientalmedicine. Polysaccharides, mainly beta-glucans, are usuallyassociated with the anticancer activities of mushroomsthrough the stimulation of immune system. Moreover, thebiologically active compounds in mushrooms can directlymodulate aberrantly activated signaling pathwaysresponsible for growth and invasive behavior of cancer cells.Here, we compare the activity of edible and medicinalmushrooms and andsuppresses invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Moreover,PL-Fraction (PLF) inhibits proliferation as well as colonyformation through the cell cycle arrest and the up-regulationof p27Kip1 expression. PLF also inhibits invasive behaviorof breast cancer through the suppression of secretionof vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) from cancer cells. These effects are mediated by theinhibition of serine-threonine kinase AKT signaling becausePLF suppresses phosphorylation of AKT. In summary,edible as well as medicinal mushrooms contain biologicallyactive compounds with anti-proliferative, anti-invasive andanti-angiogenic activities, suggesting their potentialtherapeutic effect against invasive cancers. Finally, we haveidentified the most active fraction responsible for the PLFactivity, and this fraction is currently evaluated in animalexperiments. 626 CANCER ASSOCIATED FIBROBLASTS: FACTOROF TUMOR PROGRESSION AND SPREADING Karel Smetana Jr.Charles University, First Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Anatomy and Second Faculty of Medicine, Center of CellTherapy and Tissue Repair, Prague, Czech Republic Malignant tumors are widely spread in humans and form a serious medical, economical and social burden. Aging of thepopulation can be related to the increased incidence ofmalignancies. Despite progress in cancer therapy, the prognosisof many patients does not seem to be optimistic. Remarkableprogress in stem cell research delineated new horizons ofpossible future improvement of cancer therapy. A paradigm ofexistence of cancer stem cell has been established in solidtumors and is based on the remarkable parallel between tissuestem cells and population of cancer cells responsible for tumorspreading. Normal tissue stem cells require highly specializedmicroenvironment that is necessary for the maintenance of theirstemness; a disorder of such a microenvironment drives thestem cell population to enter into the process of finaldifferentiation. Experiments based on embryonic stem cellintroduction into adult organisms resulting in tumordevelopment are well-known. On the other hand, tumor cellsin embryos frequently normalize their function. These observations indicate the importance of microenvironment in tumor biology. The positive role of tumorstroma in course of vascularisation of tumor bed has alreadybeen well described. The sum of evidence that cancer- Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3491associated stromal fibroblasts exert an important role in cancer progression is growing and their participation in cancer stemcell niche formati on seems to be highly probable. The differences between the cancer stroma and normal tissuefibroblasts were established in e.g. tumors of breast, pancreas, colon, prostatic gland, skin and oral cavity. Whenco-cultured with cancer-associated fibroblasts, celllines harden their cancerous phenotype and the inoculationinto immunodeprived mice leads to the rapid tumorprogression including metastasis. Normal keratinocytessubsequently alter their phenotype with fibroblasts prepared frombasal or squamous Modern analyticaltechnologies, such as DNA microarrays and proteomicanalysis, indicated differences in production of regulatoryfactors/cytokines that are significant in the biological activityof cancer-associated fibroblasts. The nature of thesefibroblasts is not well understood yet, but principally theycan originate in local mesenchyme under the control ofcancer cells. However, they can also arise from tumor cellsundergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition or in cellsformed by fusion of cancer cells with local fibroblasts.Summarizing these data, similarly to embryonicdevelopment, mesenchymal-epithelial interaction can play animportant role in tumor progression and its management maybe a promising future anticancer therapeutic tool. 627 NUCLEIC ACID CONFORMATION AND HOTSPOTS FOR DNA METHYLATION Steven S. SmithCity of Hope, 1500 E. Duarte, CA 91010, USA Nucleic acid conformation space is extraordinarily vast. The conformations that DNA can adopt are nearly uncountable.Modern living organisms utilize only a fraction of theavailable conformations, probably because of the constraintsplaced on DNA by fidelity in genetic inheritance. I willsummarize evidence suggesting that DNA methylation is oneof the systems that allows higher organisms to incorporatesequences with difficult-to-manage conformations into theirgenomes. In particular we will discuss evidence suggestingthat a non-B DNA structural polymorphism detected in humantumors near the c-Ha-ras VNTR is a self-perpetuatingepigenetic mark that manifests itself spontaneously duringbreast carcinogenesis in a hotspot for DNA methylation.Available evidence suggests that DNA hypermethylation andconcurrent DNA hypomethylation in carcinogenesis can beunderstood as consequences of loss-of-function in thesuppression of non-B DNA and unusual DNA structureformation.628 PHOTODAMAGE TO PROTEINS OF DNAREPLICATION AND REPAIR BY TOPOISOMERASEINHIBITORS Soo In Bae, Ran Zhao and Robert M. Snapka Department of Radiology, Division of Radiobiology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio USA We have found that commonly studied drugs, including topoisomerase II and topoisomerase I inhibitors, causecovalent damage to proliferating cell nuclear antigen(PCNA) and SV40 large T antigen when cells treated withmicromolar levels of these drugs are exposed to fluorescentlight. PCNA and large T antigen function as circularoligomers, and the subunits are covalently cross-linked byphotodamage from these drugs. With some drugs, significantcross-linking of PCNA or large T antigen can be detectedafter 5-minute exposures of drug-treated cells to laboratoryroom lighting. Heterologous proteins are photo-cross-linkedto the PCNA oligomers at much lower Photodynamicdrugs localize in cytoplasmic organelles alsocaused photo-cross-linking of PCNA and large T antigen,suggesting that small amounts of these drugs, or long-livedreactive species generated in the cytoplasm can reach thenucleoplasm. PCNA and large T antigen can serve as verysensitive markers of photodynamic damage in the nucleus.Tests for specific reactive oxygen species suggest thatsinglet oxygen is involved in PCNA photo-cross-linking.Nuclear photodamage is unlikely to be limited to proteincross-linking or to be limited to these two proteins. Damageto proteins of DNA replication and repair has the potentialto disrupt DNA replication as well as DNA damagesignaling and processing, resulting in genetic instability.This work was supported by NIH/NCI RO1-CA097107 toRMS and the Ohio State University Comprehensive CancerCenter. 629 CLINICAL AND TUMOR BIOLOGICAL ASPECTSOF APOLIPOPROTEIN-D S\u00f8ilandStavanger University D (ApoD) is a small glycoprotein of 24 kDa, which belongs to the lipocalin family, unlike otherapolipoproteins. ApoD is linked to high-density lipoproteinin plasma. It may also be highly expressed in breast,adrenal and nerve, tissue, where transportation of steroidsand lipophilic substances is abundant. The affinity of ApoDto arachidonic acid, progesterone and tamoxifen makes itANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3492relevant in breast cancer. The emerging understanding of the relationship between ApoD and cellular signalingpathways ( e.g. estrogen receptor-alfa) and also the connections to cellular stress and senescence will beaddressed. Recent studies on qualitative and quantitative immunohistochemical aspects of ApoD determination inbreast cancer tissue will be presented. Moreover, recentobservations indicate a prognostic value of ApoD in certainsubgroups of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, wehypothesize on the possible predictive value of ApoD foreffect of adjuvant tamoxifen in a subset of women withoperable breast cancer. 630 DEMONSTRATION OF THE ACTIVITY OF P-GLYCOPROTEIN BY A FULLY AUTOMATEDETHIDIUM of and Immunobiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Szeged, Szeged,Hungary The major reason for the failure of chemotherapy of cancer is the refractory nature of the cell that resulted from priorexposure to the same or another chemotherapeutic agent. Therefractory nature of that cell is due to over-expression of themdr-1 gene that codes for the transporter Pgp-1 that promotesthe extrusion of widely dissimilar cytotoxic agents employedin cancer therapy. Agents which inhibit this extrusion renderthe cancer cell susceptible to the agent to which it had becomeresistant. Obviously, targeting this transporter is of interest. The effect of an agent on the Pgp-1 is normally assessed using flow cytometry. This involves the employment of afluorochrome substrate, such as rhodamine 123, which isextruded by the P-gp-1 transporter and which is increasinglyretained if the transporter is inhibited. Although thesensitivity of this method is quite good, it does not lend itselfto physiological conditions, it is very time consuming, data isnot readily reproduced and hence of limited use for itsstandardization, and of course, utilizes a very expensiveinstrument at its core. Furthermore, the method does not lenditself for the evaluation of large numbers of assays to beconducted within a working day. We developed an automated method that utilized the fluorochrome ethidium bromide (EB) which is considered as auniversal substrate of bacterial efflux pumps. Because EB isalso recognized and extruded by ABC type transporters thatrely on the ATP binding cassette of Gram positive bacteria,and this transporter has similarity to the Pgp-1, we haveextended the method for the evaluation of agents that caninhibit the extrusion of EB by mouse lymphoma cells thatcontain the human mdr-1 gene, and are therefore multi-drugresistant. The data presented shows that phenothiazines, suchas thioridazine and its derivatives inhibit the extrusion of EBunder physiological conditions. The activity of other unrelatedagents such as reserpine, verapamil, SILA compounds, etc., has also been evaluated and will be presented. 631 SULINDAC SULFIDE: POTENT INTERACTION WITH CYTOSTATICS Sylwia Str, 00-725 Warsaw, Poland Objectives: To compare the effects of sulindac sulfide (SD) with other COX inhibitors on survival of colorectal carcinoma(CRC) cells in various cell lines (Colo 205, 29).Results: SD (a metabolite while rofecoxib, valdecoxib, and indomethacin were ineffective. The arrest of cell cycleprogression was accompanied by increased level of p21protein, accumulating in G 1-phase, and decreased level of cyclin B1. Cell cycle arrest was accompanied by strongapoptosis (65.7% of apoptotic cells). SD induced increase oftranscript of caspase-3 gene, as well as, reduction of pro caspase 8 and 3 proteins level. In addition, incubation of Colo205 cells with SD led to decrease of Bid and Bax protein leveland PARP protein cleavage. Our results indicated that bothmitochondral and death receptor pathways of apoptosis werestimulated. In celecoxib and in normal Balb/c 3T3 was observed with SD.Thus, SD appeared as an optimal candidate to studyinteractions with 5 fluorouracil (5 FU) and oxaliplatin (OXA)in CRC cell lines. SD synergistically with 5 FU and OXAinhibited CRC survival, in contrast to celecoxib, which gaveadditive or antagonistic (depending on the line studied) effects.Dose reduction effect of SD with studied cytostatics was in therange of 5 to 14 fold, when compared with single agent.Synergistic effect of SD with 5 FU and OXA on growth ofCRC cells was paralleled by changes in the cell cycleprogression and induction of apoptosis. Conclusion: Strong apoptotic signal induced by SD intrinsic extrinsic pathways may explain observed inhibitory synergism with 5Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3493FU and OXA on CRC cells and superiority to combination of 5 FU and OXA with celecoxib. Since SD may be formed inintestines from sulindac and is preferentially concentrated inthe colon in vivo , sulindac may constitute a candidate for the \"fourth line\" therapy of patients with CRC. 632 PULSE-MEDIATED CHEMOTHERAPY OF SOLIDTUMORS IN PETS (ELECTROCHEMOTHERAPY):RECENT DEVELOPMENTS A Baldi Regina Elena Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy Electrochemotherapy (ECT) couples the administration of an anticancer agent (usually bleomycin or cisplatin) to permeabilizing pulses leads to perturbation ofthe cell membrane, thus resulting in increased uptake ofchemotherapeutic drugs, ultimately leading to cell apoptoticdeath. Different waveforms have been adopted by investigators:exponentially decaying, square, rectangular or biphasic. Ingeneral the number of pulses delivered is set in 8 single pulsesapplied per cm of tumor area at a voltage of 1300 V/cm (800V/cm for intraoperative use), with a duration of 100 s and afrequency of 1 Hz. Treatments are repeated until the wholetumor area is covered. Our group investigated in the past 8years the feasibility of electrochemotherapy in companionanimals affected by different neoplasms. We adopted trains ofbiphasic pulses delivered as a burst instead of single impulses.The electric waveform was generated by Chemopulse equipment. In the first trial, ECT was used to directly attackneoplasms (1). Overall response rate was 80%, with 40% longlasting remissions (in excess of 1 year). On the basis of thepreliminary studies, cohorts of dogs and cats affected bymelanoma, soft tissue sarcoma, mast cell tumor, squamous cellcarcinoma and cutaneous lymphoma were enrolled in phase IIstudies, obtaining response rates and remissions that positivelycompared with those reported in the literature using standardprotocols (2-10). Electrochemotherapy is a safe and efficaciousapproach to veterinary soft tissue and cutaneous neoplasms. Itslow cost and ease of administration make it a valuable additionto the currently available oncological therapies. Resultsobtained in companion animals could be instrumental inplanning new protocols for humans.This work 5(1): 48, 2007. 9 Spugnini EP et al : Vet J, 2007, in press; Epub ahead of print. 10 Spugnini EP et J Biochem Cell Biol 40: 2008. 633 FEEDBACK IN GLANDDEVELOPMENT AND 5Pathology Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC; 3Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA; 4Molecular Oncology Research Institute, Tufts-New England Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA Background: Early menarche and breast development are increasingly common risk factors for breast cancer. In utero and neonatal exposure to natural and early isnot observed in mammary epithelium until studies indicate essentialroles in postnatal mammary development and suggestmechanisms for the actions of estrogens in aberrant breastdevelopment and increased carcinogenic potential.Objectives: To determine the molecular basis for the essential roles of HoxC6 and to identify other Hox genesessential in mammary development. Results: HoxC6 is expressed in mammary and stroma and thereindifferentially repressed by ovarian hormones. also be modulated in vivo by phytoestrogens. Thoracic post-natally inHoxC6 knockout mice.

In humanbreast epithelial cell lines, real time gene expressionanalyses (RT-qPCR) reveal that HoxC6 expression iselevated in well-differentiated cell lines (MCF10A andMCF7) and reduced in more aggressive cell lines ( e.g. MDA-MB-231) and tumors. Consistent with in vivo HoxC6 knockout results, siRNA-mediated HoxC6 knockdown inMCF10A an inhibition of andbranching in 3-dimensional cultures. Rescue of growth (butnot morphological) defects in knockdown Estrogen-mediated repression ofHoxC6 in MCF7 cells via Akt isoform-specific up-regulation. In addition, estrogen-mediatedchanges in MCF7 cellular growth and migration are reversedvia Akt isoform-specific up-regulation.

These results willbe discussed in relation to wortmannin, tamoxifen and ICItreatments. In induction of adipogenesis (WI-38 human altered viasiRNA-mediated HoxC6 knockdown. Using chromatinimmunoprecipitation (ChIP), we have identified HoxC6 repression (IGFBP3, IGFBP7) andactivation (CD44, FGFR2). In vivo and HoxC6 expression (either directly by knockdown/out orindirectly viaestrogen treatment) leads to a disruption of target gene expression. Estrogen-mediated repression andmammary gland defects observed in HoxC6 knockout miceare recapitulated in HoxC5 knockout mice.

Conclusion: Identification and modulation of key network regulatorshold future promise for the prevention, diagnosis andtreatment of various disorders. Dysregulation in steroidhormone/growth factor networks have been implicated incardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and obesity. Hoxgenes, their targets and their regulation ( e.g. via histone methylation/acetylation) can be modeled in the the \"classical\" feedback loop inwhich prepubertal exposure to estrogens regulation ( viaESR1) ( via HoxC6 aberrant mammaryepithelial growth associated with elevated carcinogenicpotential. 634 IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS TO DIFFERENTIATE HUMAN CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA Bangkok; 3Department of Biochemistry and Center for Protein Structure and Function, Faculty of Science, MahidolUniversity, Bangkok, Thailand Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a malignant tumor derived from bile duct epithelium, occurs with a higher incidence intropical countries such as Thailand. Distinguishing CCAfrom hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the liver oftenrequires the use of histochemistry, so molecular markers fordiagnosis and prognosis are still required. More in depthanalyses using subproteomic approaches were performed tofacilitate the identification of potential biomarkersundetected by regular proteomic methods. The two-dimensional protein map of a Thai human bile duct epithelialcarcinoma cell line (HuCCA-1) was compared to those ofhuman hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2 andHCC-S102). The major identified byLC/MS/MS. Cytokeratins were galectin-3, may be goodmarkers useful for differential diagnosis of CCA from HCC. Proteins secreted (the secretome) from cancer cells are potentially useful as biomarkers of the disease.Subproteomes enriched in membrane proteins or in cytosolicproteins from the HuCCA-1 and the HCC-S102 cell lineswere prepared. Protein patterns of differential proteinexpression were determined.

StaegeDepartment of Paediatrics, Martin-Luther-University Halle- Wittenberg, Halle, Germany DNA microarrays are powerful tools for the characterisation of gene expression profiles from cancer cells and theirnormal counterparts. However, for many cancer types, thecell of origin (the mother cell) is still unknown. Examplesare tumours of the Ewing tumour family (EFT). Since thefirst descriptions of EFT in the late 19th century differentcell types have been implicated as the EFT mother cells,ranging from endothelial cells to primitive mesenchymalcells. Recently, similarities between DNA microarray datafrom bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells(bmMSC) and EFT suggest that bmMSC are highlyattractive candidates as EFT mother cells. However, not allEFT associated genes are up-regulated in MSC aftertransgenic expression of EFT-specific EWSR1-etsoncogenes. Likewise, not all EFT-associated genes are down-regulated in EFT after knockdown of these oncogenes. EFT-specific expression of EWSR1-ets independent genes mightbe a consequence of in vivo selection. In addition, the number of so-called secondary alterations in EFT is veryhigh, rendering the possibility likely that other factorssignificantly modulate the gene expression profile of EFT.Moreover, other cell types, e.g.neuroblastoma cells, acquire features of EFT after transgenic expression of EWSR1-ets,suggesting that the effect of EWSR1-ets on gene expressionis not absolutely specific for bmMSC. Alternatively, thisbehaviour may only reflect the susceptibility of bmMSC toEWSR1-ets mediated transformation. We analyzed the expression profile of EWSR1-ets- independent genes in more detail. Surprisingly, we found avery high similarity between EFT and embryonic stem cells(ESC). Unsupervised clustering indicated that the similaritybetween EFT and ESC was even higher than the similaritybetween EFT and bmMSC. In addition, we observed weak expression of ESC-specific markers, e.g. the transcription factor NANOG in EFT. ESC-like cells have been detected inadult tissues. In addition, mesenchymal stem cells fromdifferent sources are highly heterogeneous and moreprimitive mesenchymal stem cells with ESC likedifferentiation capacities have been described. Our datasuggest that primitive ESC-like stem cells, e.g.the recently described very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSEL)might be interesting candidates as EFT mother cells. 636 CHARACTERIZATION OF TUMOUR ASSOCIATEDAND TISSUE SPECIFIC Halle, Germany DNA microarray-detected signal intensities of tumour associated genes are characterized by a high variance in thetotal group of samples (including normal and tumoursamples) compared with the variance in normal tissues alone.Therefore, the ratio of the variance in normal tissues and thetotal variance (Wilks' lambda score, WLS) can be used forthe identification of tumour specific genes. These genes arecharacterized by a low WLS. Vice versa , a high WLS characterizes tissue specific genes that are only expressed ina subset of normal samples. We used this approach for thecharacterization of gene expression profiles of Ewing familytumours (EFT) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). For this end,we combined published microarray data from tumoursamples and normal tissues from our own lab and from theGEO data base. In our analysis of EFT we found among thegenes with low WLS the complete set of EFT associatedgenes that we had identified in our previous studies,indicating that the method gives reliable results. Similarresults were obtained during analysis of HL samples. One ofthe genes with lowest WLS in this analysis was interleukin26 (IL26), despite the fact that IL26 was expressed only in asubset of HL cell lines. Interestingly, IL26 expression wasinduced in other cells after incubation with culturesupernatants from IL26 positive HL cells, suggesting that HLcells secrete soluble factors that induce IL26 in bystandercells. In addition, we identified a set of tissue specific genes(high WLS) that were expressed only in small subsets ofnormal samples, e.g. insulin (expressed only in pancreas) or the Charcot-Leyden crystal protein (expressed in blood andbone marrow). Among these genes we found several testisspecific genes ( e.g. protamines or the glyceraldehyde-3-ANTICANCER RESEARCH dehydrogenase S), as well as cancer/testis antigens (CTA). These CTA include members of the GAGE (Gantigen) family, members of the SPANX (sperm proteinassociated with the nucleus, X chromosome) family, lactatedehydrogenase C, and the outer dense fiber of sperm tailsprotein 2. Our results demonstrate that WLS can be used notonly for the identification of tumour associated genes butalso for the identification of tissue specific genes includingcancer/testis antigens. 637 PROTEOMICS Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, and 3Unit of Biomedical Radiation Sciences, Department of Oncology, Radiology and ClinicalImmunology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University,Uppsala, Sweden Low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation is used on regular basis for cancer therapy. However, an improved efficiency ofradiotherapy in non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) byusing high-LET radiation has been described. To date, littleis known about which signaling pathways are responsible forthis increased efficiency. Here we have used proteomics andpathway analysis to reveal signaling networks of importancefor proapoptotic signaling in response to high-LET radiation. The NSCLC cell line U-1810, resistant to low-LET but sensitive to high-LET radiation was used as model system.Cells were harvested 4h after irradiation with low and high-LET radiation, respectively. An unsupervised approach wasapplied using shotgun proteomics where high resolutionmass spectrometry coupled to nanoflow-liquidchromatography determined the identity and relativeabundance of expressed proteins. A newly developedpathway search engine (PSE) was then employed todetermine the pathway status in both low and high-LETirradiated cells. The observed differences in the pathwaydomain were used to generate hypotheses which werevalidated in vitro. Based on the 650 proteins quantified in each sample, the JNK-pathway was identified ( p=6 10-6) as a key event response to was found deactivated ( p=0.001) compared to untreated cells. Western blot, ELISA and immuno-fluorescence analyses confirmed that high-LET radiationcaused an increase In neither an activationof p38 nor a role for p38 in high-LET radiation inducedapoptotic signaling was found. We conclude that in contrast to conventional low-LET radiation, high-LET radiation can trigger activation of theJNK-pathway which in turn is critical for induction ofapoptosis in these cells. Thus PSE predictions were largelyconfirmed, and PSE was proven to be a useful hypothesis-generating tool. 638 DETECTION OF BIOLOGICAL PROFILE OFCUTANEOUS Sciences, Pathology 2Department of Medicine, and 3Cooperative Melanoma Group, \"Federico II\" University, School of Medicine, Naples, Italy Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) is the most aggressive and lethal among skin cancers. To date, noreliable molecular prognostic marker exists for the evaluationof the biological behaviour of this tumor. Recently, a greatinterest has been devoted to the inter-relationship betweenchromatin organization, DNA damage processing and thecontrol of the \"cell cycle checkpoint machinery\". Theresetting of the pre-existing chromatin structure during DNAsynthesis, DNA replication, and/or DNA repair is driven, inpart, to the Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF-1). CAF-1is a heterotrimeric protein p150). CAF-1 interacts CAF-1 subunit expression has been recently correlated with cellproliferation in cell lines and human tissue, and it has beenproposed as a novel sensible proliferation and prognosticmarker in some tumours. We aimed to establish if CAF-1p60 could have a role as a new prognostic indicator in a selected series of cutaneousmalignant melanomas (CMM). 80 formalin-fixed, archivalparaffin-embedded surgical specimens of CMM retrievedfrom the files of the Department of Biomorphological andFunctional Sciences, Section of Pathology, University FedericoAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3497II of Naples. Immunohistochemistry with anti-CAF-1 p60 was performed on four-micron-thick tissue sections for all cases,and the staining was evaluated semi-quantitatively. Resultswere compared with clinicopathological features of tumoursand with follow-up data of patients. Moreover, we comparethe results with the immunostaining pattern of the same casesfor the stem-cells CD133 antibody. Recent studies, in fact,have pointed the attention on the possible role of stem-cellsderivation in conditioning the malignant progression of somecases of CMM. We found CAF-1/p60 overexpressed in almost all CMM of our series, with values exceeding from two-to ten fold thelevel of expression of melanocytes of normal control skin.The statistical analysis of results demonstrated a significantassociation between the hyperexpression of CAF-1/p60 andthe occurrence of node and/or distant metastases in CMMpatients ( p<0.01). On the contrary, only a minority of CMM (9 out 80 cases) showed an appreciable reactivity for thestem-cell marker CD133, without any convincingrelationship with the biological behavior of tumors and/or themain classical clinical and pathological prognosticparameters. These results indicate that CAF-1/p60 may havea role as new sensible proliferation and prognostic marker inCMM, whereas the derivation from the stem-cellcompartment does not seem useful for the prediction ofclinical outcome in CMM patients. 639 WHICH ABC-TRANSPORTERS SHOULD WETARGET IN LEUKEMIA? Daniel Steinbach Universit\u00e4tskinderklinik Ulm, Germany ABC-transporters are a large family of proteins involved in active transport across biological membranes. Some membersof this family cause drug resistance in malignant diseases via ATP-dependent drug efflux from malignant cells. Thisphenomenon was intensively analyzed in leukemia. ABCB1 (P-g) and ABCG2 (BCRP) were shown to be associated with poor response to chemotherapy in adult acutemyeloid leukemia (AML). Both proteins confer resistance toa wide range of chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro . Therefore, they represent possible therapeutic targets. In pediatric AML,this is the case for ABCG2 but not for ABCB1. In acutelymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), both proteins appear lessrelevant with the probable exception of ABCB1 in adultpatients. ABCC3 (MRP3) has a strong prognostic impact in AML and ALL, independent of age group. However, ABCC3 doesnot cause much drug resistance in vitro . Therefore, it remains to be elucidated whether its correlation with poor responseto therapy is causative or just an epiphenomenon. ABCA3 might be an additional cause of drug resistance in AML. It is associated with in vitro drug resistance and response to therapy. Interestingly it causes drug resistanceviaintracellular drug sequestration instead of drug efflux from the malignant cell. Specific inhibitors of ABC-transporters can sensitize leukemic cells to chemotherapy. For some types of leukemiait would be desirable to develop drugs that inhibit a set ofABC-transporters. 640 USE OF MULTIV ARIATE MODELS TO IMPROVEPROSTATE CANCER C. Cammann, M. Lein, M. Schrader, S. Deger, Miller and K. Jung Department of Urology, Charit\u00e9, Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Germany Multivariate models including prostate specific antigen (PSA), percent free PSA (%fPSA) and other clinical datasuch as prostate volume, age, status of digital rectal exam(DRE) have been shown to improve prostate cancer (PCa)detection. This summary gives an overview of PSA and%fPSA-based artificial neural networks (ANNs) and logisticregression (LR) models to reduce unnecessary prostatebiopsies. New serum markers like subforms of PSA ( e.g. proPSA) or other kallikreins show additional value withindifferent models. Recently, the urine marker PCA3, a non-coding RNA, has been shown to detect PCa independentlyfrom other markers. Also, the majority of PCa harbour achromosomal rearrangement that fuses the gene for anandrogen-regulated prostate-specific serine protease,TMPRSS2, with a member of the ETS family oftranscription factors, most commonly ERG. The addition ofPCA3 and gene fusion data within PSA and %fPSA modelsmay further substantially improve PCa detection. 641 THE GENE MUTATED IN THE RIDDLESYNDROME REGULATES A UBIQUITIN-DEPENDENT SIGNALLING CASCADE AT SITES OF DNA DAMAGE Grant S. Stewart 1, Stephanie Panier2,3, Kelly Townsend1, Abdallah K. R.

Individuals bearing inactivatingmutations in components of this response exhibit a range ofclinical phenotypes that include cellular radiosensitivity,immunodeficiency, infertility, progressive neurologicaldysfunction The archetype forsuch is ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) caused bybiallelic mutation in ATM , a central component of the DNA damage response. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitinligase RIDDLIN is mutated in a recently describedimmunodeficiency and disorder calledRIDDLE syndrome. RIDDLIN acts downstream of toorchestrate the accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 at sitesof DNA damage. RIDDLIN is itself recruited to thechromatin that surrounds DNA lesions by binding to RNF8-dependent conjugated ubiquitin. Therefore, RIDDLIN andRNF8 define a protein ubiquitination cascade at sites ofDNA damage that is important for the overall DNA damageresponse. 642 CELL CYCLE DISTURBANCES AND MITOTICCATASTROPHES IN CELL LINES FOLLOWINGLOW DOSE Antibodies specific for tumour-antigens and labelled with 131I can deliver low dose, low dose irradiation to tumours and cause growth retardation at experimentalradioimmunotherapy. The aim was to elucidate the sequentialmolecular and cellular events occurring in 4 cell lines withdifferent origin that have been exposed to continuous lowdose-rate radiation. Materials and Methods: Activation of cell cycle checkpoints and mitotic behaviour four cell lines: HeLa Hep2, HT29 following low dose irradiation by 131I in cell culture media. Western blots, FACS analysis A was demonstrated by FACS analysis. The G2/M arrest was transient and the cells reentered the cell cycle stillcontaining unrepaired cellular damage. This premature entrycaused an increase of anaphase bridges, laggingchromosomal material dose dependent significant increase incentrosome numbers, as well as a dose dependent increaseof polyploid cells were detected. These disturbances causedthe cells to progress into mitotic catastrophe and a fraction ofthese dying cells demonstrated apoptotic features asdisplayed by TUNEL staining 5-7 days following irradiation.Conclusion: Low dose rate irradiation was demonstrated to force all four cell lines into mitotic catastrophe and delayedapoptosis. This phenomenon might be important in cell deathmechanisms involved in tumour growth retardation followingradioiommunotherapy of tumours. C. StreffordCancer Genomics Group, University of Southampton, UK The detection of chromosomal abnormalities by conventional cytogenetic analysis is an essential component of themultidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis, classificationand risk-stratification of patients with leukemia. The clinicalutility of cytogenetics has been expanded with thedevelopment of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). latter of copy number alterations (CNA) throughoutthe entire genome in a single reaction. While CGH wascapable of highlighting recurrent chromosomal regions andfacilitating positional cloning studies, the technique lackedresolution, and it was not until the development of array-based CGH (aCGH) that became possible to determine thegene content of these CNA. Several haematologicalmalignancies have been investigated with this approach andthis has significantly advanced our understanding of themolecular mechanisms underlying leukaemogenesis. We have been using a combination of classical cytogenetics and state-of-the-art genomic profilingtechnologies to identify novel aberrations in patients withleukaemia. Initially, we performed parallel expression andaCGH profiling to characterized a clinically-relevantchromosome aberration in childhood acute lymphoblasticleukaemia (ALL), termed intrachromosomal amplification ofchromosome 21 (iAMP21). With metaphase FISH, includingmBAND analysis, we show that iAMP21 is likely the resultAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3499of a series of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. Profiling different patient sub-groups identified evidence of retinoicacid pathway disruption in ETV6-RUNX1 -positive ALL, and a novel ETV6 -mediated mechanism of oncogenic activation. With multiplex ligation-dependant probe amplification(MLPA), we have revealed novel methylation target genes inhigh-hyperdiploidy ALL. By applying FISH, molecular copynumber (MCC) abnormalities, wereveal PAX5 disruption as a key molecular event and show how our strategy could be applied to solid tumours, whereunbalanced chromosomes are particularly prevalent. Byinvestigating novel IGH@ partner genes, we show overexpression of members of the CEBP family, a finding in contrast to that described in acute myeloid leukaemia(AML). Here, several examples of novel chromosomal abnormalities in patient with acute leukaemia are described,clearly demonstrating the power of this approach inelucidating molecular events involved in the initiation ormaintenance of the leukaemic phenotype. Further studies willsurely expand our understanding of cancer pathogenesis andimprove the treatment of patients with cancer. 644 IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL DETECTION ANDPOSSIBLE PROGNOSTIC V ALUE Slovenia; 2University Pathology, Ljubljanska 5, 2000 Maribor, Slovenia; 3National Institute of Biology, Department of Genetic Toxicology and Cancer Biology, Vena pot 111, 1000Ljubljana, Slovenia Objectives: CD68 is a marker for microglia. The role of microglia in malignant glioma biology remains unclear.Kallikreins are a subgroup of serine proteases and haverecently been strongly associated with tumour progression.Previously, we revealed a strong positive reaction with theCD68 and kallikrein 6 antibodies in most of the cells in aU87 human glioblastoma cell suspension, precultured U87tumour spheroids and in a rat tumour model. The aim of thisstudy was to evaluate the expression of CD68 and kallikrein6 in human gliomas, and to investigate the possibleprognostic significance. The expression was compared withthe expression of some other markers in the same set ofglioma patients. Materials and Methods: Using immunohistochemical analysis and specific monoclonalantibodies, we evaluated the levels of CD68, cathepsin B,CD31, kallikrein 6 and Ki-67 in histological sections of patients with primary astrocytic tumours.Immunohistochemical scores were determined as the sum ofthe frequency and intensity (0-3) of immunolabeling real-time PCR in 9 brain tumour biopsies.Results: Of the 51 patients included, 11 had benign tumours and 40 had malignant ones. A high immunohistochemicalscore (4-6) for CD68 and cathepsin B was more frequent inmalignant tumours than in benign ones, p=0.036 and 0.014, respectively. We found higher levels of Ki-67 antigen in themalignant group compared with the benign, p=0.035. In contrast, the benign group presented a stronger immunereaction for proteolytic enzyme kallikrein 6 in tumour malignant group, p=0.013. Staining with the CD31 antibody revealed no significant difference instaining of the endothelial cells in malignant vs.benign tumours. Univariate survival analysis indicated thatimunohistochemical CD68 score above 3 was a significantpredictor for shorter overall survival ( p<0.01). In the malignant group a higher CD68 score (4-6) also indicatedworse outcome, although the difference was of boundarysignificance, p=0.057. We confirmed the prognostic significance of cathepsin B in tumour cells. Cathepsin Bscore above 3 was significant for shorter overall survival(p=0.04). Other markers had no prognostic impact. Conclusion: Strong immune reaction for CD68 in U87 suspension, spheroids, rat tumour model and also in humanmalignant glioma samples indicates the important role ofCD68 expression in glioma progression. We conclude thatspecific immunostaining of CD68 and cathepsin B, but notcallikrein 6, in tumour cells can be used to predict the riskof death in patients with primary tumours of the centralnervous system. 645 DRUG RESISTANCE IN CHILDHOOD ACUTELEUKEMIA AND THE CONCEPT OF LEUKEMICSTEM CELLS Jan StyczynskiDepartment of Hematology ul.Curie-Sklodowskiej 9, 85-094 Bydgoszcz, Poland In spite of the significant progress in pediatric oncology made over last 50 years, still about 20% of children withacute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 50% with acutemyelogenous leukemia (AML) relapse. This may be due to(1) drug resistance, (2) unfavorable cytogenetics, (3) minimalresidual disease, (4) presence of leukemic stem cells. Variousaspects of drug resistance are different in childhood ALL andAML, as well as in age groups and in comparison to adultsANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3500with leukemia. In vitro and in vivo aspects of the cellular drug resistance profile and mechanisms of resistance toanticancer drugs might have clinical relevance andprognostic value in acute leukemia. A new concept of cancer stem cells (CSCs) may explain the phenomenon of tumor resistance. CSCs are a populationof rare cancer cells exhibiting stem cell properties such asself-renewing, differentiation, tissue reconstitution andmultiple drug-resistance. Putative leukemic stem cells(LSCs) have been reported both in ALL and AML. Several experimental strategies have been utilized to identify and/or isolate putative CSCs: cell surface marker-based analysis, side population (SP) analysis, drug resistanceproperties, sphere-formation assays, label-retainingproperties and microarray technology. Cancer stem cells likenormal stem cells share several common features. Sidepopulation (SP), as defined by Hoechst exclusion in flowcytometry, represents a small fraction of the whole cellpopulation, expressing high levels of various members of theABC transporter family (including MDR1 and BCRP),which are responsible for drug resistance. Malignanttransformation results from dysregulation of self-renewalpathways. Distinct sets of \"self-renewal\" genes have beenassociated with stem cells. The mutations accumulated innormal stem cells could inappropriately activate self-renewalsignaling pathways and could potentially lead to cancer. CSCs are intrinsically drug resistant. In the CSCs model, drug resistance can be mediated by stem cells. Cancer mighthave a built-in population of drug-resistant pluripotent cellsthat can survive chemotherapy and repopulate the tumor.Most CSCs have quiescent cell cycle status, reducedsensitivity to cell cycle-dependent agents, express ABCtransporters, cause drug efflux, have an active DNA-repaircapacity and a resistance to apoptosis.

However, the efficacy and in vivo mechanism of action of curcumin in human lung cancer cells have not been well investigated. In this study, weassessed the in vivo therapeutic effects of curcumin on lung cancer cells. In a primary study, we used MTT assay anddetermined that curcumin inhibits proliferation of H460 lungadenocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, the cancer cells showedincreased levels of activated caspase-3 and an increased ratioof Bax/Bcl-2, suggesting that the cells were undergoingapoptosis. At the same time, cell cycle analysis showed thatthere was an increased number of cells in the G 2/M phase. For in vivo studies, female athymic Nu/nu mice were xenografted with H460 tumors and on day 4 onwardscurcumin was administered orally at dose of 300, 450 and550 mg/kg/day for 24 days. As a control, xenografted tumorswere separately treated with docetaxel (10 mg/kg i.v.bolus on day 5, 11, 17, 23). The tumor volumes and animal bodyweight were measured every three days. Expression of PARP,Bcl(2), Bax, and caspase-3 families of proteins wasmeasured by Western Blotting (WB), while TUNEL andimmunohistochemical methods were utilized to determineDNA fragmentation and Curcumin inhibited growth of evidenced by nuclear condensation intreated H460 cells. Curcumin caused 38 and 63% reduction in the xenografted tumor volumes at a dose of 100 ( p<0.05) and 300 ( p<0.01) mg/kg/day, respectively, induction of apoptosis bya mitochondrial pathway. In conclusion, our studies thepotent antitumor activity of curcumin against NSCLC cells.Thus, curcumin may be a promising novel chemotherapeuticagent for the treatment of human lung cancer. 647 MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF THEPROGRESSION FROM PRE-NEOPLASTIC GROUNDGLASS HEPATOCYTES TO HEPATOCELLULARCARCINOMA: Su , Juei-Chu Yang, Hang-Chieh Wu and Wen-Ya Huang Division of Clinical Research, National Health Research Institutes, and Graduates Institutes of Basic Medicine andBiotechnology, Tainan, Taiwan, ROCAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3501The discovery of ground glass hepatocytes (GGH) that contain hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigens byHadziyannis and Popper in 1972 represents a historiclandmark in the pathology of chronic HBV infection.Different types of GGHs have been correlated to theexpression patterns of core/surface antigens and stages ofvirus replication. The original two types (designated Type Iand II) of GGHs were found by us to contain specific pre-Smutants, with deletions over the pre-S1 or pre-S2 regions,respectively. Both types of pre-S mutants are inendoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induce ER stress response,oxidative intermediates and DNA damage. Type II GGHsconsistently harbor pre-S2 mutants, which may escape fromimmune attack and grows preferentially into clusters in theliver, usually of advanced-stage disease. The pre-S2 mutants,albeit inducing a weaker level of ER stress response thanpre-S1 mutants, could additionally initiate ER stress-independent JAB1/p27/RB/cyclin A, D signals to initiateproliferation of hepatocytes, explaining the clustering ofType II GGHs. Recently, we further demonstrated that thereis activation of the VEGF/Akt/mTOR signal pathway inGGH, the precursor neoplastic lesion, and in the early-stagelivers of 3 to 6-month-old transgenic mice harboring pre-S2mutant which develops into HCC at 2 years of age. Theprevalence of pre-S mutants in chronic HBV carriers alsocarries a higher risk of developing HCC or recurrence afterHCC resection. Combining these data, we conclude thatGGHs, particularly Type II GGH, represent pre-neoplasticlesions in chronic HBV infection. Targeting the Akt/mTORpathway or JAB1/RB pathway by natural products or drugsmay provide prevention for the development or therapy ofHCC in chronic HBV carriers. 648 THE BCL2 MAJOR BREAKPOINT (MBR)WITHIN Sun1,2 Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics of Jiangsu Province, 2Department of Cell Biology and Medical Genetics, 3School of Pharmacy, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, PR China and 4Department of Molecular Medicine, City of Hope National MedicalCenter, Duarte, CA, USA BCL2 is a key regulator of apoptosis and has additional roles in cell cycle control, differentiation and DNA damage repair.Disrupted expression of BCL2 has been implicated in a widevariety of human cancers, including breast, pancreas,colorectal, lung, and both acute and chronic leukemias.Diverse mechanisms are likely to account for thedysregulation of BCL2 gene expression in these different neoplasms. region (mbr) in follicular lymphoma. The mbr isalso a matrix attachment region (MAR). A special AT-richsequence binding protein 1 (SATB1), a MAR bindingprotein, binds to the mbr. SATB1 regulates multiple genesduring development and also sequesters chromatinremodeling proteins and transcription factors to MARelements. In vivo mbr binding by SATB1 strongly implicatesthat this BCL2 region could be involved in BCL2 regulation.In this study we first explored the regulatory function of thembr in BCL2 transcription and its correlation to SATB1. Wedemonstrated that the mbr within the 3'-UTR of BCL2 geneupregulated the reporter gene expression. Deletion of the mbrby homologous recombination significantly decreased thetranscriptional activity of the corresponding allele in thembr-/mbr+ heterozygous cells. Furthermore, the BCL2 alleledeleted of the mbr had a slower response to apoptotic stimulithan did the wild-type allele, implying the mbr is requiredfor regulation of the BCL2 gene in response to apoptosisstimulation. The regulatory function of the mbr was mediatedthrough BCL2 expression. These clearlyindicated that the mbr could positively regulate BCL2 geneexpression and this regulatory function was dependent onSATB1. To explore the mechanism underlying the mbr regulatory function, we began to test our hypothesis that the mbrregulates the BCL2 gene by forming a special chromatinloop structure through SATB1. Based on bioinformaticsanalysis five SATB1 binding sequences have been of the BCL2 promoter using EMSA and ChIPassays. 3C analysis revealed that two of them had specificinteraction with the mbr, indicating that BCL2 gene couldform chromatin loop between mbr and promoter region byanchoring its base to SATB1. Additional experiments areundergoing to correlate the chromatin loop structure to theregulation of BCL2 transcription. Our present work providesan excellent opportunity to study the interplay of proteininteractions and DNA sequence determinants in the functionof a MAR associated with a locus critical for programmedcell death and Clinical and Experimental Hematology, Major of Clinical Medicine, Graduate School ofANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan Notch signaling influences cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in diverse biological processes.Consistent with diverse effects of Notch signaling in multipletissues, abnormalities of Notch pathway molecules areassociated with malignant neoplasms. In humans, theseinclude gain-of-function mutations of NOTCH1 , the gene for a receptor, and loss-of-function mutations of FBW7 , the gene ligase, in acute lymphoblasticleukemias (T-ALL), and a fusion geneinvolving a chromatin regulator gene MLL and Results of luciferase assay revealed that the MLL-MAML2 fusion gene caused aberrant Notch signaling. Interestingly,MLL-MAML2 conferred interleukin-3 (IL-3)-independent growth on cells that were originally dependent on IL-3through the activation of IL-3 gene transcription. Activation of an autocrine cytokine circuit might be one of themechanisms of leukemogenesis by MLL-MAML2 . 650 NEW CONCEPTS ON RISK FACTORS OF HPV ANDNOVEL SCREENING STRATEGIES FOR CERVICALCANCER PRECURSORS Kari Syrj\u00e4nenDepartment of Oncology and Radiotherapy, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland During the past several years, the author has been engaged in co-ordinating two major multi-centre trials testingoptional screening tools for cervical cancer (CC) in low-resource settings both in East Europe and in Latin America.These international trials include the NIS (NewIndependent States of the former Soviet Union) cohort(n=3,187 women) and the LAMS (Latin AmericanScreening) study (n=12,114 women). In both studies, asizeable cohort of women (887 and 1,011, respectively)have been prospectively followed-up to assess the naturalhistory of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV)infections and the role of implicated risk factors aspotential predictors of disease outcome (acquisition,persistence and clearance). We will discuss some of the key observations recently reported from the NIS and LAMS studies, with specialemphasis on i) risk factors that are still controversial ( i.e., oral contraception, OC; and smoking) or not previouslystudied (drug addiction); ii) reproductive factors as potentialco-factors of HPV infections in cervical carcinogenesis ( i.e., age at menarche, menopause); and finally on iii) theperformance of different screening strategies among young and older women. The NIS Cohort failed to establish OC as a risk factor of CC. In all future studies, the strong confounding from thelife-style behavioural factors must be taken into accountwhile interpreting the data on OCs as potential risk factorsof CC. Similarly, it now seems that the increased risk (if any)of CC among smokers seems to be attributed to the increasedacquisition of HR-HPV infections, of which the smokingstatus is an independent predictor in a multivariate model.The same seems to apply to drug addiction as a risk factorof CC. The recent LAMS data show that drug abuse itself isnot a risk factor of i) contracting HR-HPV infection, or ii)developing high-grade CIN. Instead, drug abuse seems to beclosely associated with several of the indicators of riskysexual behavior, which predisposes women to oncogenicHPV infections and thus indirectly contributes to thedevelopment of CIN2+ lesions. Data from the NIS Cohort clearly implicate that menarche age is not associated with increased risk of HR-HPVinfection, or development of high-grade CIN, feasiblyexplained by the fact that menarche age does not have anyeffect on the outcome of CIN lesions or HR-HPV infectionsin a longitudinal setting. Another special group are post-menopausal women, recently shown to have a second peakof HR-HPV prevalence in many populations. The NISCohort data suggest that among women who fail to eradicatetheir HR-HPV infection by the menopause, there is i) atransition from multiple infections to single-type infections,and ii) selection of an integrated viral clone already takenplace, driving the process towards an aggressivelyprogressing cervical disease. Finally, these special features of HR-HPV infections among young and elderly women lead us to consider whetherdifferent screening strategies should be needed for youngerand older women. Concordantly with other recent reports,data from the LAMS study show that conventional Pap andHC2, but not LBC and VIA, perform significantly differentlyamong younger and older women. However, the choice ofoptimal screening test for young and older women dependson whether the highest positive predictive value (PPV) (Paptest) or the best balance between sensitivity and specificity(SE/SP) (HC2) is used as the selection criteria. Both the NIS Cohort and LAMS Study have significantly contributed to solving several of the open issues in thenatural history of HR-HPV infections as well as in sortingout the optional screening strategies in low-resource settingsand for women of different age groups. In the long term, it ismost likely the cost-effectiveness that is the decisive factorof which screening test will be selected. Needless to say,screening for cervical cancer precursors will be mandatoryin the foreseeable future, even in this emerging era ofprophylactic HPV vaccination.

Molnar4and J. Moln\u00e1r5 1Department of Plant Biology, 2Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, 3Institute of Biochemistry, University Medical Microbiology and Immunobiology, University of Szeged,Hungary Various plant compounds and metabolites have been identified and described as potential anticancer agents ormodifiers of multidrug resistance. Among these activecompounds there are chemicals, like carotenoids andterpenoids. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectof chlorophylls freshly isolated from the leaves of beanplants. The effects of chlorophyll a and b were studied onthe drug accumulation in human MDR1 gene transfectedmouse lymphoma cells. Chlorophyll aandbhad a similar dose dependent effect on cell membrane structure withoutaltering the cell size measured by flow cytometry. Chlorophyll bwas able to elevate moderately Rhodamine 123 accumulation of MDR tumor cells. In addition thecombination of chlorophyl band capsorubin showed a remarkable increase in the inhibition of Pgp 170 while thechlorophyll a reduced the effect of capsorubin. MDR reversal effect of chlorophyll bcan be explained by energetically favorable electron charge transfer complexformation between chlorophyll band the carotenoid pigments on the Pgp170. The energy gradient is in theoptimum range from carotenoid to chlorophyll b, but low binding energy of chlorophyll adoes not modify the functionally active conformation of the Pgp 170 membraneprotein. In a checkerboard experiment the combination ofdoxorubicine and chlorophyll bresulted in a synergistic interaction on inhibition of proliferation of MDR tumor cellsin vitro . The MDR cells were re-sensitized the antiproliferative effect of anticancer drug, namely todoxorubicine. Foundation 5922 Farnsworth Ct, Carlsbad, CA 92008, USA Over half a million malignant tumors of the head and neck are diagnosed each year worldwide, about 4,000 of them inHungary. Nine tenth of them approximately are cancers ofsquamous cell origin and first diagnosed at stage III or IV .An overall 5-year survival rate is below 50% for nearlythree decades. Current therapies on selected patients permitorgan preservation. Despite aggressive combination ofchemotherapy with CDDP and 5-FU and external-beamradiation therapy, local and regional recurrence is 30% anddistant recurrence occurs in 25% of the patients. The highmortality and morbidity encourage the pursuit alternativetherapeutic strategies. The immune system of advancedstage head and neck cancer (HNC) patients is frequentlysuppressed. Poor immune function has been correlated withpoor clinical outcome. We have linked the development during which antigenic determinantsfrom pathogens mimicking to breaking T-cell tolerance.Some level of autoimmunity is normal and necessary foreffective pathogen eradication. However, autoreactive T-cells must be eliminated by apoptosis when the immuneresponse is terminated. Apoptosis can be deficient in theevent of a weakened immune system, the causes of whichare multifactorial. Some autoreactive T-cells suffer genomicdamage in this process. The resulting cancer stem cell stillretains some functions of an inflammatory T-cell, so itseeks out sites of inflammation inside the body. Due to itsdefective constitutive production of inflammatory cytokinesand other growth factors, a stroma is built at the site ofinflammation similar to the temporary stroma built duringwound healing. The cancer cells grow inside this stroma,forming a tumor that provides their vascular supply andprotects them from cellular immune response.Immunotherapeutic strategies have been previouslyattempted in an effort to enhance immune function andimprove survival. Covalently linking proteins and cytokinescould have enormous potential for the in vivo manipulation of the immune system. Human carcinoembryonic well known.Expression CEA in HNC is not widely recognized. It isimportant to note that most of these studies used polyclonalantibodies that may have cross-reactivity with CEA-relatedantigens. Recent studies evaluated CEA in preclinical andclinical levels as a target for specific immunotherapyagainst HNC.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)and its receptors are promising targets for antitumortherapy because of its major role in the tumor angiogenesis.We discovered KRN951, a novel orally active inhibitor ofVEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, and elucidated its in vitro and in vivo characteristics. KRN951 potently and specifically inhibited in vitro VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of all three critical VEGF receptorsVEGFR-1, -2 and -3, at picomolar concentrations, drugs; they inhibitnot only naomolar level but also other kinases,such as c-Kit, PDGF, Raf and so on. Because of multi-target inhibition activity in these drugs, various toxicitiesare seen in humans. In contrast, due to the high specificityof KRN951, it is assumed that KRN951 may have a mildtoxicity profile in humans. KRN951 also showed inhibitoryactivity against VEGF-driven, mitogen-activated proteinkinases and the proliferation of endothelial cells atpicomolar concentrations, but affected neither FGF-drivennor EGF-driven cellular responses even at 100 nM.KRN951 did not show antiproliferative effects in vitro on various tumor cells. Daily oral administration of KRN951 in athymic mice and rats resulted in significant growth inhibition of varioustypes of human tumor xenografts at extraordinarily lowdoses without obvious toxicity. Effective doses of KRN951that exerted significant inhibitory activity on tumors were 5mg/kg/day in nude mice and 0.2 mg/kg/day in nude rats.Significant inhibitory activity on tumors were also exertedin combination with cytotoxic drugs, without additionaltoxicity. In a syngeneic peritoneal disseminated tumormodel, KRN951 suppressed growthand accumulation of ascites, KRN951 also normalized the architecture oftumor-induced neovasculature with aberrant structure. In newly established multiple myeloma xenograft model,KRN951 also efficiently inhibited tumor-dependentosteolysis of bone marrow. Noteworthy was the superiorefficacy of KRN951 over bevacizumab against tumor-associated onset of hind leg paralysis at equivalent survivalbenefit doses. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that KRN951 is a highly potent and selective triple-VEGFR inhibitorassociated with in vivo antitumor activity in wide variety of tumor models. The highly potent, specific unique profile ofKRN951 will allow it to be easily combined with otheragents at low doses and suggests the potential for a superiortherapeutic index beyond the current multi-targeting tyrosinekinase inhibitors. Encouraging results of a Phase I clinicaltrial will also be presented. 654 A NOVEL MULTIMODALITY TREATEMENT FOR PANCREATIC CANCER Hiroshi Takamori , HideoBaba of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, 1-1-1Honjo, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan Background: Patients with pancreatic cancer often suffer from tumor recurrence despite curative resection, whichindicates that systemic therapy added to local control mightbe required to cure pancreatic cancer. The aim of this studywas to assess the feasibility and response to a novelmultimodality therapy composed of pancreatic resection andintraoperative radiation with pre-and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)intra-arterial continuous infusion and systemic gemcitabineadministration for pancreatic cancer. Patients and Methods: Forty-two patients with potentially resectable pancreaticcancer underwent this multimodality therapy. Enroll criteriawere: i) age<80, ii) PS<1, iii) no evidence of distantmetastases, iv) no evidence of tumor extension to the celiacaxis or the superior mesenteric artery, v) major organfunction preserved. For preoperative chemotherapy, 5-FUwas administered at a dose of 125 mg/m 2/day on days 1-5 every week as a continuous pancreatic and hepatic arterialinfusion, and gemcitabine was infused intravenously at mg/m 2for 30 min once Pancreatic combined with IORT (30 Gy, 12 Mev of electronbeam) was performed after a one-week rest following thecompletion of preoperative chemotherapy. Postoperativechemotherapy was performed in the same way asAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3505preoperative chemotherapy after the recovery from surgery. Results: In preoperative chemotherapy, the most common toxicities of grade 3/4 were hematological events includingneutropenia (15 pts.), leukocytopenia (7 pts), andthrombocytopenia (2 pts). Only one patient experienced adelay in surgery because of preoperative chemotherapy-related neutropenia. All 42 patients underwent surgery. Inpostoperative chemotherapy, grade 3/4 toxicities includedneutropenia (22 pts.), leukocytopenia (13 pts), anemia (4pts.), thrombocytopenia (3 pts), liver abscess (3 pts.), cardiacischemia (2 Pts.), perforation of small intestine (1 pt), andrenal failure (1pt), although no chemotherapy-related deathwas observed. The period MST of36.5 months. Conclusion: This new multimodality treatment is feasible and tolerable, and may contribute to furtherimprove the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. 655 EXPRESSION ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY GENES INVOLVED IN ACQUIRED RESISTANCE TO CISPLATIN IN OSTEOSARCOMA Medical Science, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi,Kanazawa; 2Department of Pathology, Kanazawa Medical University, 1-1 Ishikawa, Japan Background: Clinical observations indicate that tumour cells can acquire tolerance when an anticancer drug isadministered repeatedly. Gene expression in cisplatin-resistant cells was analysed to identify changes in geneexpression particularly early in the course of cisplatinexposure. Materials and Methods: After establishing a cisplatin-resistant human osteosarcoma cDNA expression microarrays were used to studygenes linked with prolonged exposure to cisplatin of humancancer cells. Results: OST/R cells showed increased expression of 17 genes and reduced expression of 14. Genesassociated with DNA repair, apoptosis, cell cycleprogression, and proliferation were associated with theacquired resistance. Genes showing early changes were alsoidentified. Conclusion: Identification of genes showing altered expression in the early stages of development ofresistance to cisplatin may help to improve the therapeuticeffectiveness of this drug.656 SURVIVIN EXPRESSION IN Department of Oncological Science (Surgery II), Oita University Faculty of Medicine, Oita, Japan Purpose: The present study examined the clinicopathological impact of survivin expression in esophageal squamous cellcarcinoma (ESCC). In addition, the biological role of anti-apoptosis parameters in ESCC was examinedimmunohistochemically. Patients and Methods: Subjects comprised 71 patients followed for 5 years after surgery forESCC and analyzed immunohistochemically to examine theclinicopathological impact of survivin expression. Separately,37 fresh frozen samples of ESCC obtained recently wereexamined concerning splicing variant expression of survivinusing reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Immunohistochemical survivin expression detected in nuclei of 10 ESCC specimens (14.1%) andcytoplasm of 22 specimens (31.0%). 26 with histologicaldifferentiation ( p=0.038), but no other significant correlations were identified between any mRNA and clinicopathologicalfactors. Conclusion: As a molecular biological anti-apoptotic factor, survivin expression was of use in assessing clinicaloutcomes in ESCC. Inhibition of survivin may be useful as amolecular biological therapy in ESCC. 657 BIO-IMMUNOTHERAPY, A COMBINEDBIOLOGICAL AND IMMUNOLOGICAL CANCER THERAPY MODALITY Thomas Tallberg and Jan Dabek The Institute for Bio-Immunotherapy, Helsinki 00200 Finland Tumours may spontaneously regress which implies that mammals possess a natural intrinsic regulatory capability toANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3506control the de-differentiation of specialized cells, \"The metabolic triumph of the host\" (Dr. W.M. Cole 1974). Thusa novel paradigm is that cancer represents a complex chronicmetabolic deficiency disease which can be compensated bybiological dietary means. The aim was consequently toanalyze if the disturbed interior milieu can becorrected/compensated for leading to a biological curewithout side-effects. In randomized clinical studies withhundreds of cancer patients, over 30 years, highly significant(p=0.001) improvement in the survival rate has been obtained by feeding them a specific combination ofnutritional amino acids, trace-element ions, inductionalcentral nervous system lipids supportinghormonal balance and specifically activating the patientsautologous immune-defence. The role of these naturalaetiological biomodulating majorforms of cancer: leukaemia, adenocarcinoma, and sarcoma,have primarily been outlined (Figure). Significantly better disease-free intervals were achieved with long-term use of powders containing these vital dietarysupplements to correct the complex aetiological metabolicdeficiency causing cancer. In a randomized study with 127patients suffering from metastasized renal cancer, dietarysupplements were also able to arrest recurrent disease.Pertinent bio-modulating dietary components were: L-aminoacids: Ala, Arg, Asp, Lys; Cr, Sn,V; central nervous system (CNS) lipids, and physiologicaldoses of vitamins. Significantly improved clinical resultswere also obtained with cutaneous (102 cases) and uvealmelanoma (54 patients) ingesting Gly, Glu, Ala, Asp, Ile,Lys, Cr, Se, Sn, V , W, and CNS-lipids. Ready-made powders made to treat prostate cancer (decreasing Gleason scores) are available from our Institute,at a cost of only 2-4 \u20ac/ day (Int J Biotechnology, 9: 3/4; 391-410, 2007). In bio-immunotherapy, significant clinicalimprovement has been achieved from dietary correction alone in renal cancer ( p=0.04), and high risk (T3) uveal melanoma ( p=0.001), but clinical results are usually further improved if the therapy is combined with active specificimmunotherapy utilizing polymerized autologous tumourtissue (except for prostate cancer). Tumour tissue shouldtherefore always be saved at surgery to facilitate thepreparation of individual vaccines since a patient's malignantcells contain a fingerprint of antigenic tumour markers (JBiol Chem, 242: 1651-1659, 1967). Similar good therapeutic results have also been obtained with other forms of cancer(J Austr Coll Nutr & Env Med, 22(1) : 1-20, healing reaction does not involve apoptosis or lysis oftumour cells as they regain normal healthy function, withcomplete regression (CR) even of large tumours, without ascar. Regular immune reactions do not have such a capacity.Actually activated regulatory organ-specific mitochondriahave in fact been found to be involved in the healing process.Metabolic bio-modulation can also prevent recurrent cancerbecause it actively strives to correct the aetiologicaldeficiency. Our standard therapy primarily related only tosymptoms of this metabolic deficiency disease. It is as ifonly the loose teeth of a scurvy patient were removed insteadof giving him vitamin-C. Malignant transformation causedby genetic weaknesses ( e.g. HNPCC) is out of reach for gene therapy, since it involves aberrations in more than threegenes, but malignant transformation can be prevented bydietary supplementation administering small amounts ofpertinent essential metabolic components aimed at regainingthe physiological internal milieu in the patient's body.Healthy persons attain this balance from their normal diet.All bio-modulating components involved are naturalsubstances, and thus ethical, inexpensive, easy to administer,with a long shelf life. Bio-immunotherapy entails no side-effects, but does have also prophylactic potential. 658 PROSTATE CANCER, AETIOLOGICAL,THERAPEUTIC, PROGNOSTIC ANDPROPHYLACTIC FACTORS Thomas and Mervi Dabek The Institute for Bio-Immunotherapy, Helsinki 00200 Finland In the eighties, prostate cancer (PCa) was justly considered a hormone-dependent disease (Huggins & Hobbs 1941), butwas lacking curative treatments and a comprehensibleaetiology. Several signs for adrenal involvement coupledwith metabolic factors impelled this analysis on its aetiology.PCa seems to stem from a deficient production of twoneuroendocrine components produced by adrenal zona-reticularis cells (ZR). One increases FSH, the other prolactin Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3507(PRL) levels. A curative ZR feed-back reaction can be activated in PCa patients by dietary supplementation utilizingready-made powders (for inaddition to ingestion of vital central nervous system, CNS-lipids, as canned \"Neurofood\" Ltd. Helsinki (cans of 220g)mixed with fruits for the sake of taste. The full recipe forthese powders is published in Int J Biotechnology, 9: 3/4, 401, 2007. This non-invasive biological treatment schedulespecifically activates an adrenal feed-back cycle controllingprostate cells (Figure). Disease progression is arrested, ultimately curatively, evidenced as complete regression of multiple bonemetastases (CR >17 years). Levels of PSA - a serine protease-may become stable or regress since enzyme inhibition. Gleason scores may declinefrom 8 to 4, paired with reduced urinary distress. PCa foundincidentally, or by screening should primarily be treatedutilizing dietary supplementation since PSA may decrease ina dose-response manner, whereby serious side-effects causedby invasive treatments could be avoided. A good prognosisis usually registered as increased FSH, PRL and SHBGlevels, declining DHEAS and PSA. In patients withmetastases, or initially a PSA exceeding 15 ng/ml,intermittent total androgen ablation therapy (for only 10days) is prescribed in synergy with continuous dietarysupplementation using PCa powders to sustain the adrenalZR feed-back reaction. We prescribe only Zoladex (3.6 mg)implants shielded by Androcur 50 mg x 2/day the LHRH injection. Androgen ablation intervals varyfrom 2-24 on patient response permitting timefor the adrenal feed-back reaction to function. This bio- modulating schedule has been sustained already for decadeswithout emergence of a hormone refractory state (HRPC).An increase in FSH is strived for preferably reaching inexcess of normal levels (>10 IU), while PSA may remainnormal or also increase before the next hormone treatment.Androgen ablation should not attain a PSA nadir sinceexcessive also decreases when the adrenal feed-backcycle has been exhausted, instigating HRPC. This fatalexhaustion is not due to pituitary dysfunction since PRL isthen markedly increased in patients. Watchful waiting, evenperformed as active surveillance omitting any effort toprevent the disease progression is equivalent to Russianroulette. A rare form of PCa is diagnosed from soft tissuemetastases and their activin levels are excessively increasedwhile inhibin stays low, but patients respond positively to ourbio-modulating treatment. Orchiectomized patients haveimmeasurable inhibin, although normal activin levels as inpregnant females or ladies on oestrogen substitution therapy.There is a new incentive for screening since PCa in the earlyphase can be arrested by non-invasive dietary means alone.Improved diagnostic serum markers such as EPCA-2,kinases, PSA velocity, coupled with MRI and constructivedietary trials inciting ZR feed-back reactions, shoulddiminish the need for 12 biopsy cores, as the latter mayactually spread malignant cells effecting even a higherincidence of recurrent PCa, than the already disturbingincident of >35%. 659 CANCER REGULATED BY The Institute for Bio-Immunotherapy, Helsinki 00200 Finland The observation was made in 1975 that in the serum of cancer patients there could transiently appear some of thebillions of vital lipids, the \"lipidome\", in the central nervoussystem and spinal cord (CNS). Lipidomics depicts studies onneurobiology describing the clinical and psychodynamicfunction of these billions of vital lipids contained in ourbrain, articulated as harmonious synaptogenesis. The aim ofour study was to relate certain clinical features of thisimmensely complex panel of neurological functionssynchronized by this multifaceted brain-lipid network. Inembryogenesis construction of a functional CNS is linked toorgan-specific mitochondria - present especially in braincapillaries. Our daily mental function and stress consumescertain of these vital CNS-lipid molecules resulting in ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3508various clinical psychological and stress conditions. Healthy reconstruction of this physiologic consumption of CNS-lipids proceeds during our sleep providing that our serumcontains certain vital CNS-lipid components supplied viaour diet. Blood-brain barrier lesions causing a leaking ofessential vital lipids into blood could tilt the inductionalcontrol exercised by the injured axon, and new malignantcells could appear in the affected enervated area. Dietarysupplementation utilizing vital, prion-free CNS-lipids canrestore normal cell induction, improve the motor and mentalbalance of patients, and led also to physiological therapeuticeffects in cancer patients. A short survey of these CNSentities will be presented. The human genome projectrevealed the surprising nucleotide sequence analogy inchromosomes of mammalian species. Consequentlymitochondrial mtDNA must have been involved inconstructing the chromosomes as a \"memory of evolution\".Random mutations would exclude such interspeciesnucleotide analogies. Mitochondria produce energy for thenucleus but also regulate the genomes they have created overeons of their phylogenetic toil (Trends Biol Med Finland,ISBN 951-98382-1-X, 2000). numerousbiological functions. mitochondria are activated,caused by bio-immunotherapy, they transform to becomeelectron dense since their cristae gather metallo-enzymesdetected as a significant increase in Cr, Fe, Zn, Ti, content,while strontium (Sr) declines. In mammalian cancer cellssuch transformed mitochondria are involved in biologicalregulation and repair of the genome (and oncogenes) ascancer cells are forced back into healthy transcriptionwithout apoptosis. Organ-specific mitochondria may alsospecifically activate stem cell maturation (Lancet online2005, Aug 18, 1-3). They seem to correct mutations as ifthey have a memory of what they created (Nature 2005:435,903-910). They may also alter the expression ofneuronal genes and mental function in co-operation withbillions of vital lipid molecules forming our inductionalcentral nervous system \"Lipidomics\", acting in concert withGenomics and Proteomics in this triumvirate sustainingnormal health. The rare mitochondrial genome mutations arefound to be closely linked to lipid metabolism resulting inexpression of various forms of neurodegenerative protein andbrain-lipid disorders. Mitochondrial mtDNA seems to havea central role in induction and regeneration of the billions oflipids in the CNS, but its short length restricts thetranscription capacity, though it is sufficient to induce the200 organ-specific mitochondria required to regulate all inmammalians can prevent complete regression of equine sarcoid skintumours in horses, cure human malignant histiocytoma,melanoma and prostate cancer cells. In electron microscopythey are seen to gather around the dividing nucleus of tumourcells as these regain healthy transcription (Figure). Organ- specific mitochondria may in the future be developed to beutilized as physiological precision medical remedies. 660 IDENTIFICATION OF MITOGEN-ACTIV ATEDPROTEIN KINASE 13 (MAPK13) AS London Ooi, Tan Yu-Meng, Alexander Chung, Cheow Peng Chung, Soo KC and Teh Bin Tean Department of General Surgery, Singapore General Hospital;Department of Surgical Oncology, National Cancer Centre;NCCS-V ARI Translational Cancer Research Laboratory,Singapore Aim: Cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common type of primary hepatobiliary cancer. It is prevalent in SoutheastAsia and worldwide incidence is increasing. Currently, onlysurgical resection has been shown to improve survival rates.Neither radiation nor chemotherapy significantly improvessurvival or quality of life. Mechanisms of carcinogenesisremain poorly understood. Prognosis of patients withcholangiocarcinoma is unsatisfactory as there is no reliabletumour marker to facilitate early detection of the disease andno effective chemotherapeutic drugs are available. Ourresearch aims to uncover a biomarker(s) and a prognosticmarker(s) for human cholangiocarcinoma using geneexpression profiling to enable identification of potentialtargets for targeted therapeutic therapy. Methods: We utilized DNA microarray technology to determine the expressionprofile in 17 fresh-frozen Immunohistochemical staining was then performedon 53 paraffin-embedded cholangiocarcinoma samples. The Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3509data obtained from microarray and IHC was correlated with data. Results: Mitogen-activated protein kinase 13 (MAPK13) overexpression was observed in ourtumour specimens. Subgroup analysis showed that MAPK 13overexpression correlated with shorter survival time, andsurvival gradually worsened increasing MAPK13scores. MAPK13 is a reliable prognostic marker for human cholangiocarcinomaand represents a potential target for targeted therapeuticinterventions. 661 DEVELOPMENT OF TWO IN VITRO ASSAY SYSTEMS: SEPARATION OF CANCERSUBPOPULATIONS AND EV ALUATION OF THE OF University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and 2PharmaCo-Cell Company Limited, 1-12-4 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 852-8523; 3Department of Nursing, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki852-8520, Japan To obtain phenotypically distinct subpopulations of cancer cells in vitro , we established a new method to separate cancer subpopulations using the Boyden chamber. Twosubpopulations of DLD-1 (colon cancer cell line) wereseparated in which the intercellular junctions differed. Next,we took advantage of the principle and the new assay system(Can kit) which can evaluate the malignant potentials inmultistep cancer progression was developed. Can kit wasmade of two membrane filter chambers, NIH3T3 (mousefibroblast cell line) and GP8.3 (rat endothelial cell line).HeLa (cervical cancer cell line), B16-F0 (mouse malignantmelanoma cell line) and B16-F10 (mouse malignantmelanoma cell line) were selected to evaluate Can kit. Eachcancer cell line was seeded on Can kit and cultured. Afterseveral days, upper chamber was removed and cells droppedin the lower chamber were cultured. MDCK cells (dogkidney epithelial cell line) were seeded on the lowerchamber, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) ofMDCK was measured after 7 days. HeLa and B16-F10induced significant reductions of TEER of MDCK, whileB16-F0 did not alter it. TEER reductions correlated with thecolony areas of dropped cancer cells on the lower chamber.In conclusion, we developed two different in vitro assay systems, which are valuable tools to understand theheterogeneity and the malignant potentials of cancer.662 INVOLVEMENT OF THE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR IN GENISTEIN-INDUCED EXPRESSION and Tatsuya Nakatani Department of Urology, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan Background: Dietary genistein, a phytoestrogen derived from soybean, has been suggested as a chemopreventive agent forprostate cancer. Genistein has been reported to exert itsanticancer effects viaa variety of functional pathways, but the upstream signaling of molecules regulated by genisteinremains unclear. In this study, estrogen receptor (ER) involvement in genistein-induced expression of cell cycleinhibitors in PC-3 prostate cancer cells was investigated.Materials and Methods: The proliferation of PC-3 cells exposed to genistein was measured by the water-solubletetrazolium salt (WST-1) proliferation assay. The expressionof p21, p27 was assessed byquantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. ERsilencing was performed using a small interfering RNA(siRNA). The transcriptional activity of the p21 promoter wasdetermined assay. of proliferative activity and inducedthe expression of p21 and ER in the PC-3 cells. The siRNAagainst ER suppressed the genistein-induced expression ofp21 and reduced the transactivation activity of the p21promoter induced by genistein. Conclusion: ER is involved in genistein-induced expression of p21 in PC-3 cells. 663 COPPER TRANSPORTER AND CTR1EXPRESSIONS Department of Bioscience,2Division of Diagnostic Radiology, Department of Oral Diagnostic Science, and 4Division of Surgery, Department of Control for Physical Functions, KyushuDental College, 2-6-1 Manazuru, Kokurakita-ku,Kitakyushu 803-8580; 3Department Hospital, 3-2-37Chiyo-machi, Oita 870-0033, Japan Objectives: Recently, it has been suggested that Cu transporters such as hCTR1, ATP7A, and ATP7B are relatedto the transfer of CDDP across the cellular membranes,although how CDDP enters and exits tumor cells hasANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3510remained poorly understood for years. We investigated whether the expression of CTR1 and ATP7A was related toacquired resistance using CDDP-resistant KBR/0.8 andKBR/1.2 cells, and CDDP-resistant 2780CP cells,whose mechanisms of CDDP resistance depend on anincreased DNA repair ability and not CDDP accumulation.Methods: Sensitivity of CDDP was determined using the MTT weremeasured using atomic 2780CP more resistant to CDDP compared toparent cell lines, KB, and A2780 cells, respectively. Theintracellular CDDP levels in KB, KBR/0.8, and KBR/1.2cells decreased depending on the degree of resistance after 2-h treatment with 40 and 80 M CDDP, and those in KBR/1.2cells were 33% (40 M) and 27% (80 M) of that of KBcells. The levels of platinum bound to DNA in KBR/0.8 andKBR/1.2 cells were markedly lower than that of KB cells.The removal of platinum bound to DNA in 2780CP cells wasincreased by 25.3 and 41.9% at 12 and 24 h after treatmentwith 40 M CDDP despite the slight reduction of 15.2% inA2780 cells at 24 h after treatment. The ATP7A level wassimilar in 2780CP and A2780 in KBR/1.2 and KBR/0.8 cells wereobserved compared with KB cells. In cells except forKBR/1.2 and KBR/0.8 cells, ATP expression increased after2-h exposure to 40 M CDDP. The level of CTR1 decreasedmore in 2780CP cells than in A2780 cells. The levels ofCTR1 were almost equal among KB, KBR/1.2, and KBR/0/8cells. Treatment with CDDP hardly had any effect on CTR1expression in all cell lines. Conclusion: ATP7A plays an important role in acquired resistance to CDDP attributed to adecreased intracellular accumulation of Jolanta Szczecin, Poland Multidrug resistance (MDR) constitutes a major problem in cancer chemotherapy. Tumour cells become resistant to awide array e.g. anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, podophylotoxins, colchicine), structurally and different mechanisms of action. Theoccurrence of multidrug resistance (MDR) is conferred bymultiple mechanisms, in particular it is associated with theoverexpression of membrane transporters ( e.g.P-glycoprotein, P-gp; areresponsible for the active ATP-dependent efflux of drugs out of resistant cells resulting in reduced intracellularaccumulation insufficient to inhibit resistant cell proliferation.Additional multidrug resistance mechanisms of tumour cellsare related to: i) drug sequestration into intracellular vesicles,ii) changes of cellular targets ( e.g.nuclear DNA and topoisomerase II), iii) increase in repair of drug-induced DNA damages, iv) intensification of detoxificationprocesses and v) inhibition of apoptosis. Moreover, in thecase of many clinical tumours, it is observed that multidrug-resistant tumour cells have higher invasive and metastaticproperties than cells sensitive to chemotherapy. In these cells,the secretion of proangiogenic molecules ( e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF), important changes in celladhesion molecule expressions and interactions ( e.g.integrins and E-cadherins) as well as increase in the activity ofhydrolytic enzymes responsible for the proteolysis ofextracellular matrix proteins collagen, MMP, cathepsins, enzymes of plasminogen activator system) are often observed. Identification of mechanisms responsible for MDR phenotype of tumour cells having a high metastatic potentialis the main condition in order to develop novel strategies forovercoming multidrug resistance and metastasis of tumourcells. Thus, there are numerous studies focused on thevalidation of MDR/metastasis targets and identification ofnew molecular mechanisms responsible for the highmetastatic activity of multidrug resistant tumour cells usingmodel MDR metastatic samples ( e.g.breast, prostate and colorectal transduction pathways ( e.g. NF-B, HIF-1, PI3K/Akt and p53) play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression involved simultaneously inmultidrug resistance and metastasis of tumour cells. Thisoverview addresses recent advances in the understanding ofcellular mechanisms responsible for the metastatic potential ofmultidrug-resistant tumour cells at the gene expression level. 665 CONTINUOUS BPH FINASTERIDE THERAPY VS. INTERMITTENT TREATMENT: THE UPGRADE OF NED AND THUS OF AGGRESSIVE PROSTATE CANCER M. Tarle , B. Spaji, I. Kralji, B. Z. Kusi Hospital Sestre Milosrdnice, Zagreb, Croatia Introduction and Objectives: Finasteride has been recognized as a drug suitable for the chemoprevention of prostate cancer(PC) by reducing intracellular dihydrotestosterone (DHT)level. Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) data based onAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3511continuous finesteride treatment of almost 19 thousands patients indicated the reduction in cancer prevalence by about25%. However, in this same study more than a two-foldincrease in high grade aggressive prostate tumors was recordedwhen compared to controls thus arising serious doubts uponthe real benefits of the protocol. Materials and Methods: During three years a continuous versus intermittent (six month treatment followed by 6 months resting period) finasteridetreatment in 125 BPH patients (pts) each has been investigatedas well as 125 control BPH pts. Results: The overall PC prevalence in both finasteride-treated groups was lower thanin untreated controls and thus being in accordance with thePCPT data. However, continuous therapy gave significantlyhigher incidence in Gleason score (GS)>6 carcinomascompared to intermitted therapy and controls (44.5%, 25%and 18.2% of total acquired PC, respectively). In addition, theacquired elevated chromogranin A (CgA) values were alsomore than doubled in pts treated continuously compared toother two groups (13.6%, 5.6% and 6.4%, respectively).Acquired PC GS>6 recorded in pts with a raise in CgA washigher in continuously treated pts (50%) than in other twostudied groups (20% and 25%, respectively). In pts with theretained normal CgA concentration highest PC incidence wasfound in controls (5.1%) and lower prevalence was recorded incontinuously (2.8%) and intermittently treated pts (2.5%)while the respective PC GS>6 incidence was lower in controlsthan in treated pts. Conclusion: Seemingly, finasteride treatment reduces PC prevalence in pts free of NED butelevates the number of aggressive carcinomas in CgA-positivepts only if continuous treatment is applied. In conclusion,current chemoprevention protocols need to be carefullyreconsidered prior to the selection between continuous anddiscontinued finasteride treatment.The authors are indebted to many colleagues to Drs. Kraus, Anzulovic, Trnski and Ahel whoparticipated in various stages of the study. 666 BLOOD LDH AND CGA V ALUES IN HRPCPATIENTS AFTER TEN CYCLES OFCHEMOTHERAPY: MARKERS OF SOFT TISSUE LESIONS AND OSTEOLYSIS M. Tarle 1, K. Kovacic1, S. Hospital, Paris, France Introduction and Objectives: Circulating LDH level was examined as a marker of either soft tissue or bone metastasesin prostate cancer (PC) patients (pts) refractory to hormonalcontrol (HRPC and hematological data were analyzedeither after 8-10 cycles of treatment or maximally eightmonths. Pts were divided into four groups according to theirLDH data (normal, 0-241 U/L) and metastases status.Elevated LDH level was tested both against pro bnp as acardiac failure marker and as being an EPO administrationside-effect. Results: i) 79 pts with bone metastases and no more than 6% increase in LDH level. In 6 months 5 of thesepts were switched to group C; ii) 11 pts with bone metastasesand elevated LDH value (17-188% increase). Within 6months lymph node and soft tissue positivity was clinicallyfound in 5/11 (45%) of them. Other 6 pts were followed forpossible micrometastases. iii) 14 pts with bone metasteses,soft tissue lesions (lymph nodes, liver/lung), highly elevatedLDH PSA (>500 was elevated in 10/14 (71%) ofthese pts. Five pts from group A were added to these 11subjects due to liver metastases; iv) 8 pts with both bone andsoft tissue metastases were found with normal LDH leveland an elevated PSA level (92-458 ng/ml); v) In 15/122(12%) pt with bone lesions osteolysis was recorded and in13 out of 15 chromogranin A (CgA) serotest level waselevated ng/ml) together with the elevation of theLDH level. Conclusion: According to the ROC curve analysis of the above data both sensitivity and specificity ofLDH values in respect to soft tissue lesions are 85-90% thusindicating the interconnection between these two parameters.The simultaneous elevation of CgA and LDH values isindicative of osteolysis. These data open the way for a moredetailed analysis of the LDH level in monitoring HRPC ptsreferred to chemotherapy with the possible extend of themarker to both osteolysis and soft tissue micrometastases. 667 CHROMOSOME COPY-NUMBER V ARIATION AND BREAST CANCER RISK Sandrine Tchatchou and Barbara Burwinkel Helmholtz-University Group Molecular Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center, DKFZ, Heidelberg,Germany Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women. It is caused by genetic and environmental factors. Whereasmutations in high-penetrance susceptibility genes have beenidentified in familial breast cancer and several single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to be associated withboth familial and sporadic breast cancer risk, the impact ofgenomic copy-number variants (CNVs) on breast cancer riskhas so far poorly been studied. An example of a CNV affectingthe tumor suppressor gene MTUS1 that has been to beANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3512associated with familial breast cancer risk is given. Moreover, we discuss CNVs affecting detoxification genes such asGSTM1 and GSTT1 that were controversially associated with breast cancer risk. Finally, the potential of array-based genome-wide CNV association studies is discussed. 668 EXTRACELLULAR PROTEASES PROGRESSION EXPERIMENTAL Department Regulation, Carcinogenesis Research Institute, N.N. Blokhin Memorial CancerResearch Center, Moscow, Russia The study was focused on comparative analysis of extracellular proteases activity in vitro in high and low metastatic lines of transformed hamster fibroblasts, as wellasin vivo in primary tumors and metastatic lung samples of experimental animals followed by subcutaneous injection ofstudied cell lines. We compared extracellular proteasesactivity in highly tumorigenic cell lines of the same origin(RSV transformed hamster embryo fibroblasts) with differentlevels of lung metastatic activity. We also analysed thischaracteristic in primary tumors and lungs of hamsters aftersubcutaneous injection of studied cells. Activity ofextracellular proteases, cell culture media, cell lysates,lysates samples and lung metastatic lesions,respectively. uPA receptor expression was detectedby Western-blot showed that uPA activity (both intracellular and secreted) is significantly elevated in high metastatic HET-SR1line in comparison with low metastatic HET-SR line. Anincrease of uPA activity was also found in primary tumours aswell as in the samples of metastatic lungs of animals afterinjection of HET-SR1 cells in comparison with hamstersinjected with HET-SR cells. Both lines demonstrated similarhigh level of uPAR protein expression. MMP-1, -2 and -9activity analysis revealed that in vitro in culltured cells, MMP-2 is the most active secreted gelatinase, MMP-1 In vivo , MMP-9 activity is stimulated so that in tumor samples MMP-9 and MMP-2 demonstrate comparable levels of activity.MMP-9 is the most active gelatinase in lungs. Under theconditions of carcinogenesis and metastasis, MMP-9 activityin lung cancer increases in comparison with that of healthyanimals from control group. MMP-2 secretion in vitro is elevated in the high metastatic HET-SR1 cell line incomparison with HET-SR cells. In vivo , MMP-9 and MMP-2are more active both in primary tumors and in lung samples of hamsters injected with HET-SR1 cells. uPA, MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities are critical for the development of highly metastatic cell phenotype in thestudied experimental model. 669 APE1/REF-1: A DNA REPAIR PROTEIN WITH PLEIOTROPIC ACTIONS Gianluca Tell Molecular Biology Section, School of Medicine, Department of Biomedical Sciences and Technologies,University of Udine, P.le Kolbe 4, 33100 Udine, Italy APE1/Ref-1 (APE1), the mammalian ortholog of E. coli Xth, and a multifunctional protein possessing both DNA repair andtranscriptional regulatory activities, has pleiotropic role incontrolling cellular response to oxidative stress. APE1 is a vitalprotein. It is the main apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease ineukaryotic cells playing a central role in the DNA base excisionrepair pathway of all DNA lesions (uracil, alkylated andoxidized and abasic sites), including single-strand breaks, andhas also co-transcriptional activity by modulating geneexpression directly by TTF-1) transcription factors. Thus it plays a central rolein controlling different, and apparently contrasting, cellularprocesses such as apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation. Itmay also have quite diversified roles depending on the cell type,whether normally dividing, postmitotic, or cancer cells. Inaddition, it controls the intracellular redox state by inhibitingreactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We speculate thatthe essentiality of APE1 may be due to its pleiotropic biologicaleffects rather than merely to its DNA-repair activity. To this aim,the biological relevance of APE1 in eukaryotic transcriptionalregulation of gene expression has yet to be elucidated, butprogress is being made using inhibitors of specific APE1functions. The ability of APE1 to activate transcription factors,such as p53 and Egr-1, which are mainly involved in controllingcell-cycle-arrest and apoptotic programs, leaves the debate openabout the mechanisms responsible for controlling its differentfunctions in several contexts. At present, information is stillinadequate regarding the molecular mechanisms responsible forthe coordinated control of its several activities. However, changein the expression level, subcellular distribution, post-translational modifications and modulation of its interactingpartners may significantly contribute to the fine-tuning of itsdifferent activities. Both expression and/or subcellularlocalization are altered in several metabolic and proliferativedisorders such as in tumors and aging. In the present review, wehave attempted to relate the most relevant informations,including our most recent findings on the APE1 interactome and Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3513gene networking concerning different functions of APE1 in order to shed new light and to focus current and future studiesto fully understand this unique molecule that is acquiring moreand more interest and translational relevance in the field ofmolecular cancer therapeutics. 670 UV BIODOSIMETER FOR ANTICANCER UV EXPOSURE - VISUAL DETECTION OF VITAMIN D SYNTHESIS Irina TerenetskayaInstitute of Physics, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, 02028, Kiev, Ukraine As is well known, high energy ultraviolet (UV) photons may produce positive or negative health effects depending on thereceived UV dose. Excessive UV exposures are generallyassociated with acute and chronic effects, and mostcommonly used UV detectors have spectral sensitivity whichis a close match to the CIE erythema action spectrum. Nevertheless, in proper dose UV radiation is beneficial: in addition to psychological benefits, exposure to UV-B light(280-315 nm) helps the body to produce vitamin D, which isrecognized as a critical factor of cells' growth. Epidemiologicalstudies show that cancer mortality rates are correlated inverselywith local solar UV-B doses for 13 types of cancer, and themost likely mechanism whereby solar UV-B radiation providesprotection against cancer is natural production of vitamin D. In the meantime, the vitamin D deficiency has become a neglected epidemic in most adults who are not exposed toadequate sunlight. With due regard to recent data on theEurope's darker atmosphere in the UV-B, it is believedvitamin D deficiency can be treated by artificial irradiationon condition that the vitamin D synthetic capacity is properlydetected to avoid both either UV deprivation or acute andchronic UV injury (Figure). To determine quantitatively the boundaries near area B, the so-called \"comfort UV dose\", we have developed a bio-equivalent UV dosimeter1) that is based on the samemolecular photochemistry from which vitamin D issynthesized in human (7- crystalline matrix. Under UV irradiation themolecular conformation of 7-DHC molecule is altered, andthe LC sample changes its colour. This enables quantitativeestimation of previtamin D synthesized per cm 2using calibrated color strips (like a litmus paper measures pH)providing the easiest detection of vitamin D synthesis andsimple estimation in situ of the accepted \"antirachitic\" UV dose. 1 Orlova T and Terenetskaya I: \"UV-biosensor FOR of Athens Medical Hippocration University Hospital, 114 VasSofias Ave, 11527, Athens; 2Department Ave, 11527, Athens; 3First Department of Surgery of Athens Medical School, Laikon University Hospital, 17 Ag.

Thoma Str, 11527,Athens, Greece Background: The primary aims of colorectal cancer surgery are to achieve oncological clearance and to prolong survival.Health-Related Quality of Life must not be forgotten in thequest for oncological excellence. Ethnic background affectsthe patients' perception of quality of life. This study wasdesigned to prospectively evaluate Health Related Quality ofLife, in a solid Mediterranean group of colorectal cancerpatients. Methods: Ninety-five colorectal cancer patients were preoperatively assessed up in repetitivepostoperative fixed time-points. The Short Form-36 HealthSurvey questionnaire was used by skilled investigators.Results: Overall, patients showed deterioration in all domains, except for pain, when baseline values werecompared to 3 and 6 months postoperatively ( p=0.0001). Asignificant improvement of SF-36 domains was noted between 6 and 12 months ( p=0.0001). Scores for general health, pain, emotional wellbeing, role limitations due toemotional problems at 1 year were better than preoperative(p<0.001). Better role limitations due to physical health and due to emotional problems domains scores at baseline and at1 year were found when laparoscopic were compared to openresections ( p<0.05). Patients that received chemotherapy, proved to be more susceptible regarding their energy, socialfunctioning and role limitations at 3 months ( p<0.05). Older patients had diminished physical functioning at 3 and 6 and12 months ( p<0.05). Conclusion: Colorectal cancer patients remain fragile up to 6 months postoperatively, withsignificant improvements at 1 year. Certain aspects of healthrelated quality of life at 1 year may be even better thanbefore surgery. 673 p53 AND EGFR EXPRESSION IN COLORECTALCANCER: A REAPPRAISAL OF \"OLD\" TISSUEMARKERS IN PATIENTS WITH LONG of Athens Medical School, School, Laikon University Hospital 17 Ag. Thoma Str, 11527,Athens, Greece Background: Extensive research into the biology of colorectal cancer has identified a plethora of molecularmarkers reputed to provide prognostic information. Duringthe last two decades conflicting results have been drawn onthe role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and of the firstidentified member of the type receptor tyrosine kinasefamily, the EGFR on colorectal cancer prognosis. p53mutational status has been associated with both improvedand reduced survival. EGFR has been associated withdecreased length of survival, increasing Dukes stage orlymph node metastases in several reports, but as manystudies have reported no association with unfavourableprognostic parameters. The aim of the study was to evaluatethe p53 and EGFR expression in patients with an at least 5-year follow-up. Materials and Methods: Paraffin-embedded material was retrospectively collected from 164 colorectaladenocarinoma (50 rectal cancers) patients, who had beenoperated between 1994 and 2003. Median follow-up was 5years (range: 1-14). p53 and EGFR expression was evaluatedAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3515by immunohistochemistry. Results: Positive p53 immunostaining and EGFR expression 62%and 43%, and EGFR positivity rates weresignificantly interrelated ( p=0.004). No significant correlation was found with the examined clinicopathologicalparameters except for the advanced T-stage, whichdemonstrated significant associations p53expression p=0.001). (Log ( p=0.0001), lymphovascular invasion ( p=0.005), the p=0.004) were associated with the overall cancer-specific survival, while a trend existed for EGFR(p=0.06) and p53/EGFR co-expression ( p=0.07). At multivariate analysis only stage was associated withincreased risk of cancer death (Cox regression analysisp=0.0001, b 1.898 colorectal cancerpatient population and were significantly associated withadvanced T stage. In the context of new therapeutic strategiesusing EGFR-targeted therapies, although EGFR remains acontroversial prognostic factor, this expression-stageassociation may play a crucial role in a decision to initiatean adjuvant treatment. 674 HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES AFTER LAPAROSCOPIC AND OPEN RESECTIONS FOR COLORECTAL CANCER: THE INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES AND THE EXPERIENCE FROM A GREEK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL George E. TheodoropoulosDepartment of Colon and Rectal Surgery, Athens Medical School, Greece Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies in the Western part of the world. Surgery is themainstay of treatment, and it may be combined withpreoperative radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy.Although surgery offers a good chance of cure, it also hasshort and long-term detrimental impacts on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQL). For several post-operativemonths, patients experience fatigue, pain and reducedactivity levels. Many struggle with an altered bowel habit,and the patient may need to adapt to life with a permanentor temporary stoma. After rectal surgery, sexual and urinarydysfunction frequently occurs, and these problems maypersist. The diagnosis and treatment of CRC also has apsychosocial impact; patients worry about diseaserecurrence, and the combination of physical and emotionaldifficulties inevitably impact on social well-being. Laparoscopic colorectal surgery for cancer offers short- term advantages such as earlier diet re-establishment, lesspostoperative pain, less narcotic use and shorter hospital stay.Slowly accumulating and rather controversial is theinformation in regards to the effect of laparoscopic colorectalresections on HRQL. Four randomized controlled trials existin the literature comparing \"open\" and laparoscopiccolectomies for cancer. Analyzing the early results of the USCOST study, Weeks et al. reported that laparoscopic surgeryresulted in slightly better overall HRQL 2 weeks post-procedure and less pain. The small trial by King et al.reported no HRQL differences between treatment groups asdid the larger UK multi-centre trial (CLASSIC). CLASSICstudy is probably the most informative, as it containsinformation on HRQL derived from repetitive assessments atfixed intervals. In this study, more problems than at baselinewere reported for physical functioning by both \"open\" andlaparoscopic arms at 6 months postoperatively. Thiscontinued in the laparoscopic arm up to 3 years, but returnedto baseline levels at 18 months for the open arm. Fewerproblems than at baseline were reported by both arms foremotional functioning. Social functioning was worse than atbaseline for the laparoscopic arm up to 3 yearspostoperatively, but remained the same as baseline for theopen arm. There was more fatigue for both arms at 6 monthsbut levels returned to baseline for both arms by 18 months.In a small study, Schwenk et al. reported significantly less pain and fatigue after laparoscopic colon resections. Eight studies in the international literature report data on sexual dysfunction after laparoscopic total mesorectalexcision (TME) for rectal cancer.A retrospective,questionnaire-based study by Quah et al. showed a higher rate of male sexual dysfunction after laparoscopic resectioncompared with open resection Analyzing the prospectivelycollected data of the CLASSIC study, Jayne et al. found that overall sexual function tended to be worse after laparoscopicthan \"open\" rectal surgery. A recent Turkish study betweenthe two approaches, though, demonstrated that impotencyrates were higher after \"open\" surgery. Focusing on patientswith low-lying rectal cancers undergoing sphincter-preserving operations, Yang et al. demonstrated that laparoscopic TME male patients had better sexual functionand less sexual problems during 12-18 months and bettersexual enjoyment than \"open\" TME patients. In a smallseries recently published by Breukink et al. , erectile function was maintained in 71% and ejaculation function in 89%,while a significant deterioration in intercourse satisfactionwith unchanged the overall satisfaction was observed afterradiotherapy and laparoscopic TME. In our Institution, 95 colorectal cancer patients were preoperatively assessed and followed up in repetitivepostoperative fixed time-points. The Short Form-36 HealthSurvey questionnaire was HRQL assessment.

Thill 1, D. Fischer1, S. Becker1, T. Cordes1, K. Diedrich1and [1,25(OH) 2D3] make the biologically active form of vitamin D to a promising target in breast cancer therapy. It is wellknown, that these effects are mediated viathe vitamin D 3 receptor (VDR). Furthermore breast cancer is associated with inflammatory processes based on an up-regulation ofcyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, the prostaglandin enzyme, 15 hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase as a tumor suppressor in cancer. First referencessuggest a correlation between vitamin D and prostaglandinmetabolism through the impact of 1,25(OH) 2D3on the expression of COX-2 and 15PGDH. Thus we evaluated theexpression of COX-2 and 15PGDH in correlation with VDR.Materials and The Expression of VDR, COX-2 and 15PGDH in MCF10F, a human benign epithelial cell lineand the breast cancer cell line, MCF-7 was determined byreal-time PCR and western blot analysis. Furthermore, wedetermined mRNA levels of COX-2 and 15PGDH and VDRin healthy and malignant breast sample tissues. Results: Although our data from real-time PCR were divergent fromthose obtained from the Western-blot analysis, COX-2protein expression increased in MCF-7 2-fold compared toMCF10F. These data were confirmed in breast cancer tissuesamples, where COX-2 mRNA level increased by 1.44 incomparison to healthy tissues. No correlation of 15PGDHwas detected in either cell line, but in malignant tissues,15PGDH increase dramatically compared to healthy tissuesamples. The expression of VDR differed at the protein andmRNA level in benign and malignant cell lines. VDR proteinlevels were inversely correlated to 15PGDH expression andrevealed that the benign tissues as well as the MCF10F cellshave the highest VDR expression. Conclusion: We found a basically inverse correlation between VDR and 15PGDHprotein level expression. These findings suggest a possiblelink between VDR, associated target genes and prostaglandinmetabolism. Gaining further insight into mechanismsregulating VDR, COX-2 and 15PGDH expression in healthyand malign tissue might open new therapeutic approaches inbreast cancer therapy. 676 ASSOCIATION BETWEEN XRCC 1 POLYMORPHISMS AND HEAD AND NECKCANCER School, Hungary, P\u00e9cs, Szigeti str. 12; 31st Department of Medicine, P\u00e9cs, Ifj\u00fas\u00e1g Munk\u00e1csy M. str. 2,Hungary Background: The head and neck cancer is the fifth most common newly diagnosed cancer in the Hungarianpopulation, with a mortality that increased by 265% in thelast thirty years. Tobacco use and alcohol consumption arethe most important risk factors of head and neck cancer.Because of the important role of the XRCC1 gene in DNArepair, we tested the effects of the Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln polymorphisms of XRCC1 to the clinical outcome of the head and neck cancer. Materials and Methods: A PCR-RFLP method was used. 108 samples were taken from intraoperatively removed formalin fixed,Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3517and paraffin embedded blocks of tissue. After deparaffination by microwave samples weredigested polymorphism age-and sex-matched healthy controlgroup was used to compare the frequency of polymorphicvariants with cancer-free population. Results and Discussion: No significant difference was found between patients and controls regarding the investigatedpolymorphisms of XRCC1 gene. In the second part of our study we tested the effects of genotype effects on overallsurvival. We investigated the effects of the XRCC1 gene polymorphisms in respect to the patients clinical stage. Wefound a significant difference between patients withdifferent XRCC1 194 polymorph status in clinical stage SIII. The patients with Arg194Arg genotype had significantly lower survival rate than patients withArg194Trp genotype. The complex analysis of these factors may be a way for the personal risk assesement andtreatment. 677 ALLELIC POLYMORPHISMS 41st Hungary, P\u00e9cs, Ifj\u00fas\u00e1g str. 13; Ifj\u00fas\u00e1g str. 13, Hungary Background: Cancers of the colorectal region are the second most frequent cause of death among malignant diseases. Weinvestigated the influence of two allelic polymorphisms ofthe GSTM1 and GSTT1 metabolyzing enzymes and that ofp53 tumor suppressor gene codon 72 polymorphisms oncolon cancer. Materials and Methods: 102 intraoperatively removed tissue samples from patients with colorectal cancerwere processed. Cancer-free human samples were used asmatched controls. After deparaffination, samples were digested with proteinase-K. DNA solutions were used forPCR amplification. For GCT GCT CCC CC. Results and Discussion: No significant difference was found between cancer patients andcontrols in respect to GSTM1, GSTT1 and p53polymorphisms. Kaplan-Meier curves were defined in allDukes' stages. Significant association was found in stageDukes' B patients between the GSTM1 and p53 gene variantand survival. The chance of survival was significantly lowerin patients with GSTM1 0 genotype and in p53 Arg/Proheterozygotes or Pro/Pro homozygotes Arg/Arg variants ( p=0.0089 and p=0.0008). The relevance of the investigated polymorphisms on prognosis is dependent on the tumor stage. Theseparameters might be used in certain cases as prognosticbiomarkers and in the planning of individualized therapy. 678 METASTATIC GENE SIGNATURE OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE HUMAN J. T\u00edm\u00e1r Pathology, Semmelweis Budapest; 3Center of Biology, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Szeged, Hungary Most of the melanoma markers used today are melanocytic markers or pigmentation pathway-associated genes drivenby those transcription factor NOTCH2,WNT5A, proliferation-associated antigens CD59/protectin and MIA. Othergenomic analyses tried to define the gene signature of themetastatic disease but failed to find a consistent one exceptANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3518the gold standard genes of 3 integrin, syndecan-4 and WNT5a . Studies on the gene signatures of chemoresistance and cytokine sensitivity of melanoma clearly definedapoptosis-resistance as one of the key elements of theabove biological properties, but the data are controversial,mostly because of the use of inappropriate model systemsand the lack of confirmation on clinical samples. Recentlya meta-analysis of the published array data (involving eighthundred genes) identified only a few-gene set of IGFBP , CMET, FGFR1 and CDK2 which repeatedly (at least in 3 cases) occured in the various genomic studies on metastaticmelanoma suggesting that without proper validation of thegene sets and proper selection of the histological variantsof melanoma it would not be feasible to define a betterprognostic signature. We have used three genetically unrelated human melanoma cell lines grown as s.c.xenografts in SCID mice to reveal a metastatic melanoma gene signature in theprimary tumor. To identify relevant genes, we usednewborn host (metastatic condition) and adult host(nonmetastatic condition). Since the stroma is murine, it ispossible to separate the human (melanoma) genes from thestromal genes without microdissection. Expression profilesof primary human melanomas were by the 41kAgilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray. Thegene set significantly different in all the three cell lineswas further validated by qPCR using Taqman card of 96genes (Applied Biosystem). Using this model, we haveidentified a large 832 metastatic melanoma gene signature(p<0.05), from which we were able to derive a 39-gene set validated by qPCR. This melanoma The largest group of metastasis genes belongs to those involved in theregulation of apoptosis (8) and HOXC13 ). This 39-gene set was on a clinical cohort of twenty primary SSM melanoma samples wherethe 5-year history of clinical behaviour was known(visceral metastatic progression or locoregionaldissemination/no progression). Using the TaqMantechnology we were able to identify a 17-gene metastaticmelanoma gene signature of ten up-regulated and 7 down-regulated genes. The signature contains integrin a v, RXR, TOPO2A, NOTHCH1 and IGFBP7, all claimed previously to be involved in melanoma progression. The signaturealso contains a 4-gene set, members of which are involvedin apoptosis regulation. This novel metastastatic melanomagene signature revealed the apoptotic pathway, TOPO2Aand 3 integrin as valid molecular therapeutic targets ofmelanoma progression. This study was supported byNKFP1a-0024-05.679 A ROLE FOR NON-CODING RNA IN CANCER EPIGENETICS Angela H. Ting Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, USA Epigenetic abnormalities, which involve modifications to the DNA and histones, have long been recognized for theirpivotal role in silencing protein coding genes (tumorsuppressors) to allow cancer development. The involvementof non-coding RNAs will be discussed in the context ofaberrant epigenetic silencing in cancer and data on RNA-dependent transcriptional silencing as a potential mechanismfor the initiation/maintenance of cancer epigenetics will bepresented. We found that synthetic double-stranded RNA isable to effectively initiate transcriptional gene silencing inhuman cancer cell lines. Furthermore, loss of DICER, anessential non-coding RNA processing enzyme, results in theloss of localized promoter hypermethylation and genesilencing. Together, these data support our hypothesis that anRNA-mediated pathway is responsible for at least some ofthe epigenetic regulation in human cancer. 680 EXPRESSION OF ANGIOPOIETINS AND TIE-2 RECEPTOR IN GASTROINTESTINALCARCINOMAS 1-4 (Ang1 - Ang4) are a family of growth factors identified as ligands for Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase,critically involved in angiogenesis by their regulation ofendothelial survival. Ang1 acts as an agonist, activating theTie2 signaling pathways, whereas Ang2 acts as blocking Ang1 dependentactivation in endothelial cells. Ang3 context-dependent actions antagonisticand agonistic ligands, respectively. The biological actions ofthe Angs in tumor growth and metastasis in gastrointestinalcancer are still not fully understood. The aim of the presentstudy was to evaluate the expression of Ang1, Ang2, Ang4and Tie2 receptor in human gastrointestinal carcinomas(GITC), and relation to clinicopathological factors.Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis wereperformed in surgically resected specimens from patientsAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3519(n=27). Normal gastrointestinal mucosa was examined as normal controls (n=5). Intensity of immunostaining wasscored as negative, weak, moderate and high. Mann-Whitneyand Chi-square test were used for statistical comparisonswith a significance defined as p<0.05. Normal gastrointestinal epithelium showed endothelial for > Ang1immunoreactions was seen in most GITC, however thehigher intensity of immunostaining was observed as Ang1 >Ang2 > Ang4 when ligand-receptor is involved in the invasion and metastatic potential of these tumors, andcertainly highlights that these factors represent importanttherapeutic targets to regulate angiogenesis.

F\u00ednek Faculty Hospital and Medical School in Pilsen, E. Benese 13, 305 99 Plzen, Czech Republic Aim: The aim of the study is to demonstrate a potential clinical use of tumor marker assessment. A current indicationfor the tumor markers assessment for the primary diagnosis,follow-up and therapy monitoring is based on ROC ofindividual markers, obtained from multicenter study results.This study proposes an opposite approach: to estimateclinician's needs and to propose the optimal combination oftumor markers. Results and Discussion: On the basis of the evaluation of results from more than 300,000 routineanalyses, an optimal multiparametric diagnostic procedurefor follow up of 10 most common tumor diseases has beenelaborated. The possibility of its use in diagnostics usingmultiplex diagnostic methods is discussed. Conclusion: Acombination of at least 4 parameters seems to be highly optimal: an established tumor marker, a cytokeratinfragment, a marker of proliferation and a growth factor. Thechoice of an optimal combination of parameters differsdepending on the histological type of tumor and the clinicaldiagnosis purpose (primary diagnosis, early detection of thedisease, progression during the follow-up therapymonitoring, etc.).

Pecen and O. Topolcan 1Academy of Science, Prague; 2Faculty Hospital and Medical School in Pilsen, E. Benese 13, 305 99 Plzen, Czech Republic Why sometimes results of tumor markers studies are so various? Weaker rules and standards applied in non-interventional tumor marker studies are applied comparingthem with rules from clinical research (new drugdevelopment). An application of strict rules could decreasethe variability of published results. In clinical research it isrequired to define many important steps in advance (priorfirst patient enters into study) mainly the primary goal of thestudy. The primary goal includes a definition of the primaryendpoint or endpoints and secondary endpoint(s). Onlyresults concerning the primary endpoint will be analysedconfirmatorily, secondary endpoint/s will be analysedexploratorily only. If more than one primary endpoints existin the study, adjustment of statistical testing for multiplecomparison has to be applied. It means alpha level for allconfirmatory testing has to be 5% (0.05) in total for allcomfirmatory testing. In clinical research the sample size hasto be optimized with a specified significance level and poweraccording selected primary endpoint/s and proposed studydesign. Variability of results will be decreased if nullhypothesis and alternative hypothesis will be formallyformulated in advance as well as statistical model will beselected in advance. Important issue is also the statisticalmonitoring of the quality of the data. Special emphasis has tobe given to items entered manually into computer whererecommended standard is double data entry by twoindependent persons and to compare results. Analysis ofpossible confounding and/or interacting factor could alsohelp to explain difference between study' results and otherANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3520published papers with similar topic.

Conti 1, P. Ferraris1, E. role of infrared (IR) spectroscopy in biomedical science has been exploited to distinguishdifferent biomolecules by probing chemical bond vibrationsand using these molecular and sub-molecular patterns todefine and differentiate pathological from healthy samples.IR spectroscopy provides a spectral signature of the intensityand spatial location of the chemical components, sohighlighting biochemical changes. FT-IR microimagingspectroscopy is particularly suitable to characterize tissuestructures owing to the capability of generating maps orimages of sample areas. The use of multivariate data andartificial neural network analysis can afford an unsupervisedclassification of biochemical components. For a decade, we have been applying IR spectroscopy to study pathological states in breast, colon and, mainly, headand neck tissues characterizing various biochemicalcomponents with the aim to detect pathological states.

In order to further verify the reliability of our classification, all the spectra from SK regions were mixedwith those from zones characterized by other tumoursobtaining a new HCA grouping in excellent agreement with their biochemical and histological characterization. The results presented here show subtle biochemical and morphological changes distinguishing various kinds andgrades of neoplasia in tissues from a specific region of thehuman body. The diagnosis of a pathology at a molecularlevel especially in the early stage is dependent on a defailedspectral analysis of infrared spectra, which contributes to theclinical histopathological and immuno-histochemicalscreening. 684 Kor\u00e1nyi Institute of TB and Pulmonology, Budapest, Hungary Numerous clinical data suggest that hypoxia in tumors enhances the aggressiveness of a tumor and promotesmalignant progression. Moreover, hypoxia is an independentprognostic factor in several types of malignant cancer.Correction of anemia and an increase oxygen level inside thetumor not only result in the improvement of quality of lifebut also enhance the success of cancer therapy, leading toimproved survival of patients. Erythropoietin (EPO) has longbeen recognized as the major hematopoietic cytokineregulating normal erythropoiesis. However, recent studiesindicated that, beside erythroid cells, tumor andendothelial cells express erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) aswell, therefore recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO)may affect their functions. We reported that rHuEPO administration modulates tumor vasculature in human squamous cell In rHuEPO treatment of xenografts at dose significantly increasedthe proliferation index of the tumor-associated endothelialcells and the size of CD31-positive intratumoral 1-alfa direct effect on the growth of EPOR-positive tumorxenografts. Due to the morphological alterations in tumoralmicrovessels, rHuEPO treatment led to a significantlyimproved efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy. Atthe same time significantly increased of radiotherapy in vivo , mediated by increased tumoral blood vessel destruction. Summarizing our data, rHuEPO treatment may modulate the efficacy of cancer chemo- and radiotherapy not only byreducing systemic hypoxia and tumoral HIF-1 expression,Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3521but also by the regulation of intratumoral vessel formation and function. 685 PIPOXOLAN INDUCES APOPTOSIS OF HUMANU937 LEUKEMIA CELLS and 3Graduate Institute of Chinese Pharmaceutical Sciences, China Medical University, 91 Hseuh-Shih Road, Taichung,40402, Taiwan; 4Department of Pharmacy, China Medical University Hospital, 2 Yuh-Der Road, Taichung, 40402 Taiwan, ROC We investigated the anti-leukemia effects of pipoxolan on the U937 leukemia cell line. viability, membranepotential, caspase-activity assay.Apoptosis-associated Bcl-2 family proteins were examinedby Western blotting. Our data showed that pipoxolaninhibited U937 cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The morphological assessment and cellcycle/apoptosis analysis by flow cytometry indicated thatU937 leukemia cell line incubated with 10 M pipoxolaninduced cell apoptosis. Pipoxolan induced an increase ofreactive oxygen species (ROS) in 1 h and thereafter a loss ofmitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry.Pretreatment with N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (ROS chelator) in pipoxolan-treated cells led to decline of ROS. Wedemonstrated an increase in the levels of Bax and decrease inthe level of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which were associated withthe induction of apoptosis after 24 h treatment withpipoxolan in U937 leukemia cells. Our data suggest thatpipoxolan could serve as a potent anticancerchemotherapeutic agent for human leukemia. 686 PROTEOMICS IN CANCER RESEARCH George Th. TsangarisProteomics Research Unit, Center of Basic Research II, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens,Athens, Greece Proteomics aim is to characterize, discriminate and identify the proteins in biological materials such as plasma andserum, urine, cell lines, tumors, biopsies etc in order toidentify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.The major proteomic technologies applied in cancer samplesinclude two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(2D-PAGE) and mass surface-enhanced laserdesorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF)-MS,liquid arrays, andantibody microarrays are emerging as alternative proteomictechnologies. Since there is little overlap between theseapproaches, the utility of these advanced technologies incancer remains an elusive goal. Nowadays many proteomicsstudies have generated numerous datasets of potentialdiagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic significance in humancancer. Despite the technological limitations of thesetechnologies, there is little doubt that the proteomic approachhas the potential to identify novel diagnostic biomarkers andtherapeutic targets in cancer. In accordance with the above statements the first part of that presentation refers to the proteomics technologiesapplied to the analysis of the entire proteome, to theidentification and characterization of single proteinmolecules or protein complexes. The second part of thepresentation refers to the most important areas thatproteomics have contributed which are the prevention,diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The high throughputproteomic technologies applied lead to the elucidation of thepathways of carcinogenesis, to the characterization ofspecific biological markers for cancer diagnosis and toidentification of new therapeutic targets. Furthermore, inorder to answer clinical questions in cancer research, theaccumulation of recent data is crucial to shift the emphasis ofcancer proteomics from technology development to carefulstudy design and data mining. The exploitation of these datawill offer a deep knowledge of the mechanisms and thespecific characteristics of the different types of themalignancy, greatly enhancing accurate prognosis andeffective treatment. 687 TOPOISOMERASE I EXPRESSION N. Tsavaris Medical Oncology Unit, Department of Pathophysiology, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University ofAthens, Athens, Greece Objectives: Our aim was to investigate whether chemotherapy with 5-FU induces an alteration in the levelsof in the study; patients had undergone surgical resection of the primary tumor, received post-operatively 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy and then suffered fromrecurrences. In a standard three-step immunohistochemicalprocedure, a monoclonal antibody to topo I was applied inboth specimens from each patient (one from the primarylocation and a second one from the recurrence). Statisticalanalysis was subsequently performed. Results: Malignant cells from the recurrences displayed a statistically significantincrease, concerning the levels of topoisomerase I, bycomparison with the primary tumors ( p=0.01). The increase in topo I levels did not demonstrate significant correlationswith Duke's stage (Fisher's Exact Test p=0.496), p=0.434), nor with relapse free interval (p=0.493). There was a statistically significant relationship between the age of patients and increase in topo I levels(p=0.011). Conclusion: Topo I expression may be part of the malignant cells' phenotype in recurrent colorectalcarcinomas, suggesting a potential role for Topo I in theacquisition of a metastatic phenotype. The increase of topo Iimmunohistochemical status is likely to be attributed to 5-FU and given the fact that high levels of topo I correlate withsensitivity to camptothecin, advanced colorectal anticancer 688 TOPOISOMERASE I FOLLOWING 5-FLUOROURACIL-BASED ADJUV ANTCHEMOTHERAPY. FOR NEWAPPROACHES CHEMOTHERAPY Medical School,National and Kapodistrian University of Athens; 2First Department of Pathology, \"Laikon\" University General Hospital, Medical School, National andKapodistrian University of Athens; 3Second Department of Medical Oncology, \"Metaxa\" Cancer Hospital, Piraeus, Greece Human DNA topoisomerases I and II (topo-I and -II) are essential for vital cellular processes such as DNA replication,transcription, translation, recombination and repair.Following a chain of observations and pilot studies, wepresent the findings of a pioneer study, in which topo-I and-II expression was correlated with outcome afterchemotherapy in primary and relapsed colorectal cancer. Patients with colorectal cancer that had recurred followingsurgery and adjuvant chemotherapy and WHO underwent asecond operation were included in the present study. All hadundergone surgical resection of the primary tumor andreceived post-operatively 5-FU-based (5FU+Leucovorin,Mayo Clinic regimen) adjuvant chemotherapy. Tumor tissuewas collected at the initial operation from the primary tumorand at the time of recurrence (during the second operationfollowing chemotherapy). All tissues samples were analyzedfor levels of expression of both topo-I and topo-IIa usingstandard three-step immunohistochemistry on paraffinsections. Forty patients were included in the study. Levels ofexpression of topo-I and topo-II were higher in malignantcells from tumor recurrences compared to primary tumors(p=0.0001 for both). There was a statistically significant positive relationship between patients' age and levels oftopo-I ( p=0.011) and topo-II ( p=0.011) expression. The study results reported here underscore the role of topoisomeraseexpression in colorectal cancer and suggest a potential role intumor recurrence. This model could be further studied toinclude other forms of neoplasia and infection, in an effortto elucidate the development of chemotherapy drugresistance, thus optimizing treatment strategies andimproving cancer patient care. 689 HER2/NEU OVEREXPRESSING BREAST TUMORS WITH INCREASED PAKT HA VE POOROUTCOME AND DEVELOP DRUG RESISTANCE Jay Vadgama , Yanyuan Wu, Hezla Mohamed, Ram Chillar, Ishrat Ali, Sheila Clayton and Dennis Slamon Divisions of Cancer Research and Training, Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine Charles R.Drew University of Medicine and Science, and DavidGeffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA Introduction: Breast cancer patients with HER2/neu overexpression have poor outcomes, with a decrease indisease-free (DFS) and overall survival. The biology ofHER2/neu overexpression in breast tumors in African-American and Latina women is poorly understood. Thepurpose of this study is to understand the clinical significanceof activated Akt (phospho-Akt or pAkt) expression in breasttumors from African-American and Latina patients withcorresponding tissue HER2/neu over expression. Cellular andmolecular studies have shown that activation of the cellsignaling phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt cascade viathe HER2/neu and other receptor tyrosine kinases cellproliferation. Materials and Methods: A total of 234 African- American and Latina patients were selected retrospectively.From this group, 141 tumor tissue samples were analyzed forAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3523tissue pAkt by immunohistochemistry (IHC). This cohort consisted of (3+ by IHC) and 95HER2/neu-negative tumors. The prognostic value of activatedtissue Akt in relation to HER2/neu over expression for DFSwas determined. Results: Patients with low pAkt and HER2- negative tumors had the best DFS. As expected, patients withHER2/neu-overexpressing tumors with low pAkt had adecrease in DFS. Similarly, those with high pAkt and HER2-negative tumors also had poor DFS. However, those with anincrease in both HER2 and pAkt had the worst DFS. Anincrease in pAkt was significantly associated with HER2/neu-positive and lymph node-positive breast tumors. Tumors withhigh HER2 and high pAkt were metastatic. Multivariateanalysis demonstrated that, in addition to the common riskfactors such as larger tumor size, lymph node involvement,estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor-negative tumors, andHER2/neu-positive tumors, overexpression decrease in 5-year DFS. Adecrease in DFS with an increase in observed inboth HER2/neu-positive and -negative groups. However, theDFS was similar in HER2/neu-positive/pAkt-negative andHER2/neu-negative/pAkt-positive groups. Conclusion: Our data suggest that there may be differences in tumorphenotypes within patients with HER2/neu-overexpressingbreast cancer. The overexpression of pAkt may be a powerfulprognostic marker for predicting DFS and overall survival ofbreast cancer patients. 690 ANTITUMOR EVENTS IN ENDOCRINE TUMORS Zs. 2, Julesz2, of Juh\u00e1sz Gyula TeacherEducation, 1Institute of Applied Natural Science, Department of Environmental Biology, Faculty of Medical School, 2First Department of Medicine Endocrine Unit, 3Department of Psychiatry, 4Institute of Microbiology, Szeged, Persistent ( e.g.: halogenated hydrocarbones) are cummulated in various biologicalorganisms. These chemicals originate from industrial andagricultural section of the society. Chlorobenzenes havestrenghtened stabilized structures responsible for dosedependent effects on human population.

TheRA>CE>AE>IF showed antitumor effects on Adh and Nh.The hormone release was increased in the ClBM inducedendocrine cell cultures. The antitumor agents could modify theincreased hormone release. Conclusion: At the end of in vivo treatments no tumors were found in the pituitary tissues.However Adrenocorticotropin, Prolactin, Oxytocin andVasopressin release were shown in the primary Adh, Nh cellcultures, in the cases of A 30, A60and A90. In A90, B60and B90. In these cases promotion and initiation effects of ClBMcould be detected in the pituitary tissue.This work was of Juh\u00e1sz Gyula TeacherEducation, 1Institute of Applied Natural Science, Department of Environmental Biology, Faculty of Medical School, 2First Department of Medicine Endocrine Unit, 3Department of Psychiatry, 4Institute of Microbiology, Szeged, Hungary Introduction: Endocrine cell transformation can be induced by disturbing the endocrine regulation (f.e.: withagents and Aim: To investigate the behaviour of different origin Prolactinomas (P). Methods: Wistar rats were used. Untreated animals were the controls, the in vivo oestron-acetate (subcutaneous implantate 1 g/bw/week; for 6 months) treatedrats were the disregulated P. From the two groups the ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3524adenohypophysis (Adh) and the prolactinomas (P) were separated by enzymatic and mechanical dissociations as primerAdh and P cell cultures. The Adh cultures were treated with(0.01 /ml) benz-c-acridine (BcAT), and (0.1 fg/mg protein)chlorobenzenes mix (hexachlorobenzene: trichlorobenzene=1:1)(ClBT) for 6 days. After the treatment the cell cultures showedtumorous formations (BcAT; ClBT). different cell cultures were treated withextracellular calcium and magnesium in lower than thephysiologic concentration (0.25 mM).The data were analyzedby ANOV A system. Results: The hormonal secretion was increased in all treated animals (BcAT > ClBT > P) compared tocontrols. However, the use of low concentration bivalent cations(Ca 2+, Mg2+) decreased the hormone-release P > ClBT BcAT. The cell-markers were lower than in controls. Conclusion: The pituitary cells show different parameters depending on the typeof transforming treatment. Antitumor effects of lowconcentration of bivalent cations can be observed inprolactinomas.This work was supported by ETT-345/2006. 692 CONTROL OF THE CELL CYCLE BY NITRIC OXIDEIN HUMAN NEUROBLASTOMA CELLS Marlies Van Nitric oxide (NO) has been recognized as a bi-modal regulator of cell proliferation, inducing either an increase inthe proliferative rate or the arrest of the cell cycle at low andhigh concentrations, respectively. Exposure of tumor cellsto both endogenously produced and exogenously added NOhas been shown to exert both anti-tumor and pro-tumoractions. Nevertheless, the potential therapeutic effects of NOin cancer are currently under intense scrutiny. To get furtherinsight into the action of NO on cell proliferation, we testedthe effect of an exogenous NO donor on the expression andactivation/deactivation of different regulators controlling cellcycle progression in human neuroblastoma NB69 cells. Wedemonstrate in this work that the chronic exposure (17-19h) of these tumor cells to 2,2'-(hydroxynitro-sohydrazono)bis-ethanimine (DETA/NO), a slow NOreleaser (t 1/2=20 h) belonging to the NONOate family, induces a decrease in the expression and/or thephosphorylation of the transcriptional repressor pRb, which controls the G1/S transition, and in thephosphorylation of two cyclin-dependent kinases, Cdk2 andCdk1(cdc2). This cyclins (Cdks regulatory subunits), particularly cyclinsD1, A and B1. We have found a variable effect of DETA/NOon cyclin E expression, consistent with reports in other cells.In addition, NO-induced changes in the phosphorylationpattern of cyclin E were noticed, as well as a decrease in thephosphorylation of cyclins D1 and B1. DETA/NO treatmentalso induces a slight decrease in the expression of the Cdksinhibitors p16 Ink4aand p27Kip1, in contrast to the enhanced expression of p21Cip1/Waf1. We have also observed NO- mediated activation of the tumor suppressor protein p53,which might account for the up-regulation of p21 Cip1/Waf1. Taken together, our results highlight some of the molecularmechanisms subjacent to the observed proliferative arrest ofcells exposed to NO. The anti-proliferative role of NO doesnot appear to be limited to its well-known action controllingthe G 1/S transition, affecting systems such as pRb, Cdk2 (with cyclin E as a partner), cyclin D (a Cdk4/Cdk6partner), and p21 Cip1/Waf1, but also affects systems controlling the S phase and the G2/M transition, such as Cdk2 (with cyclin A as a partner), Cdk1(cdc2), and cyclinsA and B itself. Moreover, our results could point to thepossible entry of cells in apoptosis because of the observedupregulation of p53. This could occur after arrest of the cellcycle whenever the exposure to NO is sufficiently high inconcentration and prolonged in time.This work was financed by grants (to A.V .)

Using a proteomic approach, we found thatxanthohumol stimulated the transcription and expression of theER chaperone GRP78 and the activation of the ER stresstransducers PERK, IRE1 and ATF6. Sustained ER stress wasassociated with stress Furthermore, of autophagosomes, as evidenced bymonodansyl cadaverin staining, theautophagosome-specific isoform LC3-II. We also found thatxanthohumol was able to inhibit 20S proteasomal activityresulting in an accumulation of polyubiquinated proteins.Altogether, our results indicate that the endoplasmic reticulumand the proteasome are interesting targets for selective drugsagainst breast cancer. 694 MICROARRAY ANALYSIS OF MCF-7 BREASTCANCER CELLS WITH Engelen2, Gent, Belgium The form of vitamin D is 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3[1,25-(OH)2D3]. 1,25-(OH)2D3functions through the vitamin VDR with the Retinoid X Receptor [RXR] receptor, thecomplex binds to vitamin D response elements [VDREs],recruits coregulators and the transcriptional preinitiationcomplex to initiate target gene transcription 1,25-(OH) 2D3is an important regulator of calcium metabolism (classicaleffects), but has also antiproliferative and prodifferentiatingeffects on both normal and tumorous cells (non-classicaleffects). Consequently, 1,25-(OH) 2D3is an interesting drug forthe treatment of hyperproliferative disorders such as cancer. The therapeutic dose however causes severe side-effects suchas hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. For this reason, structuralanalogs of 1,25-(OH) 2D3such as the seco-9,11-bisnor-17- methyl analog, WY1112 have been developed with increasedantiproliferative capacities . To identify key regulatory genes involved in the antiproliferative action of 1,25-(OH) 2D3and to distinct the molecular activities of 1,25-(OH)2D3and WY1112, total RNA was extracted from MCF-7 breast cancer cells that were treatedwith 1,25-(OH) 2D3or WY1112 and was used for microarray analysis. The experiments revealed that WY1112 induced thesame set of genes as 1,25-(OH) 2D3but the induction level of the individual genes was higher. Microarray analysis did notreveal genes that were exclusively regulated by WY1112.Altered sensitivities to metabolism or changed VDR-coactivator interactions may account for its superagonisticcharacteristics. Genes that were up-regulated can be divided into groups that are involved in proliferation and 695 THE EFFECT OF UNCARIA EXTRACT ON MOLECULAR BIOMARKERS IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER T.

Theirexpression enables the effect of surgical treatment combinedwith neoadjuvant chemotherapy to be followed and may predictthe outcome of carcinoma. Moreover, their expression canshow the possible additional curative/preventive effect ofCoD consumption. The scavenger type antioxidant capacityof blood was assessed by deoxyribose degradation test. Bloodsamples were taken at the day of surgical treatment, then 1week, 3 and 6 months and 1 year later, by which time patientswere consuming 0.2 l standard portion of CoD tea three timesa day. There were 2 groups of 20 individuals: CRC patients(CoD consumers) and a control group of healthy individuals(they were not consumers of CoD). Before surgical treatmentall CRC patients received Ca-folate and 5-FU and 45 Gyradiation after the resection they were treatedaccording to de Gramont protocol. Surgical treatment andneoadjuvant therapy are able to suppress the expression of c- myc, Ha-ras, Bcl-2, Ki-ras, p53 onco/supressor gene FOR 12 months. Moreover CoD tea together with conventionaltreatment caused a strong and significant decrease of theexpression of c- myc and Ha- ras oncogen in comparison withthe nonconsumer controls. 696 THE MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME AND GROUP J. , Farkas, G. University, Budapest, Hungary The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid stem cell disorders characterized byrefractory cytopenias, previously known as preleukemia. In theprimary form, the etiology is still unknown. However, themultiple hit pathogenesis is considered valid for this condition,and provides a possible explanation for the evolution ofrefractory cytopenia into acute leukemia. In an attempt to find answers to questions of MDS pathogenesis, the Budapest Study Group has compared certaingenetic features of patients with multiple myeloma (MM), a B-cell malignancy with a similar prevalence in the elderly withthose of MDS. We analyzed approximately 100 patient samples from both conditions for genetic polymorphism regarding themetabolizing enzymes GST especially those participating in thedetoxification of carcinogens. We also compared the incidenceof mutations and TNF- polymorphisms. We found a significant difference in incidence of only the HFE gene polymorphism between the two groups, with a higher mutation rate in the MDS group, whereas the HFE mutation was even less frequent in the MM group compared tohealthy controls. That the HFE gene mutation has an impact on iron absorption, even in its heterozygote form, is a well knownphenomenon. Iron excess confers oxidative stress tissuesleading to bone marrow impairment. On the other hand,prolonged uncorrected deficiency states, such as low copperlevels and vitamin B12 deficiency, might be as harmful fortissues with a high cell turnover such as bone marrow stemcells. Iron overload or other toxic compounds injuringmitochondria, or deficiency in trace elements and vitamins withimportance in cell respiration, might both give rise to moreprimitive cells - thus conferring a selection advantage for them.The literature includes data to support this concept. According to this model, one should question the priority of the genetic events and consider them as secondary to anunbalanced metabolism that instead can be considered as theprimary etiological factor in the disease pathogenesis in acertain group of MDS patients. 697 SUN EXPOSURE AND USE OF SOLARIUMS DURINGTHE FIRST FIVE DECADES OF LIFE AND RISK OFCUTANEOUS MALIGNANT MELANOMA: THENORWEGIAN-SWEDISH WOMEN'S LIFESTYLE Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; 2Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; 3Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA; 4Institute of Community Medicine, University of Troms\u00f8, Troms\u00f8, Norway; 5School of Public Health, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia; 6Department of Etiological Research, Cancer Registry of Norway, Oslo, Norway; 7Department of Genetic Epidemiology, Folkh\u00e4lsan Research Center, Helsinki, FinlandBackground: Sun exposure is the major established and modifiable risk factor for cutaneous malignant melanoma. Useof indoor tanning equipment has also been associated withincreased risk, but less consistently. The importance ofexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in different periods oflife and possible effect modification by an individual'ssensitivity to UV exposure is not completely understood.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3527Materials and Methods: The Norwegian-Swedish Women's Lifestyle and Health Cohort Study included more than 100 000women aged 30-50 years in 1991/92. Information on a solarium ( i.e.a sunbed or sunlamp) and individual characteristics were at cohort enrolmentthrough a self-administered questionnaire. Frequency ofsunburns, sunbathing vacations and use of a wererecorded age periods 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, years. Complete follow-up by linkage of thestudy database to national registries in Norway and Sweden.Relative risks are estimated by Poisson regression. Results: The first results from this cohort study were published in 2003(Veier\u00f8d et al. J Natl Cancer Inst 95: 1530-1538, 2003) and included follow-up through 1999 i.e.a short follow-up period to estimate the effects of midlife exposure. We present nownew results with follow-up through 2005. A total of 106,366women were followed up to14 years and 412 incident cases ofcutaneous malignant melanoma were reported to the nationalCancer Registries. The mean age at diagnosis was 49 years. Atwofold increased risk of melanoma was found for sunburns inchildhood, teenage years and early adulthood (2 sunburns peryear vs. none). In this cohort, solarium use in childhood and teenage years was rare. Solarium use in early adulthood andmidlife increased the risk of melanoma. We will also discussthe potential impact of national regulations on indoor tanningdevices implemented in 1982/83 resulting in changes in theUVB to UV A ratio. 698 TARGETING CANCER CELLS BY AN OXIDANT-BASED THERAPY J. Verrax , R. Beck, C. Lannoy, H.S. Taper and PMNT unit, Pharmacy, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, 73 Avenue E.Mounier 1200 Brussels, Belgium Among all the different features of cancer cells, two are of particular interest: their nearly universal glycolytic phenotypeand their sensitivity towards oxidative stress. By using thecombination of menadione (vitamin K3) and ascorbate(vitamin C), we took advantage of these features to develop anoriginal approach that consists of the exposure of cancer cellsto an oxidant insult. The results we obtained can besummarized as follows: The combination exhibits a synergistic antitumor activity in vivo as well as in vitro through the potentiation of the menadione redox cycling by ascorbate, resulting in thegeneration of reactive oxygen species (1, 2). Importantly, non-transformed cells are not affected by this treatment, likelybecause of their better antioxidant defences. The oxidant insult rapidly induces DNA strand breaks which provoke the activation of an enzyme participating in DNArepair, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Activated PARP consumes cytosolic NAD +, and because NAD+is required for glycolysis, this render cells unable to use glucose as ametabolic substrate. Due to the high energetic dependence ofcancer cells on glycolysis, this leads to an energetic crisiswhich ultimately results in necrotic cell death (3). Interestingly, the oxidative stress provoked by the ascorbate/menadione combination also induces the disruptionof the chaperone function of Hsp90, resulting in thedegradation of important oncogenic proteins essential forcancer cell survival, such as Bcr-abl. This phenomenon is onlyobserved in tumour cells and represents a second pathway thatparticipates in the anticancer activity of the combination. Taken together, our data suggest that the combination of ascorbate and menadione could represent a new and interestingauxiliary cancer therapy. Since both compounds are of lowtoxicity, they can easily be included in a classic anticancerprotocol without any supplementary risk for the patients, asshown in the recent phase I/IIa study performed in prostatecancer patients who failed standard therapy (4). 1 Verrax J, Delvaux M, Beghein N, Taper H, of quinone redox byascorbate induce a caspase-3 independent cell death inhuman leukaemia cells.

VeselyUniversity of South Florida Health Sciences Center/V A Hospital, Tampa, Florida, USA Cardiac hormones are a family of peptide hormones synthesized mainly in the atrium of the heart. One gene in theheart of this peptide hormone family synthesizes 28: 3528acid (a.a.) in up to 97% of human pancreatic, breast, colon, ovarian, kidney and prostateadenocarcinomas, glioblastomas of the brain and melanomas,as well as small-cell and squamous cell lung carcinoma cellsin vitro . When infused subcutaneously for 28 days with fresh hormones weekly at 3 nM min -1kg-1body weight in athymic mice bearing human pancreatic theyeliminate up to 80% of the human pancreatic adenocarcinomas.Even in the treated animals which did not have a totalelimination of the pancreatic carcinoma, their tumor volumedecreased to less than 10% (and with vessel dilator to 2%) ofthat of the untreated animals and the treated animals achieveda normal lifespan. Similarly, these peptide hormones eliminate two-thirds of human breast adenocarcinomas growing in athymic micewithout any surgery. The mechanism(s) of action cardiac ofthese hormones in cancer cells includes a 97% inhibition of thephosphorylation of extracellular-signal regulated of the upstream mitogen-activated proteinkinases (MEK 1/2). These inhibitions are mediated by theintracellular mediator cyclic GMP. The final step in theirmechanism of action is a strong ability to inhibit DNAsynthesis within the nucleus of the cancer cells, also mediatedby cyclic GMP. 700 and Pavel Vesel\u00fd2,3 1Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University in Prague, Prague; 2Institute of Molecular Genetics AS CR Prague 6, 166 37; 3Prague Burn Centre, 3rd Medical Faculty, Charles University, Prague 10, 100 00 Czech Republic EM-G3, a new clonal cell line (1) was derived from a primary lesion of human infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma and shownto originate with high probability from common progenitors ofluminal and myoepithelial cells that were immortalized in anearly stage of tumorigenesis. Such presumably low malignantcells attract efforts focused on in vitro induction of neoplastic progression. If this is successfully achieved new traits/markersof malignancy could be revealed. With this aim in mind EM-G3 have been in vitro exposed to chronic nutritional stress that was at the beginning intermittent and supported by twosubsequent treatments of an activator of the protein kinase C, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). After six monthof this challenging procedure resulting G3S1 cells grew instandard culture medium without growth factors needed forEM-G3 cells. Both cell populations were then compared. It wasfound that in Matrigel invasion chambers G3S1 cells exhibitedca 2.5 fold enhancement of the invasion capacity over a 24 hperiod as compared to parental EM-G3 cells. Also thedegradation of FITC-gelatine was substantially increased inG3S1 cells. F-actin rich structures resembling podosomes werepresent in both EM-G3 and G3S1 cells and to considerableextent colocalized with the sites of degradation. Thesepodosome-like structures were enriched in phosphotyrosine;however, they did not contain phosphorylated cortactinsuggesting they are at least in part different from podosomes.Interestingly, in some small holes in gelatine indicating theirearly stage, the F-actin structures were observed hinting thatthere could be only a slight difference between invadopodiaand podosomes consisting in an availability of a penetrablesubstrate. Examination G3S1 cells nascent incidence myzitiras andvthela (leech) morphotypes described earlier (2). Coincidenceof apparent neoplastic progression of G3S1 cells with theappearance of these distinguished morphotypes leads to apossibility of exploiting these morphological traits in selectionof individual cells for targeted examination of gene expression.Such an approach can enrich our knowledge of mechanisms ofneoplastic progression.

Ionizing radiation (x- rays, alpha, beta, gamma) is known to cause chemical changesto biological molecules, which may lead to cancer. Damage toDNA, particularly double-strand breaks is the main initiatingevent; however, damage to other cellular components mayinfluence cell functioning and progress to the malignant state.Sources of information about the health effects of ionizingradiation include theoretical and experimental studies(including animal studies) of the underlying science, especiallybiology, and epidemiological studies of humans exposed toradiation. This presentation will examine the currentunderstanding of the harmful effects of ionizing radiation.Special emphasis will be given to low levels of ionizingradiation, below about 100 mSv, where there is considerableuncertainty of the risks and, in some cases, there have beenclaims of likely beneficial effects. 702GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY TO LUNG CANCER Haris G. Vikis 1, Pengyuan Liu1, Ming You1, Marshall W. Anderson2and Genetic Epidemiology of Lung Cancer Consortium 1Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri; 2University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA Three recent genome-wide association studies identified associations between markers in the chromosomal region15q24-25.1 and the risk of lung cancer. We conducted agenome-wide association analysis to investigate associationsbetween single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and therisk of lung cancer, in which we used blood DNA from 194case patients with familial lung cancer and 219 cancer-freecontrol individuals. We identified associations betweenvariants on chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 20. Here wedescribe common sequence variants on 15q24-25.1 (whichspanned LOC123688 (a PSMA4,CHRNA3, CHRNA5, and CHRNB4) and lung cancer. Therisk of lung cancer was more than five-fold higher amongthose subjects who had both a family history of lung cancerand two copies of high-risk in 15q24-25.1 than amongcontrols. Thus, further research in elucidating causal variantsin the 15q24-25.1 locus that are associated with lung canceris warranted. 703 CANCER DIAGNOSIS BASED INTHEDIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION OF A NOVELFAMILY OF NON Andr\u00e9s Bello. Santiago, Chile We describe a novel transcript which is overexpressed in human proliferating cells but not in resting cells. Thetranscript contains a hairpin structure comprising an IR of815 nt linked to the 5' end of the 16S mtrRNA, forming along double-stranded structure. This novel transcript is anon-coding RNA (ncRNA) and experimental evidencesuggests that the transcript is synthesized in mitochondria.Therefore, we named this transcript \"sense non-codingmitochondrial RNA\" (sncmtRNA). The expression of thistranscript can be induced in resting lymphocytes bystimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). On the otherhand, proliferating cells treated with aphidicolin repressthe expression of the transcript. The cells resumeproliferation if the drug is removed and over-express thencmtRNA again. These results suggest that this ncmtRNAmay play a role in cell proliferation. In situ hybridization (ISH) using oligonucleotide (ODN) probes revealed thatthe transcript is expressed in tumor cells from biopsies andalso in tumor cell lines from a variety of human cancers,but is not present in normal quiescent cells. However, toour surprise, normal proliferating cells also expressanother transcript, named antisense ncmtRNA(AsncmtRN). The differential expression of the sense andantisense ncmtRNAs allow for the selective discriminationbetween normal proliferating, quiescent and tumor cells.The study performed in a hundred of biopsies suggests thatthese molecules could constitute a We present a new integrated microfluidic system for the high throughput, high content sorting and analysis of cancer cells. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3530Figure. Principle of the method: a microfluidic channel with microfabricated magnetic domains, on which columns ofmagnetic beads bearing antibodies directed toward cancercells surface antigens (orange) self-assemble under amagnetic field. The sample containing cancer cells (reddishblue) and normal haematopoietic cells (light blue) is thenflown in the channel. Upon collision with the magneticcolumns, the cancer cells are captured and normal cellsresume their motion. It is able to capture tumour cells with specific antibodies, like circulating tumour cells in whole blood or cells from FineNeedle Aspirates, with high specificity and efficiency. Cellseparation in this system, is based on a new conceptdeveloped in our group (1). It involves an immunoaffinityseparation matrix made of magnetic beads, self-assembledonto a pattern of magnetic traps prepared by microcontactprinting (2) (Figure). Recent work (3) did show that the microfluidic format is able to considerably enhance the yield of CTC capture,opening new routes for diagnosis, prognosis of metastaticrelapses, and selection of the most adapted treatment basedon a molecular typing of the CTC. In addition to the highefficiency described in this earlier work, in our new systemthe captured cells can be visualized using the mostsophisticated tools of cell microscopy, allowing for extensiveautomated phenotyping by multicolour antibody labellingand morphological analysis. In a near future, the technologywill also allow genotyping. Quantitative characterization ofthe efficiency and specificity of capture, obtained with modelcell lines, and our first applications to cancer cell typingfrom patient's blood samples will be presented in theconference.1 Doyle et al: Science 295: 2237, 2002. 2 Saliba al: Proc. Total Systems 2007, et al: Nature STATINS THESAME? Libor V\u00edtekInstitute of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics and 4th Department of Internal Medicine, 1stFaculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, CzechRepublic Despite supporting theory as well as experimental evidence, there is still clinical controversy as to whether statins canprevent from cancer. These contradictory views are based onlarge epidemiological studies and their meta-analyses which,however, have been focused primarily on cardiovascularoutcomes. In addition to these limitations, there are alsoother reasons to account for different anticancer effects ofstatins. These are related to the physico-chemical propertiesof statins (lipophility/hydrophility), as well as to differentpharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. In fact,we were able to detect large differences in antiproliferativeeffects on experimental pancreatic cancer among statins usedfor clinical purposes. The least efficient statins in our studieswere pravastatin and atorvastatin, while rosuvastatin,cerivastatin and fluvastatin were the most potent compounds. These data may account for inconclusiveness of cancer prevalence/incidence among statin users in cardiovasculartrials. Provided that pravastatin might be the least efficientstatin, recent meta-analytic studies might have beenconfounded by pravastatin trials. This, indeed, is the case formeta-analysis of 7 trials by Hebert et al. [JAMA 1997], where 3 out of 7 studies involved were pravastatin trials. Thesame is true for a study by Bjerre et al. [Am J Med 2001] (3 out of 5 studies involved), CTT Collaborator's study [Lancet2005] (5 out of 14 studies involved), as well as meta-analysisby Dale et al. [JAMA 2006] (10 out of 20 studies). It is clear that further large and well-designed epidemiological studies are definitely needed to determineany potential chemopreventive role of individual statins. 706 POSSIBLE INFLUENCE OF NQO1 POLYMORPHISMS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HPV-RELATED CERVICAL CANCER Milene V olpatoSection of Experimental Therapeutics, Leeds Institute for Molecular Medicine, Wellcome Trust Brenner Building, St-James University Hospital, University of Leeds, Leeds LS97TF, UK NAD(P)H:Quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) has multiple functions in cells. It is best known for its involvment in Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3531detoxification processes. However, it was more recently shown to play a role in p53 viaan mdm2-independent route. Such interaction of NQO1 with p53 can partially abrogatep53 degradation by human papilloma NQO1*2 and *3, which cause loss of NQO1 activity, raising the possibility that individuals harboringthese variants may have reduced p53 activity and increasedsusceptibility to HPV-mediated cervical cancers. A study wastherefore designed to survey NQO1 polymorphism incidence in a population of patients with pre-neoplastic and cancerouslesions of the cervix. Genomic DNA was extracted from histological blocks of cervical cancer (n=90) and precancerous CIN lesions(n=293) and NQO1 polymorphic status determined by real- time PCR. No significant difference existed between thedistribution of NQO1*2 and p53*72 in either patient groupor the distribution reported in healthy individuals. Incontrast, a significant increase in the incidence of themutated form of the NQO1*3 polymorphism with a risk ratioof 2.53 (95% conf. interval=3.52, p<0.0001) was observed in patients with cervical cancer. Additionally, no relationshipwas established between the NQO1 polymorphic variants and the CIN grade of the patients. The higher incidence of the NQO1*3 polymorphism observed within the cancerous group compared to bothhealthy and pre-cancerous groups was surprising asvariations in the NQO1*2 incidence have been previouslyreported in various cancer types but no association had beenestablished between NQO1*3 polymorphism and cancer riskto date. Whilst the mechanistic basis for this observation isnot known, this study suggests that individuals who harbourNQO1*3 may be at greater risk of progressing frompreneoplastic to malignant cervical cancer. If confirmed infurther experiments, such result scould provide a basis forimplementing NQO1 polymorphism screening of patients with dysplasia of PRESERV ATION S\u00f6ren von Otte and Al-Hasani Department Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Luebeck, Ratzeburger Allee160, 23538 Luebeck, Germany With an increase in the efficacy of anticancer therapy and quite efficient early diagnosis in gynecological cancer,increased long-term survival of cancer patients and long-termcomplications of anticancer treatments are being encountered(1). The lost of ovarian reserve or function due to gonadaltoxicity is a major problem. A wide range of new fertility preservation options and/or techniques, although the majority of them areexperimental, are now available for female gametepreservation prior to oncological treatments (2). Ovariantransposition, a surgical preservation technique, is one ofthese methods that prevents gonadal toxicity due toradiotherapy. Partial and/or total (experimental) extraction,subsequent cryopreservation and re-transplantation ofovarian tissue, another surgical preventive option both forradiotherapy and chemotherapy side-effects, is expected tobe a paramount method in the future that was performedin selective cases previously (2-4). In particular, medicalmethods with such agents as GnRH analog or antagonists,and Danazole have been reported to prevent chemo orradiotherapy related gonadal toxicity. Cryopreservation ofoocytes, zygotes and embryos either by vitrification orslow-rate freezing subsequent to ovarian stimulation andoocyte pick-up, along with/without traditional IVF andintracytoplasmic sperm injection are other commonpreventive techniques (3, 4). Currently cryopreservations of the oocyte, zygote and/or embryos seem to be the most effective methods in fertilitypreservation, especially in women of reproductive age (5).In regard of the cryopreservation techniques vitrificationhas been claimed as the most appropriate and efficienttechnique due to simplicity and cost-effectiveness (6, 7).On the contrary, surgical methods are still accepted asdifficult, and costly alternatives, as well experimental onessuch as re-transplantation are not reported to besignificantly efficient and reliable alternatives. In parallel,the effects of medical preventive alternatives, thosegenerally resulting in a pseudo-menopausal status andmainly recommended to patients prior to child-bearing, arestill controversial concerning side-effects, reducedeffectiveness. The number of available techniques for conserving fertility has increased in the last decade, but large studies are stillneeded to draw any conclusions. Some of these effectiveoptions such as vitrification of embryos is not allowed inGermany. Other technical issues remain unresolved, as is thequestion of medical insurance reimbursement for the mostefficient procedures. All current aspects and techniquesshould be compared in order to define the best method andstandardization in female fertility preservation.

Benese 13, 305 99 Plzen, Czech Republic Introduction: Gil Mor et al. developed after a proteomic study a multiplex panel for ovarian To this multiplex panel for follow up monitoring of ovariancancer patients. Methods: Two groups of patients were studied: Control gr. 0: pat. with benign ovarian cyst (20patients) and patients with ovarian carcinoma, stage III-IV(19). Serum levels of biological activity markers of ovariancarcinoma were measured by Beadlyte \u00aeHuman Cancer Biomarker Panel kit from Millipore-Upstate (USA) andLuminex 100 instrument (Luminex corp., USA).Simultaneously, levels of other markers (CA125, TK, TPS,HE4 and Monototal) were measured by routineimmunoanalytic methods. Results: From the multiplex markers, the best ROC characteristics were observed forCA125, IGFII and OPN. HE4 marker had the best ROCcharacteristic from all measured markers. In the multiplexpanel, significant differences (Wilcoxon test) in marker levelsbetween groups were found only for CA125 (higher level incarcinoma), OPN (higher level in carcinoma) and IGFII(lower level in carcinoma). Conclusion: Multiplex analysis enables an easy simultaneous measurement of multiplemarkers and so enables the use of a scoring system in future.

Virtual objectscan be created by the employment of a variety ofapproaches such as Quaoaring. A systematic evaluation ofthese steps leading to applicability in systems biologicalmathematical modeling is overdue. A preliminary overviewand comparison of methods however can be given. Theresults of such a survey suggest that to date no singleapproach meets all requirements in systems biology. Visionsof developing a gold standard therefore remain far off whichmight have considerable impact on the possible use ofcomputer generated cells and tissues in the context ofquality control in systems biological mathematicalmodeling.

Schibli CRS, Paul Scherrer Institute, CH-5232 Villigen PSI, Switzerland Rapidly growing cells show an increased demand for nutrients and vitamins. We exploited the supply route ofvitamin B12 and folate to deliver radiolabeled derivatives tohyperproliferative the tumor uptake ofvitamin B12 and folate-based radiotracers was shown to below compared with the high renal retention of radioactivity.For clinical application of radiopharmaceuticals, it is knownAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3533that high kidney uptake of radiolabeled compounds may lead to radiation toxicity. In order to obtain better tumor to non tumor ratios, we interfered with the biological properties of these vitamins tobe stored in normal organs like liver and kidney. For vitamin B12 targeting, we designed new vitamin B12 conjugates that do not bind to their main transport proteintranscobalamin II (TCII) and thus tumor to background ratioswere tremendously increased. For radiofolate targeting preadministration of the antifolate drug Pemetrexed led to an almost completeblockade of radioactivity uptake in folate receptor positivekidneys whereas the tumor uptake remained unchanged andthus tumor to kidney ratios were significantly improved.Obviously, Pemetrexed interacts differently with the uptakemechanism of the 99mTc-folate on the tumor tissue and kidneys respectively. In vivo SPECT/CT studies in mice demonstrated the specific accumulation of 99mTc-PAMA-vitamin B12 and 99mTc-PAMA-folate in tumors and an almost completeabsence or significant reduction of radioactivity in the renaltissue. Clinical trials to prove these concepts started this fallin collaboration with the University Hospital Zurich.Waibel R et al : New Derivatives of Vitamin B12 Show Preferential Targeting of Tumors.

In Europe,colon cancer is the second and the third cause of mortalitydue to cancer in women and men, respectively, and it was estimated that an effective nutritional prevention, namely toeat more fruit and vegetables, would prevent more than 60to 80% of colon cancer. Since epidemiological studies haveindicated that a moderate and regular consumption of wineis associated with a reduced risk of cancer, we hypothesizethat red wine polyphenols (RWPs) may prevent tumorgrowth by controlling tumor angiogenesis. cells, derived from colon carcinomas (chemically were subcutaneously injected in 9-week-old BALB/c mice. Two days after theinjection, RWPs or vehicle were given in the drinking waterat a dose of 100 mg/kg/day for the following 26 days. Atthe end of the treatment period, we investigated themacrovessel density in tumors by high definition microCTsystem using radio opaque silicon rubber and themicrovessel density by immunohistochemistry (anti-CD31)on frozen sections. In parallel, we measured an index ofproliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (TUNEL, activatedcaspase-3) and we determined the (VEGF, MMPs) and on paraffin sections. Results: After one month of treatment with RWPs, tumor size wassignificantly reduced by 30% compared to the controlgroup. On the one hand, the vessel density assessed bymicroCT and immunohistochemistry, was reduced by 40%and by 47%, respectively in the RWPs-treated group. Weobserved a concomitant decreased expression levels of themajor pro-angiogenic factors VEGF and MMPs 2 and 9(MMP-2,9) in tumor cells. On the other hand, RWPtreatment reduced the proliferating index (Ki-67) of tumorcells by 61% and increased the apoptotic index (TUNEL)associated with high caspase-3 activity in tumor cells by81%. Finally, RWPs also induce the expression of tumorsuppressor genes such as p16, p21, p53 and p73 in tumor cells. Conclusion: RWPs reduce tumor growth by preventing tumor neovascularisation and by inducing tumorcell apoptosis through the expression of tumor suppressorgenes. Altogether, these findings indicate that RWPs havepotent anticancer properties. As this syngenic model is veryremote from the human physiopathology, further studies arenecessary to highlight the anticancer properties of RWPs ina more relevant model of colon cancer. 712 PRECANCEROUS CARCINOGENESIS-CELLULARMODEL OF HUMAN BREAST EPITHELIAL CELLSFOR DIETARY PREVENTION Hwa-Chain Robert WangDepartment of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN37996, USAANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3534Carcinogenesis of human breast epithelial cells from non- cancerous to precancerous and cancerous stages is a multiyear,multistep, and multipath disease process. Exposure toenvironmental carcinogens has been postulated to increase therisk of developing human breast cancer. However, the role ofenvironmental carcinogens in the chronic carcinogenesis ofhuman breast epithelia has not been fully addressed.Conversely, epidemiological and experimental evidencesuggests that dietary constituents in fruits and vegetablesprevent human cancer. Still, the mechanisms for dietaryprevention of human breast cells from precancerouscarcinogenesis induced by chronic exposure to environmentalcarcinogens remain to be elucidated. To investigate dietaryprevention of cellular carcinogenesis, we studied potentialpreventative biological, biochemical, and transcriptomic targetendpoints induced by long-term exposure of human breastepithelial cells to environmental pollutions with low doses ofcarcinogens. Immortalized, non-cancerous human ofan increased acquisition of cancer-related biological,biochemical, and transcriptomic changes as target endpoints.However, long-term exposure to these carcinogens did notinduce cellular tumorigenicity. Accordingly, ourcarcinogenesis-cellular system mimics chronic carcinogenesisof breast cells to progressively produce precancerous cells inan accumulative manner as it occurs at the precancerous stage,ductal carcinoma in situ , of human breast cancer. We then used this precancerous model to reveal the ability of dietary grapeseed proanthocyanidin and green tea catechins to blockacquisition of target endpoints in the suppression of cellularcarcinogenesis. Thus, our precancerous carcinogenesis-cellularmodel can serve as a cost-efficient, in vitro system to identify bioactive dietary components that are able to suppress humanbreast cell carcinogenesis associated with long-term exposureto carcinogens. This research is expected to benefit society byidentifying molecular targets for bioactive dietary componentsto formulate dietary supplements that are able to reduce thehealth risk of cancer caused by long-term exposure tocarcinogens in environmental pollution. 713 ROLE OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES IN THEPRO-APOPTOTIC ABILITY Hwa-Chain Robert WangDepartment of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN37996, USAMore than 35% of human urinary bladder cancer involves H-Ras activation. Expression of oncogenic H-Rasnot only promotes tumorigenesis of human urinary bladdercancer cells, but also increases cellular susceptibility tohistone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI), such as FK228 (adepsipeptide also known FR901228 and romidepsin) andtrichostatin A, inducing selective apoptosis. The novelpro-apoptotic ability of oncogenic H-Ras should be seriouslyconsidered in therapeutic designs for controlling oncogenicH-Ras-involved cancer. However, the mechanisms behind theproapoptotic ability of oncogenic H-Ras to enhance cellsusceptibility to HDACI remain unclear. that ectopic expression of oncogenic H-Rasincreased intracellular reactive oxygen urinary bladder J82 cells, enhanced FK228-increased intracellular ROS production from mitochondria,and increased cell susceptibility a profoundactivation of executioner caspase-3/7 for inducingselective apoptosis of oncogenic H-Ras-expressing cellsversus parental FasL expression was induced by FR901228 in J82 cells in an ROS-dependent manner, theROS-dependent activation of caspase pathways and celldeath were induced by FR901228 in a FasL-independentmanner. Our results led us to a suggestion that increasedROS played a contributing role in the proapoptotic ability ofoncogenic H-Ras to enhance FK228-induced activation a dose-dependentmanner. 714 DOWN-REGULATION OF GRP78 IS ASSOCIATEDWITH THE SENSITIVITY OF CHEMOTHERAPY TOVP-16 IN SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER NCI-H446CELLS Yingyan Wang 1, Wang2, Jiarui Wang3and Qi Laboratory Center, 3Postgraduate School, Dalian Medical University, 2Department of Respiratory Medicine, The Third People's Hospital of Dalian, 4Department of Respiratory Medicine, The Second Hospital Affiliated to Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning,116023, PR China Background: Lung cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) isthe main type of lung cancer. Chemotherapy is an importantmeans of treatment for SCLC. However, the treatment islimited by the development of drug resistance. An importantmechanism of chemotherapy resistance is the synthesis of akind of evolutionarily conserved proteins, named as glucose-Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3535regulated proteins (GRPs). GRP78/BiP, a well-characterized GRP member with molecular weight of 78 kda, can be downor up-regulated by some agents such as inhibitors of Ca 2+- chelator BAPTA-AM or inducers of calcium ionophoreA23187. Many reports have shown that GRP78 plays aprotective role in maintaining cell viability against severalkinds of stress in a variety of cancers. However, most of thereports focus on the up-regulation of GRP78, whereas onlyfew of them examine the down-regulation of GRP78,especially whether the suppression of GRP78 is associatedwith the sensitivity of chemotherapy in cancer. Herein, weintended to investigate the down-regulation of GRP78 by theinhibitor of BAPTA-AM and the function this to VP-16 in SCLC NCI-H446 were BAPTA-AM-treated group, A23187-treated group and control-group.Immunofluorescence and RT-PCR were used to assess theexpression of GRP78 at both protein and mRNA levels forthe three cell groups. Then the cells were treated with VP-16 at the concentration of 30 M, and percentages ofapoptosis and the cycle distributions of the cells weredetected by flow cytometry. Results: Compared with A23187-treated and control group cells, the expression ofGRP78 at both protein and mRNA levels for the BAPTA-AM- treated cells were greatly decreased in a dose-dependedmanner. After treatment with VP-16, the percentage ofapoptotic cells for BAPTA-AM-treated group were:33.4\u00b11.01%, 48.2\u00b11.77%, 53.0\u00b11.43%, 56.5\u00b12.13%,respectively, corresponding to the concentrations of BAPTA-AM 10, 15, 25, 40 M, which was statistically significanthigh in comparison with the A23187-treated group anduntreated-group (7.18\u00b11.03 % and 27.8\u00b11.45%, respectively,p<0.05). The cell cycle distributions assayed by flow cytometry showed that there was a great decrease in G1phase and a dramatic increase in S phase for the BAPTA-AM-treated cells compared with the untreated cells.Conclusion: BAPTA-AM is a strong inhibitor of GRP78 in NCI-H446 cell line. This suppression of GRP78 issignificantly associated with the sensitivity to VP-16 in NCI-H446 cells through the alteration of cell cycle distributions.These results indicate that down-regulation of GRP78 or theinhibition of GRP78 activity may offer a new therapeuticapproach to the clinical management of lung cancer. 715 CONSTRUCTION OF AN ARTIFICIAL RADIATION-GUIDED SYNCHRONIZING GENE CIRCUIT USINGNITRIC OXIDE SIGNALING PATHWAY IN HUMANLUNG CANCER CELLS Wei-dong Wang , Zheng-tang Chen and De-zhi Li Cancer Center of PLA, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, ChinaAim: Radio-genetic therapy is a novel strategy for cancer treatment, however, the expression level of therapeutic genesinduced by radiation is too low to completely eradicate thetumor, especially under the routine clinical doses ofradiation. Gene circuits are some simple gene networkscharacterized by special regulatory properties. Methods: In the present study, a synchronous amplifying gene circuitcontrolled by nitric oxide (NO) signaling elements coupling c-fos promoter with inducible nitricoxide synthase (iNOS), which is ionizingradiation the radiation-responsive of c-fos promoter.Results: The synchronous amplifying property of the constructed gene circuit was demonstrated by assaying ofgreen fluorescence protein with three-fold enhancedexpression. In a further study, the suicide gene HSV-TK substituted the reporter gene; the duration and level ofexpression of target genes increased and the enhancedradiosensitivity and therapeutic effects on human lung cancerwere also shown in this experiment. Conclusion: The study will improve the radio-genetic therapy in future bypromoting the expression level and prolonging the durationof expression of target genes. 716 CHROMATIN RESTORATION FOLLOWINGGENOMIC REPAIR Qianzheng Zhu, Gulzar Wani, Hany Arab, Mohamed A.

Thus, restoration of functionally intactchromatin structure following DNA damage processing iscrucial for retaining genetic as well as epigeneticinformation coded within modified histones. Our recentresearch H2A (uH2A) occurs followingdamage repair characteristic of this process in thecontext of nucleotide excision repair (NER) sub-pathwaysof global genomic repair and transcription-coupledrepair (TCR). We XPF. This repair-proficient and -deficient cellresponse indicated that uH2A incorporation strictly relieson successful damage repair occurring through either GGRANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3536or TCR sub-pathway. In contrast, XPA, XPG or XPF were not required for the formation of H2AX foci inasynchronous cells, affirming this event ubiquitin at DNA damage sites. However, histone chaperoneCaf-1 showed distinct localization to the damage sites.Knockdown of Caf-1 p60 abolished Caf-1 as well as uH2Afoci Caf-1 was found to associate withNER factors TFIIH, RPA p70 and PCNA in chromatin.Overall data demonstrate that prompt Caf-1-mediatedchromatin restoration following NER puts uH2A marks atthe sites of repaired damage within chromatin. Ourobservations on CPD repair, and recent report on acetylatedhistone H3 driving the chromatin assembly after DSBrepair, unfolds a novel phenomenon related to DNA repair-mediated alterations of epigenetic information withinchromatin.This work is supported by Grants from NIH. 717 HD-PTP IS IMPORTANT REGULATOR OF PDGFR DEGRADATION Piotr Wardega and Johan Lennartsson Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala University, Box 595, 24 Uppsala, Sweden Human His-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (HD-PTP) is a novel protein that has been implicated insorting of internalized proteins towards degradation, althoughthe molecular mechanism remain unclear. Previous studieshave suggested that HD-PTP may interact with severalcomponents sorting machinery such as TSG101 (member ofendosomal sorting compexes for ESCR-III together proteins), endophilin A1, but not with CIN85. We haveinvestigated the role of HD-PTP in down-regulation anddegradation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Our data indicate that HD-PTP is able to interactin a constitutive manner with PDGFR. We observed thatHD-PTP is tyrosine phosphorylated steady-stateconditions, but this phosphorylation can expression PDGF-induced tyrosine decreased receptor overexpressionreduced the level of consistent withthe decreased of PDGFR ubiquitination. Inconclusion, our findings suggest that HD-PTP interferes withc-Cbl's ability to induce PDGF dependent receptorubiquitination and thereby the process of receptor down-regulation.718 PREDICTION OF RESPONSE IN MULTIMODALITYTREATMENT OF UPPER GASTROINTESTINALCANCER: IMPACT OF MOLECULAR MARKERS Cancer Surgery, 2Institute of Pathology, 3University of Cologne, Institute of Pathology, University of Bonn, 4Institute of Pathology, Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf, Germany; 5Department of Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland Malignant tumors arise when cells change their developmental program and replicate independently fromsignal cascades and cellular control mechanisms. Themalignant development is genetically directed. The aim ofour work was to exploit these genetical changes fordiagnosis, response prediction and monitoring for clinicalpurposes. Since only 30 to 50% of patients with locallyadvanced cancer 36 Gy)there is a need for predictive markers. The predictive impact of a selection of genes was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR quantification. Expression levels werecompared with the degree of histopathological tumorregression. Tumor regression was defined as major responsewhen resected specimens contained fewer than 10% residualvital tumor cells. The excision repair gene ERCC1 is essential for removal of DNA damage, caused by radiation andchemotherapy. The predictive impact of ERCC1 mRNA levels was demonstrated. An increased level of ERCC1 mRNA in pre-therapeutical tumor biopsies was not compatible with amajor response (sensitivity 62.5%, specificity 100%). A totalof 42% of patients were identified for non-response to theneoadjuvant treatment by quantification of ERCC1 mRNA. c- erbB-2 mRNA expression proved to be an additional predictive marker of minor histopathological response toneoadjuvant therapy in patients with esophageal cancer. Complementing gene expression analysis, single nucleotide polymorphisms proved to be associated withtherapy response. By genetic variants of polymorphismrs11615, 38% of the patients were identified as minorresponders and could be prevented from a non-effectiveneoadjuvant treatment. A minor group of 9.6% would missa potentially successful therapy. XRCC1 is part of the baseexcision repair system (BER) repairing small lesions aroundthe damaged base. The rarely appearing genotypes AA andAG of XRCC1 polymorphism rs1799782 proved to be additional markers for response prediction. These dataAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3537confirm that DNA repair capacity is a critical mechanism for resista nce to platin-based therapeutics. Since analysis of single molecular markers allows response prediction only at a low sensitivity and specificity, co-expressionof different candidate genes was applied. For prediction oftherapy response in esophageal cancer, the predictive impact ofa panel of 17 target genes was analyzed. Expression of mRNAin paired pretherapeutical tumor/normal biopsies was quantifiedby TaqMan Low Density Array (LDA) analysis. LDA proved tobe a standardized and reproducible method for clinical practice.Combination of a gene p21, p16, PAI-1 and VEGF accuracy. Construction of a predictive model byartificial neuronal network analysis for prediction of majorhistopathological response provided an accuracy of 90.5%, at asensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 90.5%. For identification of novel markers not yet associated with response prediction, human genome microarrays were applied.Verification experiments confirmed the response predictiveimpact of STK11 , a serine/thereonine kinase tumor suppressor gene. An LDA consisting of an optimized genepanel could be applied to customize treatment strategies byquantification of gene expression patterns. Regarding esophageal, lung and pancreatic cancer overexpression of survivin , an inhibitor of apoptosis, proved to be a marker for detection of cancer. In esophageal cancer, wewere able to show that survivin is additionally a marker for monitoring of the therapy. Detection of survivin mRNA was also established for blood samples. Survivin mRNA was monitored in 88% of the patients with gastrointestinal tumors.A total of 59% of the patients showed a significantly lowermedian survivin mRNA expression after surgical resection than before. Following neoadjuvant therapy and tumor resection, in38% of the patients there was no survivin mRNA detectable at all. The data confirm the impact of survivin mRNA expressionfor detection of dissiminating tumor cells in peripheral bloodand for monitoring of the therapy. 719 DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF A SPECIFICMONOCLONAL ANTIBODY FOR THYROID CANCER Michiko Watanabe 1, Hiroshi Takeyama2and Yoshinobu Manome1 1Department of Molecular Cell Biology, 2Department of Jikei University School of Medicine. 3-25-8Nishishin-bashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo 104-8461, Japan Thyroid cancer has been diagnosed conventionally by fine- needle aspiration (FNA). However, even though the diagnosticaccuracy of FNA has increased, 20% of cases still require further investigation to determine if the lesion is benign ormalignant. Other diagnostic procedures such as echography,scintigraphy, and CTscanning are of little help. Therefore,development of a more accurate system is required. A monoclonal antibody, JT95, was established by Takeyama, Watanabe et al. , which specifically reacts to human thyroid cancer. The immunohistochemical reactivity of JT95was 96% to papillary carcinoma and 75% to follicularcarcinoma, but it showed hardly any reaction to normal tissues.This specific reactivity was confirmed on 288 cases of thyroidcancer in 13 medical facilities. The efficacy was studied underthe jurisdiction of the Japanese Society of Thyroid Surgery. This antibody recognized a glycoprotein containing sialic acid and which had a molecular weight of 250 kDa. Amino-acid sequencing revealed that the antigen was glycosylatedfibronectin. An approximately half-sized, 105-kDa tumor-related antigen was found to be circulating in the body of thepatients and was detected in the blood by an immunoblotassay. In the serodiagnosis using an enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay, JT95 detected 80% of relapsed ormetastasized thyroid cancer. In contrast, the detection rate wasmerely 51% in the primary patients. To improve the sensitivityand enable precise quantification, we are currently attemptingto label the antibody with nano-particles. In addition,immunohistochemical investigation using the antibodycontributes to the understanding of tumor antigen distributionand biological activities in thyroid diseases. Increasedsensitivity of JT95 will raise the potential for use of JT95 indiagnosis and treatment. Monoclonal antibodies have becomemore important in both research and clinical applications. Weconsider that clinical use of the JT95 antibody might beanother therapeutic application. 720 FAMILIAL CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY SYNDROMESHA VE DISTINCTIVE CLINICAL FEATURES Walter Weber , Jacqueline Estoppey and Hansruedi Stoll Medical Oncology, Heuberg 16, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland Introduction: Every human disease clusters in families to some extent. This is also true for cancer. An excess ofcancers of the same site exists among relatives, with thyroidand colon cancers and lymphocytic leukaemia showing thehighest familial risks (1). There is also familial clusteringof malignancies originating from different primary sites (2).Primary care physicians approve syndrome-specificgermline mutation testing and want to play a central role inthe management of cancer families (3). Therefore,characteristics of hereditary cancer predispositionsyndromes have to be known (4). Methods: In BaselANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3538families with conspicuous cancer aggregations can be referred for work-up and counseling to medical oncology inthe University Hospital or in a private practice nearby.Results: In 10 cancer families with germline mutations (4 breast-ovarian ca., 4 colorectal ca., one gastric ca. and oneCowden syndrome) and one renal cancer family with abalanced translocation (t(3;11) (q13,3;q21) the followingdistinctive features features of familial cancer susceptibility syndromes should be knownin the light of growing evidence of the efficacy of medicaland surgical interventions.1 Goldgar DE et JNCI Monograph No. 2008. 721 and2Department of Clinical Hematology, Robert Debr\u00e9 University Hospital, Paris, France Despite the advances in oncology, the mechanisms by which circulating tumor cells (CTC) are generated, and theirinvolvement in the metastatic process are still under debate.Carcinomas representing 80% of all cancers are used as amodel to elucidate the important question of systemic tumorcell dissemination. Although extremely rare, CTC representa potential alternative to invasive biopsies as a source oftumor tissue. Several methods for detecting CTC in peripheralblood from patients with various carcinomas have beendeveloped over the past few decades. Immunocytochemicaland molecular assays now enable the specific detection ofCTC even at the single-cell stage. In the present review, weprovide a critical review of the current methods used fordetection of CTC and data on their morphological andmolecular characterization. In a variety of carcinomasincluding breast cancer, it is now well established that CTCcounts predict overall survival and provide independentprognostic information to predict disease progression. Thenext challenge of CTC characterization will be to detect, in anon-invasive and serial manner, resistance/sensitivity of tumorcells to novel targeted therapies. Such a genetic-basedanalysis appears as a critical step in the development of apersonalized medicine.722 INHIBITION OF SURVIV 2Research Center for Biodiversity, China Medical University, Taiwan; 3Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan, ROC; 4Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA The chemopreventive potential of indole-3-carbinol has attracted much attention because of its demonstrated ability toprotect against chemical-induced carcinogenesis in differentexperimental animal models. From a mechanistic perspective,the ability of indole-3-carbinol to target a broad range ofsignaling pathways underlies its translational potential forcancer prevention and/or treatment. However, its clinical usemight be compromised by its complicated pharmacokineticbehaviors, poor bioavailability, and low antiproliferativepotency in vitro , which render therapeutic concentrations difficult to achieve in the body. Therefore, this study was aimedat pharmacologically exploiting indole-3-carbinol as amolecular platform to develop structural variants withimproved chemical stability and apoptosis-inducing potency.Among a series of indole-3-carbinol derivatives examined,OSU-A9 represented the optimal agent, with an IC 50of 3.8 M and 2.0 M for reducing the viability of SCC9 and SCC2095human oral cancer cell lines, respectively. Cell viability,apoptosis and signaling targets were determined by MTT,ELISA, immunoblotting and cell counting. Despite a apotent antitumor pleotropic mechanisms of actionby affecting multiple signaling pathways, which might havetranslational potential in oral cancer therapy. 723 CELL SIGNALING AND CANCER-POSSIBLETARGETS FOR THERAPY C.E. WennerDepartment of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY . 14263, USA Metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells involves acquisition of properties which include growth-factor independent cellproliferation, failure of inhibition by growth-inhibitory signals,Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3539ability to invade surrounding tissues, and to evade apoptosis, etc.Characterization of the profile or molecular signature of the tumor facilitates the development of rational therapies thattarget the aberrant pathways. Rapidly growing tumor cells areusually associated with high rates of glycolysis and in thesecells, it appears advantageous to exploit this pathway whichmost likely is required for optimal synthetic needs. Glycolysisis regulated at several control points and the association ofhexokinase with mitochondria is observed with rapidlygrowing, highly glycolytic cells. Hexokinase II (HK-II) isoverexpressed in a number of rapidly growing tumors andbinds to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Phosphorylationof V oltage-Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) inthe regulation of mitochondrial integrity-promoting functions of PKB/Akt. is our view that themetabolic regulatory functions of PKB/Akt have evolved intoan adaptive sensing system involving mitochondrialhexokinases. Therefore, targeting HK enzyme activity and itsassociation with integral membrane components such as VDACoffers potential therapeutic benefit. Recent studiesl by Chiara et al.(Plos One 3: 1852, 2008) demonstrated that Hexokinase II detachment from mitochondria triggers apoptosis through thepermeability transition pore but independent of VDAC.Although these results imply that VDAC-hexokinaseinteraction are not irreplaceable constituents of thepermeabilization process, it is possible that alternate membraneconstituents can act as binding partners for the HK II in theabsence of VDAC. Alternate constituents could also be capableof opening of the permeability transition pore. The studies ofChiara et al. contribute greatly to our understanding of the pathways of outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilizationand their inactivation of tumors. For example, a hexokinase-IIN-terminal peptide selectively detaches HK-II frommitochondria and induces apoptosis. The development ofhighly specific inhibitors in conjunction with combinatorialtherapeutic agents which target the growth factor signaltransduction pathways as well as apoptotic signaling pathwaysshould provide an opportunity for maximal therapeutic benefit. 724 ANTICANCER PROPERTIES AND MULTIDRUGRESISTANCE MODULATORY EFFECT OF PLANTPOLYPHENOLS AND Slovenia; 3CECF/iMed. UL, Faculty Lisbon, Av. das For\u00e7as Armadas, 1600-083 Lisbon,Portugal Many compounds of plant origin were formed to be interesting for potential application in cancer prevention or chemotherapy.Such agents were found among flavonoids and stilbenes. Inbroad in vitro and in vivo studies, the ability of plant-derived polyphenols to interact with different cellular targets wasrevealed. Resveratrol ( trans -3,4,5'- trihydroxystilbene) influences many cellular signaling pathways and affects all threestages of carcinogenesis. In this work the effect of severalstilbenes (resveratrol, its analogue piceatannol, and piceatannolderivatives) and some flavonoids on the activity of ATP-bindingcassette (ABC) multidrug transporters and potassium channelsKv1.3 was examined. Recently the role of potassium channelactivity in cancer has emerged. Several of the compoundsstudied were potent potassium channel inhibitors. Stronginhibition of membrane transporters and ion channels was oftenobserved in case of hydroxy-, methoxy-, acetoxy- and prenyl-derivatives in relation to the parent compounds. Piceatannol,naringenin and some of their derivatives occurred to be the mostactive inhibitors of MRP1 multidrug transporter. The influenceof plant polyphenols on integral membrane proteins such asMDR transporters and ion channels can be mediated at least inpart by non-specific membrane effects. Flavonoids and stilbeneinteractions with lipid bilayers were determined by fluorescenceand ESR spectroscopy. Simulation of the experimental ESRspectra and application of GHOST condensation method wereapplied to study of the effect of polyphenols on membranedomain structure. The significance of the interaction of studiedphytochemicals with membrane transporters, channels and lipidbilayer for their anticancer properties was discussed Antiproliferative properties of the compounds were tested in doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant, P-gp overexpressingcolon cancer cell lines LoV LoV o/Dx, respectively.Tangeretin, natural polymethoxylated flavone and 8-prenylnaringenin most effectively inhibited cell growth bothin sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines. Antiproliferativeaction was compared with pro-apoptic properties of thecompounds. 725 8-PRENYLNARINGENIN INHIBITS BOTH P-GLYCOPROTEIN Department of Medical Immunology, Institute of Immunology andExperimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, ul.Weigla 12, 53-114 Wrocaw, Poland 8-Prenylnaringenin (8-isopentenylnaringenin) ( Humulus lupulus ). Apart from binding to estrogen receptors and this flavonoidwas also recognized as an inhibitor of angiogenesis and achemopreventive agent. In the present work we havestudied the interaction of 8-prenylnaringenin with twomultidrug-resistance-associated transporters, P-glycoproteinand MRP1. Functional test based on the transport offluorescent substrate BCECF revealed that the flavonoidsignificantly inhibited MRP1 transport activity in humanerythrocytes (IC 50=5.76\u00b11.80 M). The influence of 8- prenylnaringenin on P-glycoprotein was investigated in twohuman colon cancer cell lines, drug-sensitive LoV o anddoxorubicin-resistant LoV o/Dx. By means of flowcytometry it was shown that the studied flavonoidsignificantly increased the accumulation of rhodamine 123in drug-resistant cancer cell line. The ability of was alsodemonstrated by confocal to study the cytotoxicity of 8-prenylnaringenin. It was found that the flavonoid was moretoxic to LoV o than to LoV o/Dx cell line, however inconcentrations higher than 25 M its toxicity to both celllines was considerable. In conclusion, 8-prenylnaringeninwas identified as a new potent multidrug resistancemodulator. The inhibited two mainMDR transporters: P-glycoprotein and MRP1 inconcentrations that were not seriously toxic to the cells. Inconcentrations above 50 M 8-prenylnaringenin acted as ananticancer agent, effectively killing the cancer cells. 726 HOST POLYMORPHISMS AS RISK FACTORS FOR GASTRIC CANCER Thomas Wex and Peter Malfertheiner Clinic of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Infectious Diseases, Leipziger Str. 44, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany Infection of the stomach with the gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori is the main risk factor for the development of gastric cancer (GC) leading to itsclassification as a \"definite carcinogen\" by the World HealthOrganization in 1994. Since then, the pathophysiologicalmechanisms linked to this infection have been studiedextensively in clinical and basic science. The currentparadigm of gastric carcinogenesis is based on amultifactorial risk factors, the virulence factors of thebacterium ( e.g.CagA, VacA), environmental factors (diet, smoking) and host factors (gene polymorphisms). Thecomplex interplay among these factors determines theclinical outcome of the infection, leading to 3 majordiseases in 1 out of 7 infected persons, namely ulcerdisease, and mucosa-associated lymphoid H. pylori , respectively. In 2000, El-Omar and co-workers identified a gene polymorphism of the interleukin (IL)-1 gene that isassociated with an increased risk for gastric cancer and shedlight into the pathophysiology of the H. pylori infection and its molecular links to gastric carcinogenesis. In recent years,this work has been tremendously extended and variousgenomic variants, carrying a risk for the development ofgastric cancer, were identified. Among them are cytokinegenes (IL-8, IL-10) and receptors for the recognition of thebacterium (TLR-4). Besides the identification of novel genepolymorphisms linked to GC, it has become clear that thereis no general genomic risk pattern for all GC patients. Mostof the established host factors are restricted either to thehistological type (intestinal vs.diffuse), ethnical background (Caucasian vs. Asian) on tumor localization (non-cardia vs. proximal GC). Here, we will review the current knowledgeof the role of these host factors for gastric carcinogenesisand present our data concerning the role of IL-1beta and NOD-2 gene polymorphisms in German patients with gastric cancer. 727 kPCR-BASED IDENTIFICATION OF LOW-RISKAND HIGH-RISK BREAST CANCER PATIENTS FOR ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS Ralph M. Wirtz , Mathias Gehrmann, 50829 K\u00f6ln, Germany Genomic approaches have revolutionized our understanding of tumor biology. Employing microarray analysis of freshtissue tumor samples in a groundbreaking study Perou andco-workers (1) were first to identify subtypes intrinsic tobreast cancer. Importantly, these molecular subtypes do notonly differ fundamentally in their general aggressiveness, butalso in their responsiveness to different anticancer therapies.However, tests to define these intrinsic subtypes have not yetbeen adapted to formalin-fixed tumor tissue, an obstacle totheir use in routine clinical practice. At Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, we have analyzed gene expression and genomic alterations were examined in fresh andfixed tumor tissue samples of thousands of breast cancerAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3541patients treated as part of clinical trials or in clinical practice. First, we identified a gene signature, consisting of twelvegenes, that identifies node-negative breast cancer patientshaving a low-risk of developing distant metastasis within 5years. The respective breast cancer prognosis score reached asensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 35% for death afterrecurrence within 10 years in an independent validation cohortof 236 patients. The breast cancer prognosis score can beassessed by kPCR in formalin-fixed tumor tissue and thereforecould be implemented into routine clinical practice.* This mayhelp to spare low-risk breast cancer patients from harshsystemic treatments such as chemotherapy. Second, we identified a gene signature consisting of only 4 genes that identifies high-risk patients in the node-negative and node-positive situation (>60% recurrencewithin 3 years) by molecular classification. Again, this genesignature was identified in fresh tissue specimens and thentransferred to kPCR detection in formalin-fixed tissuesamples. Importantly, this 4 gene algorithm not onlyidentified the high-risk patient population in the validationcohort ( p<0.0001; n=210), but also discriminated between low risk and high risk patients in the triple negative breastcancer subtype ( p=0.006). As these patients were already treated with anthracycline and taxol-containingchemotherapy, alternative regimens might be applied tothese high risk patients early on. Interestingly, the 4 genealgorithm comprises the detection of angiogenic activitiesin tumors and therefore might be helpful for selectingpatients for antiangiogenic treatment options. 1 Perou CM, S\u00f8rlie T, Eisen MB, van de Rijn M, Jeffrey SS, Rees CA, Pollack JR, Ross DT, Johnsen H, Akslen Pergamenschikov A, Williams C, Zhu SX,L\u00f8nning PE, B\u00f8rresen-Dale AL, Brown PO and BotsteinD: Molecular portraits of human breast tumours.

WitzDepartment o Cell Research and Immunology, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel The tumor tissue is composed of 2 compartments intimately associated with each other. The first compartment constitutesthe malignant cells. The second is the tumormicroenvironment. This compartment is composed of residentcells such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells and other non-malignant cells; of infiltrating cells such as lymphocytes ormacrophages and of numerous molecules such as those of theextracellular matrix, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines,antibodies, proteases, other types of enzymes and variousmetabolites. All these molecules may be released from the tumor cells and/or from the non malignant cells. Someartificially administered molecules, for example drugs, mayalso be present in the microenvironment. Themicroenvironment of many solid tumors may be characterizedby hypoxia; low extracellular pH and by low glucoseconcentration. The contemporary concept of tumor microenvironment postulates that it functions as an active \"educational/inductive/selection\" venue in which the tumor is directedinto one of several molecular evolution pathways bymicroenvironmental factors. However the interactionbetween microenvironmental components and tumor cells isbidirectional. In addition to the regulation of genes in tumorcells by microenvironmental factors, tumor cells and theirproducts are capable of regulating gene expression in non-tumor cells residing in or infiltrating into themicroenvironment thereby altering their phenotype. Thereare scores of tumor-microenvironment interactions that playanti or pro malignancy roles. These include interactions thatlead to or drive cell proliferation or death, angiogenesis,motility, chemotaxis, invasion, protective immunity,inflammation and metastasis to name a few. Many suchinteractions await their discovery and the significance ofother interactions has still to be elucidated. Interactions of cancer cells with components of their microenvironment are pivotal determinants in the decisionmaking process that determines if cancer cells will progresstowards metastasis or whether they will stay dormant ordisappear altogether. The realization that metastasis iscontrolled by interactions of tumor cells withmicroenvironmental components has allowed for theestablishment of a new paradigm, namely intervention in themetastatic process by targeting interactions between the tumorcell and its microenvironment. Numerous preclinical andclinical trials attempt, on the one hand, to block tumor-microenvironment interactions that boost tumor progressionand metastasis and on the other hand enhance interactions thatcounteract malignancy. In order to develop effective anti metastasis therapies and in view of the complexity of tumor-microenvironmentinteractions, combinatorial approaches used in the analysisof hyper complex systems will have to be employed. 729 THE DYNAMIC SYSTEM [TELOMERES-TELOMERASE-PROLIFERATION] UNDERLIESPERENNIAL GROWTH OF CANCER CELLS AND EPISODES OF DRUG RESISTANCE J. Deschatrette and long time, regular progressive growth and resistance to anticancer drugs have been considered as invariantcharacteristics of a tumor. However, there are indications thatboth cell growth and drug resistance can display discontinuouspatterns over months, although the mechanisms underlyingthese fluctuations are unclear. Our hypothesis is that telomereregulation plays an important role in such fluctuations. In rathepatocarcinoma cells in vitro , we observed that every part of the small complex system [Telomeres-Telomerase-Proliferation]displayed deterministic oscillations. These oscillations werecoordinated and resulted in an oscillatory conservative behaviorof the whole system. This global dynamic equilibrium wasfound critical for perennial growth of hepatocarcinoma cells andfor peaks of cell resistance to methotrexate. 730 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND CANCER Alicja WolkKarolinska Institutet, Department of Environmental Medicine, Division of Nutritional Epidemiology, Sweden Physical activity promotes health, wellbeing and longevity through decreased risk for cardiovascular disease, cancer,other chronic diseases and all, as well as that for cancer,mortality. Accumulating evidence from epidemiological studies shows that physical activity is of significance for reducing cancerincidence. The most consistent associations between physicalactivity and reduced cancer risk have been observed for colonand breast cancer. Growing evidence also indicates a reducedrisk for endometrial and lung cancer. There has not been clearsupport for an inverse association between physical activityand prostate cancer risk in previous studies; however, morespecific new analyses indicate that such an association mayexist. Furthermore, growing evidence supports the role ofphysical activity in improving cancer prognosis and quality oflife in cancer survivors. Less evidence is available on cancerrecurrence. Current recommendations regarding a required \"dose\" of daily physical activity in prevention of cancer developmentand cancer mortality are specified as 30-60 minutes per dayof moderately-to-vigorously intense physical activity. Theyare further supported by new results from prospectivestudies of men and women in Sweden. 731 HELICOBACTER PYLORI ERADICATION IN THE PREVENTION OF GASTRIC CANCER Benjamin C. Y . WongDepartment of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong KongGastric cancer remains one of the top cancer killers in the World. Chronic Helicobacter pylori infection increases the risk of gastric cancer, by stepwise progression from chronicactive gastritis to gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia,dysplasia and finally cancer. These stepwise progressionsmay take many years, and at present there is no proveneffective treatment for the presence of premalignant lesionsincluding intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia. Hence the twoprevailing questions in gastric cancer prevention are (a)whether treatment of H. pylori -related gastritis can reduce the risk of gastric cancer, and (b) whether treatment of H. pylori -related IM or dysplasia can both reverse the premalignant lesions and reduce the risk of gastric cancer. Our randomized placebo controlled trial in China started in year 1994 included both patients with H. pylori related gastritis and patients with H. pylori related premalignant lesions (1). After 7.5 years of follow up, patients receivingH. pylori treatment showed a non-significant trend of having less gastric cancer than those patients that received placebo.The sub-group analysis showed that patients with H. pylori related gastritis benefited most from treatment, with nocancer developing in 7.5 years. However, in patients with H. pylori related premalignant lesions, there was no difference in the risk of gastric cancer in both treatment and placebogroups. Hence our study suggests that the benefit of treatingH. pylori in cancer prevention may be restricted to patients with gastritis only. Correa et al. performed another randomized placebo controlled trial in Columbia which included mainly patientswith H. pylori - related premalignant lesions (2). Their 12- year follow up result suggested that subjects who were H. pylori negative after treatment had 14.8% more regression and 13.7% less progression than patients who were positiveat 12 years ( p=0.001). Hence he concludes that it is beneficial to treat H. pylori in patients with premalignant lesions. However the magnitude of benefit may be in therange of 15% only. Based on these and other studies, the recommendation isthat treatment of H. pylori is beneficial in prevention of gastric cancer. The benefit is greater in patients withoutpremalignant lesions. Hence treatment earlier in life maygive better results. 1 Wong BCY , Lam SK, Wong WM et al : Helicobacter pylori eradication to prevent gastric cancer in a high-risk region in China: A randomized controlled trial.

Gibson WoodDepartment of Pharmacology, University of Minnesota School of Medicine, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA There are data, albeit with some controversy, indicating that the cholesterol lowering drugs, statins, may prevent certaintypes of cancer, are proapoptotic and may arrest cell growth.However, we and others have shown that statins affordprotection to cells under various treatment conditions.Moreover, this protection is due in part to upregulation of Bcl-2. Simvastatin stimulated murine neuronal Bcl-2 gene expression in vivo and in vitro . Simvastatin pretreatment resulted in a significant reduction in cytotoxicity(caspase-3 activation, lactate dehydrogenate release) followinga challenge G3139, an antisense oligonucleotidedirected against effects and up-regulationof Bcl-2 protein. Effects of simvastatin on Bcl-2 stimulationnot only occurred in mice but were replicated in anotherspecies, the guinea pig. We demonstrated up-regulation of Bcl-2 in cerebral cortex of drug-treated guinea pigs and dissociatedbrain cells from simvastatin-treated guinea pigs were protectedfrom was reduced Bcl-2 protein, similar to effects observedwhen Bcl-2 protein levels were reduced by G3139. Effects ofsimvastatin on Bcl-2 stimulation were independent ofinhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and data indicated thepotential role of endothelin-1 on statin-induced stimulation ofBcl-2. Here, we provide novel evidence showing thatsimvastatin can stimulate expression of Bcl-2 both in vivo and in vitro . These findings provide one of the potential mechanisms for the purported neuroprotective effects of statinsand do not support a proapoptotic mechanism of action of thisclass of drugs.

In this study, we investigated whetheror not BITC and PEITC can induce apoptosis in U-2 U-2 OS cell proliferation was examined by MTT exposure to BITC and PEITC in vitro . BITC at 7.5 M and PEITC at 10 M were used for different time treatmentsof U-2 OS cells for determination of cell viability. DAPIstaining and comet assay were used for examining DNAdamage and the results indicated that BITC and PEITCinduced U-2 OS cell DNA damage in time- and dose-dependent manners. Flow cytometry was used for cell cycleanalysis, sub-G1 group, production of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) and Ca 2+and changes of mitochondrial membrane potential ( m ) in U-2 OS cells after treatment with BITC or PEITC for various time periods. BITC andPEITC reduced m and increased the production of ROS and Ca 2+in U-2 OS cells in a time-dependent manner. BITC and PEITC induced G2/M phase arrest in U-2 OS cells. In conclusion, BITC and PEITC promoted the production ofROS and Ca 2+and caused DNA damage and G2/M phase arrest, reducing m of mitochondria, resulting inactivation of caspase-3 that finally led to apoptosis in U-2OS cells. 734 THE EFFECTS OF GAN-LUH-YIN ON THEPROLIFERATION OF LYMPHOCYTES ANDSECRETIONS OF of Biological Science and Technology, 2Department of Pharmacology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwain, ROC Oral cancer is one of the major causes of death in the male population of Taiwan. It was reported that the number of T-and B-cells and the levels of interleukin (IL)-2 in oral cancerpatients is lower then that of healthy individuals. However,the level of IL-4, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- inoral cancer patient is higher than that of healthy individuals.Gan-Luh-Yiin (GLY) is usually used for promoting cure byChinese medicine in patients. Whether or not GLY caninhibit inflammation of oral cancer cells is not clear.Therefore, the purpose of our study was to investigate theproliferation of spleen cells from mice and also to examinethe levels of cytokines from oral cancer cell lines such asCAL 27, SCC-4, HSC-3 and TW206. Celltiter kit was usedfor analysis of the total number of T- and B-cells. The CBAmethod and flow cytometry (FACS) were and interferon (IFN)-). The results indicate that GLY at 200, 500 and 1000g/ml promoted the proliferation of T- and B-cells underCon A and lipopolysaccharide stimulation, respectively. Theresults from examinations SCC-4 (2) GLY promoted IL-4 27, HSC-3 from CAL 27, SCC-4, HSC-3 and TW206cells; and (5) promoted IFN- from level as examined by real-time PCR. GLY also suppressed the levels of proteins such asphosphorylated Akt, NF- B p65 and ERK1/2 which were examined by Western blotting, NF- B promoter assay and immunostaining in CAL 27 cells. Taken together, we suggestthe effects of GLY on oral cancer may be mediated throughanti-inflammatory action viaTNF. 735 MICRORNA ANALYSIS OF FORMALIN FIXEDPARAFFIN-EMBEDDED BREAST CANCERTISSUES WITH DIFFERENT STAGES Y . Zhao 1, C. Deng2, H. Zhang1, J. G. 1Genomics Laboratories, of Medicine, Creighton Omaha,NE; 2Department of Pathology, Creighton University, Omaha, NE; 3Department of Surgery, Creighton University, Omaha, NE. Introduction: Breast cancer still has the highest incidence among women in the United States. Our understanding of itsmolecular and cellular mechanisms is limited. Recently,microRNAs have gained favorable status as upstreamregulators of breast cancer progression since then it canposttranscriptionally regulate sets of genes. It is nowestimated that there are about 1000 miRNAs in the humangenome, but only about 300 miRNAs have been identified inhumans now. Much of miRNAs and their roles in cancerformation still await discovery. Methods: Formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tissues from differentstages of the cancer were de-waxed before performing totalRNA extraction. Tissues, from normal breast, in situ ductal carcinoma (DCIS), and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC,stage II), with 15 subjects in each group were analyzed. Thetotal RNA was extracted with acid-phenol: chloroform.MicroRNAs were isolated from total RNA. MicroRNAmicroarray profiling was performed using LC Sciencestechnology (LC Sciences, LLC). The Bioconductorimplementation of Limma was used to analyze the data. Results: MicroRNA profiling experiments have been performed from 45 FFPE breast tissues of breast cancersubjects. By comparing the endogenous miRNA level innormal to that in DCIS, we found that numbers of miRNAs(e.g. mir-21) were significantly induced, while some of miRNAs ( e.g.mir-205) were suppressed, in DCIS stage. In subjects with IDC stage, we observed some up-regulatedmiRNA species ( e.g. mir-21) and more down-regulated miRNA species ( e.g.mir-126), indicating that those miRNAs could be important candidate mediators that regulateprogressive process of the breast cancer. These findings wereconfirmed by real time microRNA RT-PCR using breastcancer patient samples. Further functional studies are stillunder investigation. 736 ASSOCIATION OF THE TOB ANTIPROLIFERATIVEPROTEIN WITH THE CCR4-NOT COMPLEX, A PLATFORM OF DEADENYLASE-BASED GENEREGULATION Morita, Kentaro Ito, Takashi Miyasaka, Toru Suzuki and Tadashi Yamamoto The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo,Tokyo 108-8639, Japan The Tob/BTG family of antiproliferarive proteins is involved in multiple biological events that include cell growthsuppression, apoptosis, and bone formation. To understand theunderling mechanism by which Tob/BTG family proteins areinvolved in various biological events, we planned to identifyTob-interacting proteins. For this purpose, we established Flag-tagged Tob-expressing stable cell lines and applied a proteomicapproach. We found that Tob interacts with the CCR4-NOTcomplex that is a multi-protein complex conserved from yeastto Cnot7, and core and/orregulatory Cnot1 to -4 and Cnot9. with Cnot1, proteinof the CCR4-NOT complex. Although we previously showedthat Tob functions in the transcription machinery, the abovefinding suggests that Tob is also involved in the control ofmRNA metabolism. We then addressed biological significanceof the CCR4-NOT complex by depleting each component ofthe complex either by RNAi or targeted gene disruption inmice. Interestingly, we found that RNAi-mediated depletion ofCnot6L results in growth retardation of NIH 3T3 cellsaccompanied by elevation of both p27 Kip1mRNA and p27Kip1 protein. We showed that p27Kip1mRNA is stabilized and its poly (A) tail is preserved in Cnot6L-depleted cells. The dataAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3545suggest that Cnot6L regulates cell growth in a manner dependent on its deadenylase activity targeted to p27Kip1 mRNA. We also found unique phenotypes in mice lacking Cnot3 and Cnot7, respectively. Cnot7-/-males are sterile owing to oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia, suggesting that Cnot7deadenylase is essential for spermatogenesis. Cnot3 -/- mice are embryonic lethal. Heterozygous mice for Cnot3 are viable and fertile, but displayed severe leanness and hypersensitivity toinsulin. We also showed Cnot3 positively regulates the CCR4-NOT-associated deadenylase activity. To clarify the underlyingmolecular mechanisms, we searched for the mRNA specieswhose abundance is altered in these gene manipulated mice.Taking all findings together, we will discuss the fundamentalfunction of the CCR4-NOT complex in relation to the activityof Tob. 737 DIFFERENTIAL PROGNOSTIC FACTORSINDEPENDENT OF TNM STAGE Ooki, Hiroshi Katoh, MD, Mina Waraya and Masahiko The Department of Surgery, Kitasato University Hospital, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan Aim: To know the most important prognostic factors independent of TNM stage in advanced cancers such asesophageal, gastric, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer amongthe daily feasible relevance.TNM factors were excluded from the multivariate analysisin order to know the independent prognostic factors (IPF).Results: i) In ESCC, multivariate prognostic analysis revealed that lymph node metastasis density (ND)-factor andgrowth pattern were the strongest in more and less advancedESCC, respectively. ii) In GAD, IDF was the ND-factor instage II, III, and IV , reproducibly in both retrospective andprospective analysis. iii) On the other hand, in CAD, IDFwas preoperative CA19-9 and multiple liver metastasis onlyin and there were no other prognostic factorsidentified in curable cases. We will present diminishingprognostic impact of serum CEA in the recent patients. iv)In PAD, the strongest IDF was preoperative CA19-9, and thehigher it was, the worse the patient was. Intra-operative dissected pancreatic margin (DPM) positivity wasanother IPF, and we could identify the long survivor groupfor advanced PAD. Conclusion: In ESCC and GAD, lymph node metastasis density (ND-factor) was the most life-threatening phenotype, while ND-factor in either CAD or PAD did not show such relevance for prognosis. On the otherhand, preoperative CA19-9 was the most importantprognostic factor in both CAD with stage IV and advancedPAD. We will describe the difference of such discrete typesof cancers and present a putative mechanism to explain thedifference. Therapeutic targets among the major gastro-intestinal cancers, will also be discussed. 738 DYRK2 EXPRESSION CAN BE A PREDICTIVEMARKER FOR CHEMOTHERAPY Idaigaoka, Hasama, Yufu, Oita, 879-5593,Japan Background: Several predictive markers of treatment and survival were reported such as ERCC1 in NSCLC (non-small-cell lung cancer). We report the possibility of DYRK2,a dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulatedkinase gene to predict benefit from chemotherapy forpatients with recurrent NSCLC. Materials and Methods: Forty patients with recurrent disease after surgery receivedseveral combinations of platinum-based chemotherapy.Chemotherapy effectiveness was evaluated according toRECIST criterion. We used immunohistochemical analysisto determine the expression of the DYRK2 protein withoperative specimens of NSCLC. Results: We could not find any correlation between age, sex, pathological stage, tumorsize, nodal status, histological type and DYRK2 expression.The overall response rate was 22.2% (4 out of 18) in DYRK2positive group compared with 4.5% (1 out of 22) in negativegroup. On the other hand, the group of 17 PD (progressivedisease) patients was consisted of 3 DYRK2 positive patientsand 14 DYRK2 negative patients ( p=0.0086). The median time to the progression of disease was 120 days in theDYRK2 negative group, as compared with 310 days in theDYRK2 positive group(HR=1.984, 95% CI=[1.039-3.788],p=0.034). Conclusion: Patients with recurrent NSCLC and DYRK2-positive tumors showed a substantial benefit fromchemotherapy, as compared with patients with DYRK2-negative tumors. and School of Pharmacy, 3Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan,ROC In this study, we examined the efficacy of HMJ-30, a quinazoline derivative, on cell metastasis of humanosteosarcoma U2OS cells in vitro and explored its associated molecular mechanisms. The effects of HMJ-30 on U2OS cellviability, migration and invasion were detected by MTT,wound scratch assays and transwell invasion assays,respectively. Metastasis-relative protein expression andactivity were determined by Western blotting and gelatinzymography. Our data showed that HMJ-30 inhibited U2OScell proliferation, migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner. HMJ-30 inhibited protein expression ofMMP-2 on HMJ-30-treated U2OS cells which wereexamined in Western blotting. HMJ-30 also in HMJ-30-treated U2OS cells ERK1/2 protein expression in U20S cells. Takentogether, our data indicate a possible role of HMJ-30 as apotential antitumor agent with the marked inhibition ofmetastatic and invasive capacity of human osteosarcomaU2OS cells. 740 THE ROLE OF ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUMSTRESS ON CELL CYCLE ARREST ANDAPOPTOSIS INDUCED BY CRUDE EXTRACT OFEUPHORBIA FORMOSANA RADIX IN HUMAN PROSTATE CANCER CELLS Jiun-Long Yang 1, Chao-Lin Kuo2and Jing-Gung Chung3 1Graduate Institute of Chinese Pharmaceutical Science, 2School of Chinese Medicine Resources, 3Department of Biological Science and Technology, China MedicalUniversity, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC Prostate cancer is the one of the major causes of death by cancer in older man worldwide. Euphorbia formosana radix (EF R) has long been used as an anti-snake venom in traditional Taiwanese medicine. However, there is noavailable information to address the effects of EF Ron human prostate cancer cells. In this study, we investigated thecytotoxicity of EF RECin human prostate cancer DU 145 cells. The results showed that EFREC decreased the percentage of viable DU 145 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. The IC50of EFRis 50 g/ml and this concentration was used for further study. Flow cytometrywas used for examining cell cycle arrest and the proportionof sub-G1 DU 145 cells and results showed that EF REC induced significant S-phase arrest and sub-G1 groups appear.Comet assay demonstrated that EF REC induced significant DNA damage in DU 145 cells and DNA gel electrophoresisindicated that EF RECinduced apoptosis due to the present of DNA fragmentation. EFREC Induced the productions of cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium ionsbut reduced the changes in mitochondria membrane potential(m ) in examined cells. Results from Western indicated that EF RECreduced pro-caspase-3, In conclusion, EF of DU 145 cells through mitochondria-and caspase-3-dependent pathways. 741 HUMAN CELLS COMMONLY ACQUIRE DNADAMAGE DURING MITOTIC ARREST W. Brian Dalton, Mandayam O. Nandan and Vincent W. Yang Division of Digestive Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, 615 Michael Street,Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA The mitotic checkpoint is a mechanism which arrests the progression to anaphase until all chromosomes haveachieved proper attachment to mitotic spindles. In cancercells, satisfaction of this checkpoint is frequently delayedor prevented by various defects, some of which have beencausally implicated in tumorigenesis. At the same time,deliberate induction of mitotic arrest has proven clinicallyuseful, as antimitotic drugs which interfere with properchromosome-spindle interactions are effective anticanceragents. However, how mitotic arrest contributes totumorigenesis or antimitotic drug toxicity is not welldefined. Here we report that mitotic chromosomes canacquire DNA breaks during both pharmacological andgenetic induction of mitotic arrest in human cancer cells.These breaks activate a DNA damage response, occurindependently of cell death, and subsequently manifest askaryotype alterations. Such breaks can also occurspontaneously, particularly in cancer cells containingmitotic spindle abnormalities. Moreover, we observedevidence of breakage in primary human cells. Our findingsthus describe a novel source of DNA damage in humancells. They also suggest that mitotic arrest may promotetumorigenesis and antimitotic toxicity by provoking DNAdamage.Abstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3547742 HIPPOCRATES OF KOS, THE FATHER OFCLINICAL MEDICINE AND ASCLEPIADES OFBITHYNIA, THE FATHER OF MOLECULARMEDICINE Christos YapijakisUniversity of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece Hippocrates of Kos (460-377 BC) is universally recognized as the father of modern medicine, which is based on observation ofclinical signs and rational conclusions. Before him therapeuticattempts were based on religious or magical beliefs. Hebelonged to a family of physicians who claimed their ancestryfrom Asclepius, the god of medicine. Hippocrates workedmainly in the Aegean island of Kos and the nearby Minor Asiacoast, but he also traveled extensively visiting Athens, Thessalyand Thrace. His contribution to medical practice (collectivelyfound in the Hippocratic Corpus ) is characterized by ethical rules of conduct ( Hippocratic Oath ), close observation of clinical symptoms, an open mind for any ideas, and awillingness to explain the cause of diseases. Hippocrates andhis followers, for about two and a half millennia, basedmedicine on the notion that nature was made of four elements(established by the philosopher Empedocles), namely water,earth, wind and fire. In an analogous way, the body consistedof four fluids or \"humors\" (black bile, yellow bile, phlegm andblood) and four elemental conditions (cold, hot, dry and moist).The state of health according to Hippocrates existed when thesehumors and qualities were in balance. The physician had tomake a diagnosis and then facilitate the healing work of\"benevolent Nature\" by use of bleeding or purgatives. Despitesome wrong assumptions, the contribution of Hippocrates toclinical medicine is immense. The clinical and ethical basics ofmedical practice, as well as most clinical terms used even todayhave their origins in Hippocrates. Asclepiades of Bithynia (124-40 BCE) was the first physician who spoke about what is known today as molecularmedicine. Asclepiades was the first famous physician whoestablished Hellenic Medicine in Rome. He was born inProusa, Bithynia in the northwest region of Minor Asia, he waseducated at the Epicurean School in Athens and at the age of33 years he moved to Rome, where he first taught philosophyand later on practiced medicine. In contrast to the Hippocraticdogma of four elements and humors, he adhered to atomictheory, change and evolution, and did not accept the theory ofa \"benevolent Nature\". He suggested that the human body iscomposed of void spaces ( poroi ), as well as ). According to Asclepiades, diseases are caused by alteration of form orposition of a patient's molecules. In order to restore health, hefavored mild therapeutic methods such as healthy diet,exposure to light, hydrotherapy, massage, physical exercise,and above all the friendly support of patients. Asclepiades was the first physician who made the highly important division ofdiseases into acute and chronic ones and was the first toperform an elective non-emergency tracheotomy. He was apioneer in treating women (previously thought to be inferiorbeings) and in the humane treatment of patients with mentaldisorders, using labor and music therapy. His humane andnaturalistic approach, as well as his medical skills gave him agreat reputation. His influence lasted for six centuries throughthe Methodic Medical School, which was established by hisstudents. Some ideas of Asclepiades have been rediscovered inthe past century and represent the molecular basis of medicine. 743 INHERITED GENE POLYMORPHISMS OFFACTORS RELATED TO ANGIOGENESIS,INFLAMMATION AND THROMBOSIS THATINFLUENCE RISK FOR ORAL C. Serefoglou1, 1Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, 2Neurology and 3Pathology, University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece; 4Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Erlangen, N\u00fcrnberg, Germany Introduction: Recent genetic association studies performed by our group and others have provided evidence that inheritedfunctional DNA polymorphisms in genes of factors related toangiogenesis, inflammation and thrombosis are associatedwith increased risk for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).The present study examined the possible combinatory effectof 31 such gene polymorphisms in predicting the occurrenceof OSCC in Europeans using multivariate logistic regressionanalysis. Materials and Methods: A total of 330 individuals of Greek and German origin were studied, consisting of 162OSCC cases and 168 healthy controls of comparable age,gender, and ethnicity. DNA was isolated from blood samplesof studied individuals. Functional DNA polymorphisms in 31genes that encode cytokines and their receptors, matrixmetalloproteinases and their inhibitors, platelet glycoproteinsand coagulation factors (677C/T) . A series of regression models (adjusted for age and gender) was constructed in order to assess thecontribution of homozygous or heterozygous variantpolymorphic genotypes upon overall, early advancedstages of OSCC development. Results: In almost all multivariate logistic regression models, the contribution ofTNF- and IL-6 polymorphisms was consistent and robust.Furthermore, when the mode of inheritance of each variantallele was taken into account in a model, five polymorphismsemerged as primary present regression analysis revealed a highly significant contribution of 5 out of31 studied factors in the occurrence of OSCC. Based on thesefindings and previous reports, possible interactions of theimplicated factors leading to OSCC development, as well asan algorithm of risk estimation will be discussed. 744 EFFECT OF CORDYCEPS SINENSIS ON Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mukogawa Women's University,Nishinomiya, Hyogo 663-8179, Japan Cordyceps sinensis has been used as a herbal tonic in traditional Chinese medicine. We previously reported that thewater extract of the fruiting bodies of cultured Cordyceps sinensis (WECS), when administered to a hematogenic lung metastatic mouse model concomitantly with methotrexate(MTX), a folic acid antagonist, indicated a combined anti-metastatic effect. In this study, we investigated the effect ofWECS on a spontaneous metastatic mouse model, and alsoexamined the combined effect of were injected subcutaneously into the footpad of the right hind leg in syngeneic C57BL/6Crmice. Two weeks after inoculation, the mice were anesthetizedwith diethyl ether and the massively enlarged primary tumorwas amputated. (3 and 10 mg/kg/day) and hydroxyurea(500 mg/kg/day) were intraperitoneally administered to themice for 7 days after inoculation and for another 7 days afteramputation. To evaluate the anti-metastatic effect of WECS, wemeasured the survival of mice. As a result, mice that had beenadministered WECS 10 mg/kg showed significantly prolongedsurvival compared with that in control mice. Furthermore,hydroxyurea reinforced the anti-metastatic effect of WECS. Inconclusion, WECS may be useful for the treatment of metastatic tumors, and a promising adjuvant with conventionalanti-tumor agents such as hydroxyurea. 745 THE ROLES OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIESAND CALCIUM IN CAPSAICIN-INDUCEDAPOPTOSIS IN MDA-MB-231 HUMAN Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; 3Department of Clinical Pathology, Cheng Hsin Rehabilitation Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC Capsaicin (8-methyl- N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide), the main pungent ingredient of red pepper, has been reported topossess biological activities such as anticarcinogenic andanticancer activities. In the present study, the effects ofcapsaicin on human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells andthe signaling pathways involved in apoptosis it induces wereinvestigated. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with capsaicininhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis through reactiveoxygen species (ROS) and Ca 2+ generation, down-regulation of Bcl-2 and activation of caspase-3. The increases in bothCa 2+and ROS production were abolished by BAPTA (Ca2+ chelator) and N-acetylcysteine (ROS scavenger) and pretreatment with both compounds also prevented capsaicin-induced cell death. Capsaicin-promoted activation of ERKwas prevented with all the inhibitors tested. Interestingly,capsaicin induced morphological alterations and reduced thepercentage of viable cells. capsaicin increased theprotein levels of Bax, cytochrome cand active-caspase-3 but the of We conclude thatcapsaicin induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 Ca caspase-3 activation. 746 NOTI MICROARRAYS (NMA) FOR EPIGENETICPROFILING CANCER V Zabarovsky MTC, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden We have developed restriction site tagged microarrays (RSTM) and used NotI microarrays (NMA) for pilotAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3549experiments. Creation of microarrays on the genomic level would be very important as it may give informationunavailable on mRNA/cDNA the opportunity todetect simultaneously and differentially copy number andmethylation changes. Thus they allow to check cancer cells forgenetic and epigenetic abnormalities. These NMA can be usedfor individuals, normal/tumor pairs, different cell types etc. Atpresent, we analyzed over 400 samples representing variouscancers: breast, kidney, cervical, colon, ovarian, lung, prostate,nasopharyngeal carcinoma and leukemia. In the study 190genes from human chromosome 3 were analyzed. For allstudied cancers we found genes specifically methylated inmalignant cells. Many genes were found to be methylated in avery high fraction of cancer samples (more than 80%). Thesegenes can be divided in two classes: cancer specific andcommon for several types of cancer. Some examples of to be involved inthe development of epithelial cancers. Methylation of morethan 15 genes was confirmed by methyl-specific PCR andbisulfite sequencing. Methylation status of the genes correlatedwith expression (more than 15 genes were tested). Forexample, expression of RBSP3 was strongly suppressed (morethan 100-fold) in cervical samples and degree of theexpression decrease was tumor progression dependent. Fourgenes were tested functionally and demonstrated growthinhibiting activity proving that NMA are efficient instrumentto discover cancer causing genes and especially tumorsuppressor genes. We found that several tumor suppressorgenes in AP20 and LUCA 3p21.3 regions were co-regulatedin tumors. For example, of RBSP3, and HYAL2 types of NSCLC - squamouscell lung cancer (SCC, 41 samples) and lung adenocarcinoma(ADC, 18 tumors). Significant (from 2 to 100 times) andfrequent (from 44 to 100%) mRNA level decrease was shownin the tumors. Down-regulation of RASSF1A and ITGA9 wasassociated significantly with ADC progression. Simultaneousdecrease of all six genes' mRNA level was found in the sametumor samples and was not depended on their localization in3p21.3 and functions of the proteins. These results supportedthe hypothesis on simultaneous inactivation of cluster cancer-causing genes in AP20 and LUCA regions during thedevelopment and progression of lung cancer and otherepithelial tumors. The data could be important fordevelopment of specific biomarker sets for early cancerdiagnosis and new therapeutic approaches/strategies for cancertreatment. Genes specifically demethylated in tumors werealso found. They could represent oncogene-like genes. 747 COMBINATION OF SYNTHETIC ORGANOSILICONCOMPOUNDS (SILA-409 and J\u00f3zsef 1First Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Faculty of Medicine, 26\u00dclli Rd., Budapest, Hungary, H-1085; 2University of Szeged, Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunobiology, Szeged, Hungary Introduction: Pancreatic cancer is characterized by an aggressive behavior, poor prognosis and the main obstacleis its chemoresistance. In more than 70% of these tumorsthe P-glycoprotein encoded by the Multidrug-resistance(MDR)- gene is overexpressed. Several mdr-revertantmolecules have been synthesized, among them the patentedorganosilicon compounds (SILA-409, SILA-421) showedpromising in vitro and in vivo activities. We have investigated the combination of these compounds withvarious cytostatic drugs to achieve a better tumor-inhibitingeffect. Materials Human pancreatic cancer xenografts (PZX-40) subcutaneously growing inimmunosuppressed mice have been continuously treated with intraperitoneal administration of SILA-409 and SILA-421, together with gemcitabine, vincristine, irinotecan orpaclitaxel for a month. Tumor volumes were expression of P-170 and Ki-67 were assessedby immunohistochemistry. Results: These organosilicon compounds are not toxic in mice even at high doses (10mg/kg) and they are well tolerable drugs. Althoughgemcitabine is not a P-gp substrate, combination with theseorganosilicons resulted in a tumor growth delay, a volumereduction or volume stabilization. Growth delay was alsofound in SILA + vincristine, SILA by itself hasabolished the P-gp ex pression, but the other combination treatments all have led to significantly diminished P-170immunopositivity. The Ki-67 proliferative index wasreduced in all treated SILA-409 and SILA-421 synthetic organosilicon compounds showing anMDR-revertant activity in vitro , were also effective in in vivo experimental systems. They can be administered safely, with no side-effects. Decreased P-gp expression was alsodemonstrated in the tumors. These drugs can be effectivelycombined with cytostatics. The organosilicon compoundsare promising molecules in the oncology research. UNDERLYING and A. Telezhkina N.N.Blokhin' Cancer Research Center of RAMS, Moscow, Russia Molecular changes, during different steps of tumor progression were compared in group of tumors withdifferent morphology and level of cell differentiation. Thesignificance of individual gene alterations and certain setof molecular markers in clinical trials were evaluated invarious stages of non-small cell lung cancer in patientsradically operated in Blokhin's RCRC of RAMS in 1985-2006 (RAS gene polymorphism, deletion etc.). These results point to a subgroup of tumors with complex molecular abnormalitiesthat correlate with worst prognosis. The study focuses onthe prognosis of 120 patients with different metastaticstatus. The panel of molecular markers consisted ofdeletion in loci 1p32-36, expressions of mutant 53, BCL-2, BAX, VEGF. The simple statistical and regressive-factorial analysis of molecular markers shown in NSCLCindicated that expression of mutant 53 and VEGF,deletion in 132.1 and 136.3 and reduction of Bexpression can be reliable adverse prognostic factors forNSCLC. On the basis of the calculated values of weightfactors and clinical, morphological and molecular-biological markers, it is possible to differentiate betweenpatients with poor (less two years) and favorable prognosis(more than five years). The results allow the individual prognosis of survival rate for each patient with NSCLC. The potential clinical utilityof these findings and the possible direction for further studyare discussed. 749 CONTROVERSIES IN THE MANAGEMENT OFOV ARIAN CANCER PRO AND CONS OFINTRAPERITONEAL (IP) CHEMOTHERAPY Alain G. ZeimetDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Innsbruck Medical University, Austria Ovarian cancer generally remains confined to the abdominal cavity throughout its course. Three randomized trials haveshown superiority of intraperitoneal (IP) over conventionalintravenous (IV) chemotherapy in optimally debulkedpatients(residual disease 1 cm). Thus, in the last two yearsthe route of administration of the cytotoxic agents became a subject of major debate in the treatment of ovarian cancer.Based on the outcome of the International ConsensusMeeting on IP Chemotherapy in Ovarian Cancer held inInnsbruck in February 2006, in our institution, IPchemotherapy is routinely applied in appropriate patientsand we even extended the indications for IP chemotherapyfrom FIGO stage III to earlier stages. The two-yearsexperience of the Austrian-wide AGO observational studywill be reported. A steeply increasing learning curve inadequate catheter implantation, in the management ofcomplications with IP administration and treatment-relatedtoxicities were noticed. The most mentioned side-effectswere long lasting neurotoxicity, abdominal pain, fatigue,gastro-intestinal, metabolic toxicities and infrequentlycatheter-related complications. Apart from side-effectsrelated to the catheter, most toxicities were identified tomirror the toxicity profile of high-dose cisplatin (100mg/m 2) and were independent from the route of drug administration. Therefore the classic cisplatin/paclitaxel IP-regimen used in the GOG-172 trial was changed (d.1) andweekly paclitaxel 60 mg/m 2(d.1,8,15) In this therapeutic approach all drugs were administered viaintraperitoneal route. This treatment was by far better tolerated and qualityof life, during and after therapy, was significantly lesscompromised. However, the toxicity profile of this novelapproach was different from that observed when theincluded drugs were given intravenously. The most relevantand limiting side-effect of this IP-regimen wasmyelotoxicity with a high rate of thrombocytopenia leadingfrequently to a delay in drug administration. Furthermore,new data on cost effectiveness comparing both IP and IVchemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer will be discussedon the basis of comparable large randomized IV and IPGOG-trials. Conclusion: In cases, where optimal cytoreduction with residual disease 1 cm was achievedduring primary surgery and disease was confined to theperitoneal cavity, IP-chemotherapy should seriously be takeninto consideration even at the expense of significantlyincreased, but manageable toxicity. A more favorabletherapeutic index should be expected in IP regimens, whencisplatin is substituted by the better tolerable carboplatin. 750 ANTICANCER ACTIVITIES OF WILD ANDCULTIV ATED EDIBLE DANISH MUSHROOMS Lin Zhai 1, Ming Chen1, Henning Knudsen2, Henrik Hoff-Hansen3and Arsalan Kharazmi1 Tagensvej 20,Copenhagen, DK-2200 N; of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, 17 wild edible Danish mushrooms were collected from North Zealand, Denmark.Agaricus bisporus, Pleurotus eryngii, Pleurotus ostreatus,and other three cultivated mushrooms were purchased fromDanish supermarkets. Fresh mushrooms were dried in anatmosphere of 37C ventilation. Water extractions of thesemushrooms were made and were sterile filtered through a0.22-m-pore-size Millipore filter. The in vitro anticancer activity of the water extractions of these mushrooms have been tested against four differentcancer cell lines, K562, EL 4 (both are leukemic cell lines), MCF7(human breast cancer cell line), and PC3 (human prostate cancer cell line). A standard assay (sulforhodamine Bstaining method) for anticancer-drug screening recommendedby National Cancer Institute has been employed for the study. The results show that some mushrooms exhibit potent inhibitory activity on the in vitro growth of the four different cancer cell lines. Among the tested wild edible Danishmushrooms, C. comatus, G. frondosa , and M. giganteus, show potent in vitro anticancer activity against all four different cancer cell lines. At the concentration of 0.01 g/ml, G. frondosa and F . velutipes inhibited the in vitro growth of EL-4 cell line by 92% and 70%, respectively. A. bisporus, P . eryngii, P . ostreatus and other three cultivated edible Danish mushrooms exhibit moderate inhibitory effect on the in vitro growth of K562 and EL 4, and slight effect on PC3. However, they have no effect on the in vitro growth of MCF7. Preliminary mechanism of action study indicates that the in vitro anticancer activity of these mushrooms is probably viaapoptosis. In many parts of the world, wild mushrooms are regularly collected and used directly as a main source of food or addedto soups, stews and teas. Our data indicate that some wildedible Danish mushrooms have potent anticancer activity in vitro and there is a great potential to find new anticancer agents from these mushrooms. Recommendation of theseedible mushrooms to cancer patients as functional foodsshould be discussed. 751 INDUCTION OF MEGAKARYOCYTICDIFFERENTIATION OF CYP2E1 Weiqiang Zhao , Yan Tang, Maureen E. Baird, Gerard Lozanski and Frederick K. Racke Department of Pathology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USACytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), found predominantly in hepatic cells in xenobiotic metabolism, has beenoccasionally found to be up-regulated in other cells, includingcertain types of leukemia. In the current study, the role ofCYP2E1 in leukemic K562 cells was investigated. Over-expression of CYP2E1 reduced proliferation compared toempty vector control cells. Cell cycle analysis indicatedCYP2E1 cells produced maximum G 2/M arrest of 33% and 28% at 24 hr and 48 hr, respectively, in comparison withcontrol cells (10% and 19%, 24 and 48 hr, respectively).Growth arrest was accompanied by induction ofmegakaryocytic differentiation as evidenced by cellenlargement, polyploidization, and megakaryocytic differentiation of phorbolmyristate acetate (PMA) was accompanied by increasedexpression of CYP2E1 at both the protein and mRNA levels.Expression of BCR-ABL mRNA was not affected byoverexpression the pBCR-ABL andpSTAT5 were suppressed in CYP2E1 in overexpressorscompared to control CYP2E1 K562 was treatedwith a dual kinase inhibitor, NS187 at 1 M, a synergisticinhibitory effect on cell growth was observed at all time pointschecked from 24 to 72 hr. The mechanisms of effect of ectopicexpression of CYP2E1 in K562 cells are not understood yet;however, recent studies have shown that production of reactiveoxygen species (ROS) in normal hematopoietic progenitorspromotes megakaryocytic differentiation. Therefore, wepostulate that over-expression of CYP2E1 might increase ROSproduction and this will be tested in the future studies. Insummary, over-expression of CYP2E1 in K562erythroleukemia cells resulted in a cell growth arrest due to aG 2/M phase arrest, megakaryocytic differentiation, and a synergistic cell growth inhibition with pBCR-ABL inhibitor.The results from this study might have clinical implications.For instance, drugs that inhibit CYP2E1 activity might inhibitmegakaryocytic growth and be applied in the treatment ofmyeloproliferative disorders with abnormal megakaryocyticproliferation; in contrast, strategies to increase CYP2E1 activitymight be applied to promote thrombopoeisis in cases of theacquired thrombocytopenia. Finally, strategies to increaseCYP2E1 activity may act synergistically with bcr-abl kinaseinhibitors as novel therapy for Ph+ CUTANEOUS MALIGNANTMELANOMA M. Ziman , S. Medic, R. Slattery and R. Pearce School of Exercise, Biomedical and Health Science, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, Perth, 6027, Australia Finding sensitive markers to detect dissemination of metastatic melanoma cells is an important research focus asANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3552metastasis may be undetected clinically and recurrence can occur many years after surgery. Here we have used RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR to assess the presence of several molecular markers of circulatingmelanoma cells in peripheral blood from 200 melanomapatients and 50 healthy volunteers. The frequency and level ofexpression of markers was correlated to Breslow tumourthickness and tumour progression, and results were statisticallyanalysed. Results show that markers of circulating melanoma cells were detected in blood of 79% of melanoma patients and inonly 11% of healthy volunteers. Several markers showed ahigher detection rate overall, regardless of tumour thickness,although levels were highest in those patients with thickertumours. Notably, migrating melanoma cells were found inperipheral blood of patients with early-stage tumours and inpatients from whom tumours were removed several yearspreviously. Further research is progressing to increase thesensitivity of detection and characterise the gene expressionprofile of migrating melanoma Theodosakis, Th. Moschovos and G. Chalkiadakis Surgical Department, University of Crete Medical School, Herakleion, Crete, Greece Introduction: After completion of a trial period in which leakage control and surgical skills were assessed by Expertsin the Surgical Department, University of Crete, our teamwas accreditated the use of TNF (Beromun) in localregional treatment for inoperable or recurrent sarcomas andmelanomas of the extremities. Purpose: To depict our experience, as well as our technique with the use ofMelphalan and TNF in HILP in inoperable or recurrentsarcomas and melanomas of the extremities as performedin the Surgical Department, University of Crete between2006 and today. Patients and Methods: A total of eight cases were treated. Three sarcomas of which 1leiomysarcoma located just above the left externalmalleolus, 1 leiomysarcoma in the right tibia and the last, aliposarcoma, in the right femorus. All of the previous caseswere initially treated elsewhere and were referred to usafter recurrence. Furthermore, five intransit melanomas ofthe lower limb were treated. Chemotherapy dosages forMelphalan were calculated according to common protocol(10 mg/liter of limb volume) and TNF was 2 mg in totaldose. All patients were recovered in the ICU for 24 hours inaccordance to protocol. Results: Although statistical comparison is not applicable, we observed a notableshrinkage of the tumor and a very good partial response of the sarcomas and complete response of the melanomas. Nosystemic toxicity was observed. Limb toxicity as measuredby the Wieberdink scale was 0 in six cases and 2 in twocases. Functional disability was minimal in all cases.Conclusion: Our experience verifies that the use of Melphalan and TNF in HILP is safe when guidelines andsafety rules are followed. 754 GENE AND STEM CELL University of Ireland, Galway, and 2Regenerative Medicine Institute (REMEDI), University Road, Galway, Ireland The tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing (TRAIL) is a potent inducer of apoptosis in cancercells. We have tried several ways of delivering TRAIL totumours including adeno-associated viral (AA V) vectors.Recently we have used mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) todeliver TRAIL to sites of malignant growth. Theprerequisite for the use of MSCs is that they can withstandthe apoptosis-inducing activity of TRAIL. Indeed, we foundthat MSCs are completely resistant to the effects of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Analyses of TRAIL receptor expressionrevealed that MSCs do not have any detectable levels of thefour TRAIL-receptors on their surface. The forcedexpression of TRAIL-R1 in MSC using an adenoviralvector rendered them sensitive to TRAIL, demonstratingthat lack of TRAIL-receptor expression is the cause for Co-treatment of MSCs withTRAIL and IFN- or 5-FU showed no increase in theapoptotic response, pointing to the safety of potential futureTRAIL-based cancer therapies even in combination withother anti-tumour agents. We transduced of these TRAIL-carrying MSCs on A549 lung carcinoma cells, which arenormally resistant to the effects of recombinant TRAILprotein. We observed the same effect in various other typesof cancer cells. Apoptosis was also induced in A549 cellsby Ad.TR-transduced MSCs in the presence ofphysiological concentrations of white blood cells,erythrocytes and sera from human donors, factors that ofteninhibit conventional viral vector approaches. Moreover, wedemonstrated tumour growth reduction with TRAIL-loadedMSCs in an A549 xenograft mouse model. However,despite these encouraging results several hurdles exist forsuccessful TRAIL-based therapies. These include theAbstracts of the 8th International Conference of Anticancer Research, 17-22 October 2008, Kos, Greece 3553presence of several anti-apoptotic NF- B target genes such as XIAP , Bcl-xL, c-Flip and MnSOD in cancer cells. We found varying contributions of these factors to apoptosisresistance and we are currently trying to identify which ofthese factors are good targets for inhibitory approaches thatcould be combined with our gene-cell therapeutic tumourtargeting strategies. 755 AIR POLLUTION AND CANCER Michael Theophanides 1, Jane Anastassopoulou2 and Theo Theophanides2 1CAE, Saint Laurent, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H42 4x4; 2National Technical University of Athens, Chemical Engineering Department, Radiation Chemistry andBiospectroscopy, Zogragou Campus, 15780 Zografou,Athens, Greece Air Quality Studies are becoming an essential element of operations, since the chemical pollutants present serioushealth concerns. The existence of human, animal and plantlife on earth is dependent upon keeping the atmosphere ina reasonable state of purity. This paper presents acomparative study of mortality statistics attributed tocancer, cardiac and pulmonary diseases in the last 30 yearsin Kavala, other cities of Greece, and at the National level.The objective of this work is to demonstrate the above-average trends in mortality due to cancer, cardiac andpulmonary diseases in areas of high industrial pollutionattributed to air pollution, water pollution and foodcontamination. Statistical analysis of the data indicates thatthe prefecture of Kavala, Greece has a higher rate ofmortality (per 1000) by approximately 20% due to cancer,cardiac and pulmonary diseases compared to the Nationalaverage. There is also a trend indicating a growingdisparity of death rates between the National average andpolluted areas. Other trends will be analysed that show theincrease in the percentage of cancer-related mortalitiescompared to total mortalities in polluted areas. Forexample, in 1980, Kavala had a lower percentage (30%) ofmortalities attributed to cancer for ages less than 65 yearsold compared to the National average (36%). However, in1998, Kavala had an equal amount of percentage ofmortalities (36%) attributed to cancer compared to theNational average (28%) that the significantdecrease during 1980-1998 in cancer-related mortalities foryounger age groups represented in the National average arenot exhibited for the Kavala area. For the higher age groupof 65 to 74 years old, the results show that while theNational average has remained steady at 32%, the Kavalaaverage has increased during 1980 to 1998 from 36% to 40%.756 THE IMPORTANCE OF BIOMARKERS INPROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSTICS (A PILOT STUDY) L. Holubec , J. Klecka, Eret and M. Hora University teaching hospital, Plzen and Charles University of Plzen, E.Benese 13, 305 99, Plzen, Czech Republic Background: Early diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) in organ confined stage with following radical treatment is theonly potential currative approach in PCa. PSA is a leadingmarker in diagnosis, follow up, and therapy control. The aimof the present pilot study was to evaluate diagnostic potentialof selected biomarkers for Pca diagnostics. Materials and Methods: We examined altogether 66 patients. 27 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 9 patients withprostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and 30 patients withprostate cancer (Pca). By means of immunoanalyticalmethods and methods of multiplex analysis we patients with PCa exhibitedstatistically significant differences in the levels of PSA(0.0001), IGFBP3 (0.0027) and IGF1 (0.0148). We foundalso statistically significant differences between patients withBPH and PIN in the levels of PSA (0.0271), VEGF (0.0235)and TK (0.0426). IGFBP3 was also significantly higher inpatients with PCa in comparison to patients with PIN. Thelevels of PSA, TK and Chromogranin A correlated with stageof disease, and levels of MMP-9 correlated with Gleasonscore of prostate cancer. Conclusion: The results of the present pilot study point out that PSA is a leading biomarkerfor the diagnosis of prostate cancer. But also otherbiomarkers can improve diagnostic accuracy and prognosis.This work was supported by grant IGA NR/8918-3 and bythe Research project VZ MSM 0021620819. 757 MECHANISMS OF CHEMOTHERAPY RESISTANCEIN HEAD AND NECK CANCER Robert MandicDepartment of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, CampusMarburg, Germany Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) account for over 90% of all malignancies in the upper aero-digestive tract. Despite multimodal treatment options thatinclude surgery, radio- and chemotherapy overall survival ofHNSCC patients did not improve to a significant extentANTICANCER RESEARCH 28: 3157-3556 (2008) 3554within the past 30 years. The major cause for lack of improvement lies in the development of tumor cell resistanceto treatment by radio- and chemotherapy. Particularly afterexhausting radiotherapy, chemotherapy often remains theonly treatment option. Cisplatin is the major compound usedin HNSCC chemotherapy treatment, therefore resistance toplatinum-based compounds is of central interest. In this shortsurvey we discuss the problem of chemotherapy resistancein head and neck cancer treatment. The underlyingmechanisms conferring chemotherapy resistance to HNSCCcells such as overexpression of antiapototic proteins, p53mutations and up-regulation of efflux pumps will be pointedout. Lastly the role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in thedevelopment of tumor cell resistance will be discussed. Newtargeting strategies focusing on CSCs are an exciting newperspective for future anticancer research. 758 AN OPERATIVE GAMMA CAMERA DEDICATEDTO THE OPTIMIZATION OF SENTINELLYMPH NODE PROCEDURE IN BREAST CANCER SURGERY 1Z. de l'h\u00f4pital, StrasbourgCedex, France A close collaboration between the \"H\u00f4pitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg\" (Strasbourg, France) and the \"InstitutPluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien\" (Strasbourg, France) led tothe development of a small gamma camera covering a fieldof view of 100 \u00b0\u2014 100 mm2, dedicated for breast cancersurgery. This on-demand device is dedicated to per-operativeimaging aiming to identify and localise the Sentinel LymphNodes (SLN). Nowadays, surgeons try to use the SLNprocedure avoiding the classical axillary lymph nodedissection which causes several side effects notablylymphoedema after surgery. The procedure (used in 70% ofbreast cancer cases) consists on localising the SLN asprecisely as possible and taking them off making sure noresidual SLN remains in the axillary area. Our firstexperiment was a small field gamma camera (50 \u00b0\u2014 50mm2) built according to the dimensions of the H8500Hamamatsu's multianode photomultiplicator. Its small sizemakes it flexible and easy to use in the operating room. Itwas successfully tested on 25 patients treated for aninfiltrative breast cancer. However, despite its small practicalsize, this detector's field of view turned out to be small andsurgeons had to proceed acquiring up to 4 different images to cover the entire axillary area, which led to the idea of a 100\u00b0\u2014 100 mm2 gamma camera. This study reveals the detailsand the characteristics of our device shedding the light on itsperformances and the unique dimensions of its field of viewcovering the entire axillary area and the advantages of its useduring surgical operations. 759 MALIGNANT GROWTH IN THE BONE MARROWCREATES ABNORMAL HEMATOPOIETICPROGENITOR CELL NICHES Angela Colmone, Maria Amorim, Andrea Pontier, Sheng Wang, Elizabeth Jablonski, Dorothy A. Sipkins Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology,The Universityof Chicago, 5841 S Maryland Ave MC 2115,Chicago, IL, 60605 USA The host tissue microenvironment is known to influence malignant cell proliferation and metastasis, but little is knownabout how tumor-induced changes in the microenvironmentimpact benign cellular ecosystems. Using dynamic in vivoimaging, we show that leukemic cell growth disrupts normalhematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) sequestertransplanted HPCs. HPCs in leukemic mice decline in numberover time and fail to mobilize into the peripheral circulationin response to cytokine stimulation. Neutralization of SCFsecreted by leukemic cells inhibits HPC migration intomalignant niches, normalizes HPC numbers, and restores HPCmobilization in leukemic mice. Our data provide evidencethat the tumor microenvironment can cause HPC dysfunctionby usurping normal HPC niches, and that inhibiting HPCinteraction with tumor niches may maintain normal progenitorcell function in the setting of malignancy. 760 EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSFORMATIONIN SOLID TUMORS WITH EMPHASIS ON HEADAND NECK SQUAMOUS CARCINOGENESIS Adel K.
