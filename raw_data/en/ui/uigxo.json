I saw a video on YouTube I'll link it at the bottom. But it was about a dude doing on a dopamine detox. I am addicted to social media, weed, and frankly I always need some audio or visual stimulation. I like the idea of taking control of my own life. I feel better after meditation but I fall back into these patterns. Basically what I am asking, has anyone else done this? How did it make you feel? Was it hard? And did it even work? Let me know if you've tried this. "}
