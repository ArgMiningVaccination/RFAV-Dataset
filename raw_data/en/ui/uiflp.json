From focusing on your overall well-being to addressing a specific condition, naturopathic medicine can put you on a New Year's path to health and well-being. But do you know the difference between a naturopathic doctor and a naturopath? California's naturopathic doctors (N.D.) are licensed and regulated by the Department of Consumer Affairs' Naturopathic Medicine Committee. N.D.s can serve as primary care doctors, while naturopaths cannot. And you know N.D.s must complete training like medical or osteopathic doctors during their first two years of school? Additionally, all N.D.s must complete studies in holistic approaches. California N.D. licensure requirements include: - Four years of graduate-level naturopathic medical education. - Three years of undergraduate premedical studies. - Passing the National Naturopathic Physician Licensing Examination. Naturopaths are unlicensed and are not required to complete the same education and training as licensed N.D.s. While naturopaths can serve as health and wellness coaches, they cannot diagnose people. Therefore, they are required by law to disclose to clients in writing that they are providing unlicensed healing arts services per California Business and Professions Code section 2053.6. If you are looking for a licensed naturopathic doctor during the New Year or all year long, or just want to learn more information about naturopathic medicine, visit the Naturopathic Medicine Committee's [website](https://www.naturopathic.ca.gov/).
