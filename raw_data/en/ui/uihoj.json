At the sametime, a comprehensive understanding of critical factors that can accurately predict the outcome of vaccination is sorely needed in order to improve the effectiveness of influenza virus vaccines. Will new studies aimed at identifying adaptations required for virus transmissibility and systems-level analyses of influenza virus vaccine responses provide an improved framework for predictive models of viral adaptation and vaccine efcacy? Introduction The development of effective vaccines has altered the course of modern civiliza- tion by alleviating the scourges ofhumankind's most devastating patho- fever fever), Borde- tella pertussis (whooping cough), polio vi- rus (polio), and measles virus (measles)have become as foreign to our youngest generations as telegrams and type- writers. Indeed, the success of vaccinesto date is truly remarkable when con- sidered in light of the rudimentary principles that guided their historicaldesign ( Stern and Markel, 2005 ). Ironi- the modernera ''rationale vaccine design'' havebeen few and far between. such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis), Plasmodium spp. (causa- tive agents of malaria), human immuno- deciency virus (HIV), and influenza A virus (IAV) continue to elude broad and highly efcacious vaccine-mediatedprotection, exerting devastating human and economic tolls. The factors that have limited the successful design ofvaccines against these pathogens are complex. However, two prominent barriers stand out: (1) highly mutable/adaptable pathogens such as HIV andIAV evolve under immunological pres-sure to evade the pre-existing immunityafforded by vaccines. This has necessi- tated painstaking efforts to identify and target conserved epitopes of these vi-ruses ( Julien et al., 2012 ). (2) There is an astonishing paucity of robust, predic-tive immunological markers of vaccineefcacy. This, in turn, has precluded a comprehensive, mechanistic under- standing of what differentiates success-ful vaccines from those that fail. Therecognition of these challenges has ignited ambitious efforts to predict more accurately the behavior of the aforemen-tioned pathogens and the vaccines de- signed to protect against them. Here, we review recent advances within theeld of influenza virus research that are attempting to provide a more predictive basis for assessing the consequencesof viral adaptations and the efcacy of vaccines, and we highlight the scientic and regulatory boundaries that must beovercome to achieve these goals. Twonew studies focused on these important topics appear in this issue of Cell. Linster, van Boheemen, and colleagues (Linster et al., 2014 ) dene a minimal set of mutations (and their associatedphenotypes) that confer H5N1 viruseswith the propensity to transmit in ferrets, and Tsang and colleagues ( Tsang et al., 2014 ) use a systems biology approach to identify baseline immunological pre- dictors of vaccine responses.''Follow the Leader''The most challenging issue facing IAV vaccinologists has always been the ne- cessity to predict the antigenic character-istics of vaccine strains months in advance of the actual influenza season in order to allow sufcient time for vaccineproduction and distribution. This can be equated to a game of virological ''follow the leader,'' wherein the medical andscientic communities are constantlychasing the unpredictable evolutionary trajectory of the virus. As a consequence of this guesswork, antigenic mismatchbetween strains included in the vaccine and the strains that eventually circulate is a regular occurrence. This can severelylimit the effectiveness of a given vaccine. Of equal concern though is the sub- optimal vaccine efcacy reported evenduring seasons in which near-perfect matches are achieved. Adding to this complexity are the vastly different quali-ties of responses elicited by the availableinfluenza vaccine formulations, most notably those observed for inactivated, split vaccines in comparison to liveattenuated vaccines ( Osterholm et al., 2012 ). Recognition of the limitations that plague our current seasonal influenzavirus vaccine approaches has catalyzed renewed efforts to understand and iden- tify factors that may more accuratelypredict vaccine responses. Nevertheless,all of these issues pale in comparison to 294 Cell157, April 10, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Inc. brought to you by CORE View metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk provided by Elsevier - Publisher Connector the ever-present threat of a new and un- expected IAV pandemic. This has led to a redoubling of efforts to both detectand assess the risks associated with iso- lated epidemics caused by ''exotic'' of the ''swine-origin'' H1N1 IAV strain in 2009 that swept throughMexico and went on to cause the rst pandemic of the 21st century served as a direct example of the inherent limita-tions precluding the accurate prediction of IAV dynamics ( Girard et al., 2010 ). Never before had an IAV pandemic been caused by a virus carrying the same hem- agglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes as one of the circulating sea-sonal strains. This served as an impetusto not only bolster surveillance efforts, but to also more thoroughly understand viral molecular determinants of virulenceand transmission. Despite the fact that at least 18 sub- types of IAV hemagglutinin (HA, H) and11 subtypes of neuraminidase (NA, N) have so far been identied ( Tong et al., 2013 ), only IAVs carrying H1, H2, or H3 and N1 or N2 have proven capable of sustaining transmission among humans and of causing pandemics. However, iso- lated outbreaks caused by other subtypesof IAV occur sporadically, igniting fears that a new pandemic may arise. Notable modern examples of such outbreakshave been those caused by H5N1 IAV in (primarly) Southeast Asia and a recentflurry of human cases caused by H7N9IAV in China. Both of these viruses are of avian origin and are mainly transmittedto humans through exposure to high titers of virus from infected poultry ( To et al., 2013 ). The recent threat of a potentially devas- tating H5N1 pandemic prompted the NIHto fund a series of proposals aimed at identifying viral molecular determinantsthat might indicate adaptations that would confer the ability to transmit efciently be- tween mammals. This work, carried outby the groups of Yoshiro Kawaoka at The University of Wisconsin, Madison/ University of Tokyo, Japan and RonFouchier at Erasmus University Rotter-dam was rst published in the journals Nature and Science in May and June of 2012, respectively ( Herfst et al., 2012; Imai et al., 2012 ). The Kawaoka group used an unbiased genetic approach to generate a library of viruses containingmutations in the globular head domain of the HA from the A/Vietnam/1203/ 2004 H5N1 isolate in a nonpathogenic,mouse-adapted IAV background (PR8). Despite having been derived from a virus isolated from a human, this HA maintainsan avian-like preference for binding toa2,3-linked sialic acids (Sia a2,3Gal), whereas IAVs that circulate in humanstypically exhibit a preference for a2,6- linked sialic acids (Sia a2,6Gal). The authors identied a virus containing HAmutations E119G/V152I/N224K/Q226Lthat exhibited a receptor-binding prole resembling that of a seasonal human IAVisolate. Further analysis demonstratedthat the N224K/Q226L mutations alone were primarily responsible for the switchfrom Sia a2,3Gal to Sia a2,6Gal binding (Imai et al., 2012 ). The H5 HA mutations that conferred altered receptor binding characteristicswere then rescued in the pandemic A/California/04/2009 (Cal/09) H1N1 virus background to assess how a recombi-nant of an avian H5N1 virus with the circulating Cal/09 H1N1 virus might behave. This strategy closely resemblesprevious studies performed by the Perez lab in the context of H9N2 IAV ( Kimble et al., 2011 ). Despite causing a switch to human-like receptor binding, both E119G/V152I/N224K/Q226L and N224K/ Q226L mutations tended to attenuate virus replication in the respiratory tractof ferrets. However, a secondary N158D or N158K mutation (which abolishes a glycosylation site at position 158)that appeared in animals inoculated with the N224K/Q226L variant improved virus replication in the upper respiratorytract. The combination of N158D/N224K/ Q226L mutations conferred the ability to transmit between ferrets via respiratory droplets. A fourth mutation, which occurred naturally during the transmis- sion experiment (T318I), enhanced thestability of the HA molecule and furtherenhanced transmission ( Imai et al., 2012 ). The Fouchier group used a similar but more classical virological approach toforce adaptation of the A/Indonesia/5/ 2005 strain of H5N1 for the mammalian Figure 1. Predictive Factors of Influenza Virus Transmission A number of adaptations (shown in blue) in H5N1 IAV were observed to confer the ability to transmit from ferret to ferret. This gain of function in transmission was accompanied by a loss of function in virulence. Predicting the pandemic risk associated with future outbreaks caused by novel IAV strains in humans will require a comprehensive understanding of which strains are capable of zoonotic transmission, the adaptations required for sustained human-to-human transmission, and the consequences of those adaptations on properties such as virulence and tness.

Both wild-type A/ Indonesia/5/2005 and a ''pre-adapted'' recombinant virus containing a series of introduced mutations (HA Q222L/G224S is involved with switching receptor binding preference from Sia a2,3Gal to Siaa2,6Gal; PB2 E627K is related to a temperature adaptation that facilitates replication in the human upper respiratory tract) were serially passaged ten times in ferrets. Replication of the pre-adaptedvirus improved with passaging, while replication of the wild-type virus remained unchanged. The only mutation commonamong the wild-type and pre-adapted viruses after passaging was HA T156A. Strikingly, this mutation, like the N158D/K mutation observed by the Kawaokagroup, abolished a putative N-linked glycosylation site. The passage 10 virus populations derived from animals inocu-lated with the pre-adapted virus were also capable of airborne transmission between ferrets, whereas the wild-typevirus was not. All animals from which transmitted virus was recovered main- tained the mutations introduced duringpre-adaptation and also consistently harbored two novel amino acid sub- stitutions in HA, H103Y (located at thetrimer interface) and T156A (locatedproximal to the receptor binding site). However, the lowest number of sub- stitutions relative to wild-type to uncertainty regarding the minimal set of substitutions necessary to confertransmissibility ( Herfst et al., 2012 ). In this issue of Cell, Linster, van Bohee- men, et al. expand upon this earlierwork by elucidating the minimal setof substitutions required for airborne of A/Indonesia/5/2005 H5N1 among ferrets and by describingthe phenotypes associated with each change. In addition to the PB2-E627K, HA-Q222L/G224S, and HA-T156A substi-tutions described above, the authors found that HA-H103Y (stabilized HA with respect to high temperature and low pH)and PB1-H99Y (increased polymeraseactivity) constituted the minimal set of mutations required to transmit virus among ferrets ( Linster et al., 2014 ). Criti- cally, this type of analysis provides amore complete picture of the phenotypicproperties of changes that may constitute increased risk of H5N1 transmissibility (Figure 1 ). Taken together, these results sug- that a re-assortant virus carryingthe HA of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1and the remaining segments of A/California/04/2009 H1N1 would require as few as four amino acid substitutions in the HA molecule to become transmis-sible in mammals, whereas wild-type A/Indonesia/5/2005 H5N1 might require only ve mutations (three in HA, one inPB1, and one in PB2) ( Herfst et al., 2012; Imai et al., 2012 A meta-analysis of avail- able H5N1 surveillance data revealedthat, although many of the substitutionsfound to confer transmissibility among ferrets are rare in nature, HA substitutions N154D and T156A, which destroy anN-linked glycosylation site, and the PB2 E627K temperature adaptation are much more common and regularly occurtogether. Various mathematical models were developed to predict the probability that these substitutions would arisetogether during a natural infection and concluded that such a scenario was indeed probable. However, the proportionof viruses carrying the transmissiblegenotype as a function of the total virus population within a single host was extremely low, which would likely presenta formidable barrier to efcient trans- mission ( Russell et al., 2012 ). Though these studies have undoubt- edly enhanced our understanding ofIAV transmissibility, their interpretability is constrained by several scientic andregulatory boundaries. Let us focus rston some crucial scientic considerations. The process of viral adaptation (particu- larly via serial passaging in a new host)has historically been exploited to achieve attenuation of strains to be used for vaccine formulation. This concept relieson the biological principle that the adap- tation of new traits (i.e., transmissibility) is frequently accompanied by a lossof other traits for which there is less selective pressure (i.e., host range and/ or virulence). Indeed, the Fouchiergroup observed that, although ferretssuccumbed to intranasal inoculation with wild-type H5N1 at a dose of 1 310 6 TCID, the majority of the animals infected with the transmissible virus survived(Herfst et al., 2012 ). This clearly demon- strates that the gain of function (GOF) with regard to transmissibility was accompanied by a loss of function with re-gard to virulence. Thus, assessment of how adaptations in ferrets affect viral tness, virulence, and transmission (bothin birds and other mammalian species) issorely needed to gain a truly holistic perspective of the likelihood that these viruses might cause a pandemic andwhat characteristics such a pandemic might exhibit. Indeed, studies in mice (Zaraket et al., 2013 ) have clearly demon- strated that the H5N1 adaptations that increase tness in mammals (HA-K582I) have severe consequences on viraltness in waterfowl, and studies in guineapigs (a favored model for the study of IAV transmission) have also revealed striking differences in the phenotypesassociated with H5N1 infections when compared to mice ( Gao et al., 2009 ). This brings us to the issue of regulatory constraints. Understanding how factorssuch as virulence, transmissibility, and viral tness interconnect will requireGOF experiments, the use of which has recently been the cause of extensive con- troversy under the new ''dual-useresearch of concern (DURC)'' guidelines(Wolinetz, 2012 ). GOF experiments are (and have always been) a fundamentalpillar of scientic inquiry and are essentialto the rigorous execution of the scientic method. Indeed, the sensationalization and reactionary blow-back sparked bythe original H5N1 transmission studies stem largely from scientic ignorance with regard to how transmission, viru-lence, and tness interrelate. Ironically,the only way to address this uncertainty is to move forward with GOF studies that will serve to contextualize how adap-tations that mediate mammalian trans- missibility affect other properties of the virus (such as the dramatic reductionin virulence observed by the Fouchier group, for example). These studies would serve to demystify the risks andconsequences of viral adaptations that lead to mammalian transmissibility and should therefore not be restricted.Certainly, any future hopes for developinga predictive model for pandemic risk assessment will rely on understanding the sum of these properties. It is importantto consider that, in the context GOF 296 Cell157, April 10, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Inc.experiments related to H5N1 transmission, studies are already being performed in stringently regulated bio-safety level 3 (BSL3) facilities by highly skilled individuals. This is a responsible, pre-cautionary approach thatensures the safety of both the scientists performing the studies, and the generalpublic. Vexing Vaccines The uncertain principles that determine the pandemic risk of IAV strains are mirrored bysimilar uncertainties regard- ing the predictability of vac- cine responses designed toprevent IAV infections. A mechanistic understanding of the genetic and environ-mental factors that account for the heterogeneous nature of individual responses to thesame vaccine has long eludedresearchers, which in turn has caused vaccine efcacy to suffer. Though this problem is not uniqueto IAV vaccines, it is additionally compli- cated by the distinctive qualities of re- sponses elicited by each vaccine formula-tion (for example: split, inactivated versus live-attenuated). Therefore, the identica- tion of predictive markers of vaccine ef-cacy is a pressing need. This type of infor- mation would not only aide in enhancing the efcacy of current vaccines throughmore personalized approaches but wouldalso provide a rational basis for the re- sponses required during development of next-generation vaccines. Targeted, conventional approaches have had limited success in capturingtruly predictive markers that determinethe outcome of vaccination. However, recent advances in systems biology offer the opportunity to undertake muchmore powerful multifactorial analyses.These efforts are beginning to yield tremendous amounts of data regarding the complex orchestration of factors thatgovern the host response to vaccines, some of which may have predictive value with respect to vaccine efcacy.The seminal study that substantiated the utility of the systems biology approachto evaluate vaccine responses was pub- lished in 2009 and explored the response of humans to the highly effective yellow fever virus YF-17D vaccine ( Querec et al., 2009 ). In this issue of Cell, Tsang and colleagues ( Tsang et al., 2014 ) describe, for the rst time, a set of baseline pre-vaccination parameters that were foundto be predictive of postvaccination antibody responses ( Figure 2 ). The chal- lenge moving forward will be to distill the vast quantities of information obtained through these studies in order to assign biological signicance to the observedtrends. Indeed, the fusion of systems- level approaches with classical reduc- tionist methods holds the promiseof revolutionizing the rational design of vaccines. One of the earliest systems biology studies of influenza virus vaccine re- sponses focused on transcriptional analyses of peripheral blood mono- nuclear cells (PBMCs) derived fromadult males who received the trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (TIV) (Bucasas et al., 2011 ). Genes upregulated at early time points postvaccination were largely involved in interferon (IFN)signaling and antigen pro- cessing/presentation, whereas genes upregulated later in the response weremore likely to be asso- 24 group, whereas E2F2 was downregulated postvaccination, most promi- nently day group. the high and re-sponders ( Bucasas et al., 2011 )(Figure 2 ). These results demonstrated the potentialpower of systems biology ap- proaches but also highlighted the need for even greaterlevels of resolution. For which cell types within the PBMC population do these markers primarily apply? What mechanisms are respon-sible for the observed outcomes? Are these responses specic to TIV, or do they apply more generally to other routes ofvaccination? Elegant work by the Pulendran lab addressed many of these issues byanalyzing the immune response to both TIV and live-attenuated influenza virus vaccine (LAIV) in healthy adults overthree consecutive seasons ( Nakaya et al., 2011 ). Consistent with previous studies (Sasaki et al., 2007 ), the authors found that vaccination with TIV elicited theexpansion of IgG-secreting plasmablasts LAIV. The PBMC transcriptional sig-natures associated with each vaccine were also unique. The authors observed marked transcriptional changes in genesrelated to innate immunity, a trend con- sistently observed upon transcriptional analyses of influenza virus vaccinees.More recent work has demonstratedthat neutrophils and monocytes are primarily responsible for contributing to this early IFN-related gene signature(Obermoser et al., 2013 ). Upregulation Figure 2. Predictive Factors of Influenza Virus Vaccine Efcacy Systems biology has facilitated the identication of pre- and postvaccination correlates of efcacy (examples of positive correlates shown in green; negative correlates, red). Elucidation of the mechanistic properties of these markers will allow for personalized approaches that maximize vaccine effectiveness and will guide the development of next-generation vaccines. Cell157, April 10, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Inc. 297of genes involved in the type I IFN pathway were especially pronounced for individuals who received LAIV, likely a reflection of its replicative capacity. Inter-estingly, whereas transcriptional changes associated with B cells correlated posi- tively with antibody titers, T-cell-asso-ciated signatures exhibited a negativecorrelation with the antibody response. Using discriminant analysis via mixed integer proling (DAMIP), the authorswere able to identify and validate a mini- mal gene signature capable of accurately predicting the antibody responses to TIV.Critically, to conrm the utility of their analyses, the authors selected one of the markers identied in the DAMIPanalysis (calcium/calmodulin-dependentprotein kinase IV [ CamkIV ]) for functional validation. CamKIV expression at day 3 post-TIV vaccination negatively corre-lated with the magnitude of the anti- body response ( Figure 2 ). Vaccination ofCamKIV /C0//C0mice with TIV recapitulated this effect, inducing higher antibody titersthan in control mice ( Nakaya et al., 2011 ). The biological signatures identied in these and other studies have sig-nicantly advanced our understanding of the specic responses elicited byvarious vaccines. They have also facili-tated the of postvaccina- tion markers, ),CamkIV (Nakaya et al., 2011 ), and CD4+ T cell levels (Nayak et al., 2013; Spensieri et al., 2013 ), which can accurately predict the magnitude of the antibody responseelicited by influenza virus vaccination (Figure 2 ). However, the ability to predict the outcome of vaccination based onbaseline immunological markers has remained elusive. Tsang and colleagues provide a rst glimpse of the potentialfor systems biology to address this problem. In agreement with the work described above ( Bucasas et al., 2011; Nakaya PBMC gene ex- pression proles were characterized by strong enrichment of IFN-related gene expression at day 1 postvaccination, which then shifted to adaptive pathwaysassociated with antibody productionby day 7. These results correlated well with changes adaptive cell types, includ- ing plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and T cells, were representative of the day 7response. Interestingly, high baseline antibody titers were found to be inversely corre-lated with the postvaccination response.Baseline gene expression and pathway activity were not robust predictors of postvaccination response; however,several pre-vaccination B and T cell subpopulations were found to predict endpoint antibody responses. Naive,transitional, and memory B cell popula- tions were all positively correlated with antibody effectormemory CD4+ T cell and perforin+ CD8+T cell populations exhibited a negative correlation ( Figure 2 ). Retrospective analyses using these predictive cell populations could then be used to assign functional signicance to the gene expression signatures observed fromwhole PBMCs. It should be noted that the baseline state of antibody titers and cellular composition of PBMCs amongindividuals is likely to reflect age, at least to some extent. Thus, the strength with which these predictors apply to individ-uals in different age categories remainsto be determined. Looking into the Future Experimental assessment of the adap- tions required for IAV transmissionamong mammals and the consequences of these adaptations on other properties of the virus (especially virulence andtness) promise to provide a more robustframework for assessing the pandemic risk of novel IAV strains ( Linster et al., 2014 ). However, this goal will require a regulatory environment that dissolvesthe unnecessary barriers that hinder much-needed progress while maintaininga reasonable level of oversight that en- courages public trust. In the meantime, the use of systems biology techniques(Tsang et al., 2014 ) to assemble a more comprehensive picture of the factors that govern the immune response to vaccination should serve as a guide forthe design of more efcacious vaccines. Identifying predictive postvaccination markers of efcacy will inform thedevelopment of novel adjuvants ( Kasturi et stimulate pathwaysrequired for optimal responses, whilebaseline predictors can be exploited to assess optimal vaccine routes/formula- tions on an individual basis. Coupled withambitious ongoing efforts to elicit more broadly protective responses against influenza viruses ( Krammer and Palese, 2014 ), the hope for an effective ''univer- sal'' influenza virus vaccine may soon be realized.
