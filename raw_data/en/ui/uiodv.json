Now, many types of SEMs are being used, and their performance and functionsare greatly different from each other. To utilize these different SEMs, it is essential to recognize their features,as well as to understand the reasons for the contrast of SEM images. Thus, this document material is aimed athelping SEM users and future SEM users to understand the basics of the SEM, including the instrument princi-ples, specimen preparation and elemental analysis. 2Construction of SEM ..................................................................................................3 Construction of Instrument Electron GunConstruction of LensCondenser Lens and Objective LensSpecimen StageSecondary Electron DetectorImage Display and RecordingVacuum System Magnification of SEM ................................................................................................7 Depth of Focus of SEM ..............................................................................................8 Why Images Are Visible? ..........................................................................................9 Interactions of Electrons with Substances Secondary ElectronsBackscattered ElectronsEdge EffectInfluence of Accelerating VoltageIllumination Effect of Secondary Electron DetectorIllumination Effect of Backscattered Electron Detector To Improve Image Resolution ................................................................................15 Resolution and Resolving Power To Improve Resolution Types of Electron Guns ............................................................................................16 Filed-Emission Electron Gun Schottky-Emission Electron GunFeatures of Three Types of Electron Guns Types and Capabilities of Objective Lenses .......................................................18 Conventional Objective Lens Strongly Excited Objective Lens for High ResolutionRole of Objective Lens Aperture Actual Resolution of SEM .......................................................................................20 Charging and Its Influence .....................................................................................21 What is Charging?

When the specimen is irradiated with a fine electron beam (called an electron probe), secondary electrons are emitted from the specimen surface. Topography of the sur - face can be observed by two-dimensional scanning of the electron probe over the surface and acquisition of an image from thedetected secondary electrons. Electron gun Condenser lens Scanning coil SpecimenDisplay unit Objective lens Secondary electron detectorObjective lens Secondary electron detectorConstruction of SEM Construction of Instrument The SEM requires an electron optical system to produce an electron probe, a specimen stage to place the speci-men, a secondary-electron detector to collect secondaryelectrons, an image display unit, and an operation systemto perform various operations (Fig. 1). The electron opti-cal system consists of an electron gun, a condenser lensand an objective lens to produce an electron probe, ascanning coil to scan the electron probe, and other com-ponents. The electron optical system (inside of the microscope column) and a space surrounding the specimen are keptat vacuum. Fig. 1 Basic construction of a SEM. Electron Gun The electron gun produces an electron beam. Its con- struction is shown in Fig. 2. Note that this is a thermionicemission gun (TE gun). Thermoelectrons are emitted froma filament (cathode) made of a thin tungsten wire (about0.1 mm) by heating the filament at high temperature(about 2800K). These thermoelectrons are gathered as anelectron beam, flowing into the metal plate (anode) byapplying a positive voltage (1 to 30 kV) to the anode. If ahole is made at the center of the anode, the electronbeam flows through this hole. When you place an elec-trode (called a Wehnelt electrode) between the cathodeand anode and apply a negative voltage to it, you canadjust the current of the electron beam. At this time, theelectron beam is finely focused by the action of theWehnelt electrode. The finest point of the beam is calledthe crossover, and this is regarded as an actual electronsource with a diameter of 15 to 20 \u00b5m. The TE gun, explained here, is most generally used. An LaB 6single crystal is also used as a cathode, but it requires a higher vacuum because of its high activity. Other electron guns are the field-emission electron gun(FE gun) or the Schottky-emission electron gun (SE gun)(see page 16). Fig. 2 Construction of an electron gun.Filament heating power supply Filament Wehnelt electrodeBias power supply PolepiecesOptical axisConstruction of Lens An electron microscope generally uses a magnetic lens. When you pass a direct electric current through a coil- wound electric wire, a rotationally-symmetric magneticfield is formed and a lens action is produced on an elec-tron beam. To make a strong magnetic lens (with a shortfocal length), it is necessary to increase the density of themagnetic line. Thus, as shown in Fig. 3, the surroundingsof the coil are enclosed by yokes so that part of the mag-netic field leaks from a narrow gap. A portion with a nar-row gap, called \"polepiece,\" is fabricated with a highaccuracy. The main feature of the magnetic lens is thatwhen you change the current passing through the coil,the strength of the lens is also changed. This is notachieved by an optical lens. Fig. 3 Construction of a magnetic lens. Condenser Lens and Objective Lens Placing a lens below the electron gun enables you to adjust the diameter of the electron beam. A fine electron beam (probe) is required for the SEM. Figure 4 illustrates the formation of a fine electron probe.Two-stage lenses, which combine the condenser andobjective lenses, are located below the electron gun. Theelectron beam from the electron gun is focused by thetwo-stage lenses, and a small electron probe is pro-duced. Fig. 4 Formation of the electron probe by the lenses. Role of the condenser lens If the lens action of the condenser lens is strengthened, the electron probe becomes narrower with a smaller ratio of b/a, wher e- as if weakened, the electron probe becomes broader. The \"aperture\" is placed between the condenser lens and objective lens.The \"aperture,\" made of a thin metal plate, has a small hole. The electron beam, which passed through the condenser lens, illlu mi- nates this aperture-plate. The aperture allows a part of the electron beam to reach the objective lens. If the excitation of th e con- denser lens is increased, the electron beam greatly broadens on the aperture and therefore, the number of the electrons (amountof probe current) reaching the objective lens is decreased. To the contrary, if the excitation of the condenser lens is decreas ed, the electron beam does not broaden very much and therefore, most of the electrons pass through the aperture and many electronsreach the objective lens. That is, the adjustment of the excitation of the condenser lens enables you to change the electron-pr obe diameter and the probe current. However, even if the excitation of the condenser lens is infinitely increased, the diameter of the electron probe does not beco me infinitely small. This topic will be explained on page 15.5Role of the objective lens The objective lens is used for focusing, and this lens is a very important lens that determines the final diameter of the elect ron probe. If the performance of the objective lens is not good, an optimally-fine electron probe cannot be produced despite all of the efforts before the action of the objective lens. Thus, it is crucial to make the objective lens with the best performance. Specimen Stage In general, the specimen is observed at a high magnification in an electron microscope. Thus, a specimen stage, which stably supports the specimen and moves smoothly, is required. The specimen stage for a SEM can perform the following movements:horizontal movement (X, Y), vertical movement (Z), specimen tilting (T), and rotation (R). The X and Y movements are used for t he selection of a field of view. While the Z movement provides the change of image resolution (see page 15) and the depth of focus(see page 8). Figure 5 shows the construction of the specimen stage. Most SEMs use the eucentric specimen stage. By the use of this stage, the observation area does not shift while tilting the spe ci- men and also, the focus on the specimen does not change after shifting the field of view while the specimen is tilted. In addition to a conventional manual-drive stage, the use of motor-drive stages has increased in recent years. Furthermore, the use of a computer-controlled specimen stage has been increasing. With this stage, you can move the stage to a selected point bysimply clicking a mouse, restore the stage to a desired observed point, and use more sophisticated eucentric capabilities.Electron probe Rotation (R) Vertical (Z) Horizontal plane (X) Tilt (T)Horizontal plane (Y) Fig. 5 Construction of the specimen stage.6Secondary Electron Detector The secondary electron detector is used for detecting the secondary electrons emitted from the specimen. Its construction is shown in Fig. 6. A scintillator (fluorescent substance) is coated on the tip of the detector and a high voltage of about 10 kV is applied to it. The secondary electrons from the specimen are attracted to this high voltage and then generate light when they h it the scintillator. This light is directed to a photo-multiplier tube (PMT) through a light guide. Then, the light is converted t o electrons, and these electrons are amplified as an electric signal. A supplementary electrode, called the collector, is placed before the scin- tillator. In general, in order to help the scintillator acquire secondary electrons, a few hundred volts is applied to this col lector. By changing this voltage, you can control the number of secondary electrons to be collected. This type of the detector was origina lly developed by Everhart and Thornley, so this detector can be called the E-T detector. Many SEMs incorporate this detector in thespecimen chamber; however, when a SEM is equipped with a strongly excited objective lens for higher resolution (see page 19), asecondary electron detector is placed above the objective lens and secondary electrons are detected by utilizing the lens magne t- ic fields. This detector is often called the TTL (Through The Lens) detector. Image Display and Recording The output signals from the secondary electron detector are amplified and then transferred to the display unit. Since the scann ing on the display unit is synchronized with the electron-probe scan, brightness variation, which depends on the number of the sec-ondary electrons, appears on the monitor screen on the display unit, thus forming a SEM image. A cathode-ray tube (CRT) wasused for many years as a display unit; however in recent years, a liquid-crystal display (LCD) has been widely used. In general , the scan speed of the electron probe can be changed in several steps, An extremely fast scan speed is used for observation and aslow scan speed is used for acquisition or saving of images. To record an SEM image, in the past, the SEM image appearing on the CRT was photographed with a camera. But recently, the image has been recorded in a digital format (electronic file). This is because it is now difficult to get a high-resolution CRT and there are many advantages of electronic file. That is, it is easier to process images and convenient to send or receive image i nfor- mation. Note that an image format with 1M pixels is generally used for the electronic file. Vacuum System The inside of the electron optical system and the specimen chamber must be kept at a high vacuum of 10-3to 10-4Pa. Thus, these components are evacuated generally by a diffusion pump. If a user desires an oil-free environment, a turbo molecular pump maybe used. When a SEM incorporates an FE gun (explained later), a sputter ion pump is used because the FE gun needs an ultrahighvacuum. To exchange a specimen, either of two methods is applied. One vents the entire specimen chamber at the time of specimen exchange. The other uses a specimen pre-evacuation chamber (airlock chamber) while keeping a high vacuum in the specimenchamber.Fig. 6 Construction of the secondary electron detector.7SpecimenElectron probe Display unit Magnification M=D/dMagnification of SEM When the specimen surface is two-dimensionally scanned by the electron probe, a SEM image appears on the monitor screen of the display unit. At this time, if the scan width of the electron probe is changed, the magnification of the displayed SEM imag e is also changed. Since the size of the monitor screen is unchanged, decreasing the scan width increases the magnification, whereasincreasing the scan width decreases the magnification. Figure 7 shows this principle. For example, when the size of the monitor screen is 10 cm and the scan width of the electron probe is 1 mm, the magnification i s 100 times, whereas the scan width is 10 \u00b5m, 10,000 times. In terms of historical background, the magnification is expressed for a screen of 12 cm (horizontal) and 10 cm (vertical) as the standard (slightly different depending on a SEM manufacturer). If a di splay unit has a larger monitor screen compared to the standard size, the magnification of the displayed SEM image becomes larger. Insuch a case, the magnification and the size of an object is calculated with a scale bar displayed on the screen as a reference. Fig. 7 Concept of SEM magnification.8Objective lens Aperture: small Aperture angle: large Aperture large Depth of focus: smallBlur BlurAperture: large Depth of Focus of SEM In the observation of a specimen with a substantial depth, if the focus is adjusted to the top side, the bottom side may be out of focus. In such a case, if the range between upper and lower image blur is large, it is said that \"the depth of focus is large.\"Whereas if the range between upper and lower image blur is small, it is said that \"the depth of focus is small.\" As shown in Fi g. 8, when the electron probe is considerably parallel (aperture angle is small), the image stays in focus even if the focus is chang ed by a large amount. Whereas when the electron probe is substantially angular (aperture angle is large), the image goes out of focuseven if the focus is only slightly changed. In the case of an optical microscope (OM) where the probe scanning is not used forimaging, when the angle subtended by the objective lens from the specimen (aperture angle) is small, the depth of focus is larg e. Whereas when this angle is large, the depth of focus is small. Note that even when the image is blurred, this cannot be seen at a low magnification. However, when the magnification is increased, the image blur is found to appear. That is, the depth of focus is changed also by the magnification. Figure 9 is a graph that shows a difference of the depth of focus between the SEM and OM. Although a stereoscopic microscope provides an image with a relatively large depth of focus between OMs, you can obtain a much larger depth of focus with the SEM.This is because the aperture angle of the electron probe in the SEM is much smaller than that of the objective lens in the OM. Note that the depth of focus for the SEM is different depending on the observation conditions. Figure 10 compares the OM and SEM images of a fractured surface of a screw. This fractured surface has large irregularity, lead - ing to a fact that only a small part of the surface is actually focused with the OM. But, due to the large depth of focus of th e SEM, the entire observed surface is in sharp focus.Fig. 8 Relation between the aperture angle of the electron probe and the depth of focus.Fig. 9 Difference of the depth of focus between SEM and optical micro- scope. OM image SEM image Fig. 10 OM image and SEM image of the same field of view.9Why Images Are Visible? Since the SEM image appears as if you observe an object with the naked eye, you may intuitively understand the features of the object. However, the SEM image often produces a contrast that is difficult to explain. To fully understand the contrast of the SEM image, you must understand the principle of the formation of the SEM image. Interactions of Electrons with Specimens When electrons enter the specimen, the electrons are scattered within the specimen and gradually lose theirenergy, then they are absorbed in the specimen. Thisbehavior is shown in Fig. 11. The scattering range of theelectrons inside the specimen is different depending onthe electron energy, the atomic number of the elementsmaking up the specimen and the density of the con-stituent atoms. As the energy is higher, the scatteringrange is larger. To the contrary, if the atomic number anddensity are large, the scattering range is smaller. TheMonte Carlo simulation enables us to understand thesephenomena. Fig. 11 Monte Carlo simulation showing the scattering behavior of electrons with- in the specimen. Fig. 12 Emission of various electrons and electromagnetic waves from the speci- men.Incident electron electronsBackscattered electronsFigure 12 is a schematic diagram that illustrates various signals emitted from the specimen when the incidentelectron beam enters the specimen. The SEM utilizesthese signals to observe and analyze the specimen sur-face (or just beneath the surface). The SEM is not a sim-ple morphology-observation instrument, but a versatileinstrument capable of performing elemental analysis andstate analysis. Energy of emitted electronsNumber of emitted electronsIncident-electron energySecondary electronsBackscattered electronsFigure 13 shows the energy distribution of various elec- trons emitted from the specimen. The energy of second-ary electrons is limited to 50 eV or less; however theenergy distribution of backscattered electrons is verywide, ranging from an energy equal to the incident-elec-tron energy down to 50 eV, which is far lower than theincident-electron energy. Small peaks that appear in therange of backscattered electrons correspond to Augerelectrons. Fig. 13 Energy distribution of electrons emitted from the specimen.10Secondary Electrons When the incident electron beam enters the specimen, secondary electrons are produced from the emission of the valence elec- trons of the constituent atoms in the specimen. Since the energy of secondary electrons is very small, those generated at a dee p region are quickly absorbed by the specimen. Only those generated at the top surface of the specimen are emitted outside of thespecimen. This means that secondary electrons are very sensitive to the surface. In addition, as shown in Fig. 14, compared towhen the incident electron beam enters perpendicularly to the specimen, the amount of the secondary electron emission is largerwhen the electron beam enters obliquely. Figure 15 shows an actual example of the secondary electron image. The difference inthe brightness of the crystal surface is due to the difference of the incidence angle of the electron beam. Thus, the secondaryelectron is used to observe the topography of the specimen surface. Since the secondary electron possesses a small energy, it i s influenced by the potential near the specimen. As a result, an anomalous contrast arises when a specimen is electrically charge d; and the secondary electron is often used to measure the operating voltage of a circuit in a semiconductor device.

Incident electrons Escape depth of secondary electronsSecondary electron diffusion areaAmount of emission: small Amount of emission: large Tilt angle of specimen surfaceSecondary electron yield Fig. 14 Relation between the incidence angle of the electron probe and the secondary electron yield.11Backscattered Electrons Backscattered electrons are those scattered backward and emitted out of the specimen, when the incident elec-trons are scattered in the specimen. They are sometimescalled reflected electrons. Since backscattered electronspossess higher energy than secondary electrons, infor-mation from a relatively deep region is contained in thebackscattered electrons. The backscattered electronsare sensitive to the composition of the specimen. Asshown in Fig. 16, as the atomic number of the constituentatoms in the specimen is larger, the backscattered elec-tron yield is larger. That is, an area that consists of aheavy atom appears bright in the backscattered electronimage. Thus, this image is suitable for observing a com-positional difference. Figure 17 shows an actual exampleof a backscattered electron image. In addition, as shownin Fig. 18, if the specimen surface has irregularity, theintensity of the backscattered electrons becomes higherin the direction of specular reflection. This feature can beused to observe the topography of the surface. As shown in Fig. 19, if an electron beam enters a crystalline specimen with a uniform composition, the backscattered electron intensity changes depending on the crystal orientation. Utilizing this phenomenon enables you to observe the difference in crys tal orientation as an image. The contrast in this image is called Electron Channeling Contrast (ECC). Figure 20 shows an example.Slightly tilting the crystalline specimen causes a change in the contrast.Fig. 16 Atomic number dependence of backscattered electron intensity.

Specimen: Cross section of flexible board12Edge Effect As shown in Fig. 21, if there exists uneven steps or thin protrusions on the specimen surface, the edges of the steps or protru sions appear bright while the bright parts have a certain width (theoretically, edges should appear as sharp lines). This phenomenon is called the edge effect. Figure 22 shows the schematic diagram of this effect. Even when the electron probe irradiates the area dis- tant from an edge on an uneven step, secondary electrons generated by the electrons diffused in the specimen are emitted fromthe edge surface as secondary electrons. Fig. 21 Example of the edge effect. Specimen: Etched pit on steel. Accelerating voltage: 25 kV Electron probe Specimen surface Secondary electron escape depthSecondary electrons emitted from the edge surface Diffusion area Fig. 22 Diffusion of incident electrons and resultant edge effects.13 Influence of Accelerating Voltage When the accelerating voltage is changed, the penetra- tion depth of the incident electrons changes. As theaccelerating voltage is higher, the penetration depth islarger. If the accelerating voltage is increased, informa-tion from the inside of the specimen gives rise to thebackground, degrading the contrast on the specimen sur-face. As shown in Fig. 23, the electron probe broadenswithin the specimen. Thus, if a structural object existsinside the specimen, a higher accelerating voltage caus-es an unclear image of this object that overlaps on thesurface image. In addition, as the accelerating voltage ishigher, the edge effect is larger. Accordingly, in order toclearly observe surface structures, it is better to use alower accelerating voltage. Figure 24 shows images of plate-like crystals of boron nitride taken at three different accelerating voltages. Thin crystals of ele- ments with small atomic number overlap each other. When the accelerating voltage is high (10 kV), crystals beneath another crys - tals are seen through. Two remarkable phenomena arise for floating crystals in the images. That is, parts of the floating cryst als appear bright or dark. The reason for this is the following: In the former case, the secondary electrons emitted from the under side of the floating crystals are detected, contributing to a bright contrast. In the latter case, crystals located just beneath the floating crystals prevent the emission of the secondary electrons from the underside of the floating crystals. When the accelerating vol t- age is decreased to 1 kV, step-shaped structures on the crystals are clearly observed with sufficient contrast. Fig. 23 Overlap of the internal structural information on the surface image. Fig. 24 Difference in the contrast of secondary electron images depending on the accelerating voltage. Specimen: Plate-like crystals of boron surface Internal structural object14Electron probe Illumination direction SpecimenDetectorIllumination Effect of Secondary Electron Detector Theoretically, in the secondary electron image, the specimen surface perpendicular to the incident electronprobe appears darker, whereas, when the specimen sur-face is tilted with respect to the electron probe, theimage appears brighter. But actually, the position of thesecondary electron detector also influences the contrastof the SEM image. Figure 25 illustrates the trajectory ofthe secondary electrons that enter the secondary elec-tron detector. Secondary electrons are accelerated by ahigh voltage applied to the tip of the secondary electrondetector and then they enter this detector. The secondaryelectrons emitted in the opposite direction of the detector(on the left side of the electron probe) are also attractedto the detector because their energy is very low. As thetrajectory of the detected electrons causes the illumina-tion effect, the image looks as if the specimen was illumi-nated with a shadow-less light. In addition, part ofbackscattered electrons with relatively high energiesmay enter the detector to produce an illumination effecthaving directional property. Consequently, the resultantimage is seen as if soft light from the detector illuminatedthe specimen. The direction of the secondary electrontrajectory corresponds to the illumination direction to thespecimen. You may interpret the illumination effect that apseudo light source located in front of the detector illumi-nates the specimen and you observe an image from thedirection of the electron probe. This effect takes place when the SEM is provided with the commonly-used E-T detector. But, when a TTL detec-tor is used, the illumination effect changes a little. Asshown in Fig. 26, the secondary electrons emitted fromthe specimen move along the optical axis while they areconfined by the magnetic fields of the objective lens, andthen they enter the detector. In this case, the direction ofthe secondary electron trajectory corresponds to that ofthe incident electron probe (observation direction). Thus,the illumination effect is weakened (less topographiccontrast), and a SEM image is seen differently from theimage obtained with an E-T detector. Illumination Effect of Backscattered Electron Detector The illumination effect also occurs for backscatteredelectrons. You can observe an image as if light illuminat-ed the specimen from the backscattered electron detec-tor. However, note that backscattered electrons enter thedetector while they travel in a straight line. This is differ-ent from the secondary electron trajectory to the detec-tor, which takes a curve. The straight trajectory of thebackscattered electrons leads to a difference in the con-trast depending largely on the position of the backscat-tered electron detector; and also strong topographic con-trast is obtained. Figure 27 shows an example of thebackscattered electron detector. Two detectors (A andB), which are symmetric with respect to the electronprobe, are positioned just above the specimen. After thedetection of the backscattered electrons, the output sig-nals are calculated (the signal detected with detector Ais taken as A, whereas that detected with detector B asB). Subtracting B from A enables you to obtain the topo-graphic information on the specimen surface because animage becomes as if light illuminated the specimen fromdetector A. On the other hand, adding A and B causes thetopographic information to disappear and enables you toobserve a compositional difference because an imagechanges as if light illuminated the specimen from theelectron-probe direction.

This image sharpness can be regardedas the resolving power. To be precise, the resolvingpower is defined as \"the minimum distance that can beseparated as two distinguishable points using the instru-ment.\" Traditionally in the SEM, the resolving power isdetermined by measuring the minimum distinguishabledistance between two objects. Figure 28 is a SEM imageof gold particles evaporated on a carbon plate. As shownin arrows in Fig. 28, the distance between two particles,which are most close to each other, is measured and aresolving power of about 1 nm is obtained. In order tofacilitate the measurement of resolving power, it isimportant to prepare a specimen that is stable and easyto observe as much as possible. A standard specimen formeasurement of resolving power is different with manu-facturers of electron microscopes. In addition, there aredifferences in measurement conditions and measure-ment techniques for determining the resolving poweramong the manufacturers. The resolving power is obtained when the instrument is used under the optimum conditions. The \"resolution\" is a term similar to the resolving power. The resolution is defined as \"the minimum distance that can be separated as two distinguishable points in the (SEM) image.\" The resolution is determined by various factors: the status of the instrument, structures of the specimen, observ a- tion magnification, etc. However actually, the resolution and the resolving power are often used in the same sense. 15Resolution and Resolving Power Fig. 28 Gold particles evaporated on a carbon plate. Two arrows indicate that the distance between two points are about 1 nm (resolution of 1 nm). To Improve Resolution The SEM resolution is determined by the diameter of the electron probe. In principle, the electron beam emittedfrom the electron gun is focused by the condenser andobjective lenses. But in the actual operation of the SEM,the excitation of the objective lens is unchanged; there-fore, the diameter of the electron probe is changed bychanging the excitation of the condenser lens. Figure 29 shows the change of the electron-probe diam- eter when the excitation (strength) of the condenser lensis changed. As the condenser lens is strengthened, thediameter of the electron-source image (electron probediameter) is decreased. However, this diameter does notbecome smaller than the theoretical probe-size limitdetermined by the objective lens. Decreasing the elec-tron-probe diameter decreases the probe current thatirradiates the specimen. When the TE gun is used, as thecondenser lens is strengthened, the image quality (sig-nal-to-noise ratio) deteriorate before the electron-probediameter reaches the theoretical limit due to the lack ofthe probe current, and you cannot observe an image. When using the FE gun that produces larger probe current than the TE gun,the curve in Fig. 29 shifts to the left. Thus, the electron-probe diameter reaches the theoretical limit while you can observe an image. In addition, when the performance of the objective lens is enhanced, the curve shifts downward, enabling you to obtain amuch higher resolution. Consequently, the combination of the FE gun and a higher-performance objective lens provides an extremely high resolution.

The FE gun utilizes the field-emission effectthat takes place when a high electric field is applied to ametal surface. Its construction is shown in Fig. 30. Thecathode is made of a thin tungsten wire. A tungsten sin-gle crystal is welded to this tungsten wire, and the tip ofthe tungsten single crystal is shaped to be a curvatureradius of about 100 nm. This is called the emitter. When apositive voltage (a few kV) is applied to a metal plate(extracting electrode), the tunneling effect occurs andelectrons are emitted from the emitter. If a hole is madeat the center of the extracting electrode, the emittedelectron beam flows through this hole. Then, when youapply a voltage to the electrode (accelerating electrode)located below the extracting electrode, you can obtainan electron beam having certain energy. In order to generate a field emission, the tip of the emitter must be very clean. Thus, the FE gun needs to be placed in an ultrahigh vacuum of about 10 -8Pa. The electron beam emitted from the emitter behaves as if the beam was emitted from a small electron source with a diameter of 5to 10 nm. In the case of the TE gun, its electron source is 10 to 20 \u00b5m in diameter, indicating that the FE gun produces a much small- er electron source than the TE gun, thus suitable for high-resolution SEMs. In addition, another advantage of the FE gun is tha t the energy spread of the electron beam is small because the FE gun requires no heating of the emitter. In low-accelerating voltageobservation, this energy spread determines the resolution (chromatic aberration); therefore, this advantage is very important.

Schottky-Emission Electron Gun The SE gun utilizes the Schottky-emission effect that takes place when a high electric field is applied to aheated metal surface. Its construction is shown in Fig. 31.The cathode is a ZrO/W emitter. That is, a tungsten singlecrystal coated with ZrO, which has a tip curvature radiusof a few hundred nanometers. Coating of ZrO greatlydecreases the work function, thus a large emission cur-rent can be obtained at a relatively low cathode tempera-ture of about 1800K. As shown in Fig. 31, in order to shieldthe thermoelectrons from the emitter, a negative voltageis applied to an electrode, called the suppressor. Anadvantage of the SE gun is that the electron-beam cur-rent is highly stable because the emitter, which is placedin an ultrahigh vacuum of about 10 -7Pa, is kept at a high temperature and no gas-absorption occurs.Compared to the FE gun, the energy spread of the electron beam is somewhat larger, but the SE gun produces larger probe cur-rents. Thus, these features are very effective for various analyses simultaneously with morphological observation. This electro n gun is often called the thermal-cathode FE gun or thermal FE gun for convenience. Fig. 31 Construction of the SE gun.Type of Electron Guns There are three types of electron guns: TE gun, FE gun and the SE gun. This section explains the two latter guns. - +- +Heating power supply EmitterExtracting voltagepowersupply Suppressor Extracting electrodeAccelerating voltage power supply Accelerating electrode+ -17Features of Three-Type Electron Guns Figure 32 is a radar chart compares the features of the TE gun, FE gun and SE gun. The FE gun is superior in terms of the elect ron- source size, brightness (quantity that means the current density and parallelity of the electron beam), lifetime and energy spr ead (energy width) of the electron beam. The TE gun is superior in terms of the probe current and current stability. Considering th ese features, the FE gun is suitable for morphological observation at high magnifications, and the TE gun is suitable for versatile appli- cations such as analysis that does not require high magnification.

This is an important component thatdetermines the SEM resolution. Here, the relationbetween the objective-lens capabilities and resolution ispresented. In the ideal lens, the electron beam emittedfrom a point converges to a point after passing throughthe lens. But in the actual lens, the electron beam doesnot form a point, which has a blur. This blur is called\"aberration.\" The lens aberration consists of variousaberrations such as spherical aberration, chromaticaberration and diffraction aberration. In order todecrease the spherical aberration, the aperture angle ofthe lens is decreased, that is, only the beam near theoptical axis is used; however, this increases the diffrac-tion aberration. Thus, the minimum diameter of the elec-tron probe is determined by the optimum aperture anglethat takes account of the balance of these aberrations. Figure 33 shows the relation between the objective-lens aberrations andthe electron-probe diameter. Note that when the accelerating voltage is lower, the influence of the chromatic aberration become s larger; therefore, this must be taken into consideration. Electron-probe diameter Diffraction aberrationCombined probe diameter Aperture angle aberration Fig. 33 Objective-lens aberrations and electron-probe diameter. Conventional Objective Lens The conventional objective lens is also called the out-lens objective lens. This lens is used for most electron-probe instrumen ts including Electron Probe Microanalyzers (see page 28). As shown in Fig. 34, a specimen is placed below the objective lens, in o rder to prevent the interference of the specimen and the lens even if a large specimen is tilted. This lens allows the specimen to b e han- dled freely, but the distance between the specimen and the lens should be long, requiring a long focal length. Therefore, the a ber- ration becomes large and a high resolution cannot be obtained. SpecimenLens magnetic fieldCoil Yoke Fig. 34 Construction of the conventional objective lens.19SpecimenLens magnetic fieldStrongly Excited Objective Lens for High Resolution This lens aims at obtaining high resolution by shortening the specimen-lens distance and enhancing the lens performance. The distance is shortened by placing the specimen in the lens magnetic field. There are two types of lenses available for this purp ose: the in-lens objective lens and semi-in-lens objective lens (also called snorkel objective lens). Figure 35 shows the constructi on of the in-lens objective lens. The specimen is inserted into the magnetic field between the polepieces of the objective lens, as i n the case of the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The specimen size is limited to a few millimeters. Figure 36 shows the con-struction of the semi-in-lens objective lens. To overcome the limit of the specimen size in the in-lens objective lens, the sha pe of the polepieces is designed to produce the lens magnetic field below the space of the objective lens by leaking a strong magneti c field to this space. Thus, a large specimen can be handled with the semi-in-lens objective lens. In these two lenses, the secon dary electron detector is placed above the objective lens; therefore, the image contrast is different from that in the conventional objec- tive lens (see page 14). Role of Objective Lens Aperture If the entire opening of the objective lens is used, a fine electron probe cannot be produced due to the lens aberration. To av oid this, the \"aperture,\" which is a thin metal plate having a small hole is used to enable the electron beam to pass only through the center of the objective lens. If this objective lens aperture is displaced from the center, the aberration of the objective len s becomes large, making it impossible to form a fine electron probe. Therefore, the objective lens aperture must be placed exactl y on the optical axis.Fig. 35 Construction of the in-lens objective lens. Fig. 36 Construction of the semi-in-lens objective lens.20Actual Resolution of SEM Figure 37 shows the relation between the accelerating voltage and the resolution in actual SEMs. The resolu-tions of three types of SEMs, the general-purpose SEM,general-purpose FE-SEM (SEM with FE gun) and ultrahighresolution FE-SEM, are presented. In any SEM, as theaccelerating voltage is higher, the resolution is higher.When the accelerating voltage is decreased down to afew kV or below, the resolution is drastically degraded.The decrease of the resolution in low accelerating volt-ages is caused by the influence of the chromatic aberra-tion. Note that the resolution curve for the SEM with anSE gun is almost the same as that for the general-pur-pose FE-SEM.

Figure 38 shows the relation between the probe current and the probe diameter at 20 kV accelerating voltage. Inthe SEM with a TE gun, increasing the probe currentincreases the probe diameter with a relatively uniformcurve. On the other hand, in the SEM with an FE gun,even when the probe current is increased, the probediameter is relatively constant in a certain range; howev-er, the probe diameter drastically increases at a probecurrent of about 1 nA. In addition, the FE gun cannot pro-duce a probe current larger than few nA. In the SEM withan SE gun, a much larger probe current can be obtainedand also, the increase of the probe diameter is not dras-tic. Thus, the SE gun is suitable for analytical purposes. 1pA 1nA1nm10nm100nm Probe currentTE gun FE gun20kV SE gunProbe diameter1\u00b5m 1\u00b5A Fig. 38 Relation between the probe current and the probe diameter.21What is Charging? As explained before, the electrons that entered the specimen lose their energy and they are absorbed in thespecimen. If a specimen is conductive, the electrons flowthrough the specimen stage; however, if a specimen isnonconductive, the electrons stop in the specimen. Thatis, the charging occurs. Figure 39 is the schematic illus-tration of the charging. In this case, the number of theelectrons flowing to the specimen is not equal to that exitfrom the specimen. In general, the number of the elec-trons flowing to the specimen is larger and the specimenis negatively charged. If the irradiation of the electronbeam is continued, a negative charge is accumulated inthe irradiated point, resulting in a large negative potentialin this point. If the electron-beam irradiation is continued further and the negative potential exceeds a certain value, discha rge occurs and the potential returns to its original potential. On the other hand, if some reason causes the number of the electron s exit- ing from the specimen to be larger than that flowing to the specimen, the specimen is positively charged. Fig. 39 Electric flow in a nonconductive specimen. Influence of Charging on SEM Image If the charging occurs, the electron probe that scans over the specimen is deflected by the repulsive force from a charged pote n- tial, resulting in a positional shift of the electron probe. This causes an image to distort. In addition, if discharge occurs, the elec- tron probe returns to its original position for a moment. As a result, a SEM image appears as if the image was broken away, asshown in Fig. 40. If the charging is very small and the electron-probe scan is not affected, what happens? In such a case, secondary electrons wi th a small energy are influenced by a local charging. The influence gives rise to a difference in the detection efficiency of seco ndary electrons or disturbance of the secondary electron trajectory. As a result, part of the image appears bright or dark. The diffe rence in the detection produces a so-called voltage contrast. That is, if the specimen is negatively charged, the voltage differencebetween the secondary electron detector and the specimen becomes large and therefore, more secondary electrons enter thedetector, causing the locally-charged area to be observed bright (high detection efficiency). Whereas, if the specimen is posit ively charged, the detection efficiency becomes low, leading the locally-charged area to be observed dark. Local charging generates ahigh electric field surrounding the locally-charged area. This electric field is higher than that generated by the secondary el ectron detector. Therefore, the secondary electrons emitted from the specimen are deflected by this high electric field, giving rise t o dis- turb the secondary electron trajectories. As a result, the secondary electrons do not enter the detector and part of the imageappears dark. Figure 41 shows this phenomenon. Fig. 40 Distortion of a SEM image caused by the charging. Fig. 41 Anomalous contrast due to the charging.Charging and Its Influence22To Prevent Charging The most typical method to prevent the charging is conductive coating. This method coats a nonconductive specimen with a high- ly-conductive thin metal film. Ion sputtering and vacuum evaporation are included in this method. A thin film with a thickness rang- ing from a few to 10 nm of a noble metal (for example, Au, Pt, Au-Pd, Pt-Pd) is coated on the specimen. The reason for using anoble metal is that it is highly stable and its secondary-electron yield is high. In order to reproduce the true surface of the speci- men, it is necessary to prepare a thin film. However, if a surface has a complicated morphology, too thin coating may cause cha rg- ing because the coating film loses its continuity. Fig. 42 Relation between the accelerating voltage and the secondary- electron yield. Fig. 43 Secondary electron images of ceramics at different accelerating voltages (no coating).Coating In the case when a specimen is charged, the number of the electrons flowing to the specimen is different from that which exit from the specimen. As the accelerating voltage of the incident electron beam is decreased, the secondary-electron yield isincreased as shown in Fig. 42. At an accelerating voltage of around 1 kV, the number of the emitted secondary electrons is larg er than that of the incident electrons. By using such a low accelerating voltage, the number of the electrons flowing to the speci men becomes equal to that which exit from the specimen. This means that the specimen is not charged. Thus, even a nonconductivespecimen can be imaged without any charging. Figure 43 is an example of images of ceramics without coating. At an acceleratingvoltage of 10 kV, there is little topographic information and some anomalous tailing appears on the image. But in an accelerati ng voltage of 1 kV, substantial topographic information is obtained and also, no tailing appears in the image.Low accelerating-voltage observation As explained before (see page 10), when the electron beam enters obliquely to the specimen, the number of the emitted second- ary electrons is increased. Utilizing this phenomenon enables you to observe a nonconductive specimen without any charging.This technique is effective for the observation of a specimen with less surface irregularity. Tilt observation23 Fig. 44 Schematic diagram illustrating the principle of the LVSEM for observation of nonconductive specimens. Fig. 45 Example of images of a nonconductive specimen taken with LVSEM. Specimen: Shell of Foraminifera (no coating)When you use the low vacuum SEM (LVSEM) explained later (see page 26), you can observe a nonconductivespecimen without any charging. Decreasing the vacuumin the specimen chamber increases the number of theresidual gas molecules. These gas molecules are ionizedby the electrons and reach the specimen as positive ionsto neutralize the charging (Fig. 44). In order to produce asufficient number of the positive ions for charge neutral-ization, it is necessary to set the pressure in the speci-men chamber to a few tens to 100 Pa (this value may bedifferent depending on the specimen). Figure 45 shows anexample of images of a shell of Foraminifera withoutcoating, taken with an LVSEM. An anomalous contrastarises due to the charging in the high-vacuum mode, butthis contrast disappears in the low-vacuum mode. Notethat the latter image is backscattered electron image;therefore, strong shadowing effect is observed.Low vacuum SEM observation High-vacuum mode Low-vacuum mode24Basics of Specimen Preparation The specimen must meet the following requirements before it is loaded to the SEM stage: a) The surface to observe is exposed. b) The specimen is firmly fixed to the specimen mount. c) The specimen has conductivity in principle. Exposing Surface to Observe and Contrast Enhancement After cutting the specimen with a suitable size for observation, expose a surface to observe. In principle, when you want to observe the specimen surface itself, special treatment is not required. But if necessary, you are required to remove films that may prevent observation. When you want to observe internal structures, it is necessary to prepare a cross section. Actual methods are as follows. If a specimen is hard, it is fractured to prepare a cross section. When a specimen is a structural object, such as semiconducto r device that is grown on a Si or GaAs single crystal, it has a cleavage property in a specific direction of the crystal; therefo re, frac- turing the specimen in this specific direction enables you to obtain a flat cross section. If a specimen is soft at normal temp erature but hard at low temperature, freeze fracturing is applied to this material in liquid nitrogen.Fracturing If a specimen is soft like a polymer, it can be cut using an ultramicrotome, which is originally used to prepare a thin section for a TEM. A cross section planed off by this method is very flat. When only a low-magnification observation is performed, a specimenwith a few scars may be acceptable. In such a case, a razor blade is used for cross-section preparation.Cutting For many metal or mineral specimens, mechanical polishing is applied. In this method, a specimen is embedded in a resin and pol - ished. In the mechanical polishing process, abrasives are gradually changed from rough to fine abrasives and finally, a polishe d cross section is fabricated to a mirrored surface.Mechanical polishing In many specimens, secondary electron images provide no contrast when their cross sections are very smooth. In these cases, various contrast-enhancement techniques are applied. Two examples are explained. The first is selective etching. Surfaces ofcross sections are chemically or physically etched to form irregularity on the surface and internal structures are observed usi ng secondary electron images. The second is called \"staining.\" Specific areas of a high polymer specimen are stained by heavy met-als, such as Os and Ru, and its compositional image is observed by using backscattered electron images. On the other hand, evenwhen such specimen treatment (contrast enhancement) is not applied, if an original specimen has a difference in composition orcrystalline property, a compositional image or an ECC image can be observed in backscattered electron mode.Milling by the ion beam In recent years, the use of ion-beam milling has been increasing. For example, a focused ion beam (FIB) system enables you to obtain a cross section with a high positional accuracy of a few hundreds of nanometers. In addition, the broad ion-beam millingtechnique is available, which uses a broad Ar ion beam for cross-section preparation. Compared to FIB, the positional accuracy of this technique is lower, but this technique provides a much wider cross section. Contrast enhancement Bulk specimens are fixed to the specimen mount by conductive paste or conductive double-sided adhesive tape. If a bulk speci- men has a relatively uniform shape, it is clamped with an exclusive specimen holder. If a bulk specimen is nonconductive, it sh ould be coated by conductive paste as wide as possible while keeping an area to observe.Bulk specimens These specimens are dusted on conductive paste or double-sided adhesive tape. In dusting powders or particles, they must dis- perse as wide as possible. On the other hand, some specimens can be subjected to the suspension method. In this method, speci-mens are suspended in the dispersion medium (organic solvent, water, etc.) and they are dropped on an aluminum foil or a Siwafer, and finally they are dried. Powders and particlesMounting Specimen The specimen must be stably fixed to the specimen mount. In addition, the specimen must electrically connect to this specimen mount.If a specimen is nonconductive, its surface needs to be coated with a thin metal film so that the surface has con-ductivity. This technique is called coating, and ion sput-tering and vacuum evaporation are typical methods. Ion sputtering is classified into two techniques. The first technique uses an ion-sputter coater and the second oneuses an ion-beam sputter coater. general, the firsttechnique In the ion-sputter coater, positive ions, which areproduced by discharge in a low vacuum of about 10 Pa,sputter a target metal and the specimen is coated withthe sputtered target metal. Figure 46 shows the schemat-ic diagram of the ion-sputter coater. Since the inside ofthis device is kept at a low vacuum, the particles of thesputtered target metal collide with many residual gasmolecules; therefore, the metal particles are stronglyscattered and attached to the specimen surface from every direction, forming a uniform film on the surface. On the other hand,when the ion-beam sputter coater is used, a high-quality thin film is formed because both the target and specimen are placed in a high vacuum. Vacuum evaporation heats and vaporizes a material, forming a thin metal film on the specimen surface. Since the inside of the vacuum evaporator is a high vacuum of about 10 -3Pa, the number of the residual gas molecules in the device is small, causing the scattering of the evaporated material particles to be weak. As a result, the specimen surface cannot be coated with the evapora t- ed material from every direction. In order to form a uniform film on the surface, the specimen is rotated and tilted. As a coating material, a noble metal (Au, Au-Pd, Pt, Pt-Pd, etc.) is used because it is stable and has a high secondary-electro n yield. For high-magnification observation, Au-Pd, Pt or Pt-Pd is used. For some cases including elemental analysis, C or Al may be used. Pt and Pt-Pd are difficult to evaporate in vacuum. C and Al are difficult to sputter. If a coated film is thick, this hides fine structures on the specimen surface; therefore, a thinner film is desirable. However, if the film is too thin, it may cause charging because the coating film loses its continuity. In general, a coated film is prepared to be a few to 10 nm in thickness.Coating Water-containing specimens, such as biological tissues, are deformed if they are transferred to the SEM specimen chamber without any pre-treatment. In order to prevent the deformation, biological specimens are generally subjected to the following p ro- cedure, and then they are observed with their surfaces coated. Foods are also subjected to a process similar to the following p ro- cedure.Treatment of Biological Specimen In this process, a tissue is cut to make it with an appropriate size so that it can be preserved until the drying process. In o rder to prevent the deformation of the tissue, sufficient care is needed. Cleaning of its surface may be also necessary.Removing and cleaning of tissues Since a removed tissue starts to change its structure after its death, in order to prevent this change, it is chemically fixed by chemicals such as glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, and osmium tetroxide. In this process, adsorbing much osmium metal to the tis-sue may give conductivity to the tissue (conductive staining). For some tissue specimens, rapid freezing (called physical fixat ion) is used to suppress a structural change of the tissue.Fixation In the dehydration process, to prevent the deformation, the specimen is immersed in an ethanol or acetone solution for a certai n period of time while the concentration of the solution is changed in several steps. Ethanol or acetone in the tissue specimen is removed and then, this tissue is dried. If natural drying is applied, a surface-te nsion effect deforms the specimen. Thus, a special drying method, critical-point drying or freeze drying for example, is used.Dehydration Drying This process is the same as that for other nonconductive specimens.Mounting and coating of specimen 25Residual gas moleculesTarget Magnet Sputtered particles Ion bombardment Rotary pumpDirect A few hundred V Specimen+-- Fig. 46 Principle of the ion-sputter coater.Fig. 47 Observation example of a concrete piece using LVSEM. Fig. 48 LVSEM image taken by simple freeze drying. Specimen: Lactobacillus. 26Low Vacuum SEM In a normal SEM, the pressure inside the specimen chamber is kept at 10-3to 10-4Pa. But, in an LVSEM, this pressure can be set to several tens to several hundreds Pa. In order to maintain a high vacuum in the electron gun chamber, an orifice is generallyplaced between the electron-beam path and the specimen chamber (see p23). If the E-T detector is used in vacuum in the LVSEM,discharge occurs; therefore, the backscattered electron detector is used. The use of the backscattered electron detector mayenhance the compositional contrast and provide a SEM image with strong shadowing effect, thus sometimes, an ion-currentdetection technique is used, which utilizes gas amplification of secondary electrons in low vacuum. We already explained that the LVSEM is used for observation of nonconductive specimens without coating. In addition, utilizing the fact that the pressure in the specimen chamber can be increased, the LVSEM is used for observing specimens with a lot of ou t- gassing, unstable specimens in high vacuum and frozen water-containing specimens. If you try to observe a porous specimen with a lot of outgassing in a normal SEM, it takes a lot of time to decrease the pressu re (for higher vacuum) in the specimen chamber, thus you have to wait for a while until observation. To the contrary, the LVSEM ca n be used even if the vacuum in the specimen chamber is several tens to several hundreds Pa, thus effective for observing such aspecimen in a short time. Figure 47 is an example of an LVSEM image taken from a concrete piece with a lot of outgases. In this observation, the time to obtain a SEM image was only a few minutes. In order to observe a water-containing specimen while its native state is preserved, a cryo stage is used where the specimen is frozen by liquid nitrogen and is subjected to observation on a cooling stage. Since the pressure in the specimen chamber can bekept high in an LVSEM, ice does not sublimate even at a relatively high temperature. For example, if the pressure in the specim en chamber is about 100 Pa, the ice can be observed even at a cooling temperature of about -20\u00b0C. This temperature can be obtainedby a Peltier element, eliminating a need for the cooling stage with liquid nitrogen. In addition, in an LVSEM, a frozen specime n can be easily imaged. That is, the specimen frozen by liquid nitrogen in the air is loaded into the specimen chamber and imaged dur ing the rise of a temperature. Figure 48 shows an LVSEM image taken by this method (simple freeze drying).27Generation of X-rays As explained before, when the incident electrons enter a substance, various electrons and electromagneticwaves are emitted from the substance. Figure 49 showsthe schematic diagram of the generation of characteris-tic X-rays. When electrons in the inner shells are emittedfrom the constituent atoms in the substance due to theirradiation of the incident electrons, the vacant orbits arefilled with outer-shell electrons, and the substance emitsX-rays whose energies correspond to the energy differ-ence between the outer-shell electrons and the inner-shell electrons. These X-rays are called \"characteristicX-rays\" because their energies (wavelengths) are char-acteristic of individual elements. Thus, the characteristicX-rays are used for elemental analysis. Characteristic X-rays that are emitted by the excitation of the electrons in K shells a re called \"K lines,\" whereas those emitted by the L and M shell excitations are called \"L lines\" and \"M lines,\" respectively. As t he constituent element is heavier, the energy of characteristic X-rays is higher; therefore, in order to excite characteristic X-r ays from heavy elements, high-energy incident electrons are required. On the other hand, when the incident electrons are decelerated bythe atomic nucleus, different X-rays are emitted. These X-rays are called \"continuous X-rays\" or \"white X-rays\" or\"background X - rays.\"M shell L shell K shellIncident electrons Characteristic X-rays Fig. 49 Principle of the generation of characteristic X-rays.

Fig. 51 Example of an EDS spectrum.Basics of Elemental Analysis X-ray Spectrometer The Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS) is used to analyze characteristic X-ray spectra by measuring the energies of the X-rays. As shown in Fig. 50, when the X-rays emitted from the specimen enter the semiconductor detector, electron-hole pairs ar e generated whose quantities correspond to the X-ray energy. Measuring these quantities (electric current) enables you to obtainthe values of X-ray energy. The detector is cooled by liquid nitrogen, in order to reduce the electric noise. The advantage of the EDS is that the X-rays from a wide range of elements from B to U are analyzed simultaneously. Figure 51 shows an example of anX-ray spectrum obtained by the EDS. The horizontal axis corresponds to the X-ray energy, whereas the vertical axis correspondsto the X-ray counts.Principle of analysis by EDSEDS WDS Measurable element range B ~UB ~U Measurement methodEnergy dispersive method Wavelength dispersive method with a Si (Li) semiconductor detector with an analyzing crystal Resolution E 130 ~140eV E 20eV(energy conversion) Measuring speed Fast Slow Multi-element simultaneous measurement Possible Impossible Damage/contamination of specimen Little Many Detection limit 1500 ~2000ppm 10 ~100ppm Detectable X-rays per current Many Little 28Electron probe SpecimenAnalyzing crystal DetectorRowland circle X-rays Fig. 52 Principle of WDS analysis.The Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (WDS) is used to analyze characteristic X-ray spectra by meas-uring the wavelengths of the X-rays. As shown in Fig. 52,first, the X-rays emitted from the specimen hit the analyz-ing crystal, next, this crystal diffracts the X-rays, andfinally the X-rays enter the detector and their wave-lengths are measured. The analyzing crystal and detectormust move on a so-called \"Rowland circle\" with a con-stant radius. In order to cover (measure) all of wave-lengths, a driving mechanism for multiple analyzing crys-tals is needed, requiring a lot of time to acquire all of thecorresponding X-ray spectra.Principle of analysis by WDS Table 2 shows differences in EDS and WDS. The EDS features measurement with a small probe current, short-time acquisition of spectra, etc. WDS features a high energy (wavelength) resolution, detection of trace elements. Most SEMs are equipped with anEDS, whereas a WDS is generally used as an Electron Probe Microanalyzer (EPMA) that mainly performs elemental analysis. Difference between EDS and WDS Table 2 Features of EDS and WDS29As explained before, X-ray mapping is used to obtain the distributions of specific elements. In this analysis, the electron pro be is scanned over a specified area and characteristic X-rays with specific energies are acquired. It should be noted that if the P-B ratio is extremely low (the peak intensity is very small compared to the background), X-ray maps show the distribution of continuous X- rays (not the distributions of elements of interest). In addition, you should note that if the energies of characteristic X-ray s from ele- ments not of interest are very close to those of the elements of interest, X-ray maps might show the distributions of the eleme nts that are not of interest. This arises when the energy difference between the elements not of interest and elements of interest is equal to the energy resolution of the spectrometer. Figure 53 shows an example of X-ray mapping. Since the intensities of chara c- teristic X-rays are smaller than those of secondary and backscattered electrons, it requires a lot of time to obtain one X-ray image.Qualitative Analysis X-ray spectra enable us to perform qualitative analysis that identifies what elements are present in a specimen area irradiated with an electron beam. Three analysis modes are available: Point analysis to obtain a spectrum from a point irradiated with anelectron beam, Line analysis to display one-dimensional distributions of elements of interest on a specified line, and Mapping to display two-dimensional distributions of elements of interest in a specified area. Mapping is often called \"area analysis.\" If the point analysis is applied to a certain area (not a point), this qualitative analysis is performed while the electron probe is s canned over this area (an image is observed). The detection limit is different depending on the element. For EDS, this limit is a few thou- sand ppm, as shown in Table 2 (page 28). X-ray Mapping The resolution of X-ray mapping is limited by \"analysis area\" explained on the next page. But even when a particle smaller than the analysis area is present on the specimen surface, sometimes this particle can be recognized. This can happen when the parti - cle (element) is localized in a specific area. On the other hand, a method that quantitatively analyzes points on the specimen one by one while scanning the electron probe is called \"quantitative mapping.\" Using this method, even if the P-B ratio is low, accurate distribution of elements can be obtain ed. This is an advantage of quantitative mapping, which cannot be achieved using simple X-ray mapping (qualitative mapping).Fig. 53 Example of X-ray mapping Specimen: Concrete piece 30Since the intensity of characteristic X-rays is proportional to the concentration of the corresponding element, quantitative an aly- sis can be performed. In actual experiment, a standard specimen containing elements with known concentrations is used. Theconcentration of a certain element in an unknown specimen can be obtained by comparing the X-ray intensities of the certain ele - ment between the standard specimen and unknown specimen. However, X-rays generated in the specimen may be absorbed inthis specimen or excite the X-rays from other elements before they are emitted in vacuum. Thus, quantitative correction is need ed. In the present EDS and WDS, correction calculation is easily made; however, a prerequisite is required for this correction. Tha t is, elemental distribution in an X-ray generation area is uniform, the specimen surface is flat, and the electron probe enters perp endi- cular to the specimen. Actually, many specimens observed with the SEM do not satisfy this prerequisite; therefore, it should benoted that a quantitative analysis result might have appreciable errors.Quantitative Analysis When analyzing a nonconductive specimen, metal coating is required as in SEM observation. However, you must use a metal that is different from that may be contained in a specimen. When you want to detect light elements, a coated film must be thin enoug h because a thick heavy-metal coated film may prevent the emission of X-rays from light elements. If you try to analyze a nonconductive specimen without coating, this specimen is analyzed with a low accelerating voltage cause d by to the charging effect. Thus, some problems may occur; for example, characteristic X-rays with high excitation energies cann ot be detected, and the accuracy of quantitative analysis is degraded. In addition, positional shift of the incident electron prob e may occur when line analysis or X-ray mapping is performed. The use of the LVSEM enables you to analyze a nonconductive specimen without coating. However, in the specimen chamber in the LVSEM, the incident electron probe is broadly scattered by residual gas molecules existing in the electron-beam path, incre as- ing the analysis area. You should note this problem.Analysis of Non-conductive SpecimenIncident electrons that entered the specimen diffuse while losing their energy. In this process, they excite characteristic X-r ays. The X-ray generation area has a certain size, and this is of the order of \u00b5m in normal operation conditions. It should be noted that even if you try to analyze a particle of a few to a few ten nm in a SEM image, an actual analysis area becomes very wide.Decreasing the accelerating voltage decreases the analysis area. However, since the accelerating voltage (electron energy) mustbe higher than that of the characteristic X-rays to be excited, there is a limit in decreasing the accelerating voltage. Prepar ation of a thin-film specimen enables you to further decrease the analysis area. For example, when a thin film with a thickness of 100 n m is analyzed at 30 kV, an analysis area of 100 nm or less can be obtained for many elements. Analysis Area31History The development of a SEM began a few years after the invention of a TEM by Ruska in 1931. But the commercialization of the SEM required about 30 years. Figure 54 shows the history of the initial development stage of the SEM. In 1935, the original prototype of the SEM, which scans the specimen with an electron beam to obtain an image, was made by Knoll (Germany). Knoll was also involved in the development of the first TEM, and he developed this prototype SEM to study thematerial for a TV camera tube. He housed an electron gun and a specimen in a vacuum-sealed glass tube. Then, the specimen wasirradiated with an 100 \u00b5m-diameter electron beam and an absorbed current image was taken from the specimen.A SEM that incorporates a demagnifying lens system was first developed by von Ardenne (Germany) in 1938. The height of the opti - cal column of this instrument was about 2 m, and a small electron probe with a diameter of 4 nm was produced by a demagnifyinglens system comprised of a two-stage electrostatic lens. This instrument was dedicated to Scanning Transmission ElectronMicroscopy (STEM) and it was used for thin-film specimens. An image obtained with this SEM was recorded directly on a photo-graphic film placed below the specimen. The image was not visible until developing the photographic film because a CRT was notequipped with this instrument. He did not observe bulk specimens, but he published an article on his idea for a secondary elect ron detector that utilizes an electronic amplifier. In 1942, Zworykin, RCA Corporation (USA), developed a SEM for observing bulk specimens. This instrument combined an FE gunand a four-stage demagnifying lens system, and a scintillator was used for detecting secondary electrons. For image recording, a facsimile was used. Secondary electron images obtained with this instrument were inferior to those obtained by the replicamethod in the TEM, thus, RCA stopped the development of the SEM. Furthermore, the interest of many researchers shifted to thedevelopment of TVs and the research on the SEM suspended for about 10 years. The restart of developing a SEM was launched atthe Oatley Laboratory in Cambridge University (UK), around the early 1950s. In his laboratory, much basic research on the SEM was performed. In 1953, McMullan succeeded in the development of a SEMproducing a resolution of 50 nm at accelerating voltages from 15 to 20 kV, and his laboratory made five SEMs of this kind until 1965. During this period, many developments were made and they became the basis of the present SEMs. The achievements includedthe E-T detector which has been a prototype of the secondary electron detector of present SEMs, various observation techniques,and application technologies. Also in 1961, an SEM made in the Oatley Laboratory was installed in a pulp company in Canada.In 1965, Cambridge Scientific Instrument (UK) and JEOL (Japan) first commercialized a SEM, individually. During the four decade s after the first commercialization of the SEM, about several tens of thousands of SEMs have been manufactured. Now, the SEM hasmade significant advances in its performance and functions, and it continues to develop into a more sophisticated instrument.Fig. 54 History of the initial development stage of the SEM.1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1931 E.
