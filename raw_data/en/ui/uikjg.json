For most households electricity is a small part of expenditure, butfour million low income households spend more than 10 per cent of theirincome on fuel to heat their homes. Since May 1999 all domestic electricitycustomers in Great Britain have been able to choose which company suppliestheir electricity. This represents a major achievement by the Office of Gas andElectricity Markets (Ofgem), the industry's regulator, which has sinceJanuary 1999 been headed by Mr Callum McCarthy 1. It would also not have been possible without the co-operation of the companies involved in thesupply of electricity. By June 2000, 6.5 million customers, one in four, hadexercised their choice to change their electricity supplier and every monthsome 400,000 customers were changing supplier. 2 Successive Governments have taken the view that competition is the best way to protect customers' interests because it increases choice and gives companiesan incentive to lower prices and improve customer service. Fourteen regionalelectricity distribution and supply companies were established at privatisation,in 1990 and 1991, and were initially given a monopoly of supply to domesticand smaller business customers in their areas. The sale prospectuses of thesecompanies stated, however, that the Government were committed tointroducing competition in electricity supply for all customers by 1998.Meanwhile, to protect customers from the electricity companies' localmonopoly, Ofgem have regulated prices and quality standards. 3 In line with Government objectives, Ofgem introduced domestic electricity supply competition during September 1998 to May 1999 2, following the introduction of competition into the domestic gas market between 1996 and1998. Ofgem will continue to regulate the prices and quality standards ofelectricity suppliers until they consider that competition is sufficient to meettheir principal statutory objective of protecting the interests of consumers,having regard to their other duties including the protection of vulnerablegroups. 4 Preparing the systems of the electricity companies for domestic competition cost the companies some \u00a3850 million and took five months longer thanoriginally planned. In the absence of statutory powers to require electricitycompanies to co-operate with the implementation process, Ofgemencountered project management problems, which provide lessons for futureIn this chapter Lower bills but more 6 complaints Some customers are 13benefiting more than others Ofgem's action to help 14more customers benefit Recommendations 20GIVING DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS A CHOICE OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLIER executivesummary 1 Mr Callum McCarthy was appointed Director General of Gas Supply in November 1998 and Director General of Electricity Supply two months later. The Offices that he headed, the Office of Gas Supply (OFGAS) and the Office of Electricity Regulation (OFFER), have since merged to form Ofgem. The Director General posts will be replaced with a board, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. Mr Callum McCarthy is the Chairman-designate of the new Authority. 2 Competition was introduced into the small business market at the same time. Larger users of electricity could already choose their supplier by September 1998.2executive summaryGIVING DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS A CHOICE OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLIER projects of this nature. Ofgem have allowed companies to recover an additional \u00a3121 million a year from customers on average between 1998-99and 2004-05 to meet the additional costs they incurred 3. 5 This report examines the extent to which domestic customers have benefited from electricity supply competition, through reduced prices and improvedservices, and what more Ofgem could do to sustain and extend the benefits. Indoing so we have considered the impact on customers of changes made to theprice controls that Ofgem apply to electricity distribution and supplycompanies. We have also compared the impact of competition with othercountries and sectors of the British economy, and taken account of our previousreport, and the subsequent report of the Committee of Public Accounts, on theintroduction of competition into gas supply 4. Main Findings Competition has reduced electricity bills for many customers although some have experienced problems 6 The 6.5 million customers who had changed their electricity supplier by June 2000 have together seen their bills fall by \u00a3299 million since the start ofcompetition. This is a 15 per cent reduction in real terms, an average of \u00a345 per customer 5. About half of this reduction is attributable to competition (Figure 1) . 3 Ofgem had initially allowed the companies to recover \u00a3726 million over fiveyears and gave this figure to the House ofCommons Trade and Industry SelectCommittee in 1997. Ofgem increased theamount the companies were allowed torecover, and extended the period of recoveryto seven years, after companies supplied newinformation on the costs they had incurred. 4 Office of Gas Supply: Giving Customers A Choice - The Introduction of Competition intothe Domestic Gas Market (HC 403 (1998-99)12 May 1999) and the Committee of PublicAccounts' 8th Report, HC 171 (1999-2000) 3 February 2000. The Committee'srecommendations are set out in Appendix 1. 5 The range of tariffs offered by domestic suppliers, and variations in consumption,mean that customer savings vary substantiallyand few customers have saved precisely thisamount.The 6.5 million domestic customers who have changed their supplier have saved 15 per cent of the electricity bills in real terms since the start of competition, half of which is due to competition and half due to price cuts1 6.5 million have together saved \u00a383 million a yearby changing their electricity supplie r 3.9 million customers are saving \u00a354 millio n a year from dual fuel discounts 0.42 million customers have switched to direct debit saving \u00a36 million a yearSavings due to competition are \u00a3143 million: Savings due to Ofgem's price caps are some \u00a3156 million (Note) Note: These savings are due to Ofgem's controls over the prices transmission and distribution businesses charge suppliers for their network services. Source: NAO analysisGIVING DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS A CHOICE OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLIER 3executive summary7 Customers who have not changed supplier have also seen their bills reduced since competition was introduced. Ofgem's reduction of price caps for thedistribution and supply companies since competition began means thatcustomers who have not switched are paying lower prices overall by some\u00a3450 million a year (eight per cent), an average of \u00a323 per customer.Competition has allowed Ofgem to develop a clearer view of costs andavailable price reductions, and Ofgem believe that competition may also havehelped force down the prices paid to electricity generators for the electricitythey supplied. It may be therefore that supply price caps from April 2000 werelower than would have been the case in the absence of competition. 8 Of about 19 million customers who have remained with their existing supplier, four-fifths (15.4 million customers) have not yet, however, made any financialsavings, beyond those arising from the reduced price caps, on account ofsupply competition. This is because most of the 'incumbent' electricitycompanies that supply their electricity have not reduced their prices belowOfgem's price caps in response to competition. The remaining 4.2 millioncustomers have made savings due to competition in that their existing suppliershave reduced their tariffs a little below Ofgem's price caps. The savings to suchcustomers have been mostly no more than \u00a32 a year 6. 9 All customers are paying an extra \u00a34 each year on average to meet the costs companies incurred in introducing competition, which means that customerswho have not switched have not benefited financially to any significant extentsince competition was introduced, and some may have lost out slightly.Customers who have not switched have, however, been able to benefit from agreater range of tariffs and complementary products (such as gas) offered bytheir existing suppliers. 10 By June 2000, some 25 per cent of domestic customers had changed their electricity supplier - a slightly higher proportion of customers than had changed gas supplier one year after gas competition was introduced(23 per cent). The rate of switching in the gas and electricity markets is higherthan in many other British markets and overseas electricity markets. Mostcustomers who change supplier do so in response to direct contact from asupplier, often home visits by suppliers' sales agents and the relatively highlevel of switching in the electricity market is attributable to the effectiveness ofthis marketing technique. Doorstep selling has, however, given rise tocomplaints from customers, for example that sales agents had misled themabout the savings they would achieve if they switched or they had beenswitched without giving their consent. In the first year of electricity supplycompetition there were some 4,900 complaints. This represented1.06 complaints per thousand electricity switchers, a similar position as in thefirst year of domestic gas competition. 11 Although most customers who changed supplier found switching easy, there is a large variation in how long it takes to complete transfers to new suppliers. Inthe first two years of domestic electricity supply competition, some 18,800customers experienced problems with the switching process. Complaintstatistics suggest that the customers of some of the new suppliers are muchmore likely to have received a poor service after they have switched, forexample inaccurate and delayed bills. The standard of service provided by theincumbent suppliers to those who have not changed their supplier hasremained at a high level during the transition to competition and since. Customers who have remained with their existing supplier are better off dueto changes to price controls, but havenot otherwise benefited financially toany significant extent Switching levels in the domesticelectricity market are relatively high Customers who have switched supplierare more likely to have complaintsabout the service they receive 6 An exception is 250,000 customers who have not switched electricity supplier but are nonetheless benefitting from dual fuel discounts worth \u00a32.9 million a year, or over \u00a311 a year each, because they now buy gas from their local electricity company.4executive summaryGIVING DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS A CHOICE OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLIER 12 Although problems in changing supplier reported by customers are likely to understate the number of customers experiencing problems, surveysnevertheless suggest that those experiencing problems are a relatively smallproportion. Responsibility for maintaining supply to customers rests withdistribution businesses and has not, therefore, been directly affected bycompetition among suppliers. In September 2000, Independent Energy, a newsupplier with 240,000 electricity customers, went into receivership but thesecustomers continued to receive a supply of electricity on the same terms,because another company agreed to take them on. There are variations in the proportion of customers who have benefited financially from competition between different partsof the community 13 A survey in May/June 2000, which we commissioned in association with Ofgem, disclosed significant variations in the proportion of customers who hadswitched electricity supplier: a) Rural customers are less than half as likely to have changed their electricity supplier than those who live in urban areas. This is probably because manycustomers change their electricity supplier in response to a visit from a salesagent, and direct marketing of electricity has so far been less intensive inrural areas. b) The proportion of domestic customers switching supplier, and hence paying lower bills, is lower than average amongst poorer households (Figure 2) . A major reason for this disparity is that a higher than average proportion ofpoorer households use a prepayment meter. Customers who use aprepayment meter cost more to serve (even allowing for the greatercertainty of income), and few companies compete with the incumbents'tariffs. Ofgem allow the incumbents to recover some of the additional costsof supporting such meters by charging up to \u00a315 a year more to thecustomers concerned 7. c) Scotland has relatively more rural customers and customers using a prepayment meter than the rest of Britain. Even after allowing for this, asmaller proportion of customers in Scotland have changed their supplierthan in England and Wales. This may be because fewer electricity suppliershave actively marketed electricity in Scotland, which reflects the smallersize of the market, the high degree of customer loyalty to the twoincumbent suppliers and the more limited scope to offer dual fuel deals dueHow customers pay for their electricity and where they live has a significant effect on the likelihood that they will change their electricity supplier Source: NAO/Ofgem survey or moreFewer customers on low incomes have changed their electricity supplier than others have Customers who have changes their electricity supplier 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30%Annual household income 7 In October 2000, the average additional charge was \u00a312, ranging from \u00a30 in one case to \u00a315 in six cases.Although there have been problems, most customers find changing supplier easyGIVING DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS A CHOICE OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLIER 5executive summaryto the lower penetration of gas in northern Scotland. The different market structure whereby the incumbent suppliers also own the generation,transmission and distribution businesses in Scotland may also have had aneffect. Ofgem are acting to help more customers benefit from competition 14 The 19 million customers who have not switched supplier could save up to \u00a3674 million, or 13 per cent of their annual bills were they to switch. Beforethat happens there should come a point when incumbent suppliers' reduceprices in their home regions to stem the loss of customers, as has alreadyhappened in the domestic gas market. Ofgem have therefore sought to helpdomestic customers benefit from electricity supply competition: a) They have sought media coverage for the savings available to domestic customers in the electricity market. Most customers are aware that they canchoose their electricity supplier. Research commissioned by theDepartment of Trade and Industry has shown, however, that many do notknow the level of savings available or the names of alternative suppliers,and hence few customers shop around for the best deal and switchers havetended not to obtain the largest savings available in the market. b) They have made increasing amounts of comparative price and service information available to the public via a freephone helpline and website.These services reach relatively few customers, but Ofgem are investigatingwhether requiring suppliers to disclose prices in a standard format wouldmake it easier to draw comparisons, a task many customers find difficult.Information on quality of service is, however, still hard to obtain. c) They introduced new licence conditions governing selling practices in September 1998 following earlier complaints about the doorstep selling ofgas. Complaints about unfair selling practices in the first year of electricitycompetition were at a similar level to the first year of gas competition andOfgem therefore continue to monitor and take action on such problems. d) They are considering, in a fundamental review of the transfer process, how far aligning the different gas and electricity transfer processes could reducethe delays experienced by some customers. 15 Domestic electricity suppliers have so far competed mainly on price rather than on service, but Ofgem believe supply competition should eventually removethe need for specific regulation of customer service. Meanwhile, Ofgemregulate the quality and range of services suppliers provide. Ofgem recognisethe need to improve their monitoring of customer service, and will be workingwith the new Gas and Electricity Consumer Council 8, known as energywatch, to develop appropriate mechanisms. 16 The market is less well developed for prepayment meters and fewer prepayment customers have switched. Many suppliers consider prepaymentmeter customers to be unprofitable at current price levels and competitionshould tend to make tariffs more closely reflect costs. If Ofgem lift pricecontrols over the incumbents' prepayment meter tariffs they may, therefore,need to develop other ways of protecting such customers if they wish to avoidincreases in the relative prices they pay. Ofgem are already taking orconsidering several actions to help protect prepayment meter customers:Ofgem have sought to alert customers through the media to the savingsavailable by changing supplier Ofgem are seeking to help customersidentify the best deal Ofgem have sought to combat highpressure and misleading sellingpractices Ofgem are seeking to streamline thetransfer process Ofgem are seeking to improve theirmonitoring of customer service Ofgem will need to continue to protectcustomers who pay by prepaymentmeter until the market is competitive 8 The Gas and Electricity Consumer Council was established under the Utilities Act 2000. The Council, also known as energywatch, will take over from Ofgem the handling of complaints from electricity consumers, advising and informing them, and representing their views.a) They believe that competition would be strengthened if suppliers lost their right to block customers with outstanding debt from changing supplier, andare consulting on removing or curtailing this right, while protectingsuppliers' rights to recover debt. b) From October 2000, they have required suppliers to inform prepayment meter customers who are not in debt about cheaper ways to pay for theirelectricity. Many customers begin to use a prepayment meter when theymove into a new home already equipped with one. Because suppliers incurcosts when customers change their meter there was before then a risk thatthey might not tell customers about cheaper alternatives. 17 Ofgem research shows that many customers using prepayment meters prefer this method of payment, and some cannot switch to paying by cheque or directdebit because they do not have a bank account. New technology, however,offers opportunities to reduce the costs of prepayment meters, and Ofgem areexploring alternative payment methods for those without a bank account. 18 The possibility that new companies will enter the market places competitive pressure on existing suppliers, but fewer new companies have so far enteredthe domestic electricity market than the domestic gas market and entry barriersare higher than in the gas market. The Utilities Act 2000 provides Ofgem withpowers to reduce barriers to competition and help ensure that suppliers cancompete on equal terms. For example: a) Ofgem are empowered by the Act to prevent the same company from both supplying electricity and providing electricity distribution services, whichshould reduce the risk of distribution businesses giving their own supplybusiness preferential treatment. b) Ofgem consider that the lower rate of switching in Scotland relative to England and Wales is due in part to the dominance of the two incumbentelectricity suppliers in Scotland (paragraph 13c above), and the differentwholesale trading arrangements in Scotland. The Act provides for separatingthe ownership of distribution and supply businesses in Scotland, and forcreating separate electricity transmission companies for Scotland. Ofgemplan to align the wholesale trading framework in Scotland with that inEngland and Wales in 2002. 19 Ofgem expect the competitive market to continue to deliver choice and value for customers. They consider that larger savings could be achieved if suppliersseek to build a competitive advantage by driving down the 'wholesale' cost ofelectricity they buy from generating companies, as wholesale electricity pricesare about half of the price of electricity to customers. They believe that the newframework they plan to introduce in 2001 for buying and selling electricity onthe 'wholesale' market 9will aid this process. 'Wholesale' prices are, however, also affected by other factors such as fuel costs and Governmentencouragement of generators to switch to renewable fuel sources, which couldcause prices to rise. 6executive summaryGIVING DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS A CHOICE OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLIER Ofgem are seeking to protect the interests of prepayment meter customers and help them benefit from competition Ofgem are seeking to minimise barriers to entry and ensure all suppliers are able to compete on an equal footing Ofgem are addressing issues in Scotland, where a smaller proportion of customers have switched supplier than in the rest of Great Britain Ofgem expect that price reductions arising from competition will be sustainable 9 The new framework for trading electricity is known as the New Electricity Trading Arrangements. Ofgem had intended to introduce the new trading framework in November 2000. Following problems with systems testing, in October 2000 they announced a new target date of 27 March 2001 for implementing the new framework. For customers and suppliers 20 The achievement of the Government's objectives for introducing competition into the domestic supply of electricity ultimately relies on customers. We recommendthat customers, if they are to benefit fully from electricity supply competition,should review whether their current electricity supplier best meets their needs.They should take into account prices, quality of service and the scope for dealsthat can provide a range of services, including gas, from a single supplier,especially where the supplier offers a discount for doing so. We recommendsuppliers to help by keeping customers informed of the scope for benefits and ofthe latest developments. Suppliers may also be able to take advantage of changesin the way that electricity generators sell electricity and the availability of newtechnology, such as the internet, to offer customers better deals. For Ofgem 21 Ofgem have an important role to play in helping customers and suppliers make the most of the new market in domestic electricity. While Ofgem have takenmany actions to help develop a competitive market for electricity, we considerthat there are other actions that might prove worthwhile: i Improve customers' awareness of how to benefit from competition. If customers are to benefit from competition, they need to be able to makeinformed decisions as to whether it is worth changing supplier. Althoughmost are aware of competition, many are not aware of the savingsavailable, alternative companies in the market, and the different ways ofpaying for electricity. Many customers who have switched have relied ondoorstep selling for their information, which has meant that switchinglevels have been lower in rural areas. Ofgem have sought media coveragefor the financial savings available and have published comparative priceinformation on their website. Ofgem in 1999 distributed a leaflet,produced jointly with the National Audit Office, to gas customers, and wehave recommended that Ofgem should help us to produce a similarleaflet for energywatch to distribute to electricity customers. ii Improve the accessibility of price and service information. The increasing range of tariffs and services available from suppliers has madeit harder for customers to compare prices. Information on quality ofservice is hard to come by, and competition has largely been on price sofar. Ofgem should press ahead with their research on the feasibility ofrequiring suppliers to disclose prices in a standard format to makecomparisons easier, and consider extending this to include customerservice information. They and energywatch should also consider raisingthe profile of the comparative price and service data they continue toproduce to the extent that energywatch have not taken on theseresponsibilities. iii Act to reduce the problems customers experience when they change suppliers. Some customers have experienced problems when switching supplier such as misleading information from sales agents or delays inthe transfer process. Although such problems have so far affected a smallproportion of customers, the bad publicity engendered could erodeconsumer confidence. Ofgem therefore need to be able to quicklyidentify and remedy problems with the switching process, and shouldcontinue developing other sources of information such as mysteryGIVING DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS A CHOICE OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLIER 7executive summaryRecommendations8executive summaryGIVING DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS A CHOICE OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLIER shopping10. They should take timely action against suppliers that provide a sub-standard service. Once Ofgem have reviewed the transfer processthey should also act to streamline it, possibly by removing anyunnecessary differences between the electricity and gas transferprocesses. iv Continue to work with the industry to reduce the costs borne by prepayment meter customers. Prepayment meters are the most expensive payment method both for customers and suppliers, and thelimited competition to serve customers using these meters helps toexplain why lower income households have so far benefited less fromcompetition than others. Some customers use prepayment metersbecause they moved into a property already equipped with one, andOfgem should continue to encourage suppliers to make clear to thesecustomers that they could save money by changing payment method.Research shows, however, that some customers prefer to use aprepayment meter, while some cannot pay in other ways because theydo not have a bank account. Obtaining the full benefits of competitionfor these customers will probably require the development of cheaperways to serve them. Ofgem should therefore continue to support thedevelopment of cheaper payment options, for example by promoting thedevelopment of cheaper prepayment metering technology. v Press ahead with measures to strengthen competition in Scotland. The different market structure in Scotland has contributed to lower rates ofcustomer switching than in the rest of Great Britain. To make the marketin Scotland more competitive, Ofgem should press ahead withseparating the ownership of distribution, supply and transmissionbusinesses and bringing the framework for trading wholesale electricityinto line with that in England and Wales. vi Minimise barriers to entry to the electricity supply market. The possibility of new companies entering the market is an important sourceof competitive pressure on existing suppliers and new entrants can be animportant source of innovation. Fewer companies have so far entered thedomestic electricity market than have entered the domestic gas market.Barriers to entry are higher than in the domestic gas market and Ofgemare aligning the regulation of the two markets so that companies cancompete on an equal footing. Ofgem need to continue to monitor theimpact of entry barriers, and pay particular attention to the impact ofchanges such as the new wholesale electricity-trading framework inEngland and Wales to be introduced in 2001. 10 Mystery shopping involves seeking first hand experience as a consumer of the services companies are delivering. The mystery shopper does not reveal to the company that they are evaluating the standard of service provided.GIVING DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS A CHOICE OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLIER 9executive summaryFor energywatch The Utilities Act 2000 has established the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council, which will be known as energywatch. Their focus will be on the needsof electricity and gas consumers. They will have a key educational role to playin raising consumers ' awareness of the competitive electricity market, and hence in taking forward some of the actions recommended above. In particular,we recommend that energywatch: vii Improve customer awareness of electricity competition and how to make an informed choice. There would be a role for energywatch in ensuring that any leaflet produced by the National Audit Office (seerecommendation i above) receives wide circulation and publicity. Theyshould also seek to secure greater consumer awareness of the website,currently run by Ofgem, and the helpline for which energywatch arenow responsible, and to develop the value for consumers of these andother communication tools. viii Develop clear and consistent processes for monitoring and reviewing the performance of electricity companies. This will be an important r \u00f4le for energywatch working alongside Ofgem. As part of their remit,energywatch should seek to put quality of service information into thepublic domain in such a way that consumers can better understand itand make choices about different levels of performance. ix Help ensure that all parts of the community take advantage of the competitive market. Access to a competitive electricity supply market is not consistent across all classes of domestic consumers, and it might beunrealistic to expect this to be the case. There is, however, a role forenergywatch to keep under review how the market is developing andwhether there are groups of consumers who are being excluded from thefull benefits of competition, and to propose remedies.
