Bastyr, in collaboration with Community Health Centers of King County and the Statistics and Epidemiology Research Corp., will run and evaluate the clinic, to be located in Kent. County Executive Gary Locke selected Bastyr over two other finalists - Harborview Medical Center and Pacific Medical Center and Clinics. The selection comes nearly 16 months after the county council passed a motion to establish a government-subsidized natural medicine clinic. At a council hearing a month prior to the vote, health-care providers testified that massage, acupuncture, herbal remedies and other alternative treatments are effective and often cost less in the long run because they focus on preventive care. The natural medicine clinic, which will serve predominantly low-income, immigrant and refugee patients, has received a $750,000 start-up grant from the federal government. \"This contract recognizes that science-based natural medicine techniques do have a place in our health-care system,\" said Councilman Kent Pullen, a longtime natural medicine advocate. \"Natural medicine has proven itself in other cultures through centuries of use. My own family has benefited from the use of Chinese herbal medicines,\" Locke said. \"By blending natural medicine with conventional treatments, we can achieve the highest-quality health care at the most affordable cost.\" The clinic, which opens this fall, will be located at the Kent Community Health Center. \"We commend the King County Council for their vision and commitment to finding the best forms of health care for the people of King County,\" said Joe Pizzorno, president of Bastyr University. Bastyr is the only regionally accredited education and research center for alternative, natural medicine in the United States. "}
