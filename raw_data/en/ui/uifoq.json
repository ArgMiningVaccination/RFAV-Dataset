Despite continuing efforts to improve the inclusion of underserved groups in clinical research, gaps in diversity remain. Participation of special populations is especially important when facing problems of unprecedented complexity such as the COVID-19 pandemic. A better understanding of factors associated with the immune response in diverse populations would advance future preventive and curative approaches. The objective of this study was to investigate the factors potentially responsible for adverse events following COVID-19 immunization. The study population included adults from rural areas, transitional countries, and those with medically understudied conditions, across a broad age range. The study evolved from peer support networks developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were recruited digitally through online neighborhood and health communities. Some of the participants volunteered as study investigators assisting with offline recruitment and safety monitoring. Individuals who consented to participate were asked to share their vaccination experiences either using constantly evolving web-based surveys or via one-on-one communication. Inferential statistical analysis to estimate differences between study groups was performed using parametric and nonparametric tests. Of 1430 participants who shared their vaccination experiences, 648 had outcome measures at their 1.5-year follow-up. Significant differences were found between age groups, types of vaccine adverse events (VAEs), incidences of breakthrough infections, and health conditions linked to the microbiome. Pairwise comparisons showed that VAEs interfering with daily activities were significantly higher in both younger (18-59 years) and older age groups (80-100 years, The findings of this study demonstrate that vaccine adverse reactions in older individuals are being overlooked, and the incidence of VAEs impairing immunity may be higher than previously perceived. Better preventive measures are needed for all those at risk for life-threatening and long-term adverse events due to vaccination. Supportive community-based studies focusing on these populations could add important data to the current body of knowledge. Further and more comprehensive studies should follow. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04832932; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04832932 RR2-10.1101/2021.06.28.21256779 While COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, they can lead to a range of vaccine adverse events (VAEs). The mechanisms underlying VAEs and their association with vaccination efficacy are not completely clear. Traditional clinical trials are essential for understanding the safety profiles of new interventions, but many people would not enroll themselves. The COVID-19 Citizen Science study [ The idea for this study evolved as minority populations were struggling to make vaccination appointments owing to digital inequality, or seeking answers to questions about their pre-existing conditions, which were not addressed by funded research. A previously reported protocol for an ambispective study [ Participants were recruited from private e-neighborhood networks and health support groups via direct emails and social media posts. Particular efforts were made to recruit populations underrepresented in existing research data sets. Individuals with socially debilitating metabolic body odor (MEBO) [ Inclusion criteria were age18 years, intention to get vaccinated, and intended availability throughout the study period. No one was excluded for reasons other than age. The study's primary outcome was the incidence of adverse reactions within 14 days of immunization. The secondary outcome was long-term health conditions and the incidence of breakthrough COVID-19 infections that occurred post vaccination with either a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or with 2 or more doses. Details of the study procedures (the optional nature of all questions, how the information will be used, the ability to withdraw from research, risks, and benefits) were explained to the participants, and informed e-consent was obtained. Ethics approval for primary and secondary analysis was granted by the institutional review board of MEBO Research (IRB00010169, protocol 20210103MEBO). To ensure participant confidentiality, all their data were coded and stored in a decentralized manner with no individual having complete access to sensitive information. All identifiable data were removed from survey and interview responses. Neither participants nor investigators were compensated. Demographic and clinical characteristics of study groups were compared using the Fisher exact test and relative risk calculations for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney Participant characteristics are described in Basic descriptive and inferential statistics of the study population. |Characteristics||Vaccinated (n=1430)||1-year follow up cN/A: not applicable. The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) flow diagram in The bar charts in Incidence of breakthrough infections was significantly higher in participants younger than 40 years ( Another significant association was found between adverse reactions and the ability to avoid infection, but only if symptoms did not last longer than a week ( Overall, 5%-10% of individuals in chronic disease groups experienced exacerbation of their respective conditions following COVID19 immunization. The difference in the incidence of VAEs between healthy individuals and those with chronic conditions was not significant for all age groups ( There were no significant gender differences in the incidence of VAEs, but age distributions revealed significant differences: a greater risk of VAEs among younger males and higher all-cause mortality in older individuals ( CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) flow diagram.

Relative risk is shown as a solid line (dark blue: VAEs; orange: COVID-19). In summary, we found that adverse events following the COVID-19 immunization are likely to be influenced by a combination of demographic, genetic, and environmental factors. The principal findings of this study were (1) higher incidence of VAEs in both younger and the \"oldest old\" groups than in \"younger old\" populations, (2) association of VAEs with immunogenicity observed for short-term but not long-term adverse reactions, and (3) indications that disparities in host genetics and microbiomes in VAEs may exist. Age is a known factor contributing to reactogenicity. The heterogeneity is commonly addressed by splitting the sample in 2 groups with the cutoff age between 50 and 65 years [ Reporting of VAEs is higher in younger and more educated individuals [ Systemic adverse reactions have been found to be associated with a higher antibody response in mostly healthy younger [ Host genetic factors are known to contribute to the severity of COVID-19 [ The primary limitation of this study was that the data were obtained from self-reports. Our results demonstrate that vaccine adverse reactions in older populations can be easily overlooked. Long-term effects of vaccination in all age groups could outweigh the benefits of this preventive measure in some populations. More research is needed for genetic, epigenetic, metabolome-, and microbiome-associated risk factors of serious VAEs.
