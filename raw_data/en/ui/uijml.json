Abstract The thesis will highlight both qualitatively and qu antitatively that during the twentieth century the English population experienced unprecedented im provements in mortality and particularly morbidity, which has provided a substantial boost t o standards of living and economic development. Despite the extensiveness of these hea lth improvements, there have been a very limited number of attempts to evaluate and quantify these valuable improvements. None of the existing studies that quantitatively assess improve d health actually measure health per se, as they all utilise mortality as a proxy. Furthermore, there have been no historical studies that aim to map the evolution of improving health from the p erspective of quality of life for illness sufferers. The thesis will fill all of these voids through developing a quantitative health (mortality and morbidity) measuring tool that is ca pable of providing (monetary) estimates about the contribution of improved health to standa rds of living and economic developments in twentieth century England. This will be applied to key case study illnesses (blindness, breast cancer, stomach cancer and tuberculosis) and then extrapolated forward to include all illnesses which will be combined with mortality in order to provide an aggregate health index for twentieth century England. The results of this exercise provide a significant contribution to the twentieth century health and economic history of England. The thesis finding s that, at a most conservative estimate, the value of twentieth century health improvements is i n excess of 33 billion (1990 international $) substantially adds to a new view of the economic s of health and provides very valuable historical detail. This new view is that improvemen ts in health have been a major contributor to economic welfare in twentieth century England. P ut another way: the thesis will highlight that during the twentieth century increases in life expectancy and improvements in the quality of life associated with morbidity have provided a c onsiderable contribution to standards of living and the growth of GDP defined on a utility, 'Fisherian' basis, whereby economic growth nearly doubles, from 1.4 percent for GDP onl y versus 2.6 percent when GDP is adjusted for improved health.

Introduction During the twentieth century there were significant improvements in the life expectancy of the English population. Improvements in life expect ancy are one important manifestation of improvements in human welfare 1. Furthermore, improvements in the quality of life associated with illness increased, which provided i mportant contributions to the standards of living of the twentieth century English populati on. Despite the importance of improved health and the n umerous implications for standards of living and economic prosperity that these changes i n health have created, there have been a very limited number of attempts to evaluate and qua ntify these developments in mortality, and especially morbidity 2. The only studies that have attempted to value hea lth (in an extended form of GDP measure, i.e. through 'Fisheri an' type considerations 3) are Nordhaus (1999) 4 for the USA between 1900 and 1995, Crafts (2001) 5 for the UK between 1870 and 1998 and Hickson (2002) 6 for twentieth century Japan. However, none of thes e studies measure health per se, as they all utilise mortality (i.e. increased life expectancy) as a proxy for health. Efforts to measure the health of the population pos e a new, difficult and increasingly relevant challenge. Unprecedented gains in life exp ectancy accompanied by concerns related to the level of health in these extended li fe years have exacerbated the need to measure health per se and consider twentieth centur y improvements in the quality of life associated with health 7. The main reason for this shortage in health measure ments is related to the difficulty in trying to gauge actual levels of health. Reported l evels of morbidity have increased 1 Maddison, \"The World Economy: A Millennial Perspec tive\", p. 29 2 Nordhaus and Crafts are two of the few authors to make these considerations for mortality (as did Ush er, but not to the same extent). Cutler & Richardson and Murray & Chen are the only authors to make considerations about morbidity that are di rectly related to this thesis. 3 Fisherian growth is a notion that was coined by No rdhaus (1999) and is defined as the maximum amount that a nation can consume while ensuring that members of all future generations can have life time utility that is at least as high as that of current generations. When this yardstick is utilised, life expectancy is included in the production function and the value of improve ments in mortality can be accounted, in terms of consumption. See Appendix 12.16 for method ological algebra. 4 Nordhaus, \"The Health of Nations: The Contribution of Improved Health to Living Standards\" 5 Crafts (2005) \"The Contribution of Increased Life Expectancy to Growth of Living Standards in the UK, 1870-1998\". Retrieved 17 June 2005, from: www.york.ac.uk/res/wpeg/documents/craft s.pdf 6 Hickson, \"The Contribution of Improved Life Expect ancy to Standards of Living in Twentieth Century Ja pan\", MSc Thesis (2002), London School of Economics and Political Science 7 Cutler & Richardson have considered the improved q uality of life associated with illness for the USA, during the last thirty years of the twentieth century. These considerations have not be en made for England, and consequently this is one o f the knowledge gaps that the thesis will fill. Introduction - 10 - throughout the twentieth century (in developed econ omies) for many reasons, some of which are not exclusively related to health (which will be explained in detail in Section 2.2). Moreover, health is an extremely subjective n otion. These two factors have meant that, to-date the complications associated with mea suring health are virtually insurmountable. Consequently, existing health measu res are very specialised and limited, as they only achieve a predetermined narrow objecti ve, usually for clinical outcomes research or policy investigations and predictions. There have been no historical studies that aim to m ap the evolution of improving health from the perspective of quality of life for illness sufferers. To do this would require considerations about the shifting burden of disabil ity, disease and death. It would also require deliberations about the contribution of imp rovements in medical technology, which have probably adversely affected the prevalence of disease, but have also reduced the negativities associated with ill health, and conseq uently provided an overall contribution to health related quality of life. Furthermore, because of the dogmatic scope of exist ing health measures, very few have adopted a multifaceted stance and included as many variables as is desirable to fully consider health, as: \"not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, he alth is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being\" 8. This situation has inspired two key questions, whic h will be answered by the thesis: 1. What was the extent and value of improvements in he alth (mortality and morbidity) during different periods of the twentieth century i n England? 2. What has been the impact of improved health upon st andards of living and the overall health related welfare of the population in twentie th century England? These questions will be answered throughout the rem ainder of the thesis. Chapter 2 will examine the theoretical, practical and historical c ontext of the thesis. This will include a detailed investigation into the existing literature and theories related to health and health measurement and a detailed evaluation of England's health in the twentieth century. 8 Preamble to the Constitution of the WHO as adopted as the definition of health since 1948: World Heal th Organisation (2005): \"Constitution of the World Health Organisation\".

It will highlight how the qualitative i llnesses chapters contribute to the quantitative results of the thesis. Chapter 3 will also provide a detailed explanation about the thesis (extended willingness to pay or Quality Adjusted Life Expectancy [QALE]) methodology. This will also entail an outline of ho w the QALE will be applied and the array of sensitivity analyses that will be included in the thesis methodology. Part II of the thesis will present the qualitative analysis of the twentieth century health and welfare situations faced by sufferers of the thesis illnesses, namely, blindness, tuberculosis and cancer (breast and stomach). These chapters of the thesis will provide the analysis which bolsters the quantitative results, which will be presented in Part III of the thesis. The final part of the thesis will provide the resul ts which will contain the application of the QALE methodology, to the thesis illnesses, in order to derive estimates about the (monetary) value of improved health. This contains two broad sections: one which provides the summary qualitative results and their subsequent evolution into quantitative indices and one which presents the subsequent quant itative results. This part of the thesis will also contain a variety of sensitivity analysis approaches and simulation exercises, which will be employed to provide a range of QALE g ain results for the three illnesses in different eras of the twentieth century 9. Part III of the thesis is concluded with the Extended Results chapter, which develops earlier re sults in order to generate a lower bound estimate about the value of twentieth century healt h, in its entirety. Finally, these results will be complemented by the thesis conclusions in Chapter 10, which will summarise the key questions of the thesis: Wha t was the extent and value of improvements in health (mortality and morbidity) du ring different periods of the twentieth century in England? And, what has been the impact o f improved health upon standards of living and the overall health related welfare of th e population in twentieth century England? The thesis will conclude by defining the k ey contribution to knowledge of this analysis. 9 Although there are actually four illnesses analyse d in this thesis (namely: breast cancer, stomach ca ncer, blindness and tuberculosis) breast and stomac h cancer will be considered in a combined chapter and therefore, in general, 3 types of illness will be considered.

Although much of this debate revolves around the ti me period that precedes that of the thesis and the results of the thesis do not contrib ute significantly to this debates, the key themes of this debate will be outlined to provide a n indication of the state of health in England at the beginning of the twentieth century a nd the grand theories most associated with the thesis topic. The debate is also relevant for the thesis because it illustrates the influence of factors other than medical technology as important for early twentieth century health improvements. 2.1.1.1 Historical Theories / Debate about Health I mprovements The debate was initiated by McKeown (1976) in the m iddle of the twentieth century, who contemplated whether the reduction in mortality ach ieved in England and Wales since 1750 and particularly 1850, was primarily a by-prod uct of improved standards of living, as manifested primarily in levels of nutritional intak e, or whether it was attributed to technical improvements in the means of preventing premature d eath 10 . McKeown established the foundations of his theory t hrough classifying the following major causes of disease: 1. An autonomous change in the character of diseases. I.e. a decline in the virulence of the micro-organism itself 11 . 10 In its fully developed form, McKeown originally pr esented a grandiose all-encompassing thesis account ing for Britain's demographic growth since the early eighteenth century, which included claims abo ut the relationship between fertility and mortality as well as claims about the causes of declining mortality. The demographic aspects of McKeown's the sis will not be considered here as they are not imp ortant to the thesis. 11 McKeown, \"The Modern Rise of Population\", p. 89 Context: Theoretical - 13 - 2. An improvement in the overall environment so as to reduce the chances of initial exposure to potentially harmful organisms 12 . This could either be: a. Through prevention. I.e. as a result of scientific advances in immunisation techniques b. Through a reduction in the exposure to diseases. I. e. achieved with public health policy (municipal sanitation or hygiene impr ovements) designed to sanitise the urban environment. 3. An improvement in the human victims' defensive reso urces after initial exposure to hostile organisms 13 . This could occur either: a. Through treatment. I.e. the development of effectiv e scientific and medical methods for treating symptoms b. Via an increase in the level and quality of the exp osed population's average nutritional intake. I.e. better and more abundant f ood, thereby improving the individual's own natural defences. McKeown's strategy was then to consider the potenti al influence of each of these prospective causes, and systematically explain away factors other than nutrition ( 3b ), as key for the mortality decline. Through a simplistic process of deduction (outlined below), McKeown arrived at his conclusions about the paramo unt importance of nutritional factors. McKeown began by explaining away the potential for a change in the nature of diseases (1), through claiming that there was no evidence or c onsensus to suggest that there had been a change in the scientific configuration of di sease and the virulence of micro- organisms. However others have claimed the contrary . For example, Magill has attributed the decline in deaths from pneumonia to a change in the nature of the disease 14 . And more generally, Griffith attributed the eighteenth centu ry decline in mortality to medical advances, which changed the nature of disease 15 . McKeown continued by dismissing the environment and potential exposure ( 2a and 3a ) through his claims that: \"Certainly...no one...has sufficient therapeutic proof to argue that the drugs available at the turn of the century were sufficiently potent to have initiated the 12 McKeown, \"The Modern Rise of Population\", p. 91 13 Ibid 14 Griffith, \"Population Problems of the Age of Malth us\" 15 Ibid Context: Theoretical - 14 - precipitous drop in mortality\" 16 . McKeown offers further substance for this claim t hrough a consideration about the timing of the introductio n of therapy and the decline in major diseases: with the exception of smallpox and diphth eria, the dates at which either effective immunisation procedures or medical treatment became available were often far too late in time to be attributed to anything more than the fin al, marginal declines of these diseases 17 . This process leaves two possible causal factors: pu blic health measures this hurdle through considerin g the aetiology of the key diseases and grouping them into either 'water and food borne diseases' or 'air borne diseases'. The latter were much more significant for the mor tality decline (as they were more infectious and subsequently rife). According t o McKeown, 'air borne diseases' could only have been reduced as a result of improved resi stance in the population, which could only have been brought about through improved dieta ry status ( 3b ). Therefore, using this a priori argument, McKeown cl aimed that his data were able to show that the air borne category of disease was responsi ble for the major decline in death rates and that this constituted irrefutable evidence that improved nutrition had been the cause of the British mortality decline 18 . Furthermore, McKeown felt it legitimate to extrap olate these findings backwards (into the eighteenth centu ry) and forward (into the later part of the twentieth century), on the seeming assumption t hat the mortality decline was a linear process across all three centuries 19 . Preston (1975) has identified one of the major inac curacies of McKeown's assumptions through his considerations about the relationship b etween mortality and per capita income. McKeown's theory of nutritional developments implie s a relatively unitary relationship between economic developments and improvements in m ortality, through his suggestions that these improved health dimensions (embodied in improved nutrition) can be conceived as direct functions of changes in a country's per c apita real income 20 . Preston has conducted an international cross-country study, whi ch considers the relationship between mortality and income, and has concluded, \"It is difficult to devise a plausible model in which the rate of change of mortality is a direct f unction of the level of income\" 21 . 16 McKeown et al, \"An Interpretation of the Decline o f Mortality in England and Wales during the Twentie th Century\", p. 410 17 Ibid 18 Szreter, \"The Importance of Social Intervention in Britain's Mortality Decline c. 1850-1914: A Re-int erpretation of the Role of Public Health\", p. 10 19 Ibid 20 Ibid 21 Preston, \"The Changing Relationship between Mortal ity and Level of Economic Development\", p. 233 Context: Theoretical - 15 - Furthermore, in his study, Preston rules out nutrit ion (and literacy) as fundamental mortality change agents in favour of the major cont ribution of inoculation and vaccination 22 . Other authors have placed more importance upon lite racy, female education and state programmes to promote mortality improvements. Caldw ell (1979) and others have conducted a series of international and historical studies and concluded that personal health behaviour has been important in the prevention of i nfectious diseases, as has the pivotal role of government programmes in speeding mortality improvements 23 . Many of McKeown's critics have pointed out that whi le improved nutrition might be part of the story, McKeown's theory has given too little credit to public health measures and medicine 24 . One of the most famous proponents of this argumen t is Szreter. The period from the late 1830s to 1875 has come to be seen as encompassing a 'heroic age' of pioneering advances in public health activism and l egislation, and the period thereafter was also marked by activity from local governments and municipalities 25 . This inspired numerous developments, for example, improved water systems and sanitation and a great reduction in 'water borne disease' mortality. Furth ermore, the problems of housing quality and quantity were gradually being alleviated and th ere was an expansion of local health and maternity services and regulation of milk suppl y (which was recognised by McKeown) 26 . These developments helped to foster the later dec line in infant mortality, which occurred during the first three decades of th e twentieth century. Therefore, the McKeown theory, which implies that t he invisible hand of living standards conceived as an inevitable by-product of economic g rowth, facilitating an improvement in nutritional status, cannot take the leading role as the mechanism for Britain's mortality decline 27 . Although his thesis is valuable as it emphasises the limited role of medical technology before the twentieth century, which is o ften carelessly overlooked by historians, there are many inaccuracies and fundame ntal components that McKeown has disregarded in his dogmatic allegiance to the impor tance of nutritional factors 28 . Hence, 22 Preston, \"The Changing Relationship between Mortal ity and Level of Economic Development\", p. 243 23 Preston, \"Population Studies of Mortality\", p. 533 24 Frank & Mustard, \"The Determinants of Health from a Historical Perspective\", p. 5 25 Szreter, \"The Importance of Social Intervention in Britain's Mortality Decline c. 1850-1914: A Re-int erpretation of the Role of Public Health\", p. 21 26 Szreter, \"The Importance of Social Intervention in Britain's Mortality Decline c. 1850-1914: A Re-int erpretation of the Role of Public Health\", p. 32 27 Szreter, \"The Importance of Social Intervention in Britain's Mortality Decline c. 1850-1914: A Re-int erpretation of the Role of Public Health\", p. 35 28 McKeown, \"A Sociological Approach to the History o f Medicine\", p. 342 Context: Theoretical - 16 - public works, sanitation, improved housing and mate rial standards of living, improved nutrition, medical and scientific developments all contributed to the decline in mortality. 2.1.1.2 Implications of Changes The health transition began in Northwest Europe dur ing the eighteenth century and was well under way by the middle of the nineteenth cent ury, taking the form of a continuing, although not always consistent rise in life expecta ncy 29 . These increases continued into the twentieth century, which experienced some of the mo st impressive increases in life expectancy: from approximately 50 years at the begi nning of the twentieth century to nearly 80 years by the close of the century. Howeve r, accompanying these improvements in mortality has been an increase in the population prevalence of chronic diseases and disabilities. This has occurred as a result of the dynamic between mortality and morbidity, which has often been referred to as the 'substitute morbidity and mortality' effects, defined as \"that disease and mortality which results from a de crease in another specific disease\"30 . Hence, during the twentieth century, health has b een gained on the one hand due to the reduction and elimination of one particu lar disease category (infectious), however this gain has been somewhat lost on the oth er hand because of other diseases replacing the original disease category (non-infect ious, chronic). The epidemiological character of twentieth century Britain has come to resemble a scenario of disease without death and consequently a seemingly increased burden of illness. Over the course of the century, the balanc e between death and disease has shifted towards a longer life but with proportionately more suffering and disabilities. These twentieth century changes in the burden of disease and death raise numerous questions about the standards of living associated with healt h. 2.1.2 Epidemiological Transition 2.1.2.1 What is the Epidemiological In 1971, Abdel Omran detected an 'epidemiological t ransition', consisting of a passage from a regime in which there was a conversion of th e pattern of mortality from one dominated by infectious diseases to one dominated b y chronic degenerative diseases, this 29 Riley, \"Rising Life Expectancy: A Global History\", p. 33 30 Van de Water, \"Health Expectancy and the Problem o f Substitute Morbidity\", p. 1820 Context: Theoretical - 17 - also entails a decline in the death rates accompani ed by a seemingly paradoxical increase in morbidity rates 31 . 2.1.2.2 What Happened to Twentieth Century Mortalit y and Morbidity? A major component of England's twentieth century ep idemiological transition has been the decline in the death rate and the increase in life expectancy, which have both meant that there has been a radical increase in the number of people surviving to old age 32 . The increasing average age of the population is also re inforced by the change in the composition of fatal diseases, as degenerative dise ases kill at much older ages than infectious disease, and therefore this transition i n the causes of death is characterised by a general redistribution of deaths from young to olde r ages 33 . The epidemiological transition also describes the s hift in the burden of illness, which has been experienced in twentieth century England. At t he beginning of the twentieth century the major killers were infectious epidemics. By the end of the twentieth century the major killers were chronic degenerative illnesses. Hence cancer, heart disease and cardiovascular disease represented the main killers and the most p revalent illnesses, by a significant majority at the close of the twentieth century, whi ch marks a stark contrast with the pattern of illness one hundred years earlier when tuberculo sis and whooping cough dominated the mortality burden. The link between ill health and death has a further dimension, which the epidemiological transition literature addresses. In the vast majori ty of the literature concerning public health and historical changes in the level of health, and even grand theories about the state of health, many have inaccurately used mortality as a proxy for morbidity. During certain situations this proxy is acceptable, for example, w hen many illnesses within the disease profile of a population cause death in a significan t number of the people affected (usually at least five percent) and when this level of case fatality rates remains stable. Hence, in strict epidemiological terms, this is considering t he relationship between mortality and the risk of falling sick. During eras before the twenti eth century, when the clinical course of most sicknesses was brief (eight weeks or less) and most sicknesses were resolved quickly (by either recovery or death), this association was acceptable 34 . 31 Omran, \"The Epidemiological Transition: A Theory o f the Epidemiology of Population Change\" 32 Riley, \"The Risk of Being Sick: Morbidity Trends i n Four Countries\", p. 405 33 Olshansky & Ault, \"The Fourth Stage of the Epidemi ological Transition: The Age of Delayed Degenerativ e Diseases\", p. 356 34 Riley, \"The Risk of Being Sick: Morbidity Trends i n Four Countries\", p. 405 Context: Theoretical - 18 - Throughout the twentieth century it became increasi ngly necessary to look further than death rates when considering changes in health and the quality of life associated with illness. This was a result of the inability of deat h rates to approximate sickness rates, which is most vividly illustrated by the following mechan isms. First, over time the case fatality rate may describe a different trend than the death rate 35 . Second, not all sicknesses pose a significant risk to death, which became increasingl y true as the twentieth century unfolded. As a result of developments in health, the average duration of an illness has increased. For example, treatment of most chronic degenerative dis eases does not cure these sicknesses they only ameliorate the symptoms and prolong the p eriod of illness preceding death. The theory of the epidemiological transition implies a shift in the average duration of illness in general, rather than merely in diseases causing dea th, which is an increasingly important distinction for the time period being considered in the thesis. A further advantage of considering the changing bur den of illness through the framework of the epidemiological transition is for the import ant distinction it provides between the risks of falling sick, which is a measure of incide nce and the risk of being sick, which is a measure of prevalence. By the onset of the twentiet h century, previous developments in public health, sanitation, nutrition, and early med ical advances had reduced the risk of falling sick and in turn increased the risk of bein g sick. Hence, by the end of the twentieth century, most of the population survived to the boundary of entering old age, but much of the popul ation survived with illness and injuries that occupied increasing time. From this perspectiv e the epidemiological transition can be defined more broadly as a shift in the leading caus es of death from acute to chronic diseases and therefore a shift from brief to protra cted diseases. A society that has gone through such a transition gains additional life yea rs, some in good health and some in poor health. This is the central trend that is reflected in the thesis, which will consider the value of these additional (disease burdened) life years, in terms of individual quality of life and health related welfare of the population as a whole . 2.1.2.3 Implication of the Epidemiological Transiti on in General The situation and events which encompass the epidem iological transition (outlined above) combined with the shortage of empirical evidence de picting long term trends in chronic 35 Case Fatality Rate = Refers to the proportion of p ersons with a particular disease who die. I.e. The number of persons dying due to a particular disease Context: Theoretical - 19 - disease has resulted in a wide range of opinions an d theories about: the meaning of current trends in health, the outlook for future scenarios, and the general nature of the link between mortality and morbidity. One of the most pessimistic theories to evolve from the epidemiological transition is the 'failure of success' hypothesis. Proponents of this theory, most notably, Kramer (1980) and Gruenberg (1977), have connected medical improvemen ts (for example, the introduction of sulfa, penicillin, Aureomycin, Terramycin, etc) wit h the postponement of death, rather than a universal improvement in health. Consequently, in stead of diminishing disease and enriching life, the twentieth century products of m edical developments have served more to prolong disease and increase the proportion of t he population suffering from disabling and chronic illnesses 36 . This is vividly highlighted through a considerati on of the twentieth century changes in the prognosis of Down's syndrome . As a result of twentieth century (1940s) medical developments, the life expectancy o f some individuals with Down's syndrome has been extended from early adolescence t o seventy years. The net effect has been a doubling or quadrupling of the prevalence of Down's syndrome in the population 37 . These delay of death effects are also significant f or numerous other disorders, for example, arteriosclerosis, schizophrenia, diabetes, spina-bi fida, etc 38 . Hence, the key message of the 'failure of success' school is the claim that twentieth century scientific developments in medical care hav e only made achievements in life- saving technologies, rather than health preserving technologies, and that the net effect has been to worsen the population's health and furtherm ore, without a concentrated effort to search for preventable causes of chronic illnesses there will be no further enhancements in human health 39 . An alternative, optimistic perspective is the theor y of 'dynamic equilibrium'. This optimistic view claims that in the long term, chron ic illness will be confined to the last few years of life so that the proportion of healthy lif e will increase. Certain policy makers, for example, Marshal (1975) in the UK and Robine (1986) in the USA have adhered to this utopian opinion 40 . 36 Gruenberg, \"The Failure of Success\", p. 5 37 Murray & Chen, \"Understanding Morbidity Change\", p . 495 38 Ibid 39 Failure of Success\", p. 22 40 Bebbington, \"The Expectation of Life without Disab ility in England and Wales\", p. 321 Context: Theoretical - 20 - Along a similar vein is the theory of the 'compress ion of morbidity', coined by Fries (1989), which envisages a reduction in illness by p ostponing the age of onset of chronic infirmity relative to the average life duration, su ch that the period of morbidity is compressed between an increasing age of onset and a relatively fixed life expectancy 41 . This model requires the effects of preventative int erventions to have a greater effect on morbidity than mortality and is also dependent upon the population adhering to favourable personal health habits 42 . A final theory, which entails the most optimism abo ut future health trends, is the 'fourth stage' of the epidemiological transition hypothesis . Olshansky (1986) claims that the next phase in mortality and morbidity evolution will be marked by a decline in degenerative diseases. These predictions are bolstered by the im provements in chronic diseases that were achieved in America during the final decades o f the twentieth century, for example, the decline in heart disease (by more than 20 perce nt between 1968 and 1978) and reductions in the death rates for cancer and stroke s since the early 1970s 43 . Due to the nature of increased survival and the cha nge in the burden of morbidity and causes of mortality, many of these aforementioned t rends and theories are not illogical. However, to claim that health and standards of livi ng associated with it have worsened, a la Gruenberg and Kramer, seems overly pessimistic. Thi s will be justified by the thesis, through applying the thesis' original health evalua tion methodology to twentieth century health in order to provide estimates about the valu e (direction and magnitude) of improved mortality and morbidity, which will enable the thes is to commentate on the plausibility of the above theories. 2.1.2.4 Implication of the Epidemiological Transiti on for the Thesis The theory of the epidemiological transition is use ful for highlighting the relationship between mortality and morbidity, although it does n ot extend to quality of life considerations. The thesis will consider the nature of the additional life years which have been fostered by the substantial and unprecedented twentieth century improvements in longevity. 41 Fries, \"The Compression of Morbidity: Near or Far\" , p. 208 42 Feldman, \"Work Ability of the Aged under Condition s of Improving Mortality\", p. 441 43 Olshansky & Ault, \"The Fourth Stage of the Epidemi ological of Delayed Degenerativ e Diseases\", p. 358 Context: Theoretical - 21 - First, the increasing average age of the population (which is indicative of improvements in life expectancy and the death rate) was a result of the changing nature and declining virility of diseases. Infectious epidemics kill (typically c hildren and young adults), whereas this is not the case for chronic degenerative diseases (whi ch take their victims in old age). This has ramifications for the increase in life expectan cy (mentioned above) and also for the increased proportion of healthy life years. Second, the change in the case fatality rate has fa cilitated a more favourable relationship between the chances of contracting an illness and s ubsequently dying from that particular illness. At the onset of the twentieth century the case fatality rate was much higher, which essentially means that the chances of illness close ly foregoing death were much higher. Along a similar vein, it will also be necessary to consider the changing dynamic between incidence and prevalence throughout the twentieth c entury. Third, the general result of the epidemiological tr ansition, which states that there has been a gain in life years enjoyed by the average individ ual but that not all of these additional life years are in good health will be evaluated by the t hesis. This trend is undeniable, but the prospect of improving comfort in ill health, and co nsequently more valuable life years, even when overshadowed by morbidity, has been compl etely overlooked in the literature to date. The thesis will fill this void through consid erations about the changing quality of life years associated with different illnesses during th e twentieth century. Lastly, the thesis will highlight the profound dist inction between mortality and morbidity and through close attention to both and a detailed analysis will polarise the error of using death rates as a proxy for health, especially as th e twentieth century unfolded. 2.1.3 Choice of Thesis Illnesses The epidemiological transition provides the most de scriptive and authentic theory about the trends in twentieth century mortality and morbi dity and consequently provides the best framework for the selection of illnesses for consid eration in the thesis. It is not possible to include all illnesses because of time constraints a nd also because of the changing classification of illnesses and other complications , which would make the task impossible. Therefore the thesis will consider illnesses that c orrelate with the principles of the epidemiological transition. I.e. the illnesses eval uated in the thesis will reflect the move from infectious epidemics (e.g. tuberculosis) to ch ronic degenerative diseases (e.g. breast Context: Theoretical - 22 - and stomach cancer). These illnesses will be consid ered qualitatively and quantitatively in order to generate numerical counterfactual estimate s about the monetary value of improvements in health. Blindness will also be cons idered to provide a proxy for disabilities. The reasons for selecting these parti cular morbidity states will be outlined in Chapter 3: Section 3.4.

However, there are numerous problems with the measu rement of health, which are outlined below. 2.2.2 Epidemiological Transition Forces 2.2.2.1 Substitution Effect The substitution effect is interlinked with the cor e of the epidemiological transition. The changing burden of disease, i.e. the move from infe ctious to chronic has meant that the average time of illness preceding death has increas ed significantly as degenerative and protracted illnesses have replaced acute illnesses. This has been further exacerbated by medical developments, which are increasingly able t o prolong life in the diseased state but are unable to cure the disease. Pessimists identify thi s as an indication of worsening health, with their references to the prolonged average duration of certain diseases and disabilities, rather than producing cures 44 . 44 Gruenberg, \"The Failure of Success\", p. 5 Context: Practical - 24 - A more optimistic stance is taken by those who reco gnise that sicknesses are lasting longer as a result of improvements in medical technology, whi ch means that they are resolved in disease management rather than death. The positive change i n the nature of the key illnesses has meant that on the whole, diseases with a long cours e and low incidence have replaced illnesses with a short course and high incidence 45 . The longer duration of these long course diseases exceeds their lower incidence in its effect on sick ness time in the population 46 . 2.2.2.2 Composition Effect In each successive period within an era of declinin g mortality, the population composition changes such that people who would have died earlie r in the preceding regime are now living longer, and these 'new survivors' are, on average, more likely to experience health problems 47 . Therefore, by virtue of improvements in medical tec hnology, more morbid prone individuals are being kept alive. Consequently (despite the imp rovement in their death rate) they are contributing to a 'failure of success' type increas e in the mortality burden, as there was no cure for their morbidity (only for their potential mortality) throughout the twentieth century. This phenomenon became increasingly evident during the antibiotic era. 2.2.2.3 Time Effect The claim of this theory is that there has been an increase in ill health as a result of improvements in survey and diagnostic methods. Henc e, because diseases, especially chronic ones, are being detected earlier and the life expec tancy with these diseases is increasing, the prevalence of these diseases has risen, albeit part ially artificially. Increasingly over time medical science has introduc ed a variety of means of surveillance and detection, and these techniques were applied to a r ising proportion of the population. This meant that individuals were found to be sick sooner than they would have been without these screening and diagnostic innovations, and are addin g to the prevalence of disease statistics, without a worsening per se in the general health le vel of the population 48 . This time effect is sometimes referred to as the 'early patients' pheno menon, as it depicts people being included 45 Kumar, \"Low Mortality and High Morbidity in Kerala Reconsidered\", p. 117 46 Ibid 47 Verbrugge, \"Longer Life but Worsening Health? Trend s in Health and Mortality of Middle Aged and Older Persons\", p. 515 48 Morrison, \"Screening and Chronic Disease\" Context: Practical - 25 - in morbidity statistics earlier than they had tradi tionally been as a result of the improved ability to detect disease in earlier stages, e.g. h ypertension, hypercholesterolemia, etc. Therefore, although reported levels of illness have increased, this is for reasons not strictly related to health. The thesis measurement will be c apable of illustrating health improvements that will be isolated from these seemingly perverse effects of the epidemiological transition. 2.2.3 Social Forces 2.2.3.1 Health Expectations As economies develop and the population becomes wea lthier and enjoys a general increase in their standards of living they also become more sen sitive to health and adopt more stringent expectations about suitable levels of health. For e xample, at the end of the twentieth century, morbidity levels were highest in the wealthiest cou ntries 49 . This positive correlation between national income and reported levels of morbidity pr ovides a likely contribution to part of the rise in morbidity in twentieth century England. 2.2.3.2 Stock of Diseases The above mentioned personal relaxing of the distin ction between wellness and illness is also evident from physicians, as they also seem to have lowered the threshold of sickness 50 . As a result, conditions that would not have been regarde d as health problems earlier are now recognised as such, e.g. depression and glandular f ever. Although it is difficult to explicitly test and approximate the magnitude of this effect, there is clear historical evidence that shows a rising trend in the range of conditions regarded as ailments 51 . Additionally, as a result of medical developments, there is an increasingly recognised stock of diseases and diagnosable conditions, which creates the potential for physicians and patients to diagnose and register their ill health with a disor der. In this sense the incidence rate and overall morbidity in a population is a function of the (increasingly) recognised stock of diseases 52 . 49 Johansson, \"The Health Transition: The Cultural In flation of Morbidity During the Decline of Mortalit y\", p. 40 50 Riley, \"The Risk of Being Sick: Morbidity Trends i n Four Countries\", p. 419 51 Riley, \"The Risk of Being Sick: Morbidity Trends i n Four Countries\", p. 419 52 Johansson, \"The Health Transition: The Cultural In flation of Morbidity During the Decline of Mortalit y\", p. 44 Context: Practical - 26 - 2.2.4 Economic Incentives Some researchers have considered the effects of eco nomic incentives for encouraging people to more willingly present themselves as sick. This is a product of the notion that labour force participation may become less attractive as a resul t of the provision of alternative sources of more easily obtained income, such as disability pay ments 53 . Wolfe and Haveman (1990) illustrate the correlation between the proportions of registered disabled people in America and the level of disabil ity payments over a twenty-year period. In 1962: 7 percent, in 1973: 11 percent and in 1980: 9 .5 percent of working age men were classified as disabled 54 . In combination with this trend, the generosity of disability welfare payments also display a 'hump shaped' pattern 55 . These inferences are also consistent with the findings of other authors who have suggested that p erhaps one third of the rise in disability rates has been due to the generosity of disability transfer policy 56 . A further type of economic incentive that is potent ially increasing registered levels of morbidity is the availability and accessibility of health service facilities. The use of healthcare services can increase morbidity, as the provision o f subsidised healthcare is likely to provide an incentive to seek medical help earlier and more frequently. Consequently, ailments are diagnosed more frequently, rapidly and in some case s unnecessarily and this creates a pseudo worsening in the prevalence of disease 57 . Therefore these types of social forces all combine to alter the meaning of illness prevalence data. Hence, the same environment of mortality in 1 900 would appear much more detrimental in 2000, because of the change in social attitudes towards illness and because of the magnitude of genuine health improvements. The problem for mea suring historical levels of health that this poses is the impossibility of separating the i nfluences of these social forces from actual changes in health. Consequently, a different angle for considering and measuring health needs to be employed in the thesis. This will be achieved through making considerations about the quality of life associated with these illnesses. Fo r example, even though the prevalence of 53 Riley, \"The Risk of Being Sick: Morbidity Trends i n Four Countries\", p. 420 54 Wolfe & Haveman, \"Trends in the Prevalence of Work Disability from 1962 to 1984, and their Correlates \", p. 59 55 Ibid 56 For example, Bailey, \"Ageing and the Ability to Wo rk: Policy Issues and Recent Trends\", and Chirikos, \"Accounting for the Historical Rise in Work Disabi lity Prevalence\" 57 Certain passing ailments are being recognised and registered, whereas in earlier times these would ha ve been resolved (in death or recovery) without med ical attention and subsequent registration. Context: Practical - 27 - arthritis or diabetes has increased between 1900 an d 2000, the burden of these illnesses was considerably lower by the close of the century, as a result of improvements in medical therapy which have increased the quality of life associated with these ailments. The benefit of this approach is that the above distortions are overcome . 2.2.5 Recent Studies that Measure Mortality and Mor bidity During the last quarter of the twentieth century th ere was mounting attention directed towards the concept of measuring health and evaluating the genuine changes in morbidity, as well as those for mortality. The majority of studies and me asures of health have been conducted by two broad groups: social policy experts and health sector professionals. Both of these groups are dispersed between the public and private sector . Additionally, there is a peripheral and hybrid collection of professionals with an interest in considering the changes in health. Also on the margin are those who provide commentary abou t the authenticity of measurement techniques in general. The majority of these critic s are economists and philosophers, who have an understanding about notions of utility and measu rement. Despite the significant and varied pool of potentia l health measurers, there is a dearth of efforts to consider the changes in health, gauge th ese in a quantitative manner and also to consider broader implications than just health. The table below provides a brief explanation of the most prominent approaches to measuring health, which are largely attributable to medical professionals and secondly, social policy experts.

Census information on disease. 63 Cutler & Richardson, \"Your Money or Your Life: The Value of Health and what Affects It\" 64 The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is the National Centre for Health Statistics' (NCHS) annu al, nationwide survey of about 36,000 households in the U.S. This is a principal source of information on the health of the civilian non-institutionalised popula tion. It has been conducted every year since 1957. As such, it is one of the most significant sources of health data on the US population. The NHIS incl udes a set of core questions which change very infrequently, as well a s a series of supplemental special topic questions that are modified from year-to-year in response to current interest and need for data. The core quest ions make up about 50 percent of the questionnaire and provide e stimates of acute conditions, injuries, restriction of activity due to chronic conditions, respondent- assessed health status, and the use of medical serv ices, including physician contacts and short-stay hospitalisation.

The most common and increasingly popular method of assessing health is through subjective evidence about an individual's perceived ability to perform tasks of daily living, expressed through responses to some form of questionnaire. It is generally agreed that these types of consideration about functional ability in conjuncti on with life expectancy provides the most proficient approach for indicating improvements in health 78 . Despite the popularity of functional ability, there was still a broad range of health measurement methodologies and results. One of the r easons for this is the difficulty involved in defining and measuring morbidity. Additionally, there exists inconsistency among theorists about what the most important proxy variables are c oncerning health 79 . Numerous authors have indicated that the variables that are selected , and the manner in which the health questions are conveyed, exert a major influence upo n the results obtained 80 . Another problem, related to the study design, is the unreliability o f data collection as a result of morbidity rates being variable in quality. Further weaknesses of the questionnaire approach ar e a consequence of the problems with the respondents, e.g. symptoms do not always directly r eflect the actual disease 81 , the subjective reporting of morbidity is influenced by cultural an d individual differences in attitudes towards 77 Balinsky & Berger, \"A Review of Research on Genera l Health Status Indexes\", p. 286 78 Numerous authors have stressed the desirability of creating a health measure that combines some proxy for morbidity with life expectancy, for example; Balinsky & Berger, Wilson, Bone, Bowling, etc. 79 As Table 2 indicates, there are numerous health me asures that consider different aspects of disease. This is partly because there is no agreement or pro of about the most indicative proxies to question and also ab out the most efficient methodology for framing the questions and therefore this debate still remains u nresolved. This debate has no crucial relevance for the thesis and therefore it will not be visited in any greate r detail than what is provided here. 80 Llewellyn-Thomas, \"Describing Health States: Metho dological Issues in Obtaining Values for Health Sta tes\", p. 550 81 Ho, \"Measuring Health as a Component of Living Sta ndards\", p. 10 Context: Practical - 32 - health, and accounting for handicap at the personal level or the significance of functional disability are not catered for in the majority of t hese questionnaires 82 . The diversity between the results that are yielded from observed (e.g. clinical studies) and self reported (e.g. functional ability, questionnaire st udies) studies implies that self-perceived morbidity and observed morbidity may be measuring d ifferent aspects of illness 83 . When considering the authenticity of clinical studies of morbidity, it is worrying to note the wide variation in the diagnostic skills of clinicians. E linson and Trussel (1957) compared clinical diagnoses by two physicians in the same sample of p atients and identified marked differences in their diagnoses 84 . In addition to these general weaknesses in the abov e studies there are also numerous specific weaknesses for the demands of the thesis. 2.2.6 Recent Studies: Mortality and Morbidity Measu rement Weaknesses for the Thesis There are two fundamental shortcomings of the afore mentioned measures for the requirements of the thesis: the lack of historical content and t he failure of these measures to explicitly connect the burden of morbidity with the quality of life of illness sufferers. 2.2.6.1 Lack of Historical Content Virtually all existing approaches to monitoring hea lth are redundant when trying to evaluate health from a historical perspective. Self-perceive d measurement techniques consist of asking or observing present-day sufferers about how they p erceive the burden of their diseases and/or disabilities. Observed measures of mortality requir e a physician to monitor and evaluate the burden of illnesses upon contemporary sufferers. As a result of the historical nature of the thesis it will be impossible to estimate morbidity through interviewing or observing contemporary sufferers. And, because efforts to mea sure health only became commonplace towards the end of the twentieth century, there are no existing historical estimates of the morbidity burden for any earlier eras. 82 Ibid 83 Murray & Chen, \"Understanding Morbidity Change\", p . 490 84 Elinson & Trussel, \"Some Factors Relating to Degre e of Correspondence for Diagnostic Information as O btained by Household Interviews and Clinical Examinations\" Context: Practical - 33 - 2.2.6.2 Void of Quality of Life Concerns The major focus of existing health measures is typi cally on the effects of different illnesses (and the efficacy of therapies for these illnesses) in medical terms or for their implications upon the economy in policy terms. These measures ar e significantly lacking in scope for reflecting the implications of the changing burden of morbidity upon quality of life for the individual and standards of living of the populatio n in general. Moreover, there is currently a significant void in the literature that considers the changing twentieth century burden of morbidity, and none of these studies have attempted to make quantitative estimates about the value of this chan ging morbidity burden, for the quality of life of the English population during the twentieth cent ury. As a result existing measures are unsuitable for the demands of the thesis. 2.2.7 Conceptual Requisites of an Ideal Historical, Mortality and Morbidity, Quality of Life Measure 2.2.7.1 Conceptual Requisites of an Ideal Measureme nt The form of measurement that the thesis requires is one that accords with the requisites for a representational (as defined by representational th eory of measurement) and reliable measure. 2.2.7.2 Representational Measurement The core and virtue of this theory is that measurem ent is a process of assigning numbers to objects in such a way that the relevant qualitative empirical relations among the objects are reflected in the numbers themselves as well as in i mportant properties of the number system. This will be achieved through the measurement instr ument of the thesis aspiring to accord with the basic criteria of representational measure ment 85 : 1. The measurement will be 'accurately indicative' thr ough precisely representing the relative quantities of the variables being measured (e.g. EuroQol component) as well as indicating the relations between the variables ( e.g. between different EuroQol components) 86 . 85 Points 1 to 4 have been developed from Boumans, \"R epresentation and Stability in Testing and Measurin g Rational Expectations\", p. 383 86 EuroQol depicts the foundation matrix of the thesi s measure, i.e. it is from the EuroQol matrix that the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) will be deriv ed and ultimately the Quality Adjusted Life Expectancy (QA LE) will be determined. The EuroQol contains the te mplate and framework of elements that will be considered collectively to form the basis of the he alth related quality of life thesis measure. Please see Chapter 3: Methodology for further explanation s about the EuroQol matrix. Context: Practical - 34 - 2. The desirability of consistency in the measurement necessitates that the approach to measurement is maintained throughout the thesis, fo r different times and health states. For example, whether measuring the health burden of breast cancer in 1900, tuberculosis in 1950 or blindness in 2000, the Euro Qol matrix will be designed and implemented to yield consistent measurements of the QALY, which will ultimately provide a consistent estimate about the quality of life related to health across time (twentieth century) and space (different diseases a nd disabilities). 3. Sensitivity in measurement in order to accurately a nd entirely gauge changes in the objects of measurement. For the demands of the thes is the sensitivity demands are: i. To identify marginal and tacit changes in the burde n of illness. ii. To better achieve the ceteris neglectibus condition (see below for details) through minimising the effects of 'other circumstan ces' (OC) not associated with health related quality of life 87 . For example, worsening in the reported health of the population as the twentieth century u nfolded as a result of changes in health expectations, the epidemiological transition and improved medical technology will be minimised through adheri ng to the requisites of sensitivity. 4. In order to achieve the above criteria of represent ational measurement there is a need for a steadfast scale of measurement. As a result of the need to measure quantity (in this respect the quantity of health and qualit y of life related to health), there is an order relation system which enables the measurer to order quantity in a way which has formal similarity to th e relations equal, greater and lesser 88 , which provides the basis for developing a scale of measur ement 89 . Measurement scales can be formed in two ways 90 : 1. Direct mapping (from a quality relational system to a numerical relational system). 2. Indirect mapping (through a relation to the quality to be measured and other qualities, for which measurement scales have been defined, bec ause it is impossible to set up a satisfactory measurement scale directly). 87 See Equation 1 below for definition of OC. 88 Finkelstein, \"Theory and Philosophy of Measurement \", p. 12 89 Ibid 90 Finkelstein, \"Theory and Philosophy of Measurement \", p. 15 Context: Practical - 35 - The thesis utilises the second type of measurement. Quality of life will be measured through identifying a QALY as a result of the impossibility of directly gauging health related quality of life. The worked examples below provide a furthe r explanation about the mechanics of indirect and representational measurement. In this measurement framework, the representative a cts as an instrument for measuring attribute X. The table below highlights two example s of the relationship between components in an ideal representative measure. Table 2.2.2: Comparison of thermometer and thesis Q ALE components of representational measurement 91 Components of Representational Measurement Example 1: Temperature Example 2: Quality of Life (QoL) Instrument: Thermometer EuroQol Index Attribute X: Temperature Quality of life (QoL) Correlate of attribute X: Height of mercury QALY in dex (0 /barb2right 1) Function: T = f (h) T = temperature, h = height of mercury QoL = f (QALY) In example 1: the thermometer is the representative of temperature in which the height of the mercury column correlates with the temperature. The formal analogy of that correlation is the function between height and temperature, T= f (h). In example 2: the EuroQol index is the representati ve of quality of life in which the value of the QALY index correlates with the overall QoL. The formal analogy of that correlation is the function between the QALY and the quality of life, QoL = f (QALY). 91 Referenced and developed from Chang, \"Spirit, Air and Quicksilver: The Search for the Real Scale of T emperature\" Context: Practical - 36 - In both of these examples, the only restriction whi ch must be placed upon f is that T and QoL must be defined for every value which h and QALY ma y assume, and the numerical order of the temperature and QoL numbers must correspond to the temperature and QoL order. 2.2.7.3 Reliability of an ideal measure When trying to develop an indirect measurement tool in the form of representational theory there are numerous conditions that need to be achie ved. These conditions are further complicated when the measurement and the tool devel oped to gauge it are economical (e.g. QALY and QoL) rather than physiological (e.g. therm ometer). When conceptualising an ideal measurement scale for assessing health related qual ity of life the initial objective is to achieve standardisation and satisfy the condition of minima list over determination. Standardisation is achieved through accuracy and st able correlations in order to minimise the influence of 'other circumstances' (OC) not associa ted with health related quality of life 92 . This has been adhered to in the development of the thesis methodology through the selection of the most precise EuroQol variables. Chang (2001) has developed a procedure of minimalis t over determination, which is designed to identify the best measure under conditions of un certainty, i.e. non ceteris paribus environments (which were derived from the history o f the development of a standard thermometer in the nineteenth century) 93 . In order to achieve the conditions of minimalist over determination Chang outlined the following process: Build a series of instruments that are each based o n a different but very minimal and consistent set of theoretical assumptions, and test these instruments under different circumstances. The instrument for which the results are most coherent, under these different circumstances is the instrument which can be chosen to be the standard measuring device94 . According to Chang, the point of this history of th e thermometer is that for endorsing the air thermometer as the best standard, Regnault did not need to prove that the expansion of air is 92 See Equation 1 below for definition of OC 93 Chang, \"Spirit, Air and Quicksilver: The Search fo r the Real Scale of Temperature\" 94 Ibid Context: Practical - 37 - uniform. Through minimalist over determination, the air thermometer was the only thing left as all other types of thermometer failed to meet th e necessary, minimalist conditions of consistency. Hence, the art of practicing this stra tegy (of minimalist over determination) lies in the ability to contrive over determined situations on the basis of as little as possible. Minimalist over determination has been achieved in the thesis through selecting the most indicative variables and versatile methodologies fo r measuring historical health related quality of life. When applying over determination to history or econ omics, the process becomes more complicated as a result of the inability to create a stable environment under which to compare different measuring instruments. Accuracy is achiev ed through adhering to the 'ceteris neglectibus' condition 95 . The ceteris neglectibus condition for example 2 (Qo L) shown = = + V V V V (1) where (I) indicates the components of the QALY. The influence of other circumstances (OC), besides quality of life (QoL), on the QALY index QA LY (I) is the partial derivative: ( ) 0QALY I OC Equation (1) clarifies the key components that need to be considered when trying to construct the ideal measure. The foundations of the health me asure that has been developed as part of this thesis are more secure as they have been const ructed to satisfy the criteria of a good measuring tool. Subsequently, the thesis health mea sure is capable of measuring the phenomenon associated with mortality and morbidity most accurately (and minimise the effect 95 Boumans, \"Representation and Stability in Testing and Measuring Rational Expectations\", p. 386 96 All formulae is referenced and developed from Boum ans, \"Representation and Stability in Testing and M easuring Rational Expectations\", p. 386 Context: Practical - 38 - of OC), in order to adhere (as closely as possible) to the criteria of an ideal representational measurement (namely: accurately indicative, consist ent, sensitive and scaled), through achieving standardisation and minimalist over deter mination and subsequently satisfying the ceteris neglectibus condition when measuring health over space (different illnesses) and time (different eras of the twentieth century). 2.2.7.4 Ideal Measure in Conjunction with the Deman ds of the Thesis The difficulty in achieving this objective (of an i deal general economic measure) is further complicated when combined with the difficulties of defining and measuring health in general and specifically in conjunction with the historical measurement of quality of life associated with health considerations contained in the thesis. A major part of the thesis will entail the developm ent of a morbidity (and to a lesser extent, mortality) measuring tool that is coherently constr ucted, statistically reliable, sensitive, applicable and valid. Finally, it will be capable o f providing estimates about the value and contribution of improved health to standards of liv ing in twentieth century England, which is to date lacking. The construction of this new measu re, namely, the QALE (quality adjusted life expectancy) is explained in Chapter 3. 2.2.8 Hickson QALE As a result of the aforementioned difficulties and shortcomings associated with existing health measurement methodologies, in conjunction with the original, historical and quality of life considerations entailed in the thesis, a new health measure will have to be constructed. This new health measure will be capable of simultan eously considering the value of: 1. Improvements in the quality of life associated with morbidity (from a health and welfare perspective) at different points during the twentieth century, and 2. Increases in life expectancy at different points du ring the twentieth century. This will enable the thesis to identify the improve ments in the quality of life associated with morbidity and mortality experienced by the English population during the twentieth century. Once these developments have been highlighted the t hesis will endeavour to quantify the extent and impact of these improvements (in qualita tive and quantitative terms) upon Context: Practical - 39 - standards of living and for their contribution towa rds an extended 'Fisherian' notion of economic growth.

As well as considering the change in life expectancy during th e twentieth century, it will also be necessary to examine the shift in the burden of dis eases, particularly as some of the most important improvements in health were a product of the changing pattern of morbidity 97 . During the twentieth century England experienced un paralleled improvements in health. Life expectancy improved from 47 years in 1900 to nearly 80 years by 2000 98 . The burden of diseases experienced a remarkable transformation as it shifted from infectious illnesses (accounting for 25 percent of deaths in 1911 and 0. 5 percent in 1991 99 ), such as tuberculosis to chronic degenerative disorders (accounting for over 80 percent of deaths by 1991 100 ), such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Surrounding this change in the health profile are n umerous debates and issues. The most important for the thesis will be considered. These include the debates about the effect of the Great Depression and World Wars on health, which ar e some of the most frequently visited 97 The World Health Organisation's wider definition o f health (1979) will be adopted as the definition o f health throughout the thesis: health is a state of complete physical, social and mental well being and not merely the absence of disease: World Health Organisation (2005). \"Constitution of the World Health Organisation\".

By the early twentieth century gastrointestinal i nfections, such as cholera, enteric fever and dysentery had been controlled. This was p articularly attributed to the purification of water supplies 102 . The incidence of smallpox dropped to negligible p roportion during the first decade of the twentieth century 103 . A similar trend was evident for scarlet fever and whooping cough (which declined most impressively between 187 0 and 1900) 104 . These observations are confirmed by reviewing the infant mortality rate (I MR) time series. 101 Gage, \"The Decline of Mortality in England and Wal es 1861-1964: Decomposition by Cause of Death and C omponent Mortality\", p. 57 102 Charlton & Murphy, \"The Health of Adult Britain 18 41-1994\" Volume I, p. 1 103 Fraser, \"A History of English Public Health\", p. 2 85 104 Mercer, \"Relative Trends in Mortality from Related Respiratory and Airborne Infectious Diseases\", p. 141 Context: Historical - 42 - Table 2.3.1: Infant mortality rates (per 1,000) and indexed infant mortality rates (150=100), 1890s-2000 105 .

These improvements resu lted in an infant mortality rate that had reached a remarkable 6 per 1,000 by the year 2000 108 . Despite these staggering declines in infectious dis eases, it might be possible to claim that developments were postponed because of the discrepa ncy between the introduction of vaccines for some of the major killers and the intr oduction of 'publicly notifiable' legislation for the corresponding diseases.

In the majority of cases in the two tables, public notific ation legislation was introduced a long while after the introduction of the vaccine. For example, smallpox inoculation was introduced in 1796 and not notifiable until 1889, a ninety three year lag. 108 WHO Core Health Indicators: World Health Organisat ion (2004), \"Core Health Indicators\".

I.e. one would have thought that once a disease is recognise d as a public health hazard increased efforts are dedicated to the initiatives necessary to combat the disease. When all of the twentieth century notifiable diseases are considere d in conjunction with their corresponding vaccine history, there is very little, if any corre lation. It seems reasonable to conclude that there is minimal interaction between these two feat ures of public health. Moreover, it is also noteworthy that the reduction of many of these dise ases was accomplished before the discovery of their corresponding immunisation. This highlights the importance of improvements in public health for the decline in ma ny of the major diseases, for example, smallpox, scarlet fever and whooping cough. 2.3.2 Adult Health Between 1900 and 1950 the trend of improved surviva l prospects through a decline in the prevalence of infectious diseases was distributed f airly evenly across all age groups. Since 1950 ages 0-1 and 15-44 have experienced the sharpe st declines while the opposite applies to the oldest age groups, although it is noteworthy th at, in 1911 the oldest age groups had the lowest incidence of infectious disease mortality 110 . The graphs below provide an illustration of the twentieth century health transformation, in sup port of the epidemiological transition. Figure 2.3.1 contains all seventeen international c lassification of diseases (ICD) categories and Figure 2.3.2 details the five most notable disease categories in order to highlight the key trends of twentieth century health. 110 Charlton & Murphy, \"The Health of Adult Britain 18 41-1994\" Volume I, p. 45 Context: Historical - 46 - Figure 2.3.1: Percentage of deaths in each Internat ional Classification of Disease (ICD) category 1911-1991 111 .

The statistics used here, from Charlton & Murphy ha ve converted historical data to their ICD9 equivale nts. 112 Ibid Context: Historical - 47 - 2.3.2.1 Infectious Disease Decline The infectious disease category contains numerous d iseases. The six diseases that were especially significant for the decline in deaths fr om infectious diseases are listed below: 1. Tuberculosis 2. Diphtheria 3. Whooping Cough / Pertussis 4. Measles, Mumps, Rubella 5. Influenza 6. Communicable diseases (including STDs) Although tuberculosis peaked in incidence before th e twentieth century, it persisted to be a health burden until about 1950. Improved ventilatio n and host resistance helped to reduce the virulence of tuberculosis. In contrast to this 'McK eown type argument', others have claimed that the reduction in other infectious diseases was more important in abating tuberculosis because this reduced the impact of a trigger diseas e, in this case smallpox 113 . Although there is some accuracy in this claim, as tuberculosis is rec ognised as a sequel to smallpox, it probably only accounts for about 20 to 30 percent of tubercu losis deaths 114 . The most important factor in the reduction of tuberculosis was the introducti on of specific chemotherapy in the 1950s 115 . This facilitated a rapid decline and virtual elimin ation of tuberculosis because the new drugs quickly rendered patients non-infectious and thus s wiftly controlled a potential source of infection for further cases 116 . Diphtheria was a major contributor to childhood mor tality from the 1890s until the 1940s, when successful immunisation was introduced. By the late twentieth century, the disease had almost disappeared 117 . E.g. during the 1980s only 30 cases were reported and many of them had been imported 118 . Whooping cough has a very long role in the health h istory of England. Deaths remained at about 10,000 per year from the 1840s until 1910. By 1950 improved host resistance facilitated 113 Mercer, \"Relative Trends in Mortality from Related Respiratory and Airborne Infectious Diseases\", p. 145 114 Ibid 115 Davies, \"The Pharmaceutical Industry - A Personal Study\", p. 197 116 Charlton & Murphy, \"The Health of Adult Britain 18 41-1994\" Volume II, p. 8 117 Charlton & Murphy, \"The Health of Adult Britain 18 41-1994\" Volume II, p. 13 118 Ibid Context: Historical - 48 - a fall in the mortality rate, to less than 400 per annum 119 . Widespread immunisation, which began in the 1950s, facilitated a continuation and enhancement in this downward trend, although public health measures ought to be attribu ted to the decline in whooping cough as this had largely been achieved before the introduct ion of widespread immunisation. However, the decline in whooping cough was interrupted betwe en 1974 and 1994, when there were fears that immunisation was linked to encephalopathy and vaccination levels fell to 30 percent 120 . This link was disproved in 1985, and by 1994 vaccin ation levels had returned to nearly complete coverage (93 percent) of the infant popula tion 121 . The decline in measles, mumps and rubella is more a ttributable to medical technology, as the prevalence of these diseases declined rapidly when immunisation became widespread in the late 1960s 122 . Notification fell by about two thirds as a result of the introduction of the vaccines, to a level of about 90,000 reported cases per year in the 1980s 123 . When the MMR vaccine was introduced in 1988 further declines in mortality from these diseases were facilitated such that the 1990s annual notification fell to about 9,000 cases per annum 124 . There have been three influenza pandemics during th e twentieth century: 1968, 1947, and most notably 1918-19, which was of unprecedented sc ale and particularly detrimental as it mainly affected young adults 125 . Prior to the establishment of special VD clinics an d the introduction of penicillin, STDs were responsible for considerable mortality (syphilis) a nd morbidity (gonorrhoea) 126 . Despite inflation in the number of reported STDs during the 1960s and 1970s, which is likely to be caused by changes in population trends of sexual be haviour, by the close of the twentieth century most STDs were under control. For example, the number of deaths from syphilis declined from 4,375 in 1910 to 18 in 1990 127 . Much of the concern regarding STDs in the late 119 Ibid 120 Ibid 121 Ibid 122 Charlton & Murphy, \"The Health of Adult Britain 18 41-1994\" Volume II, p. 21 123 Ibid 124 Ibid 125 Charlton & Murphy, \"The Health of Adult Britain 18 41-1994\" Volume II, p. 10 126 Charlton & Murphy, \"The Health of Adult Britain 18 41-1994\" Volume II, p. 21 127 Ibid Context: Historical - 49 - twentieth century had centred on Chlamydia, Herpes simplex and HIV/AIDS, for which the number of reported cases increased every year since the disease was recognised in 1982 128 . 2.3.2.2 Respiratory Diseases The decline in infectious diseases was the most imp ortant classification of mortality reduction in twentieth century England. Second in importance were respiratory diseases. When considering diseases of the respiratory system it i s necessary to differentiate between those which are infectious and non-infectious, as the red uction in infectious diseases becomes more pronounced. The decline of mortality from infectious respirator y illnesses (e.g. influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia, etc) began in the early twentieth centur y and was not especially aided with the advent of antibiotics or the National Health Servic e although both are thought to be conceivable explanations for the continuing downwar d trend in respiratory related deaths 129 . E.g. the introduction of antimicrobial chemotherapy accelerated the decline of pneumonia in the 1930s 130 . Decreases in respiratory disease mortality pre 1950 were largely a result of the reduction in infectious respiratory diseases. After 1950 two for ms of respiratory disease related to smoking became the most prevalent: lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 131 . By the year 2000 lung cancer was the most importa nt respiratory cause of death. Because this ICD category contains infectious disea ses, e.g. pneumonia, as well as diseases that reflect long term damage to the lungs, e.g. as thma, there was a mixture of age related trends during the twentieth century 132 . For ages below 65, mortality has been falling, especially for ages 0-14 between the 1940s and 1950 s and again from the late 1960s onwards, this trend was also evident for ages 15-24, but to a lesser extent 133 . In ages 25-44 rates fell, especially in the post war period, but have been ri sing since 1980 for men and static for 128 Ibid 129 Charlton & Murphy, \"The Health of Adult Britain 18 41-1994\" Volume II, p.94 130 Ibid 131 Ibid 132 Charlton & Murphy, \"The Health of Adult Britain 18 41-1994\" Volume I, p. 49 133 Ibid Context: Historical - 50 - women 134 . There has been a fall in the oldest ages over the twentieth century as a whole, although the pattern is more volatile as these age groups are particularly prone to flu epidemics. 2.3.2.3 Degenerative Disease Increase The increase in degenerative diseases is related to longer, richer lifestyle characteristics, which tend to be correlated with unhealthy lifestyle prac tices, for example, smoking, high levels of alcohol consumption and fat intake, and low levels of exercise. 2.3.2.4 Cardiovascular Diseases The most striking trend in Figure 2.3.2 is the majo r increase in diseases of the circulatory or cardiovascular system: from about 16 percent in 191 1, to a peak of nearly 52 percent in 1971, and in the year 2000 about 45 percent of the popula tion died from circulatory system diseases 135 . Of cardiovascular disease deaths there are two sub- categories that are particularly noteworthy: 1. Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) / Coronary heart dise ase 2. Stroke / Cerebrovascular disease By the year 2000, 25 percent of all deaths were cau sed by IHD and 11 percent related to stroke 136 . Although strokes account for less mortality they have a significantly greater adverse impact on morbidity. By the 1990s strokes had becom e the second most prevalent cause of hospital admissions 137 . Economic transition, urbanisation and industrialisa tion have initiated lifestyle changes that promote heart diseases. These risk factors include tobacco use, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet 138 . Smokers of all ages have IHD death rates 2-3 time s higher than non-smokers and physical inactivity doubles the risk of dying f rom IHD or stroke 139 .

Since 1911 there have been very different patterns in the burden of IHD across different age groups and genders. In males aged 35+, IHD increase d - apart from an apparent temporary fall during World War Two - until the 1970s and then dec lined 141 . Female IHD rates experienced a more gradual rise until the 1970s, thereafter rat es began to decline for ages 35-44 but ages 65-74 did not experience a decline until the 1980s 142 . 2.3.2.5 Neoplasm The proportion of deaths from neoplasms increased f rom about 7 percent in 1911 to about 26 percent in 1992, and by 1950 neoplasms represented the second most prevalent mortality category 143 . There are over 200 different forms and locations in which a neoplasm can 140 Charlton & Murphy, \"The Health of Adult Britain 18 41-1994\" Volume II, p. 70 141 Charlton & Murphy, \"The Health of Adult Britain 18 41-1994\" Volume I, p. 48 142 Ibid 143 Charlton & Murphy, \"The Health of Adult Britain 18 41-1994\" Volume I, p. 30 Context: Historical - 52 - develop. Therefore, only the major cancer trends wi ll be considered here, namely: lung and breast cancer. Lung cancer was the most common form of cancer for males. Mortality rates decreased during the last thirty years of the twentieth century, esp ecially at younger ages 144 . For women, who had significantly lower rates, there was an increas e since 1970 especially at older ages 145 . This was so extensive that by the 1990s the female morta lity rate from lung cancer was very similar to the male rate. These trends in lung cancer gener ally reflect trends in smoking habits 146 . Despite the increases in female lung cancer, the mo st common fatal cancer in women during the twentieth century has persisted to be located i n the breast. In 1999 one in four female cancers was located in the breast, with around 34,0 00 new cases diagnosed per annum in England 147 . Since 1970 there has been a decline in breast can cer mortality for ages under 50 and since the late 1980s for ages over 50 148 . These improvements are attributable to the widespread adoption of new diagnostic, surgical and therapeutic regimes. Cancer mortality in all aged below 25 years experie nced increasing rates between 1900 and 1950, and declines thereafter 149 . In ages 25-44 mortality in men shows a similar pa ttern, although the decline began earlier in the 1940s, wh ile rates for women had been falling throughout the period 150 . In men aged 45-64 the rise was reversed during th e 1960s. At ages 65-74 and 75+ male and female mortality rates incre ased throughout the twentieth century and only began to level off at the end of the 1990s 151 . 2.3.3 Life Expectancy By the 1960s deaths from most infectious diseases h ad declined sharply as a result of continuing improvements in hygiene, sanitation, ris ing standards of living, immunisation and after the 1930s, specific therapeutic measures and the 1950s with further developments in 144 Charlton & Murphy, \"The Health of Adult Britain 18 41-1994\" Volume II, p. 35 145 Ibid 146 Ibid 147 Cancer Research UK: Cancer Research UK, (2003). \"B reast Cancer - Summary\" .

This decline had been substituted with an increas e in degenerative diseases, such as heart disease and cancer. This sh ift in the burden of disease created positive changes in life expectancy.

The most notable trend is the relationship of this increase between different cohorts. The older age groups experienced improvements in their life expec tancy increasingly later during the twentieth century. 152 Davies, \"The Pharmaceutical Industry - A Personal Study\", p. 2 153 Charlton & Murphy, \"The Health of Adult Britain 18 41-1994\" Volume I, p. 20 Context: Historical - 54 - Figure 2.3.4: Average gains in years of life expect ancy by age 154 Gains in Years of Life Expectancy by Age 529 34 316 20 213 17 0812 36 013 0510 15 20 25 30 35 40 1931 1961 1991 Further Years of Life Expectancy (Base 1901) At Age 0 At Age 5 At Age 15 At Age 35 At Age 55 At Age 75 This graph provides an average of the gains in life expectancy for both sexes, by age and as an addition to 1901 levels of life expectancy at the c orresponding ages. The most significant and early increase came for life expectancy at birth (L Eo), where between 1901 and 1931 LEo increased by five years, between 1901 and 1961 by 2 9 years and from 1901 to 1991 by 34 years. This graph clearly illustrates that between 1931 and 1961 LEo experienced the most significant gains compared to the rest of the centu ry and any other time in history. Figures 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 highlight similar trends for life e xpectancy at other ages (namely: 5, 15, 35, 55, 75) but none of these ages experienced the magnitud e of increase enjoyed by infants. 2.3.4 Mortality Change Implications for Morbidity One of the most significant features of twentieth c entury health was the shift in mortality from infectious to degenerative diseases. This has numer ous implications for the burden and age distribution of morbidity and for mortality/morbidi ty trade-offs 155 . One of the most important contributions to quality adjusted life expectancy (QALE) and the trade-off was the improved age-death related profil e, such that the burden of mortality shifted significantly towards older ages. 154 Ibid 155 Trade-off encompasses the notion that although lif e expectancy has increased, this has been at the co st of an increase in morbid life years, and there i s therefore a trade-off between increased life years on the one hand and increased unhealthy years on the other.

Firs t, the decline in the population death rate, from 17/1000 in 1901 to 11/1000 in 1997. Second, the inc rease in circulatory diseases, which has substituted for the decline in infectious diseases. Third, respiratory diseases mortality remaining relatively constant between 1901 and 1997 , which is because this category contains causes of death that are infectious and non- infect ious and some of the most persistent infectious mortality. This is illustrated below. 157 Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys, \"Twent ieth Century Mortality\" 11/1000 17/1000 Context: Historical - 57 - Figure 2.3.7: Distribution of respiratory disease d eaths between infectious and non-infectious 1901 and 1997 158 Percentage of Respiratory Deaths that are Infectiou s and Non-Infectious by Age 1901 and 1997 010 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Age Group Percentage of Total Respiratory Deaths 1901 Infectious 1901 Non-Infectious 1997 Infectious 1997 Non-Infectious Figure 2.3.7 shows that there have been some expect ed declines in infectious and corresponding increases in non-infectious respirato ry diseases. However, the magnitude is not large enough to explain the whole story. The second explanation is that infectious respiratory diseases represent some of the few remaining infect ious diseases, e.g. pneumonia, bronchitis and flu. The increasing age profile of the populati on perpetuates the remaining prevalence of these infectious diseases. 2.3.5 Mortality/Morbidity Trade-Offs The previous analysis has highlighted that there is a pattern about the implications for morbidity from the changes in mortality. First, the notion of a trade-off, between reduced mortality at the cost of increased morbidity become s increasingly pronounced: throughout the twentieth century there was a significant decline i n mortality which was accompanied by an increased proportion of the population living in po or health. This is partially a symptom of other factors (exogenous to health per se) and a re sult of the population living to older ages when degenerative diseases become more prevalent (w hich exacerbates a decline in killers of young people), but nevertheless there is still some authenticity to the observation of morbidity replacing mortality. This essentially means that 'q uality adjusted life expectancy' has not 158 Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys, \"Twent ieth Century Mortality\" Context: Historical - 58 - improved as much as it would seem when only concent rating on death rates. For example, cancer has experienced improvements in mortality bu t with significant trade-offs for morbidity. However, to claim that health has worsened because of an increase in the reported prevalence of disease and/or to claim that every additional ye ar of life expectancy in the population is riddled with morbidity is a very simplistic and ove rly pessimistic conclusion. Even though the changed aetiology of diseases has meant that more y ears are spent in less than perfect health, it is clear that the trade-off is in favour of overall health. I.e. the thesis' analysis will highlight that the contributions of the improvements in morta lity outweigh the associated deteriorations in morbidity and that in many instances the burden of morbidity is less significant than the scenario outlined in contemporary literature. Moreo ver, as a result of improvements in medical technology, this trade-off became increasingly less pronounced as the twentieth century unfolded. I.e. although medical technology could no t cure many ailments it became increasingly able to relieve many of the associated adverse symptoms. 2.3.6 Twentieth Century Health Debates Despite the seemingly continual improvements in hea lth since the onset of the twentieth century, there has been much debate during certain times about the direction and distribution of health improvements. Most noteworthy was the deb ate about what happened to health during the inter-war period and issues concerning t he persistent health inequalities. These will be analysed below. 2.3.6.1 Effects of the World Wars and the Great Dep ression on English Health The pessimistic commentary on the effects of World War One claimed that standards of living declined as nutrition and health levels worsened. T he foundations of these claims are reports of poor nutrition and housing, caused by a lack of income due to unemployment 159 . Winter (1994) indicated the contrary through identifying i mprovements in nutrition and life expectancy 160 . The evidence provides weight for Winter type clai ms, as there was no interruption in the decline of infectious diseases and mortality (with the exception of life expectancy at age 35, - Figure 2.3.3). 159 Jones, \"Health and Society in Twentieth Century Br itain\", p. 58 160 Jones, \"Health and Society in Twentieth Century Br itain\", p. 34 Context: Historical - 59 - Along a similar vein, Webster (2001) concedes that the British people did experience some overall improvement in living standards during the 1920s and 1930s, but that these improvements were slow 161 . The table below provides weight for this type of argument. Table 2.3.5: Consumption per head per week (in lbs) for the United Kingdom, 1909-1913 and 1924-1928 relative to 1934-1935 162 Product Years (lbs) % + or - of 1934-35 compared +36 -35 +9 +10 Milk / Cream 3.46 3.35 3.26 -6 -3 Other Vegetables 1.38 1.81 2.22 +61 +23 Potatoes 4.68 4.43 4.25 -9 -4 Tea 0.12 0.17 0.18 +50 +6 The table above highlights an improvement in nutrit ional standards between 1909 and 1935, which provides contrary evidence to many of the pes simistic claims about nutrition during this period. The most striking trends in the above table are the improvements in quality and quantity of the average British diet 163 . The increases in pounds worth of produce signific antly outweigh the declines. Furthermore, the decline in cereals and potatoes is likely to be a direct result of the increased availability of meat, other vegetables and fish. The increase in fruit and 161 Webster, \"Caring for Health: History and Diversity \", p. 151 162 The National Archives: MH 56(213): Advisory Commit tee on Nutrition, Ministry of Health Advisory Commi ttee on Nutrition 163 In this context diet quality considers the increas e in more nutritious and wholesome sources of calor ie intake Context: Historical - 60 - vegetables was substantial and would have provided a valuable contribution to quality of life and health standards in general. It is important to recognise that this table presen ts aggregate data and therefore may be masking poor nutrition for the poorer segments of t he population, although there is little evidential support for the claims about significant inequality in nutrition. For example, in September 1934, a study of 69 working class familie s (38 of which had an unemployed breadwinner) in Newcastle-upon-Tyne (conducted by t he Advisory Committee on Nutrition) found that the average diet of these families provi ded 2,960 calories a day per man, which was considered to be \"just about sufficient\" 164 . 90 percent of all families consumed fresh vegetables, 88 percent fresh fruit, 69 percent fres h meat and 71 percent fresh fish 165 . In contrast, there were evident inequalities in the death rate and levels of infant mortality. This is shown in the table below. 164 The National Archives: MH (56)213: Advisory Commit tee on Nutrition, Dr. Bradford Hill (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine) 165 Ibid Context: Historical - 61 - Table 2.3.6: Ratio of geographical death rates and infant mortality for all regions of England and Wales, 1938 166 Region Deaths at all ages per 1,000 pop Infant mort per 1,000 births Crude Ratio of adjusted rate I.

Comparing North to the Sou th East indicates significant inequalities in the death rate (117:86) and the infant mortality rate (114:88) 167 . These inequalities are exacerbated by the fact that the majority of region s in England and Wales experienced death rates that were lower than the average index (100), whereas fewer experienced higher than average death rates which by definition of this dis tribution being highly skewed, indicates that these deprived regions were especially depressed. Moreover, Titmuss used data from the 1930s Registra r General's reports to calculate the 'human wastage' in the deprived and high unemployme nt regions of the North and Wales, compared to the standards of health achieved in the South of the country, he calculated that 166 The National Archives: MH 58(401): \"General Regist rar 1950\", After adjustment of the 'all ages' rates for differences in the sex -age structure of the regions, compares the regional rat es with those of England & Wales taken as 100. 167 Ibid Context: Historical - 62 - 50,000 excess deaths were occurring each year becau se of the presence of intense poverty in these areas 168 . Despite the adversities associated with England's W orld Wars and depression, there were some more optimistic developments during these eras . The post World War One era and 1920s witnessed the seeds of many developments which faci litated continued improvements in the health of the population throughout the twentieth c entury. Many campaigns of long term significance got underway, e.g. birth control, fami ly allowance and local authority housing 169 , when problems of over-crowding and sub-standard hom es began to be faced 170 . Interwar developments are even more commendable when scienti fic achievements are considered. The 1930s marks the dawn of the modern antibiotic era, when therapies were introduced to treat infectious diseases, namely sulphonamides 171 . These developments were enhanced during the following decade (1940s) when the penicillin / tetr acycline group of drugs were discovered and developed for mainstream use. The General Regis trar (1950) claimed \"there is no doubt that the application of new drugs and remedies to t he treatment of bacterial infections since 1937 has been the main reason for the accelerated d ecline in all-causes death rates\" 172 . The culmination of these developments meant that th ere were considerable health improvements in the early 1940s, despite the setbac ks outlined above. 2.3.6.2 Health Inequalities Analysis of English mortality by social class began in 1921 and was conducted with increasing detail throughout the twentieth century 173 . This analysis has continually generated concernin g results about the inequality in health, such that p oor social classes fair much worse in terms of survival and illness probabilities. This has persis ted despite the introduction of the NHS (whose main objective was to eliminate inequalities through providing equal accessibility). This aspect of twentieth century health history is more a prominent theme than an actual debate, as all authors agree on the existence and s ignificance of health inequalities, although some disagree on the timing and magnitude of this t rend. 168 Ibid 169 Jones, \"Health and Society in Twentieth Century Br itain\", p. 58 170 Ibid 171 Ibid 172 The National MH 58(401): Ministry of Health: 173 Pamuk, \"Social Class Inequality in Mortality from 1921 to 1972 in England and Wales\", p. 17 Context: Historical - 63 - The statistical evidence bolsters the theorists who maintain that social class inequality had not been reduced by the end of the twentieth century.

The table also illustrates that, although each social class has increased its life expectancy over this period, some social classes have gained more than others. However, the most noteworthy feat ure is the persistence of social class in equality despite twentieth century health developme nts, especially the National Health Service. 179 Ibid 180 National Statistics: Health Statistics Quarterly ( 2002), \"Inequality in Life Expectancy by Social Cla ss, 1972-1999\". Retrieved 7 March 2006, from: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_health /HSQ15.pdf Context: Historical - 66 - Despite the slight variation in magnitude and trend s between the series of tables above, the overall existence of social class inequalities is u ndeniable. It is most important to recognise that there were persistent health inequalities. Because of the inconsistencies in the numbers some authors have approached the problem from a different angle. E.g. Wilkinson (1989) consi ders relative poverty in twentieth century Britain 181 . His cogent reason for thinking that health is mor e responsive to changes in income at the bottom end of the scale led him to focus mor e narrowly on trends in relative poverty 182 . As well as providing an insightful analysis, this a lso provides plausibility to the previous mortality inconsistencies. Wilkinson also provides an explanation for why the problem is so exaggerated in twentieth century Britain 183 : It might be suggested that the whole population wou ld move down and out along the curve so that the death rates of those at the lower end of the income distribution would fall faster than others. That this has not ha ppened adds weight to the claims that we are dealing with relative rather than absol ute poverty. Essentially, Britain experienced a situation where as the country got ri cher, rather than moving along the curve relating income to health, the curve itse lf moves down and to the right. This is depicted in Figure 2.3.8, where this moveme nt from curve T0 to T1 (rather than along curve T0) enables richer people to reduce their dea th rates further than previously (shown by the move from DR0 to DR1), while the poor have to p ay more to keep themselves off the steeply rising part of the curve (shown by the move from Y0 to Y1) 184 . 181 Wilkinson, \"Class Mortality Differentials, Income Distribution, and Trends in Poverty\" 182 Wilkinson, \"Class Mortality Differentials, Income Distribution, and Trends in Poverty\", p. 333 183 Wilkinson, \"Class Mortality Differentials, Income Distribution, and Trends in Poverty\", p. 332 184 Ibid Context: Historical - 67 - Figure 2.3.8: Long run GDP/capita increase and inco me mortality 185 DR DR0 DR1 Y0 Y1 Y These mortality inequalities (in income and relativ e poverty) are also evident in morbidity, and some have claimed to be more pronounced. E.g. by th e year 2000 there were no major disease conditions that were more prevalent in wealthier so cial classes 186 . Even diseases that used to be associated with affluence and were more prevalen t in wealthier social classes at the beginning of the twentieth century became more prev alent in poorer social classes by the end of the twentieth century 187 . E.g. cancer and coronary heart disease were all m ore prevalent in poorer social classes by the close of the twentieth century. This is highlighted in the table below, which depicts social class inequality for a selection of mortality causes in 1960, when this crossover was largely complete. 185 Graphed from the qualitatively presented descripti on in: Wilkinson, \"Class Mortality Differentials, I ncome Distribution, and Trends in Poverty\", p. 332 186 Gjonca, SA4A2 Lecture 11, January 2003, London Sch ool of Economics 187 Ibid A A T0 T1 Context: Historical - 68 - Table 2.3.12: Cause of death by social class, males ,1961 188 Cause of death Standardised mortality ratios: socia l class I II III IV V Tuberculosis 40 54 96 108 185 Malignant Neoplasm 73 80 104 102 139 Psychoses 80 77 96 80 179 Epilepsy 30 39 46 97 251 Rheumatic Fever 40 67 85 113 207 Pneumonia 48 54 88 102 196 Bronchitis 28 50 97 116 194 Stomach ulcer 46 58 94 106 199 Accidents in the home 95 78 81 104 226 Suicide 91 94 87 103 184 A comparative study of mortality rates between 98 a rea health authorities (AHAs) identified considerable variation within their sample of disea ses 189 (which were chosen for their strong association with medical intervention), and this re mained even after adjustment for social factors 190 .

This will be elaborated below. 191 Charlton et al, \"Geographical Variation in Mortali ty from Conditions Amenable to Medical Intervention in England and Wales\", p. 693 Context: Historical - 70 - Table 2.3.14: Distribution of social indicators by area health authority (AHA), 1977-78 192 Social indicator Distribution Median Minimum Maximum Households without cars (%) 41.9 24.5 64.4 Unskilled workers (%) 6.2 3.2 10.4 Households renting (%) 41.1 28.0 81.3 Birth-weights under 2.5kgs (1980) (%) 7.0 4.4 10.3 This table provides an indication about why a subst antial variation in survival was still evident after controlling for social factors, because a sig nificant part of the above variations in mortality is not born from social factors. Along a similar vein, Tunbridge (1977) conducted a study that considered social class and hospital use 193 . The key finding states that there is \"No social class variation in length of stay, by specialty or diagnosis\" 194 . This supports other studies that have failed to sho w any relationship between social class and length of hos pital stay or use 195 . If the health of lower social classes is generally poorer but their hospital use does not reflect this, then there is a clear indication that higher mortality would ensue as a consequence. If this tentative argument is accepted as a contender in so cial class mortality inequality, then the most important question would be: what is the cause of t he seemingly positive correlation between social class/income and hospital use? I.e. is this a story about education and culture or access to medical care? The underpinnings of this question about access to medical care in the first half of the twentieth century are related to the markedly varie d evaluations of pre-NHS hospitals. For example, while some contemporary observers stated t hat, \"it is universally acknowledged that 192 Ibid 193 Tunbridge, \"The Effect of Social Class on Hospital Use\" 194 Tunbridge, \"The Effect of Social Class on Hospital Use\", p. 12 195 For example, Logan et al, \"Dynamics of Medical Car e: The Liverpool Study into Use of Hospital Resourc es\" and Weiss & Greenlick, \"Determinants of Medical Care Utilisation\" Context: Historical - 71 - our health services are the best in the world\" , others were generally critical 196 . It is often implied that before the advent of the NHS, the poor were denied the healthcare available to their wealthy counterpart. A closer analysis of the pre-NHS healthcare system implies that might not be strictly true in the pre 1948 era. Free public and charitable care was available for t he working class even in the mid nineteenth century and treatment was provided at a small cost through various types of contributory scheme 197 . From 1911, many workers received free general pra ctitioner care under the National Health Insurance, and only those above the level of destitution began to be charged for their care. Middle class patients were often ex empt from such schemes, and by having to pay high private fees they subsidised the care of w orking class patients 198 . It is possible that in terms of GP care, middle class patients received be tter treatment, but this does not seem to have been the case in hospitals, as middle class pa tients were generally confined to the smaller and less well equipped (in both machinery and speci alists) private hospitals, as the most proficient hospitals were in the voluntary sector a nd unavailable to the middle classes 199 . Furthermore, there does not seem to be any affluenc e inequality (by geographic location in England and Wales) in hospital distribution. The ta ble below presents geographic variations, but without a clear North: South dichotomy, althoug h there does seem to be some evidence of variation between hospitals. 196 Powell, \"Hospital Provision before the National He alth Service: A Geographical Study of the 1945 Hosp ital Survey\", p. 483 197 Watters, \"Class Inequality and Healthcare\", p. 43 198 Ibid 199 Powell, \"Hospital Provision before the National He alth Service: A Geographical Study of the 1945 Hosp ital Survey\", p. 485 Context: Historical - 72 - Table 2.3.15: Hospital beds (per 1,000 population) by region in England and Wales, 1938 200 Region Hospital beds (per 1,000) Acute Chronic Maternity Tuberculosis Infectious Diseases Total North-Western 3.35 1.04 0.33 0.84 1.22 Yorkshire 1.16 0.23 0.59 1.18 5.32 West Midlands 2.57 1.40 0.20 0.59 0.69 5.45 1.62 0.22 0.61 0.75 5.83 Berkshire, Bucks and Oxfordshire 2.20 1.91 0.19 and more influential was the variation in fina ncial constraints that was faced by interwar hospitals. Hospitals in the North-West and South-Ea st were equally constrained 201 . Modernisation and increasing medical staff costs se em to be an important determinant of strain and subsequent service of interwar hospitals , which were often unequally distributed between hospitals independently of geographical aff luence. Without a central system to redistribute resources from surplus to deficit hosp itals these inequalities were not reduced, despite an increase in bed numbers per population i n interwar Britain 202 . It was not until 1948 that these differences began to be addressed (throu gh an integrated hospital system that was more able to allocate resources). 200 Powell, \"Hospital Provision before the National He alth Service: A Geographical Study of the 1945 Hosp ital Survey\", p. 498 201 Gorsky et al, \"The Financial Health of Voluntary H ospitals in Interwar Britain\", p. 539 202 Gorsky et al, \"The Financial Health of Voluntary H ospitals in Interwar Britain\", p. 543 Context: Historical - 73 - Although the NHS reduced some of these problems the NHS has proved to be \"remarkably ineffective\" in reducing class inequalities in health 203 . What is most persistent and vivid is the conclusion that improvements in health (outlined ab ove) were distributed in favour of richer social classes. 2.3.6.3 Inefficiency of the NHS A consistent theme throughout the findings of the t hesis is that the poor performance of the NHS detracted from further improvements in quality of life, in general and also as a result of the health inequalities it failed to eliminate. Evidence of the shortcomings of the NHS is highligh ted by recent considerations about the efficiency of healthcare systems. At the end of the twentieth century evaluations began to be made (by scholars and the World Health Organisation ) about the overall performance of healthcare services in a variety of countries. Thes e measures have considered numerous facets that are capable of reflecting efficacy of health c are services, for example: the level and distribution of health attainment, responsiveness o f the health system and the degree of fairness in financing relative to the country's lev el of economic and educational development 204 . Hence, to establish the contribution of a healthc are system (or 'mortality amenable to healthcare') it is necessary to determi ne what the health service achieves in excess of what would have been achieved in its abse nce, in absolute terms and also relative to healthcare service investment 205 . The results of these studies have highlighted the p oor performance of the British NHS. Nolte & McKee (2003) have illustrated the fall in Britain 's ranking when 'mortality amenable to healthcare' is considered 206 . For example, when considering disability adjusted life expectancy the UK achieves a world rank of tenth, but when the healthcare service is considered in conjunction with these efficiency proxy outcomes, t he UK rank declines to eighteen. Evans et al (2001) have painted an even bleaker picture with their considerations about healthcare 203 Watters, \"Class Inequality and Healthcare\", p. 127 204 Nolte & McKee, \"Measuring the Health of Nations: A nalysis of Mortality Amenable to Healthcare\", p. 11 29 205 Evans & Tandon & Murray & Lauer, \"Comparative Effi ciency of National Health Systems: Cross National conometric Analysis\", p. 307 206 Nolte & McKee, \"Measuring the Health of Nations: A nalysis of Mortality Amenable to Healthcare\", p. 11 31 Context: Historical - 74 - efficiency, where the UK only achieves a word rank of twenty-fourth, behind much lesser developed economies such as Jamaica, Malta and Oman207 . Although it is important to appreciate that these n ew measures, which consider 'mortality amenable to healthcare' are in their infancy and th at these types of studies have had to contend with numerous anomalies and controversies there is still a clear and valid message about the paucity of the performance of the NHS, particularly during the last decade of the twentieth century (when these studies where conducted). When considering 'mortality amenable to healthcare efficiency' the UK experiences significa nt losses in its performance appraisal. Finally, in conjunction with being inefficient the NHS was also under funded, both of which have contributed to comparatively poor healthcare f or the English population. For example, it was not until the new millennium that the governmen t finally conceded the need to bring its health service spending (on cancer) up to the Europ ean average. However, there was still no guarantee that funds would be available on a sustai ned basis, necessary to bring the NHS standard up to the European average. The problems of escalating costs, that have plagued the NHS since its introduction, are faced by all health services, but during the second half of the twentieth century they have become increasingly and particularly acute in the UK becau se of under spending and neglect, which were evident from the birth of the NHS 208 . 207 Evans & Tandon & Murray & Lauer, \"Comparative Effi ciency of National Health Systems: Cross National E conometric Analysis\", p. 308 208 Webster, \"The National Health Service: A Political History\", p. 257 Methodology - 75 - 3.

And, why are these features the most im portant aspects to gauge for considering improved health in twentieth century En gland? This will be followed by the solutions to the deman ds above, through providing an outline about the existing willingness to pay (WTP) model a nd how this will be developed into an extended willingness to pay or quality adjusted lif e expectancy (QALE) model which forms the thesis' central methodology. This chapter will also delineate the sensitivity an alysis that will be applied to the results of the QALE methodology, in order to provide a broader range of estimates and a more comprehensive and justified indication of the possi ble contribution of improved health. 3.1 Methodology Outline A major component of the thesis is the identificati on and valuation of improvements in health related quality of life. Once these developm ents have been documented, the thesis Methodology - 76 - will endeavour to quantify them so that they can be included in an extended measure of national income. This will be achieved through deve loping the existing willingness to pay methodology (WTP) to include morbidity improvements as WTP currently only considers mortality improvements. Hence, a significant attrib ute of the thesis methodology will be the creation of an original (extended) WTP model, w hich considers morbidity in tandem with mortality. A simplified version of this proces s is outlined at the end of this chapter in Figure 3.4, which is useful for referencing in orde r to understand the general features of the QALE methodology. 3.2 Willingness to Pay Methodology (WTP) The WTP methodology considers what individuals woul d be willing to forego in income for an increased probability of survival with healt hy life years. I.e. the amount an individual would pay for an increase in their healt hy life expectancy in the current period (not for a given [future] age of life expectancy or to prevent specific illnesses). Numerous authors have highlighted the importance of improved mortality to society, to such an extent that there is a plausible likelihood of an individual sacrificing any other modern standards of living to maintain current mort ality rates 209 . Bradford DeLong (2000) has highlighted the contribution of improved health to economic development, which has been so extensive during the twentieth century (in developed countries) that there is not likely to be any magnitude of income that could com pensate a year 2000 family for living under 1900 health conditions. Therefore, given the absence of modern vaccines, antibiotics and other technologies in 1900, it is hard to argue that anything less than an astronomical income in 1900 could compensate for the health of 2 000 210 . The indifference curve diagram below illustrates th ese types of claims and subsequently illuminates the basic notion of the thesis methodol ogy. 209 Usher, \"The Measure of Economic Growth\", p. 223 210 Bradford DeLong, \"Cornucopia: The Pace of Economic Growth in the Twentieth Century\", p. 22 Methodology - 77 - Figure 3.1: Indifference curve diagram to illustrat e the rationale of the WTP methodology Consider a person observed initially at point 1900 and subsequently at point 2000: between 1900 and 2000 life expectancy has increased from E1 to E2 and income has increased from C1 to C2*, not C2, as traditional measures would in dicate. Point C2* is the height of the intersection of the indifference curve attained in 2000 with a vertical line at the value of life expectancy in 1900, whereby the individual mai ntains 2000 income with 1900 life expectancy. The difference between C2 and C2* indic ates the income or consumption value of increased life expectancy between 1900 and 2000 and the amount of income that an individual would be willing to pay for the impro ved health conditions of 2000, compared to 1900. The notion of imputing national income measures to account for increases in life expectancy was initially proposed by Usher (1980), who recognised the need to consider the value of maximising age specific mortality rate s and societies' willingness to pay for this improvement 211 . Usher's main objective was to find a natural way of combining the two social indicators (GNP and mortality rates) int o a single comprehensive index, his basic contention being that the growth of GNP alone significantly understates the extent to which current generations are better off than earli er generations. 211 Usher, \"The Measure of Economic Growth\", p. 228 Income (Units per Year) 140 120 C2* 100 800 600 C2 400 C1 200 100 0 0 20 40 E1 60 80 E2 100 1900 2000 Preference Direction Healthy Life Expectancy (Years) Methodology - 78 - These considerations have been developed in a limit ed number of studies, namely: Nordhaus (1999) 212 for the USA between 1900 and 1995, Crafts (2001) 213 for the UK between 1870 and 1998 and Hickson (2002) 214 for twentieth century Japan. Despite their agreement with Usher's objectives of providing a mo re indicative national income estimate, none of these studies measure health per se, as they all utilise mortality (i.e. increased life expectancy) as a proxy for health. In this willingness to pay approach, gains from imp roved mortality are treated as an imputation for a change in the environment, because increased life expectancy has been largely a result of the accumulation of knowledge o n how to cure and prevent diseases that affect all individuals (rich and poor, educated and uneducated), and subsequently this is the reason that these improvements are not included in income measures, and therefore not double counted by WTP imputations 215 . 3.2.1 Extended Willingness to Pay Methodology (WTP) The thesis will enhance existing willingness to pay methods in order to consider the value of increased life expectancy (as has been accomplis hed in the Nordhaus, Crafts and Hickson studies) and also improved morbidity from a health and welfare perspective. As well as considering the reduction in the death rate and the corresponding value of an improved mortality profile, the thesis will conside r the decline in the burden of morbidity and its associated value. Although this more compre hensive health measure can only yield estimates it is still superior as these estimates p rovide a much more accurate indication about health than the more precise but less detaile d mortality only estimates. Hence, through adopting a more comprehensive (utility base d) measure of economic growth it is possible to indicate how existing (fiscal only) mea sures are inadequate for providing a thorough indication of improvements in welfare. Mor eover, through adopting a more comprehensive definition of health it is possible t o estimate the full gain in utility towards an extended national income. This provides results that are greater than those that are yielded when extending GDP for mortality only. Finally, the methodological approach used in the th esis to obtain utility national income (which is defined as the maximum amount that a nati on can consume while ensuring that 212 Nordhaus, \"The Health of Nations: The Contribution of Improved Health to Living Standards\" 213 Crafts (2005) \"The Contribution of Increased Life Expectancy to Growth of Living Standards in the UK, 1870-1998\". Retrieved 17 June 2005, from: www.york.ac.uk/res/wpeg/documents/crafts.pdf 214 Hickson, \"The Contribution of Increased Life Expec tancy to Standards of Living in Twentieth Century J apan\" 215 Usher, \"The Measure of Economic Growth\", p. 247 Methodology - 79 - members of generations can have expected lifetime u tility the same as that of the current generation), values improvements in quality adjuste d life expectancy by considering the change in the population weighted average of age sp ecific mortality rates multiplied by the estimated value of death averted in conjunction wit h the population weighted average of the morbidity burden multiplied by the estimated va lue of unhealthy life years averted. This is approximately equal to the increase in qual ity adjusted life expectancy times the value of an additional healthy life year. The data required to make these willingness to pay methodological adjustments to the conventional estimates of national income are popul ation by age, death rates by age and the value of death averted (value of a statistical life). The data required to make extended willingness to pay estimates are population by age, prevalence of a given disease, the burden of the disease (quality adjusted life year, QALY) and the value of ill health averted (value of a statistical healthy life year). These t wo calculations will then be combined to estimate the aggregate health improvement, namely, QALE. 3.2.2 Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) In order to estimate a society's willingness to pay for reduced mortality it is necessary to establish the amount that a group of people (a soci ety) would be willing to pay for a reduction in the current period probability of deat h. VSL studies estimate the value of fatal risk reduction (through evaluating the amount that a society is willing to pay) in the expectation of saving one life (of an unidentified person) in the current period 216 . For example, if people are on average willing to pay \u00a31 0 for a safety improvement that will reduce their individual risk of death during the co ming year by 1 in 100,000, this risk reduction would mean that, on average, in a group o f 100,000 people there would be 1 less premature death, and these 100,000 people would, be tween them, be willing to pay \u00a310 x 100,000 = \u00a31 million for the prevention of 1 statis tical fatality 217 . Hence in this example the VSL is \u00a31 million. There is a growing body of empirical evidence conce rning premiums individuals are willing to pay to reduce the risk of death by small amounts 218 . One method for deriving such estimates is based on individuals' observed be haviour in production, e.g. labour market risks compensating wage studies. Another app roach considers the implications of 216 Miller, \"Variations between Countries in the Value s of Statistical Life\", p. 170 217 This is example is taken from: The Department of H ealth, \"Economic Appraisal of the Health Effects of Air Pollutants\", p. 2 218 Blomquist, \"The Value of Human Life: An Empirical Perspective\", p. 158 Methodology - 80 - individuals' observed behaviour in consumption, e.g . data concerning the time- inconsistency-safety trade offs involved in car sea t belt use, motorway speed decisions, the purchase price and the maintenance of smoke detecto rs and the frequency of car tyre replacement 219 . Both of these approaches are revealed preference studies. The third method, contingent valuation (CV), analyses replies to questionnaires that ask individuals about their willingness to pay for various hypothet ical changes in risk. The majority of revealed preference studies have fo cussed on risk compensating wage differentials of hedonic price studies, where there is an equilibrium wage risk function such that, at any particular point workers are substitut ing income for risk of death. By estimating this equilibrium wage risk function - while control ling for other job characteristics - it is possible to identify the compensating wage differen tial and subsequently estimate the value of a statistical life. Because labour market studies reflect actual behavi our, with decisions that are consistently repeated, it is thought that this form of VSL study is most reliable and therefore many more studies have been conducted from this perspect ive, which has generated a much richer variety in risk compensating revealed prefer ence studies (from a collection of time periods and occupation). Estimates of the VSL range widely: from less than $ 100,000 to several million dollars 220 .

Table 3.1 highlights that these studies also report their VSL results in a variety of currencies. This is not a problem because the key v alue of the table is to highlight the range of existing VSL estimates, which Table 3.1 highligh ts is so broad, even without a standardised currency. Therefore, Table 3.1 indicat es that the collection of even the most credible VSL studies lack precision, which has led sceptics to claim that \" the variation in VSL estimates raises such doubts about their reliab ility that they are virtually redundant\" (for example, for a time this sceptical view was ad opted by the UK Department of Transport)227 . A more positive and preferable approach (on philo sophical, scientific and practical grounds) is to identify the reasons for t he large variation in empirical estimates and try to define what constitutes a reliable study and subsequent estimate of the VSL 228 . Although it is not possible to claim that the VSL s elected for use in the thesis is a definitively precise estimate, it does supersede ma ny of the shortcomings inherent in numerous VSL estimates. The thesis utilises the VSL result from one of the most credible and detailed studies available. Miller (2000) provi des a summary VSL 'best estimate' derived from applying a detailed and robust statist ical analysis to the most reliable existing VSL studies (for the UK) 229 . The initial stage of Miller's analysis was the id entification of reliable VSL studies which are candidates for his a ggregate VSL. These are shown in the table below. Table 3.2: Range and estimate of statistical life v alues from the most credible studies for United Kingdom as selected by Miller (in thousands of 1995 $)230 Author / Year Type of VSL study Estimated VSL Ghosh et al (1975) Consumer Behaviour 1704 Jones-Lee et al (1983) Contingent Value 3568 Jones-Lee et al (1995) Contingent Value 2691 Maclean (1979) Contingent Value 2446 Marin Ibid 228 Ibid 229 Miller, \"Variations Between Countries in Values of Statistical Life\", p. 172 230 Miller, \"Variations Between Countries in Values of Statistical Life\", p. 176 -177 Methodology - 83 - Hence, the studies in Table 3.2 were used by Miller to estimate the most plausible aggregate VSL value. This was achieved through a pr ocess of statistical analysis, which optimises the credibility of Miller's VSL results. At the outset it was necessary for Miller to standa rdise all of the studies. This was achieved through ensuring that they were all measuring the s ame features (unique to each type of VSL derivation study) through regressing any inaccu rate or inconsistent variables whilst maintaining the necessary features of the study, e. g. through identifying occupation specific risk from industry wide risk data. Moreove r, all VSLs used in the Miller estimate have been standardised for currency, the differing value of currencies over time and tax, such that all units of value are in the same conver tible format. After standardising the studies Miller remedied one of the most persistent and obvious flaws in numerous VSL studies, which is that they a ccount for actual risk rather than perceived risk, and catered for this through includ ing an adjustment for risk misconceptions in his regressions. Along a similar vein, numerous labour market studies tend to utilise 'all-cause fatality risk' rather th an 'work place fatality risk by occupation' and/or use 'fatality risk by industry' without incl uding 'occupational indicator variables', which is often further exacerbated by use of averag e wage data. Miller's regression model estimates the impact of these problems and subseque ntly eliminates their influence. This is desirable as these flaws tend to artificially influ ence the value of the VSL: using 'all-cause mortality risk' tends to underestimate the VSL and failure to use 'occupational mortality risk' or occupational dummies (in regression analys is) tends to overestimate the VSL. In addition to compensating for the problems that a re evident in labour market revealed preference VSL studies, Miller applies similar cons iderations to revealed preference consumption VSL methodologies. The key problem here is that consumer behaviour studies tend to underestimate the VSL because these studies are based on (consumer) risk, which is typically under-perceived. Hence, labour m arket and contingent valuation studies tend to yield VSL estimates in a similar range, whe reas consumer behaviour VSL results tend to be lower as a result of misunderstood risk. This is shown in Table 3.2, where, with the exception of the Melinek (1974) wage-risk estim ate, behaviour studies yield the lowest VSL. This artificial influence is amended in the we ighting of the estimates in Miller's aggregate best estimate VSL, e.g. Miller's best est imate VSL (which is a weighted average Methodology - 84 - of the VSL results in Table 3.2 [see Table 3.3] = 2 ,750 versus 1,608 and 1,704 which were yielded in the consumer behaviour VSL studies [see Table 3.2]). Lastly, in a best effort to include the broadest ra nge of credible VSL studies whilst yielding the most plausible aggregate VSL estimate for the U K, Miller has weighted the VSL studies contained within the overall estimate. Henc e, the best estimate that is developed from the seven studies (outline in Table 3.2) has w eighted these studies according to their type of VSL study, methodologies within the study a nd overall results. This optimises the plausibility of Miller's best VSL estimate as it en sures (as far as possible) that any artificial influences have been minimised. The outcome of Miller's efforts to consider the gre atest number of existing VSL studies and include them with optimal accuracy in an aggreg ate or 'best estimate' VSL yields results that are desirable for the thesis. This is largely because the objective of the thesis is to utilise a VSL which is roughly plausible, for tw entieth century England. The provision of a weighted average of studies is desirable becau se it provides a broader consideration about what the VSL might be. The subsequent applica tion of this broad range of studies to detailed statistical analysis is also desirable for the thesis because it helps to eliminate any sources of inaccuracy and artificial risk which wou ld in turn yield a distorted VSL value. Finally, the inclusion of a representative for all three types of VSL study is also desirable as it goes some way in balancing out the advantages and disadvantages inherent in each type of study. Moreover, a probable reason for the difference in estimates yielded by the three types of VSL study is that they are measuring different risk functions and therefore having all of these represented (and weighted accor dingly, by Miller) is desirable for the accuracy of the thesis' VSL. A final appeal of adopting the VSL results of the M iller study is the versatility of the VSL results. It is possible to present the VSL as eithe r an aggregate monetary estimate (shown in the table below as 2,759,000 [1995 dollars]) or as a VSL multiple (shown in the table below as 101, 128 or 154), which is then multiplied by GDP per capita, which yields the VSL estimate. The mechanics and appeal of using Mil ler's VSL multiple approach are outlined below. Therefore, Miller's unique and credible efforts of finding an aggregate 'best estimate' VSL will be utilised in the thesis as a result of the l ikely accuracy of Miller's estimates. As a Methodology - 85 - direct result of Miller's procedure and analysis, t he best estimate VSL used in the thesis is representative (as it was derived from a broad base of studies) and accurate (as far as possible due to detailed statistical analysis) whic h makes it ideal for the thesis' methodology. The best estimates that this intricate statistical analysis has derived are shown in the table below, which presents Miller's ' best VSL estimate' and a range of 'best VSL estimate: GDP multiples', which will be explain ed below. Table 3.3: Miller's best VSL estimate (in thousands of 1995 $) and according VSL multiple (of GDP per capita) range for United Kingd om 231 Best VSL estimate Best VSL estimate: VSL multiple Range Low Mid High United Kingdom 2750 101 128 154 Table 3.3 provides the results to Miller's analysis . There are two ways of thinking about the VSL (both of which are considering the same fea tures). First, as an aggregate monetary estimate, which is shown in the table above as 2,75 0,000 (1995 dollars). The second way in which the VSL can be considered is as a function of i) a VSL multiple and ii) GDP per capita. In this second method, the VSL multiple (sh own above as 101, 128 or 154) is multiplied by GDP per capita (precisely, GDP for th e mid point of the period under consideration, is the value prescribed by this meth odology to account for the average economic wealth during the period under considerati on) which yields the VSL estimate. For example, for the period 1900 to 2000, 1950 GDP per capita will be multiplied with: 101 (low VSL), 128 (mid VSL) or 154 (high VSL). Or, for the period 1900 to 1925, the thesis will multiply 1913 GDP per capita by 101, 12 8 or 154. The key point here is that both types of VSL are accurate and identical in wha t they are measuring, although, when considering long and/or historical time periods the latter (VSL multiple) approach is superior. The reasons for this and the subsequent a ppeal of using the VSL multiple approach (which is the strategy adopted by the thes is' methodology) will be outlined below. Therefore, in relation to Table 3.3 the VSL(s) that will be used throughout the thesis will be those that are derived by using the Miller VSL m ultiple, either 101 (low estimate), 128 (mid estimate) or 154 (high estimate), which will b e multiplied by the associated GDP per capita number (which will be the level of GDP per c apita [GDP pc] for the mid point of the 231 Miller, \"Variations Between Countries in Values of Statistical Life\", p. 180 Methodology - 86 - era under consideration), in order to identify the VSL for the different eras of the twentieth century analysed by the thesis. When considering the value of the VSL that will be utilised in the thesis, it should be noted that the precise value of the VSL is not fundamenta l in influencing the overall findings of the thesis methodology. The thesis will apply a ran ge of VSL estimates ('low' GDP pc]) in order to reinforce that even if a low value for the VSL is considered, the twentieth century health gains have been extremely valuable a nd pronounced and contribute to the same overall conclusions as the high VSL estimate. Hence, because of the nature of the VSL in the thesis methodology combined with the mag nitude of improvements in the death rate a VSL estimate that is in the correct region w ill be sufficient to provide an accurate approximation about the value of twentieth century mortality improvements in England. When considering the validity of the thesis' VSL wh at is important is that the key issues of contention are recognised and that a range of estim ates are chosen accordingly. Although it is possible to supersede some aspects of inaccuracy in VSL studies (as was achieved by adopting Miller's estimates, as outlined above) the re are still inherent problems associated with estimating the VSL. The most prominent sources of VSL inaccuracies and contention are considered below. A universal problem with estimating the VSL is the likelihood that individual rates of marginal substitution - and hence the VSL - will al most certainly differ from one cause of death to another and therefore it may not be approp riate to find one VSL for all situations 232 . For example, the UK Department of Health have est imated that willingness to pay for reductions in involuntary and poorly unders tood risk can exceed that of voluntary, familiar risk by a factor of up to two or three 233 . A problem associated with evaluating labour market risk is the underlying notion of this revealed preference approach: that riskier occupati ons can be expected to carry clearly identifiable wage premiums as compensating for risk . However, this cannot be accepted as a universal occurrence. For example, workers in hig h risk employment may simply be less 232 Blomquist, \"Estimating the Value of Life: Recent D evelopments\", p. 28 in Jones-Lee, \"The Value of Lif e and Safety\" 233 Department of Health, \"Economic Appraisal of the H ealth Effects of Air Pollution\", p. 3 Methodology - 87 - risk opposed than average, or lack other economic o pportunities 234 . Hence, some of the differences in the VSL are surely due, in part to d ifferent relative demands for occupational safety among the groups studied 235 . The extent to which wage premiums are aggregated fo r labour market conditions often reflects non-fatal as well as fatal risks. Lalive ( 2003) argues that industry aggregation of risk is responsible for the wide range in VSL estim ates 236 . This shortcoming is particularly problematic from the perspective of the thesis beca use it creates the potential for double counting issues when the VSL (valuation for improve ments in fatal risk) is combined with the VSHLY (valuation for improvements in non-fatal risk) in the overall QALE methodology. However, it should also be noted that this weakness has been amended as far as possible by Miller's statistical analysis which attempts to identify, convert and measure accurate risk. There are also problems concerning model misspecifi cation and risk data sets that are inaccurate for estimating the wage differential. Fo r example, the omitted variables problem and the over aggregation of data are likely to prod uce estimates that are not precisely accurate. The inability to keep all variables separ ate (and avoid multicollinearity) is one of the greatest problems when trying to estimate the V SL 237 . Hence, it is necessary, but not always possible, to control for other factors in or der to isolate the pure wealth risk trade off and the subsequent VSL 238 . Miller has adhered to these problems and overcome them as far as possible through his regressions. A final limitation of the revealed preference appro ach is that it is inherently incapable of generating estimates at an individual level. The qu estionnaire approach is useful as it is able to avoid these major difficulties encountered by revealed preference studies. The questionnaire method is also a straightforward proc edure for computing the VSL without distributional weighting schemes, an exercise that is extremely difficult under the compensating wage differential approach. However, c ontingent valuation (CV) estimates are viewed as less indicative than revealed prefere nce, largely because survey respondents may have inadequate opportunities or incentive to a ccurately determine their trade-off 234 Hodgson & Meiners, \"Cost-of-Illness Methodology: A Guide to Current Practices and Procedures\", p. 443 235 Blomquist, \"Estimating the Value of Life: Recent D evelopments\", p. 28 in Jones-Lee, \"The Value of Lif e and Safety\" 236 Lalive, \"Did we Overestimate the Value of Health?\" 237 Hudson, \"History by Numbers: An Introduction to Qu antitative Approaches\", p. 162 238 Jones-Lee, \"The Economics of Safety and Physical R isk\", p. 54 Methodology - 88 - between income and mortality risk 239 . The Miller VSL estimation process used in the the sis recognises this short coming of the CV method and w eights CV VSL results accordingly. It should be noted that, when considering Table 3.2 and 3.3 the best estimate VSL (=2750) shown in Table 3.3 seems very close to the results of CV studies shown in Table 3.2 (=2691, 2446, 3568), which is a coincidence as the final VSL number is a function of a very detailed statistical analysis which consolidat es a large number of weights and estimates. An additional source of inaccuracy is generated thr ough utilising a constant VSL value over time. This problem is exacerbated by the conte ntion that exists in the literature regarding the nature of the VSL over time. Costa & Kahn (2003) have highlighted that as an economy develops, income, the quantity of safety and the health and well-being of the population also increase along with the demand for safety and the subsequent compensating wage differential 240 . For example, they estimate that between 1940 and 1980 the VSL increased by 300 to 400 percent, rising fro m roughly 1 million (1990 $) in 1940 to 5 million (1990 $) in 1980 in the USA, which indica tes a VSL income elasticity of between 1.5 and 1.7 (estimated here as 1.6, see Tab le 3.4) 241 . Conversely, some studies have shown that there is an inelastic relationship between income and the VSL. Viscusi & Aldy (2003) also consider wage risk studies and con clude that the income elasticity for the VSL is less than 1 and they estimates income elasti city as being between 0.5 and 0.7 (estimated here as 0.6, see Table 3.4) 242 . There have been no studies, to date, for the historical VSL in the UK and it is therefore imposs ible to provide estimates which indicate the income elasticity and subsequent VSL over the t wentieth century for England. However, the thesis makes some progress in addressi ng this issue through utilising Miller's VSL multiple which is applied to GDP for the mid-po int of the era being considered and is therefore dynamic to an extent, because changes in the wealth of an economy are accounted for with GDP per capita. Moreover, in uti lising a constant VSL multiple the thesis is estimating income elasticity as unitary, which provides a mid-point between the divergences (of 1.6 elasticity and 0.6 inelasticity ) in the literature. 239 Hammitt, Lui, Lui, \"Survival is a Luxury Good: The Increasing Value of a Statistical Life\", p. 2 240 Costa & Kahn, \"Changes in the Value of a Statistic al Life, 1940-1980\", p. 1 241 Costa & Kahn, \"Changes in the Value of a Statistic al Life, 1940-1980\", p. 13 242 Viscusi & Aldy, \"The Value of a Statistical Life: A Critical Review of Market Estimates Throughout Th e World\", p. 44 Methodology - 89 - The implication of these different elasticities is the variance of the VSL relative to GDP. Costa & Kahn's results imply that as an economy dev elops, increases in longevity or the VSL become more valuable (as the VSL rises 60 perce nt more than GDP or income, because the VSL income elasticity they propose is 1 .6 percent, on average). This is in direct contrast with Viscusi & Aldy's result, which implies that earlier increases in longevity were more valuable (as the VSL rises appr oximately 60 percent less than GDP or income, because they propose that the VSL is inelas tic by 0.6 percent). The implication of these theories (which are summarised in Table 3.4) is the relative magnitude of the VSL: if the VSL is income inelastic (Viscusi & Aldy), the v alue of the VSL is relatively large in earlier time periods, and the opposite is true for an income elastic VSL (Costa & Kahn), where the VSL becomes increasingly valuable as the twentieth century unfolds. The unitary elasticity (Miller utilised in the thesis) VSL estimates will lie between inelastic and elastic, respectively. The table below provides a summary of the ramificat ions these different elasticities have upon the VSL. In Table 3.4 the VSL is derived from Miller (unitary elasticity), this VSL is calculated as the VSL multiple times GDP per capita for 1950 (mid point of 1900 to 2000). The alternative VSL values (for elasticity = 1.6 an d inelasticity = 0.6) are derived through considering the Miller 2000 VSL value and adjusting this accordingly: identifying a VSL that has risen by 60 percent and 160 percent relati ve to income over the twentieth century. Table 3.4: VSL value when assuming different levels of VSL income elasticity: Costa versus Viscusi, 1900-2000 Study VSL income elasticity 1900-2000 (= 1950) VSL value (millions) Costa & Kahn 243 1.6 0.64 Viscusi & Aldy 244 0.6 1.18 Thesis (Miller) 245 1 0.88 In Table 3.4 the thesis VSL assumes a unitary VSL i ncome elasticity. This is calculated through multiplying the VSL multiple (128) with GDP per capita for the mid-point of 1900 to 2000 (1950 GDP per capita = 6907, hence 6907 * 1 28 = 0.88 million = the VSL for 1900-2000 using unitary VSL income elasticity), in order to identify the VSL (this is the 243 Costa & Kahn, \"Changes in the Value of a Statistic al Life, 1940-1980\", p. 1 244 Viscusi & Aldy, \"The Value of a Statistical Life: A Critical Review of Market Estimates Throughout Th e World\", p. 44 245 The Miller multiple used for the year 2000 was us ed as the base in deriving the VSL for alternative income elasticities as this is considered to be the most accurate VSL estimate, derived from Miller, \"Variations Between Countries in Values of Statistical Life\", p. 180 Methodology - 90 - process of calculating the VSL using a VSL multiple approach, which has been outlined in Table 3.3). The other VSL estimates in Table 3.4 are calculated by considering the Miller VSL for 2000 and adjusting this accordingly for elasticity of 0.6 and 1.6, in order to identify the VSL for these alternative elasticities, in 1950, wh ich will make these results comparable with the thesis VSL shown above in Table 3.4. The C osta and Kahn estimates is the product of a VSL income elasticity of approximately 1.6 (average of 1.5 and 1.7), which indicates that the Miller VSL for the year 2000 est imate needs to be adjusted (in accordance with the Costa VSL change) in order to e stimate a historical (1950) VSL with 1.6 VSL income elasticity (i.e. Miller 2000 VSL = 1 28 [VSL multiple] * 18714 [GDP per capita in the year 2000] = 2,395,392; 2.395.392 / 3 .735 [percentage change in the Costa 1.6 income elasticity VSL] = 0.64 million). The same pr ocess is necessary in order to adjust the Viscusi and Aldy estimate so that the VSL has i ncome inelasticity of about 0.6 (average of 0.5 and 0.7). Hence, the Miller VSL for 2000 estimate needs to be adjusted in accordance with the Viscusi VSL change in order to estimate a historical (1950) VSL with 0.6 VSL income inelasticity (i.e. Miller 2000 VSL = 128 [VSL multiple] * 18714 [GDP per 2,395,392; 2,395,392 / 2.026 [percentage change 0.6 income inelasticity VSL] = 1.18 millio n). These results are shown in Table 3.4. Another noteworthy point about Table 3.4 is the rel ationship between the thesis VSL and the alternative elasticity VSL results. The relatio nship between Costa & Kahn, Viscusi & Aldy, and the thesis VSL displays the properties th at would be expected: income inelastic (Viscusi & Aldy) VSL estimates are higher in earlie r periods than unitary elastic and income elastic (Costa & Kahn), respectively. This i s a result of the VSL relationship with income, implied by these elasticities, such that fo r income inelasticity, earlier gains in VSL are more valuable and for income elasticity, later gains become more valuable. Table 3.4 highlights that the VSL is influenced by the elasticity that is adopted and therefore the subsequent result (derived in the the sis) about the value of twentieth century improvements in mortality will also be a function o f the VSL (and its elasticity to twentieth century income). However, as has been stated above, this does not cause an overruling concern for the thesis because the precise value of the VSL is not fundamental in changing the aggregate results, largely as a result of the m agnitude of improvements in mortality Methodology - 91 - (and to a lesser extent GDP). I.e. whichever elasti city is adopted the results and conclusions of the thesis hold weight. This claim w ill be justified in Chapter 8.1 sensitivity analysis about the VSL (see Table 8.1.11), when the range of elasticity VSL values (s hown in Table 3.4) are applied to the thesis methodology . Hence, the key value of Table 3.4 is to highlight the range of VSL elasticity theories in t he literature and indicate how and why these will not overly influence the conclusions of the thesis. An additional source of inaccuracy associated with a constant VSL, which is more consistent across all the literature and a problem for the thesis is the change in the age profile of the twentieth century English population . Hence, a dynamic VSL multiple is desirable to account for changes in the VSL during an individual's life cycle and the overall effect that this phenomenon has upon twenti eth century increases in the proportion of elderly in the population. VSL studies that are based on hedonic wage model estimates, age-specific hedonic wage estimates and a minimum d istance indicator estimate, have highlighted the effect of age upon the VSL through their findings that workers' VSL exhibits an inverted U-shaped relationship over the ir life cycle, such that the VSL for a 60 year old is likely to be less than half the value f or 30 to 40 year olds 246 . The thesis overcomes this to an extent through applying Murray 's age-weighting function (to the aggregate results) which also operates on an invert ed U-shaped function (this will be explained later). The aforementioned problems associated with derivin g the VSL are significantly heightened when trying to assess the morbidity equi valent, namely the value of a statistical health life year (VSHLY). 3.2.3 Value of a Statistical Healthy Life Year (VSH LY) The VSHLY follows the same rationale as the VSL, as it tries to establish the amount that a group of people (society) would be willing to pay for a reduction in the current period probability of ill health (instead of a death that which is estimated by the VSL). The VSHLY will estimate the value of illness risk reduc tion in the expectation of saving one healthy life year (of an undefined person) in the c urrent period, and therefore indicate society's willingness to pay for improved morbidity (= VSHLY). 246 Aldy & Viscusi, \"Age Variations in Worker's Value of a Statistical Life\", Abstract Methodology - 92 - In contrast to the VSL literature, very little has been estimated about the value of a healthy life year. Furthermore, the existing initial attemp ts to consider some form of VSHLY tend to be abstract and generalised and do not consider the array of different illnesses. Cameron and DeShazo (2004) who coined the term 'Val ue of Statistical Illness' (VSI), consider this as the rate of substitution between c onsumption and mortality/morbidity risk through evaluating the willingness to pay to avoid five (and only five) generalised mortality/morbidity states 247 . Although this provides an acceptable first effort to provide a more accurate VSI, there are noteworthy shortcoming s. For example, the very general nature of the illness states and the void of consid erations about the quality of life mean that the VSI is too generalised. Of greater concern is t hat some of the assumptions in their illness model seem incorrect, e.g. the 6 year survi val profiles are arbitrary 248 . Finally, there is no indication about the change in the VSI, i.e. the associated trade-off costs as medical technology has advanced and the resultant improveme nt in the health/welfare quality of life associated with illness which is likely to hav e increased the value of the VSI over time. A more general drawback of the majority of existing VSI methodologies is the assumptions that individuals are in one of two mutu ally exclusive states while alive: healthy or ill. The thesis WTP methodology will pro vide a much more detailed and bespoke evaluation about the burden of illness. The thesis will provide a much more precise VSI est imate through the following process. The VSHLY used throughout this thesis will be a fun ction of the VSL adjusted for the QALY (for the associated illness and era). The VSL considers a life year with 100 percent health and the QALY equals the necessary deduction of a healthy life year and hence the VSHLY will deduct the according QALY fraction for t he burden of illness (blindness, cancer [breast and stomach] or tuberculosis in the context of this thesis). E.g. if the morbidity burden of tuberculosis in 1950 was 40 per cent, an individual would only have gained 60 percent of a healthy life year (1 [full h ealthy life year] - 0.4 [morbidity burden] = 0.6 or 60 percent). The value of this healthy lif e year has been established above (it is the VSL) and this will need to be reduced by 40 percent for the morbidity burden in order to provide the VSHLY value. This calculation is summar ised below. 247 The five mortality/morbidity states that are consi dered: 1) shorter term morbidity with recovery, 2) longer term morbidity with recovery, 3) a combinati on of shorter term morbidity and premature mortality, 4) a combination of longer term morbidity and prema ture mortality, 5) immediate mortality. Cameron & DeShazo, \"An Empirical Model of Demand for Future H ealth States when Valuing Risk-Mitigating Programs\" , p. 5 248 For example, their rates of recovery do not seem t o be consistent with the data concerning survival r ates for certain cancers. I.e. the breast cancer (f ive year) survival rate in the USA (where the study was conducted) is greater than 60 percent, which is th e recovery rate (six year) used in the study. Methodology - 93 - Equation 3.1: Summary definition of VSL and VSHLY u sed in the thesis methodology The VSHLY will also be considered as a range, conta ining 'low', 'mid' and 'high' VSL and QALY variables. Finally, it is important to rei terate that these indices do not have to be estimated with complete precision. The thesis will include a range of VSL and VSHLY estimates. All of these estimate values yield simil ar results that are acceptable for justifying the conclusion about the value of improved health i n twentieth century England. 3.3 Methodology Application As a result of the complexities associated with mea suring morbidity and creating a model capable of doing this and the level of detail that is necessary to generate meaningful results, only a limited number of illnesses can be evaluated. However, these results will ultimately be extended in order to provide a lower bound estimate for the value of all health improvements in twentieth century England. 3.4 Illnesses Considered for the Morbidity Componen t The morbidity component of the thesis will provide a catalogue of illnesses that have been selected within the rationale of the epidemiologica l transition, in an effort to optimise the results of the thesis. To this end, the thesis will provide a detailed (qualitative and quantitative) analysis of an infectious disease, tu berculosis and of a debilitating disease, cancer (represented by breast and stomach cancer). Blindness will also be considered in order to provide an indication about the twentieth century trends in disability. Tuberculosis was selected because it represents one of the most important infectious diseases that declined during the twentieth century in accordance with the epidemiological transition. The prominence of tuberculosis in the t wentieth century enables more detailed *VSL VSL Multiple VSL QALY = Where, VSL Multiple = 101 (low) or 128 (mid) or 154 (high) pc GDP = the level of pc GDP at the mid point of the period under evaluation Methodology - 94 - quantitative considerations due to the availability of better data than alternative infectious diseases, for example, whooping cough and especiall y influenza. One of the reasons for selecting breast cancer is t he same as the appeal mentioned above for tuberculosis. Breast cancer was the most funded and researched cancer in twentieth century England, which facilitates a deeper insight into the quality of life features of this disease. Stomach cancer was utilised as a control f or breast cancer and also to represent a more generic cancer, as far as possible. Breast and stomach cancer were also selected as their burden accords with the epidemiological trans ition, where debilitating diseases have increased to replace (and supersede) the decline in infectious diseases. This cancer trend is in contrast to the most prevalent twentieth century debilitating disease, circulatory or cardiovascular disease. The reason this has not bee n used is because of the decline of this disease from 50 percent of deaths in 1971 to 45 per cent in 2000 (see Table 2.3.2). This contradicts the (epidemiological transition) framew ork of the thesis and would skew the results. Blindness was selected because it represents a sign ificant twentieth century disability. All disabilities, including blindness, have inherent me asurement problems for the QALE (largely because they are not usually resolved in d eath and therefore prevalence is harder to estimate compared to diseases). However, blindness has been well defined and documented over the twentieth century which makes i t a preferable proxy disability compared to alternatives like paraplegia or being d eformed. 3.5 QALY Estimating Process The QALY needs to be established in order to provid e a standardised, numerical indication about the burden of morbidity (from the illnesses c onsidered in the thesis) during different eras of the twentieth century. Essentially, the QAL Y is considering the portion of a healthy life year lost as a result of illness. The QALY wil l be presented as a number that is a fraction of one: where one represents a full health y life year and anything between zero (which represents no healthy life year, i.e. death) and one is the fraction of a healthy life year lost to illness. The QALY number will move clo ser to one as the burden of disease is alleviated. This can occur for numerous reasons, wh ich will be outlined below. The QALY is fundamental in the methodology of the t hesis because it provides the index for morbidity. The QALY forms the foundation of the morbidity and value of a statistical Methodology - 95 - healthy life year (VSHLY) variables, which will ame nd the mortality and value of a statistical life year (VSL) data. Therefore, withou t the QALY it would be impossible to gauge and estimate the numerical/monetary value of improved health and the thesis' aggregate health measure, QALE. The QALY, in the context of the thesis, considers t he quality of life associated with blindness, tuberculosis and cancer (breast and stom ach) related to health and welfare. In order to establish this number it is necessary to p rovide a detailed and consistent analysis of all pertinent literature and data (relevant for the key health and welfare variables in the thesis). These considerations will also be made con sistently across all the illnesses and eras considered in the thesis in order to provide a stan dardised series of QALYs. This is also necessary so that the QALE results for all illnesse s can be combined to provide aggregate QALE results for twentieth century England. This wi ll be achieved through applying the EuroQol standardised spectrum of development, which is explained below. 3.5.1 Key Variables The key variables for consideration for each illnes s in the morbidity chapters of the thesis have been selected for their power as the most indi cative and relevant aspects of quality of life related to health and welfare for sufferers. Methodology - 96 - Table 3.5: Key variables considered for all disease states in the thesis methodology Key Variable Description/Significance Example 249 Government initiatives and help All government legislation, initiatives and benefits (financial and non-monetary) directed towards sufferers. National Health Service Act 1948 and specific Acts of Parliament, e.g. 1922 Cancer Bill Recognition and awareness All factors related to public (i.e. non- governmental) sources of help. This largely includes the work of charities raising awareness and help for sufferers and also preventative campaigns. Chest Clinic Samaritan Funds for the treatment of tuberculosis sufferers in Sanatoria before the introduction of government aid. Health developments Provides an aggregate score for the combination of the three most applicable health sub-variables and contains facets such as understanding, treatment, cure and prevention The introduction of mammography screening for breast cancer and antibiotic therapy to treat tuberculosis. Pain and discomfort Provides a summary indication of the symptoms of a disease in conjunction with the associated medical and (to a lesser extent) welfare aid available to abate the condition. The transformation of twentieth century therapy for tuberculosis. Ability to lead a normal life Provides an aggregate score for the combination of the three most applicable health and welfare sub-variables. These are more subtle and peripheral although equally as important as the aforementioned categories, e.g. depression and anxiety, physical ability, financial burden and social difficulties experienced by disease sufferers The conditions of daily life associated with the prognosis and treatment of stomach cancer. Each of these variables will be consistently evalua ted from the perspective of tuberculosis and cancer sufferers in order to provide a detailed and standardised estimate about the quality of life burden of these illnesses for all e ras of the twentieth century. For all of the variables in the above table the consideration poin t will be matched for tuberculosis, breast cancer and stomach cancer, with the exception of th e sub-variables contained in 'health developments' and 'ability to lead a normal life'. These will be disaggregated for tuberculosis and cancer as outlined in the table be low. 249 It should be noted that the examples provided here are not exhaustive. Methodology - 97 - Table 3.6: Sub-variables for 'health developments' and 'ability to lead a normal life' variables in the thesis methodology Morbid Condition Key Variable Sub-Variable Sub-Variable Description Prevention Medical knowledge about potential predisposing factors for cancer, e.g. smoking. Screening Ability to monitor individuals for cancer before they display symptoms, e.g. mammography. Cancer (Breast and Stomach) Health developments Treatment Ability to abate (if not cure) the spread of cancer, e.g. chemotherapy. Depression The unhappiness associated with having such a potentially fatal illness and the distraction to normal life this can cause. Anxiety The worry about the effects of cancer and treatment options. Cancer (Breast and Stomach) Ability to lead a normal life Physical ability The disabling effects of therapy (whether successful or not) for the treatment of cancer. Understanding The biological recognition and medical agreement about what the tubercle bacillus is, how it is spread and ultimately how it can be treated/prevented. Treatment The discovery of successful therapy for relieving, curing and preventing tuberculosis and the burden that these different twentieth century therapy regimes had upon tuberculosis sufferers. Tuberculosis Health developments Cure The contribution of having a cure for tuberculosis and the associated boost to quality of life this yielded. Depression/Anxiety The unhappiness associated with having such a potentially fatal illness. Social difficulties The problems that arose out of isolation in the pre tuberculosis antibiotic era. Tuberculosis Ability to lead a normal life Financial burden The problems associated with the discontinuation of work that were caused by the tuberculosis disease. It should also be noted that for blindness these va riables are slightly different because of the different nature of disease versus disability. This is essentially because the emphasis on certain quality of life variables is different for a disability than it is for a disease. Although it would be possible to consider blindness in the c ontext of the variables above (as it is still a form of health burden and therefore compatible), it would not be strictly accurate. The key variables for blindness are: government initiat ives and help, recognition and awareness, health developments (prevention, treatme nt), status, ability to lead a normal life (education, employment, wages). The first two varia bles are identical to those evaluated for diseases (and shown as the first two rows in Ta ble 3.5) and 'health developments' is Methodology - 98 - also comparable, just with slightly different sub-v ariables. The final three are more unique to disability and subsequently differ from disease. These are summarised below. Table 3.7: Key variables considered for the disabil ity state in the thesis methodology in addition to relevant variables in Table 3.5 Key Variable Description/Significance Example Prevention Medical knowledge about potential predisposing factors for blindness, e.g. the effect of syphilis when giving birth. Antibiotic treatment for eye trauma that prevent eventual blindness, e.g. cortisone Health developments Treatment Ability to cure causes of blindness, e.g. cataract surgery. Status Provides a summary indication of the actual effectiveness of blind legislation and recognition initiatives across all aspects of blind health and welfare related quality of life. The extent to which anti-discrimination legislation was implemented and offenders prosecuted Education The opportunities for the blind to be educated and instilled with an equal foundation to the able bodied for later employment and wages. Employment The extent to which the blind experienced equal treatment with the able bodied in the labour market. Ability to lead a normal life Wages The extent to which the blind experienced equal wages with the able bodied in the labour market. Therefore, the above table highlights that the gene ral considerations being made by the thesis are uniform across all illnesses, but that t he most fundamental variables differ slightly between disease and disability. After these key variables have been analysed in qua litative detail they will be transformed into a series of index numbers, which are represent ative of the quality of life associated with these conditions during different eras of the twentieth century. The first stage of this qualitative to quantitative transformation will be conducted on a standardised spectrum, referred to as EuroQol. For the actual transformati on of the qualitative analysis, through applying EuroQol to the key variables for different illnesses and eras, into a quantitative (QALY) index, see Chapter 7. 3.5.2 EuroQol Grid EuroQol has been used in numerous studies that try to yield QALY weights for a variety of medical conditions 250 . The appeal of EuroQol is the simple ranking spect rum that it 250 EuroQol (2005). \"What is EC-5D?\", Retrieved 9 Oct ober 2005, from: http://www.euroqol.org/web/users/w hatis.php Methodology - 99 - facilitates and the subsequent transparent comparis on it provides, through establishing a two dimensional information medium. The first set o f EuroQol dimensions is the five key variables (see Table 3.5). The second set of EuroQo l dimensions is the values generated by a ranking scale, which, in the context of the thesi s, assess the performance of these variables from a perspective of quality of life for the sufferer. For all illnesses and eras in the thesis there are six possible health and welfar e ranks. By applying these rankings to the key variables for health and welfare the thesis wil l provide a standardised comparative analysis of all the illnesses and eras compared in the thesis. To summarise, the table below provides the (two dimensional) fundamentals of the EuroQol grid. Table 3.8: EuroQol standardised spectrum: two dimen scale of the thesis methodology: all possible EuroQol variables, health states and ranks Therefore, when considering the illnesses in the th esis, there are five key variables (top part of Table 3.8) and six possible (whole number) rankings that each of these can achieve (bottom part of Table 3.8), i.e. there are 65or 15,625 different states of health and welfare, where the worst situation (of no quality of life fo r any of the key variables) would be 6, 6, 6, 6, 6 and conversely the best situation (or compl ete quality of life for all the five variables) would be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. Once these score s have been established it will be possible to convert them into QALY numbers (a fraction betwe en 0 = death and 1 = complete health EuroQol Variables (= EuroQol health and welfare variables) Government initiatives and help Recognition and awareness Health developments Pain and discomfort Ability to lead a normal life Status (disability only) EuroQol standardised spectrum (= EuroQol evaluations of health and welfare variab les) EuroQol Rank Complete quality of life 1 Good quality of life 2 Fair quality of life 3 Some quality of life 4 Poor quality of life 5 No quality of life 6 Methodology - 100 - or 0.1 percent to 100 percent), which forms a key c omponent of the QALE methodology and eventual thesis results. This is achieved thro ugh indexing the EuroQol 1 to 6 range of possible values into the equivalent QALY 0 to 1 ran ge (this conversion and the corresponding EuroQol and QALY values are presented in Table 7.1). A simplified conceptual illustration of these considerations is shown in the figure below. Figure 3.2: Simplified QALY ranking grid for tuberc ulosis 1900 and 2000 In the above example, which considers the improved quality of life associated with tuberculosis at the beginning and end of the twenti eth century, the possible burden of tuberculosis (and any other illness as the core gri d is standard throughout the thesis) can be anywhere between about 0.1 251 and 100 percent of a healthy life year. In 1900 th e burden of suffering from tuberculosis was considerable and , in the hypothetical context of the diagram, an individual only experienced 25 percent of a healthy life year. By the year 2000, medical and welfare improvements had been con siderable and improved the quality of life for tuberculosis sufferers to 75 percent of a healthy life year. These types of simplified ranking considerations will be made for all illnesses and all time periods studied in the thesis. 251 The reason that the lowest score is 0.1 and not 0 is a result of the underlying inherent assumption i n the thesis that any living state, regardless of h ow severe the burden of morbidity, is better than deat h. Hence, death is equal to 0 and perfect healthy l ife is equal to 100, it is theoretically possible t o have a perfect healthy life but it is not possible to have an illness state that is worse than or equal to de ath. Best Imaginable Health/Welfare State Worst Imaginable Health/Welfare State 100% 0% Tuberculosis 2000 Tuberculosis 1900 Best EuroQol situation (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) Worst EuroQol situation (6, 6, 6, 6, 6) Methodology - 101 - 3.5.3 Periodisation The period that the QALE methodology will be applie d to is the twentieth century, because during this era there were unprecedented increases in life expectancy and also when the epidemiological transition occurred in England. Alt hough this era could be extended back in time, e.g. to the late nineteenth century, this would not change the overall findings or add any detail that is not captured in the early tw entieth century. In order to estimate how the health and welfare rel ated quality of life evolved over the twentieth century it is necessary to analyse the ke y variables during different periods between 1900 and 2000. Because of the pace of healt h and welfare improvements, charting the changes for consecutive years would provide an excessive level of detail. The ideal approach is to consider health and welfare related quality of life at reference points throughout the twentieth century. To this end the t wentieth century has been divided into quartiles: 1900, 1925, 1950, 1975 and 2000. The qua litative analysis will chart the improvements and breakthroughs that were necessary to change the quality of life at these points in time. The actual process of this appraisal is much more d ynamic, as the thesis analysis and results will consider the evaluation of health and welfare related quality of life between these reference points that contain the eras that a re listed below. 1. 1900 to 1925 2. 1925 to 1950 3. 1950 to 1975 4. 1975 to 2000 5. 1900 to 2000 3.6 QALY Value Accreditation The thesis utilises an unorthodox method for elicit ing quality of life values for illnesses and it is therefore necessary to identify the conve ntional methods for deriving QALYs in conjunction with the reasons and appeal for the div ergence between this and the thesis' approach. It is also desirable to highlight that th e thesis QALY results do not bias the overall thesis findings, and show that in most inst ances the thesis QALYs are more conservatively estimated than those in mainstream m easures. Methodology - 102 - There is no uniformity in how a QALY should be meas ured and the most common methods for evaluating health are: expert ranking a nd individual self-rating of perceived health status, both of which can be aided by the us e of tools such as a visual analogue scale (VAS), standard gamble (SG) and time trade off (TTO ) 252 . The most established studies are Cutler and Richard son (1997, 1998, 1999)253 , who use a combination of expert judgement and individual self -rating to evaluate \"health capital\" and Murray's (1996) 254 global burden of disease study, which derives DALY (disability adjusted life years, which are essentially an inver se QALY) through an expert study that utilises VAS and TTO. The majority of credible stud ies which include the value of a QALY are based upon these methods and often provide refinements, e.g. age influence. The most obvious incompatibility with these studies and the thesis is that they all tend to be based on modern national health questionnaires, e.g. the National Heath Interview Survey (NHIS) in America from 1969 onwards and the British Household Panel Survey in Britain from 1996. The QALYs generated through such methods are recent and therefore inadequate for considering the changing QALY betwee n 1900 and 2000. This issue eliminates all types of QALY measures that rely on any form of self-reporting. The next obvious alternative is the Murray type app roach, of conducting an expert study to determine (through a series of revealed preference exercises) the likely QALY burden of different illnesses in different eras of the twenti eth century. Although this approach has numerous attributes, it was felt that for the time and effort required to conduct an unbiased expert study was not productive, especially given t he unavoidable drawbacks of such an approach, e.g. relativity among experts, participan t biases which detract from subjectivity, and avoidance of issues about adaptation and fist h and understanding of the quality of life burden of illnesses. Moreover, although the expert study has 'consensus' as the compensating feature, it was felt that this did not add enough value for the thesis to conduct major research along the lines of an expert study to yield historical QALY values. Therefore, as a first approximation, the QALY for t he thesis illnesses and eras will be as well established by the author summarising the cons ensus of a detailed literature review, 252 Praag & Ferrer-i-Carbonell, \"Age Differentiated QA LY Losses\", p. 3 253 Cutler & Richardson, \"The Value of Health 1970-199 0\" and \"Measuring the Health of the US Population\" and \"Your Money and Your Life: The Value of Health and What Affects It\" 254 Murray, \"Rethinking DALYs\", in Murray & Lopez, \"Th e Global Burden of Disease\", pp. 1-98 Methodology - 103 - while appreciating all the potential factors of bia s. The major sources of contention of this method are: author biases which detract from subjec tivity and avoidance of issues such as adaptation and first hand understanding of quality of life burden of illnesses. Hence, these issues are very similar to those which arise from a n expert study. Because the thesis QALY is derived by the author's consistent review of all relevant sources these estimates escape other problems assoc iated with numerous quality of life studies that are based on Cutler and Richardson met hods, namely adaptation and relativity. Adaptation is defined by Heyink (1993) as \"an intra-psychic process in which past, present, and future situation and circumstances are given such cognitive and emotional meaning that an acceptable level of wellbeing is ac hieved\" 255 . As the prevalence of disease increased during the twentieth century, so did the biasing from 'adaptation' 256 . I.e. distortions arise because people's perception is st andardised by their surroundings and experiences of themselves and those they know 257 . This is avoided by the thesis because the author is eliciting QALYs from unemotional, unp hysical and unconnected experience, which eliminates the scope for adaptation and enhan ces the consistency (and subsequent reliability) of the thesis' QALY estimates. In an additional effort to consider the validity of the thesis' unorthodox QALY generating process (which can be considered as a definitive su rvey of all existing relevant sources) it is desirable to consider the results that the Cutle r and Richardson and Murray studies have derived for comparable periods as this will help to indicate the acceptability of the thesis results. 255 Heyink, \"Adaptation and Wellbeing\", p. 1332 256 Groot, \"Adaptation and Scale of Reference Bias in Self-Assessments of Quality of Life\", p. 406 257 Ibid Methodology - 104 - Table 3.9: Comparison of QALY results from leading studies versus thesis (Hickson) estimates, for all available periods; 1970-2000 Illness Study Range 258 Year 1970 1975 1980 1990 1996 2000 Blindness Cutler & Richardson 259 0.73 0.80 0.87 Murray 260 0.60 Mid 0.67 0.67 Hickson Low 0.50 Cancer 261 Cutler & Richardson 0.70 0.70 0.70 Breast Cancer Mid 0.67 0.83 Hickson Low 0.67 Stomach Cancer Mid 0.67 0.67 Hickson Low 0.50 Heart Disease Cutler & Richardson 0.64 0.70 'Heart Disease' 262 Hickson Low 0.50 258 For the purposes of the thesis; Mid represents wha t Hickson deems to be the most likely QALY value an d Low represents the most conservative estimate tha t will be utilised for the extended results lower b ound estimate 259 Cutler, D. & Richardson, E. (1998) \"The Value of H ealth: 1970-1990\" 260 Murray, \"Rethinking DALYs\", in Murray & Lopez, \"Th e Global Burden of Disease\" 261 Cutler and Richardson's cancer estimate is obtaine d from the 'National Cancer Institute's Surveillanc e, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database'. 262 In the Extended Results of the thesis, all non-inf ectious and classifiable diseases are given the low profile of stomach cancer, and therefore this can be applied to heart disease for exemplary purposes. The rationale of this will be elaborated in Chapter 9: Extended Results. Methodology - 105 - The above table highlights the validity of the QALY weights yielded in the thesis, for the comparable periods of the twentieth century. The ke y evidence for this claim is two-fold. Fist, the similarity in estimates between the thesis and Murray and Cutler and Richardson, which indicates that the thesis QALY is making similar qu ality of life considerations and measurements. Second, the lowest bound QALY estimat es yielded by the thesis add weight to the eventual conservative estimates of the thesis. However, it should be noted that this comparative substantiation is not available for the years prior to 1970, as these types of consideration had not been made. In an attempt to e liminate the challenges caused by this void in the literature, the thesis QALY has been develop ed from a detailed and consistent review of the literature in order to derive the most universa lly accurate QALY estimates. Moreover, this estimation process was consistent across all illnes ses and eras considered in the thesis in order to yield the most robust summary of the QALY from a ll relevant historical sources. Hence, in every comparable instance the thesis QALY weights are less favourable than Murray's and particularly Cutler and Richardson's. This is evident for the 'Mid' thesis estimates, which will be used in the Quantitative R esults to provide a range and is deemed to be the most likely value by the author. The only ex ceptions to this are Hickson: breast cancer: 2000 versus Cutler and Richardson: cancer: 1990 and Hickson: blind: 2000 versus Murray: blind 1996. However, these are marginal and also th ere is the potential for the Cutler and Richardson and Murray estimates to have closed this QALY gap by the year 2000. A final issue which adds extra validity to the thes is QALY estimates is the additional research related to QALY measurement a la Cutler and Richard son. These studies have attempted to add more precision to existing methods, for example , Praag and Ferrer-i-Carbonell (2001) 263 consider the effects of age upon QALY and Honda and Ohkusa (2001)264 have developed a more rigorous model for defining quality of life, w hich includes economic consideration variables. All such studies have found a more optim istic value for the QALY than Cutler and Richardson, which implies that when more accuracy i s attained the QALY burden declines, although estimates of magnitude are still lacking i n the literature. 263 Praag & Ferrer-i-Carbonell, \"Age Differentiated QA LY Ohkusa, \"International Comparison of Subj ective Health Evaluation - USA, UK and Japan\" Methodology - 106 - Hence, the above analysis highlights that there is no mainstream literature that generates results and conclusions that are inconsistent with the thesis. Although the methodology used in these studies differs from that in the thesis, this is a result of the unique objectives of the thesis and the final QALY results of the thesis are in con sensus with those yielded in established studies. Although it is not possible to justify in the pre 1970 era, every reasonable process has been employed to estimate the most accurate QALY va lues. Furthermore, compared to the estimates yielded by Cutler and Richardson and Murr ay between 1970 and 2000 the thesis results are conservative. 3.7 QALE Methodology The measurement of mortality and morbidity will be combined in the quantitative methodology in order to provide an aggregate measur ement for the value of improved health in twentieth century England. This overall (QALE) m easure will provide an indication of the value of the decline in mortality in conjunction wi th the improvements in quality of life when ill. Once this has been achieved for the thesis sample o f illnesses the findings will be developed in order to provide a lower bound estimate about the v alue of improved morbidity in its entirety, which will be combined with all twentieth century m ortality improvements to provide an aggregate estimate for the value of improved health or QALE for the entire twentieth century in England. This is facilitated by the creation of the thesis methodology, which provides the thesis' most significant contribution to knowledge, through facilitating estimates about the value and contribution (to a more rounded notion of economic welfare development) of improved QALE. This methodology is summarised below . Methodology - 107 - Equation 3.2: Summary of the thesis methodology: qu ality adjusted life expectancy (QALE) 265 . Willingness to Pay Morbidity (MB): MB WTP Considers increased quality of life with an illnes s or disability /barb2right MB WTP = VSHLY * population weighted fall in the burden of disease / disability For MB WTP this would have to be calculated for each type of i llness and disability and their associated QALY ( ) This will then be combined with the equivalent info rmation for mortality improvements Willingness to Pay Mortality (MT): MT WTP Considers increased life expectancy /barb2right MT WTP = VSL * population weighted fall in the death rate Quality Adjusted Life Expectancy (QALE): Such that MB WTP + MT WTP = QALE improvement: * ( *) [ ] ( [ ]) dc u c d\u00b5 \u00b5 =+ + + ( *) u c = the goods value of life, *c= consumption or income, = the pure rate of individual time preference, \u00b5= set of mortality rates, ( Pr[ =Condition D at t + k] * [QALY for D at t + k]) Hence, the willingness to pay mortality represents the monetary value estimate for improvements in mortality and will be estimated thr ough combining the decline in the death 265 For detailed methodological algebra see Appendix 1 2.16. Methodology - 108 - rate with a value of this decline, which is represe nted here as the value of a statistical life (VSL). The willingness to pay morbidity represents the monetary value estimate for improvements in morbidity (through an improvement i n quality of life associated with illness) and will be estimated through combining the decline in the burden of illness with a value of this decline, which is represented here as the valu e of a statistical healthy life year (VSHLY). These two measures will be combined to provide an o verall indication about the (extended) willingness to pay for improved health which is dep icted here as the quality adjusted life expectancy (QALE). 3.8 Methodology Sensitivity Analyses Because of the numerous assumptions and estimates t hat were necessary to produce the overall results of the thesis it is desirable to tr y and accommodate for this through providing a range of possible results. The thesis will apply tw o broad categories of sensitivity analysis: the provision of a range of estimates, which will then be applied to an age-weighting function. These processes will provide an additional, more so phisticated set of QALE estimates. 3.8.1 Sensitivity Analysis: Range of QALE Gain Resu lts This sensitivity analysis will provide a range of a ggregate estimates in order to overcome some of the uncertainty associated with estimating the QALY, VSL and VSHLY (which is a function of the VSL and QALY values) and subsequent ly add authenticity to the results. The QALY will be considered with a degree of error of one EuroQol category in either direction. This will help to highlight the robustne ss of the overall conclusions. For example, the overall rank for tuberculosis in 2000 was 2 ('g ood' quality of life) on the scale of 1 to 6 266 . In the final results, the values 1 and 3 will also be considered. This range of (low [3], mid [2] and high [1]) QALY estimates will highlight that ev en if the QALY is not precisely 2, the results and overall implications of the results sti ll hold weight. The VSL and VSHLY will also be subject to a similar range of estimates. Because the VSHLY is a combination of the QALY and VSL this will be subject to both of the aforeme ntioned sensitivity analyses. Hence, the thesis will provide a range of VSHLY estimates whic h reflect low, mid, high VSL and QALY estimates. 266 For the possible EuroQol ranks, see Chapter 3: Sec tion: 3.5.2 'EuroQol Grid' Methodology - 109 - The above analysis has provided a detailed explanat ion about why there is such wide variance between VSL estimates and has identified a subseque nt best estimate for the VSL. Although the value that has been selected avoids many of the associated problems, additional sensitivity analysis (the provision of a low and high as well a s a mid VSL value) will be applied in an effort to further overcome inaccuracies. As well as providing a range of results, this analysis also recognises the likelihood that there is no def initively correct VSL estimate, and highlights that, regardless of the value utilised, the finding s remain the generally unchanged. The results of this sensitivity analyses process wi ll be an extremely broad range of estimates, for example, instead of providing twenty QALE resul ts (one QALE gain estimate for five eras and four illnesses) the thesis' sensitivity analyse s will extend this series of QALE results to more than one thousand. The QALY, VSL and VSHLY sen sitivity analysis will yield 27 estimates for each of the 4 illnesses and 5 eras (= [27*4]*5 = 540) the age-weighting will double the number of estimates for the three illnes ses (= {[27*4]*5}*2 = 1080) and therefore there will be an aggregate number of 1080 estimates about the aggregate QALE gain in twentieth century England, all of which contribute to the same conclusion. 3.8.2 Sensitivity Analysis: Results Application: Ag e-Weighting There is evidence that the VSL is not constant acro ss all age groups and therefore a more valuable approach for estimating society's willingn ess to pay would be a methodology that considers the potential for different ages to have varying values. Barnum (1987) has indicated that relying on calculations of health effects that are un-weighted for different ages is not wholly satisfactory 267 . There are numerous perspectives associated with the se calls for age-weighting. Some have highlighted that age-weighting can be conducted fro m an equity standpoint, where age- weights reflect the feeling that everyone is entitl ed to some normal span of life 268 . Anyone failing to achieve this has been cheated, while any one getting more than this is 'living on 267 Barnum, \"Evaluating Healthy Days of Life Gained fr om Health Projects\", p. 837 268 Williams, \"Intergenerational Equity: An Exploratio n of the 'Fair Innings' Argument\", 119 Methodology - 110 - borrowed time' 269 . In this type of 'fair innings' argument, the youn ger population receive a higher age weight as they have completed a smaller portion of their normal life span 270 . At the opposite end of the spectrum, certain author s have identified the need to consider more indicators of economic contribution than just age. Cooper and Rice (1976) adopt a human capital approach to include income differentials of workers, where higher income groups who contribute more to total economic product are given a greater weighting, i.e. income weighted years of life 271 . Others have studied the extra contribution of mor e educated workers, and emphasised the importance of including differentiat ions between high school and college graduates 272 . The preferable - and more commonly utilised - metho d of age-weighting considers the relationship between age and efficiency, by reflect ing an individual's social role, where people in general are supported by others during infancy a nd old age but support others during adulthood 273 . This form of age-weighting is provided by Murray (1996) in his Global Burden of Disease Study for the World Health Organisation (WHO) where he considers the age weight function of Disability Adjusted Life Years ( DALYs). Murray provides values with which to calculate an age weighted value of death a verted, supported by the notion that greater importance needs to be attached to years of product ive adult life 274 . The continuous age weight function outlined by Murray is presented in the gra ph below. 269 Ibid 270 Ibid 271 Cooper & Rice, \"The Economic Cost of Illness Revis ited\" and Rice, \"Estimating the Cost of Illness\" 272 Rosen, \"A Theory of Life Earnings\", p.

Furthermore, Murray's model is detailed and accurate enough to p rovide the necessary indication for the purposes of the thesis. Despite the appeal of Murray's methodology there ar e some areas of unavoidable conflict which need to be recognised. In the context of the thesis there are evident problems with the static nature of Murray's age-weighting model. The economic contribution from different ages and genders is likely to have altered considerably over the twentieth century. Therefore, it would be ideal to have a different set of age weigh ts for different eras of the twentieth century. As this option is not feasible, the Murray age-weig hting will be utilised in order to provide a more accurate indication, rather than a definitive estimate, about the value of improved health, particularly compared to not making any age-weighti ng considerations. 275 Murray, \"Rethinking DALYs\", in Murray & Lopez, \"Th e Global Burden of Disease\", p. 60 Methodology - 112 - The age-weighting represents the final aspect of th e thesis' QALE methodology. This process is summarised in the flow chart overleaf. The comme ntary below also provides a summary to the QALE methodology, outlined in detail above. In the context of the methodological series in the flow chart below: defining a measurement scale was achieved through constructing the QALE an d (its measuring tool) the two dimensional ranking scale, EuroQol. The illnesses t hat were applied to this measure were chosen within the rational framework of the epidemi ological transition (the appeal of which has been outlined in Part I of the thesis). The det ailed qualitative review will be conducted in Part II of the thesis in order to provide a transpa rent analysis (about the key EuroQol variables) for the reader. This analysis will also provide the justification for the EuroQol rank which will subsequently be transformed into an aggr egate QALY for each illness and corresponding era (in Chapter 7). Concurrently, the thesis has also identified the mo st credible VSL estimate. This process has been outlined previously in this chapter. This VSL can be combined with the change in the death rate in order to establish the WTP or value o f improved mortality. Along a similar vein, the VSL can be combined with the previously identif ied QALY in order to provide the VSHLY. This can then be combined with data about th e burden of illness (which is established through considering the prevalence of a n illness in conjunction with the QALY for the corresponding illness and era) in order to iden tify the WTP morbidity, or value of improved health. The WTP mortality can then be summ ed with the WTP morbidity in order to identify the QALE gain. For completeness and in an effort to provide the mo st robust results, this QALE gain will then be subject to a series of sensitivity analyses. The first will recalculate the QALE gain for lower ('low') and higher ('high') QALY, VSL and VSHLY val ues. This will provide a wide range of results which will then be applied to Murray's a ge-weighting function (see Figure 3.3).

These considerations will be made for different points of the twentieth century in order to identify the extent and value of improvements in health and welfare related quality of life. 3.9 Extended Results Once the methodology has been applied to the thesis illnesses (Chapter 8) the analysis will be extended in order to optimise the results of the th esis. The findings for individual (proxy) illnesses will be developed to provide an aggregate lower bound estimate about the value of improvements for the entire twentieth century morbi dity (and mortality) burden (Chapter 9). This will provide the fullest evidence for the impo rtance and meaningfulness of the claims of the thesis. 3.10 Methodology Location A fundamental component of the quantitative thesis results is the qualitative evaluation of different illness states and the subsequent estimat ion of the quality of life burden (QALY) of the illness for different eras of the twentieth century . This will be achieved in detail in Part II of the thesis, after which it will be possible to summaris e the key qualitative results and subsequently utilise this in the quantitative chapters, which fo rm the results of the thesis. Illnesses: Blindness - 115 - PART II 4. Blindness 4.1 Government Initiatives towards Blindness 117 4.2 Socio-Economic Initiatives towards Blindness 126 4.2.1 Employment 126 4.2.2 Education 131 4.2.3 Status 133 4.3 Blind Discontent 134 4.4 Medical Developments 136 4.5 Summary 146 \"Blindness is a disability that has far-reaching so cial, economic and developmental implications. When visual disability occurs at birt h or in childhood it provides a challenge to development and learning. When it is apparent in wo rking age individuals it lowers productivity and capability. Across the lifespan it increases the scope for inequality, poverty, discrimination, poor status and ultimately devaluat ion in the quality of life\"276 . Consequently the recognition and help provided by the government and society have very important implications for the overall quality of life of the blind, as do improvements in medical technology. The number of blind people has been counted in Brit ain since 1851, starting with a simple declaration of blindness on census returns. This wa s discontinued after 1911, but after the 1920 Blind Persons Act, with its statutory benefits to the blind, a register of blind persons was established. This was refined during the 1930s with the introduction of the BD8 forms, which were accepted only if they had been signed by a rec ognised ophthalmologist. The legal definition of blindness, which has been used throug hout the twentieth century, was \"so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eye s ight is essential\" 277 . This is usually considered as 3/60 vision or worse in better eye or 6/60 or worse in better eye with markedly restricted fields 278 . 276 WHO (2002) Article for world blindness day: World Health Organisation (2002), \"Article for World Blin dness Day\". Retrieved 2 March 2003, from : The National Archives: MH 55(74): 1933-1935 De-Cer tification of Alleged Blind Persons; this interpret ation is based on the advice of the Ophthalmologic Section of the Royal Society of Medicine and from t he Prevention of Blindness Committee 278 Evans, J. (1995) \"Causes of Blindness and Partial Sight in England and Wales 1990-1991\", p. 57 Illnesses: Blindness - 116 - The number of registered blind people in England co ntinually increased during the twentieth century, from approximately 23,907 in 1901 279 * to 75,420 in 1950 280 and peaking at 157,820 by 2000 281 . For the first half of the twentieth century this increase was a likely result of improved registration and not a genuine increase (a t least not entirely). For the second half of the century the increase in the number was strongly affected by the growth of the elderly population (70 years and over). Figure 4.1: Prevalence of blindness in twentieth ce ntury England, 1901-2000 282 Prevalence of Blindness 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1968 1969 1970 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1982 1986 1988 1991 1994 1997 2000 Year Number of blind people in England There was also a change in the age distribution of the blind population. The most common age of blindness increased so that by 1975 and especial ly 2000 this disability was mainly prevalent in old ages. This is an improvement over the first 50 years of the twentieth century when blindness was most common in working aged individua ls and therefore hindered quality of life for a greater number of years. These types of consi deration will be made at the end of this chapter (Table 4.9) and in the blind results chapte r (Chapter 8.2). Before this is achieved, this chapter of the thesis will consider the key quality of life variables for blindness (see Tables 3.5 and 3.7) throughout the twentieth century. 279 Census of England and Wales 1901 * NB: It has been highlighted (by the Parliamentary report of the departmental committee on the welfar e of the blind 1917) that census returns do not pro vide a reliable indication of the total number of persons who are blind for practical and economic purposes. 280 Government Papers: Local Authority Blind Returns 281 Department of Health and National Statistics, Regi stered Blind Year Ending 31 March 2000 282 Census of England and Wales and RNIB \"Local Author ity Blind Returns\" Prevalence of Blindness in Twentieth Century Englan d, 1901-2000 Illnesses: Blindness - 117 - Hence, this chapter will highlight the welfare cond itions faced by the blind during the twentieth century and identify the improvements in blind quality of life by examining three fundamental areas: legal, socio-economic and health . The legal history encompasses government acts and m onetary aid to assist the blind and also various other state initiatives to help compensate the blind for their handicap. These questions are important because legislation had the potential to help the blind obtain equal quality of life in most socio-economic domains of life and facilita te an improvement in their quality of life, despite their disability. The socio-economic history will be evaluated in ord er to highlight the actual conditions faced by the blind in the major domains of their lives. T his will include the following: employment and wages, education, and the status of the blind a nd the major issues of blind discontent during the twentieth century. Medical developments will be considered in order to determine how effective and valuable preventative and curative technological breakthroug hs have been for blind quality of life. 4.1 Government Initiatives towards Blindness Table 4.1 provides a summary of the legal legislati on that was provided to help the blind during the twentieth century. Table 4.2 provides a summary of the average income received by the blind (independently and due to government welf are). Many of these policies were insufficient for improving the blind quality of lif e. However, others were more far reaching and these will be discussed in more detail after th e tables. Illnesses: Blindness - 118 - Table 4.1: Government legislation for the blind 190 6-1999 283 Year Title of government legislation Provisions of government legislation 1906 Blind Aid Act Established technical schools, workshops and home-w orkers schemes. Also provided limited financial maintenance for the unemployable blind. 1920 Blind Persons Act The blind were recognised and helped more explicitl y, welfare payments increased, pensions were introduced and nu merous charities established. 1929 Local Government Act Forced Local Authorities to donate funds to volunta ry associations providing services for the welfare of the blind and to provide funds for other blind services - workshops, home teachers, ho stels, libraries, etc. Local Authorities were also expected to augment cen tral spending on the blind. 1934 Old Age Pensions A reinforcement of pension policies under the 1920 BPA. 1938 Blind Persons Act Forced Local Authorities to promote blind welfare. Improvements in aid for the blind. Pension age for the blind was lo wered: from 50 to 40 years of age. The pension levels were the same as u nder the 1920 BPA. 1942 Scheme to employ suitable blind persons Forced Local Authorities to encourage and facilitat e the employment of blind persons in normal industry. 1948 National Assistance Act Removed the blind from the Poor Law. Further provis ion for the disabled, in the form of increased welfare payments . 1966 Travel Concessions Act Provided monetary concessions for the blind when us ing public transport. 1970 Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act Extended the powers of Local Authorities to help di sabled people and forced Local Authorities to publicise services to h elp the disabled. 1981 Education Act Required the provision of special education for bli nd children to be conducted in normal schools (as far as possible). 1986 Disabled Persons Act Promoted the inclusion of disabled people on commit tees and bodies, especially for issues concerning the interests of d isabled people. 1992 Disability Living Allowance Provided financial payments to the blind (\u00a315 to \u00a33 0 per week in 1992 and this increased since its introduction). 1992 Disability Working Allowance Provided a 'top-up' for low earning disabled people who worked 16+ hours per week. 1995 Disability Discrimination Act Made it illegal to discriminate against disabled pe ople and introduced a quota system which forced large companies to employ a certain number of disabled workers. 1999 Disability Rights Commission Act Established the disability rights commission, which helped to promote equal opportunities for the disabled. 283 Information on the government legislation in Table 4.1 can be found in the corresponding Parliamentar y Papers, The National Archives, and Beacon references in the bibliography.

Retrieved 7 from: http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~alan/fami Ibid Illnesses: Blindness - 121 - 1920 Blind Persons Act With the introduction of the 1920 Blind Persons Act , aid for the blind became, for the first time, widespread and specific. The provision of ass istance under this Act was designed to ensure that no blind person was deprived as a resul t of their disability. The conditions of this groundbreaking Act were generally regarded - among the blind population - to be \"exceedingly wide and comprehensive\" 307 . Under Section 1 of this Act pensions were provided for blind men and women aged between 50 and 70 years of age. The rate of the pension ran ged from 5 to 50 pence per week, dependent upon existing income. Additionally, the v ast majority of Local Authorities provided another 50 pence, which provided an extra boost for blind pensioners' quality of life 308 . Although the National Institute of the Blind (NIB) did not regard the maximum under the Act as \"nearly adequate for the proper maintenance of thos e who were completely dependent upon the pension\" , they still recognised that it was a useful beginn ing 309 . The Advisory Committee on the Welfare of the Blind (hereafter th e advisory committee) adopted a more positive view with their claims that the provision of pensions \"has provided a great boon to the unemployable blind, and has secured for them a greater degree of comfort than previously...and has done much to alleviate stress am ong unemployed blind people\" 310 . A further credit for Section 1 of the Act was the w ide coverage from the onset of this legislation. In 1922 it is estimated that 93 percen t of the blind aged between 50 and 70 were receiving the full pension 311 . Furthermore, for the first four years of the 1920 Blind Act pension, the blind were especially privileged compa red to the rest of the population as there was no state pension before the Royal Assent in 192 4. Under Section 2 of the 1920 Blind Persons Act the s cale of blind assistance \"was to be provided by Local Authorities; as it was thought to be a matter which should be determined by the local councils as representatives of the ratepa yer who will meet the costs, and the Minister 307 Beacon 1920: The Editor 308 Ibid 309 Beacon 1920: The Editor 310 RNIB, \"Fourth Report of the Advisory Committee on the Welfare of the Blind 1923\" 311 Beacon 1922: Report of the Advisory Committee on t he Welfare of the Blind Illnesses: Blindness - 122 - of Health would probably only criticise the scale i f it was excessively low or high\" 312 . The 1920 level of weekly income that the low amount had to exceed was \u00a31.38 313 . The actual level of weekly payouts for the blind, around the midpoin t of the twentieth century (1944), was between \u00a31.05 and \u00a31.75, with a median of roughly \u00a3 1.35 314 . These payments also took into account the existing means (wages, pensions, charit able grants, investments, etc) of blind individuals who were applying for benefits. This re presents an average blind welfare payout which was about 26 percent 315 to 40 percent 316 of semiskilled and unskilled wages, respectively, in 1944. In addition to these blind w elfare payments, some Local Authorities also provided allowances for winter, rents, fuel, and ot her paraphernalia 317 . The government also provided a grant for the maintenance of blind servi ces. 312 The National Archives: MH 55(76): 1930-1934 Declar ation of Schemes by Local Authorities: Blind Person s Act 1920 313 Parliamentary Bills, \"Allowances under the 1920 B lind Persons Act\": the minimum amount stated is one pound, seven shillings and sixpence (this has been converted into new money) 314 The National Archives: MH 55(1098): 1943-1944 Blin d Persons Treatment under Beveridge: provides detai led lists of the amounts each Local Authority paid in blind relief.

Table 4.3 highlights that nearly all the services show progressive increase during t he twentieth century and the value of grants had nearly doubled between 1921 and 1930 320 . Another achievement of this Act was \"the efforts made by the workshops to keep blind workers fully employed during the times of economic depression\" 321 . 318 Beacon 1930: \"Report of the Advisory Committee on the Welfare of the Blind 1923 - 1928\" 319 Ibid 320 Calculation: 100-([69886/1313680]*100) = 47 321 Ibid Illnesses: Blindness - 124 - This Act also catalysed the formation of numerous r egional and national blind charities. Although the National Institute of the Blind (known as the Royal National Institute for the Blind since 1953) was established in 1899 (and sinc e has represented the main vehicle for blind promotion and help) many more specialist and regional charities evolved out of the 1920 Act. These charities and voluntary agencies were ge nerous with the support they donated to the blind population, and consequently they played a key role in enhancing the quality of life of the blind population during the twentieth centur y. 1942 Scheme to Employ Suitable Blind Persons In 1942 the government introduced a scheme to emplo y suitable blind persons This government initiative forced Local Authorities to f acilitate the blind joining normal employment. Within four years (by January 1946) \"this policy had been so well received by blind persons that there was a need to employ addit ional staff for the placement of blind workers in normal industry\" 322 . This enabled blind employment in normal industry, w hich represents one of the most important contributions towards blind equality with the able bodied population. \"There can be no doubt about the benefit to the individual blind person who has been found a place in industry. Many were now able to work for the first time since being diagnosed as blind, while others were being given the opportunity of doing wo rk previously regarded as beyond their capacity\" 323 . 1948 National Assistance Act The blind population was not removed from the Poor Law until 1948 when the National Assistance Act was introduced. This Act made furthe r provisions for the disabled, sick and aged. The scales of assistance of this Act ranged f rom \u00a31.25 to \u00a32.75 per blind person, dependent upon age. In addition to these basic rate s, blind individuals also received financial help for their rents and mortgages. 322 The National Archives: MH 55 (1089): 1943-1946 Emp loyment of the Blind, Placement in Industry 323 Ibid Illnesses: Blindness - 125 - 1981 Education Act The 1981 Education Act required that \"the provision of special education of the blind be conducted in mainstream schools as far as possible\" , but did not abolish schools for the blind 324 . This indicates a step towards equality and integr ation of the blind. Although the effectiveness of normal schools compared to special schools for the education of the blind is contentious, the blind were still provided with the opportunity for equality, which facilitated an improvement in their quality of life. 1992 Disability Living and Working Allowances The introduction of the Disability Living Allowance was an important development in welfare payments for the unemployable blind and in legal re cognition and help for the blind in general. The Disability Living Allowance replaced the Attend ance Allowance and Mobility Allowance, which were introduced in the 1970s but d id not cater for the blind. This allowance paid blind individuals a weekly sum of between \u00a315 and \u00a330 (which increased later in the 1990s), regardless of any other income. This highli ghts increased recognition of the blind and improved financial aid for the needs of their disab ility, which would have enhanced their quality of life 325 . Also in 1992 the government introduced the Disabili ty Working Allowance (DWA), which was designed to 'top-up' low earnings of disabled p eople who worked at least 16 hours per week. This indicates a further effort to recognise and cater for the needs of the blind in the labour market. Unfortunately \"when this policy was first introduced, the number of disabled people who received DWA was far lower than the offi cial projections\" 326 . 1995 Disability Discrimination Act & 1999 Disabilit y Rights Commission Act \"The blind community experienced another milestone on the path to full equality and civil rights with the introduction of the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act\" 327 . This legislation made it illegal to discriminate against blind peopl e. It also forced companies who employed more than 20 workers to hire a certain number of di sabled (including blind) individuals. Although this Act provided important rights for the blind, some areas were not covered and 324 Government Papers, \"1981 Education Act\" 325 The New Beacon 1995: Insight; Disability Working A llowance 326 Ibid 327 The New Beacon 1995: Statement from the RNIB Illnesses: Blindness - 126 - other aspects of the Act were poorly designed, whic h often left the blind without comprehensive and enforceable rights. For example, the Act did not apply to manufacturers or cover transport vehicles. The provisions of this Ac t were formalised through the creation of the Disability Rights Commission Act in 1999. Both forms of legislation provided an improvement in quality of life. 4.2 Socio-Economic Initiatives towards Blindness The analysis below draws heavily on the reporting i n the Beacon magazine, as a source of evidence about the standards of living experienced by the (overall) blind population. The Beacon was published monthly by the RNIB and was ai med at people with sight problems and also those who were involved with the blind. The ty pical content of a Beacon magazine would be a collection of topics that were relevant to con temporary blind issues. The tone of the beacon was upbeat, which is a likely result of the underlying objective of the Beacon, which was to empower, inspire and inform the blind. The B eacon should be considered as a reliable source, although some of the claims need to be inte rpreted with cautions of journalism and bias. Journalism in the language and possible over enthusiasm and bias concerning features related to the contribution of the RNIB and convers ely, the government. 4.2.1 Employment 1900 /barb2right 1925 Blind employment initiatives were developed many ce nturies before the twentieth, however during this century the blind experienced the most significant developments towards equality with their able bodied counterparts. Home working b egan in the 1850s, as welfare schemes with aid from charitable funds. \"In the industrial circumstances of the time, very few blind people were ever able to become self supporting and so the pattern of supported employment was established. This pattern was redrawn on employ ment lines in the early twentieth century as a result of war time needs, which saw the develo pment of workshops and the government established its factories for disabled ex-serviceme n. Such arrangements continued to be envisaged as welfare or therapy rather than commerc ial employment and genuine rehabilitation\" 328 . 328 Royal London Society for the Blind & RNIB (1998) S upported Employment: Towards a National View Illnesses: Blindness - 127 - This attitude changed in around 1920 when: \"the great aim of those who had the welfare of the blind as their objective campaigned to get them into normal life, so that they could work shoulder to shoulder with their sighted colleagues\"329 . The leader of the NIB had pointed out in 1918 that \"workshops throughout England and Wales employed le ss than 3,000 blind out of a possible 34,000\" 330 . Furthermore, the wages that blind individuals were earning at this time were insufficient. For example, there were 700 blind workers existing in L ondon on less than 50 pence per week 331 . This is compared to the recommendation of the advis ory committee that blind workers should be earning about one pound per week 332 . During the 1920s conditions improved somewhat for t he blind who were seeking employment. There was an increase in the number of blind employ ed, for example by 1923 there were 8,246 blind people in employment (compared to 6,391 in 19 18) 333 . Blind employment opportunities were further helped by the 1922 Ministry of Health grant of \u00a320 per head for each home worker, to assist with: provision of material, sale of produce, and also to enhance the scheme so that home working could become a good career opt ion for the blind. Although the average wages for home workers did not reach the recommende d level they still provided the blind with employment and some form of economic compensat ion 334 . The extent to which this applies varied widely between occupations: in 1924 the highest weekly earning were \u00a31.20 (piano tuners) versus the lowest weekly earnings, 1 3p (boot repairers). This gap was evident, although reduced, in 1933 when the highest weekly e arnings were \u00a31.37 (piano tuners) versus 31p (hand knitters). Full details of the range of w eekly wages are shown in Appendix 12.13.3. 1925 /barb2right 1950 There was a slight increase in the wages of home wo rkers during this time, however relative to the wages of comparable mainstream industries the b lind were still not close to equality. This is highlighted by comparing the average wage of bli nd workers in home industries with the average wage for semi-skilled and unskilled mainstr eam industry, shown in Table 4.2, which 329 Beacon 1920: Scope for the Blind in General Occupa tions 330 Beacon 1919: State Aid for the Blind 331 Beacon 1919: State Aid for the Blind 332 Ibid 333 Beacon 1924: Welfare of the Blind 334 Beacon 1921: A Minimum Income for all Blind Worker s Illnesses: Blindness - 128 - highlights that the blind only earned as much as 34 percent of their sighted counterparties between 1924 and 1935. This unequal situation motiv ated criticism from blind supporters, e.g. \"I have examined in the closest detail most of the systems of remuneration obtaining in the institutions for the blind in Great Britain, and, i n my judgement, none of them can be regarded as entirely satisfactory\" 335 . However the home worker scheme is still thought t o have been a success in other ways. \"Because of the increase in the number it employed and the extension of this service, many blind were capable of working and obtained training\"336 . The advisory committee had stated that by the 1930s many blind people had been employed in ordinary factories and workshops. Furthermore, \"between 1910 and 1935 nearly every workshop for the blind had been enlarged or rebuilt and many more have been introduced\" 337 . As well as developing existing blind industries thi s helped foster new blind industries. For example, in 1900 flat machine knitting was a practi cally unknown industry for the blind and by 1932 it was one of the main industries for the e mployment of blind females. These developments contributed to the valuable 49 percent increase in the number of blind in employment between 1919 and 1930 338 . Wages also improved during this period where the average weekly wage paid to blind men in workshops increased from 60p in 1910 to \u00a31.24 by 1935 339 . However, even though many blind persons had been em ployed in workshops, there were evident problems in finding employment for the youn ger working age blind. Furthermore, \"many of these workshops were too small to be effic ient and about 60 percent of the blind workers would not have been employed if strict stan dards of productivity were enforced\" 340 . Furthermore, blind employment levels were geographi cally very uneven, for example the proportion of employed blind persons in 1931 varied from about 14 to 21 percent between different regions 341 . Also, out of the blind who were employed during t he 1930s (and this is generally true for all times during the twentieth c entury), less than half were in workshops or under home workers schemes, which suggests that man y of the blind were only casually or 335 Purse,\"The Blind in Industry\", p. 76 336 Beacon 1924: Home Industries for the Blind 337 Beacon 1935: 1910-1935 338 Beacon 1930: A Record of Useful Work 339 Ibid 340 Beacon 1924: The Employment of the Blind; A Survey of the General Problem 341 Beacon 1931: Report of the Advisory Committee on t he Welfare of the Blind Illnesses: Blindness - 129 - partially employed. Another area of inequality was evident between male and female employment of the blind, whereby women experienced discrimination. Despite the problems with employment opportunities for the blind, the situation with wages continually improved during this era. Between 1938 and 1955 there was a substantial increase in normal industry wages and blind wages appear to have also experienced this increase, which marks a valuable achievement for the blind. T his comparison is shown in Table 4.2. 1950 /barb2right 1975 In 1963 a new comprehensive service for placing bli nd people in industrial employment was introduced by the Ministry of Labour. During the fi rst year of this scheme 921 blind people were placed in industry, of which 761 were placed i n open employment, which the RNIB considered a \"good start\" 342 . the blind: number and perc entage of working age blind in employment and areas of employment, 1968-1975 343 1968 % blind age working population employed 1969 % blind age working population employed 1970 % blind age working population employed 1975 % blind age working population employed Total Employed 9143 24 8969 24 8683 24 7837 31 In open employment 6269 17 6241 17 6123 17 5687 23 Table 4.8 considers the total number of blind in em ployment and the percentage of the blind working age population that this represents. This t able highlights that despite the efforts of the Ministry of Labour, the blind employment rate faile d to improve before 1975. This is best highlighted by there never being more than 24 perce nt of the blind working age population in 342 The New Beacon 1965: Placement 343 Ibid 1975 = average of 1974 and 1976 (1974 = 24933 and 1976 = 24843, aged between 16 and 64 /barb2right approximately 24888 at working age in 1975) Illnesses: Blindness - 130 - employment. However, the percentage of blind employ ed in general and in open industry by 1975 was a considerable increase from the previous levels. 1975 /barb2right 2000 \"Between 1991 and 2000 there is not thought to have been very much improvement in the percentage of the blind population who [were] employed\" , and between 1975 and 1991 the data show a considerable decrease in blind employme nt 344 . The RNIB suggest that \"the problem is one of discrimination and inadequate gov ernment help to train the blind and place them in open employment\" 345 . This was exacerbated by the decline in blind work shops (from 4,000 in 1949 to 1,500 in 1975). Between 1985 and 1991 the RNIB conducted a major su rvey of blind and partially sighted adults in Britain, which identified that only 17 pe rcent of the working age blind were in employment 346 . This is considerably worse than what the blind em ployment rates had been for the rest of the century. Therefore, the above data indicates that there was still deep seated discrimination against the blind in employment. This is partly because \"there [were] still many situations where disabled people [could] be discriminated against legally\" , despite government legislation 347 . Most noteworthy is that only direct discrimination was p rohibited which enabled the more subtle forms of oppression that were sustained by in-built or institutions patterns of inequality 348 . An additional source of inequality was between the bli nd and the able bodied population was that \"visually impaired people are less likely to be in professional jobs than non-disabled and disabled people in general\" 349 . This is summarised in Table 4.5. 344 RNIB, \"Work Matters\" 345 Bruce & McKennell, \"Blind ults in Britain: The RNIB Survey\" 346 Ibid 347 French, \"Disabled People and Employment A Study of the Working Lives of Visually Impaired Physiothera pists\", p. 29 348 Borsay, \"Disability and Social Policy in Britain s ince 1750\", p. 1 349 French, \"Disabled People and Employment A Study of the Working Lives of Visually Impaired Physiotherap ists\", p. 29 Illnesses: Blindness - 131 - Table 4.5: Occupational status of visually impaired people, disabled people and non-disabled people as a percentage of the workforce, 1990-2000 350 Professional Semi-skilled and Unskilled Visually impaired people 14% 36% Disabled people 25% 31% Non-disabled people 34% 23% These problems in employment are exacerbated by lab our market changes which should have boosted the ability of the blind to obtain employme nt. Throughout the twentieth century there was a shift in Britain's employment structure away from industry and towards manufacturing and the service sector, where the blind would have been more able to engage in employment. The increase in the size of the labour market betwe en 1979 and 1999 from 24.5 million to 27 million should have helped provide employment for a higher proportion of the blind population 351 . During this time there was an increase in part-ti me temporary jobs, which suited the employment needs of the blind more favourably, and should have boosted blind employment. Finally, developments in workplace tech nology should have facilitated additional employment. Despite the efforts of the government and charities the blind did not experience any significant reductions in the adverse effects of blindness in e mployment. \"In 1990, 53 percent of the visually impaired were living on less than half the national average income\"352 . This is a strong indication of the poor quality of life that the majority of the blind consistently faced in twentieth century England. 4.2.2 Education 1900 /barb2right 1950 The provision of education was the most developed s ocio-economic aspect of blind welfare at the start of the twentieth century. 350 Aggregate disabled population includes all disabil ities. French, \"Disabled People and Employment A St udy of the Working Lives of Visually Impaired Physiotherapists\", p. 34 351 RNIB, \"Work Britain: The Employment Challenge\" Illnesses: Blindness - 132 - The education of the blind has traditionally been c onducted in special blind schools, which were funded by the government. In 1918 the governme nt grant (which was increased during the twentieth century) was \u00a310 per unit of average attendance in a certified day school for the blind and \u00a316.50 in a boarding school, both per ann um 353 . At this time it was generally considered that the s pecial blind schools were the best place to educate the blind and that these schools were satis factory at this task. Some even highlighted how \"blind schools were superior to a blind child atte nding a normal school\" 354 . There had been a continual improvement in the standards of th ese schools and by 1930 there was \"ample provision for the education of blind children and t he facilities to educate them to the same extent as seeing children\" 355 . An alternative method for educating the blind was t hrough home teachers. During the 1920s the number of home teachers began to expand rapidly : in 1924 there were 270 home teachers and by 1928 there were 390 356 . Despite the merits of home teaching, as technolog y advanced and special schools for the blind improved there wa s an increase in the number of blind children who attended school and a decline in the n umber who were taught at home. There was also a decrease in the number of blind ch ildren who did not receive any kind of tuition. In 1921, 15.7 percent of normal blind chil dren were not attending school. By 1930 only 10 percent of blind children were not attendin g school. 1950 /barb2right 2000 These improvements in education for the blind conti nued and are likely to have inspired the Warnock Report and the 1981 Education Act, which en couraged greater integration for children with disabilities into mainstream schools 357 . However, the blind were slow to enter mainstream schools and instead remained at special schools for the blind. \"In the year 2000 in England, Wales and Scotland, 59 percent of primary aged children and 46 percent of 353 Beacon 1918: The Board of Education 354 Beacon 1922: The Blind and Education; a letter fro m the Chairman of the Standing Committee and Honora ry Treasurer of the NIB 355 Claims of a headmaster of a blind school in Beacon 1930: Helping the Blind 356 Beacon 1924: The Welfare of the Blind, Beacon 1925 : Advisory Committee on the Welfare of the Blind, B eacon 1928: Welfare of the blind Ministry of Health Report 357 The New Beacon 1982: Integration of the Educationa lly Blind Illnesses: Blindness - 133 - secondary aged children with visual impairments att ended mainstream schools\" 358 . The majority of blind children who were attending mains tream schools were at infant schools and it is likely that they would have graduated to blin d schools for their further education. The other type of blind pupil at mainstream schools was one-off placements. Despite these developments in equality for educatin g blind children, the number of blind university graduates provides a depressing contrast as there was never more than 3 percent of the blind population (1969-1985) and usually only a bout 0.5 percent (1901-1985, mode average) attending university 359 . 4.2.3 Status 1900 /barb2right 1950 The first improvement in the status of the blind wa s delivered under the 1920 Blind Persons Act. This was the first time that the blind had bee n exclusively recognised and helped for their disability. However, it was not until the Second Wo rld War (and after) that the blind experienced their most significant improvement in s tatus. This boost in blind persons' standing was a result of their inclusion in the war effort, which continued throughout the rest of the twentieth century with an increased proporti on of the blind workforce (albeit small) working in open industry. However, the blind standi ng, particularly in employment, was still not overly impressive (see Table 4.4). 1950 /barb2right 2000 As a result of continued problems in gaining employ ment and the failure of legal legislation to completely cater for the needs of the blind, their status did not reach optimum levels during the second half of the twentieth century. In the ar eas of recognition and help the status of the blind had improved considerably. These developments indicate that some of the burden of blindness had been alleviated. However, much of the help and treatment of the blind still seemed to be aimed more at welfare rather than reha bilitation, which was undesirable for the status related quality of life of the blind. 358 Mason, H. & McCall, S. (1997) Visual Impairment, A ccess to Education for Children and Young People, p . 16 359 Calculated from: Butler, \"Visually Handicapped Stu dies: A Survey\" Illnesses: Blindness - 134 - An improvement in status was experienced by blind c hildren with the introduction of the 1981 Education Act. The 1986 Disabled Persons Act promoted the inclusio n of disabled persons on committees, especially for issues concerning the interests of d isabled people. This highlights another small improvement in the standing of the blind population . The 1995 Disability Discrimination Act provided equality between the blind and the able bo died populations. However, in actuality this did not provide equality, to the detriment of the status of the blind. Therefore, as a result of better education, employm ent opportunities and various social improvements \"the status of the blind has improved such that the word blind no longer has unpleasant connotations, in the way it might have d one at the start of the century\" 360 . However the blind population had not reached a poin t where their opportunities and treatment were equal to able bodied individuals. One of the k ey frustrations for this achievement was the experiences of the blind with regard to policy. As well as the government introducing more far reaching measures (which had been stated) it could also be argued that the blind charities could have taken a more involved and influential ro le in order to reiterate the precise legislative needs of the blind to policy makers. 4.3 Blind Discontent Regional Inequalities The organisation of blind welfare differed between Local Authorities. For example in 1944 there was nearly a 100 percent difference between t he highest and the lowest levels of welfare payments to the blind 361 . The provision of other services for the blind wer e also unevenly distributed: in some areas there were many more pro visions for home working, workshops and schools. The densely populated urban areas tended t o lead with the provision of blind aid and the sparse rural areas were able to provide compara tively very little to their blind residents. 360 The New Beacon 1980: Visually Handicapped or Blind ? 361 The National Archives: MH 55 (120): 1934-1935 Prop osed Review of Circumstances of Unemployable Blind Illnesses: Blindness - 135 - Preferential Treatment of Blinded War Veterans Another area of discontent was the treatment of bli nded ex-service men, who received substantial state pensions (shown in Table 4.2) and comprehensive retraining at St. Dunstans, which was the rehabilitation and training centre fo r blinded ex-servicemen. There were approximately 2,000 of these war veteran s who received this special treatment that was generally considered to be excellent 362 . Their benefits were considerably more extensive than the welfare benefits received by the rest of t he blind population, for example, the maximum veteran pension was \u00a36, which was twelve ti mes greater than the 50p maximum for the normal blind, who interpreted this as a very un fair situation, and demanded \"an equal standard of living for all blind persons, the stand ard of living that is presently enjoyed by soldiers and sailors blinded in the Great War\" 363 . Perceived Inadequacy of State Help Perceived inadequacy of state treatment of the blin d is best measured by the demonstrations and marches of the blind. During the twentieth cent ury these started in around 1915 as a result of demands for aid, which culminated in the 1919 NI B demonstration, which was supported by numerous trade unions, cooperatives and labour b odies. Their demands were to secure decent conditions of life and labour for every sigh tless person in Britain 364 . This process was re-enacted in 1920 when there was a march of about 200 blind people who were campaigning \"to highlight and improve the unsatisfactory social and industrial conditions faced by the blind and to demand that the government shall, with out delay redeem its promises by providing the necessary financial arrangement\" . In 1936 there was another march of the blind, which was very similar in nature to the 1919 campaign. Finally, in 1990 there was a major demonstration by over 250 disabled groups and charities: of this group the RNIB were present on behalf of the blind. They were campaigni ng for a new system of benefits for disabled people, in order to bridge the gap between the living standards of the able bodied and disabled. 362 Ibid 363 The National Archives: MH 55 (607): 1936 Amendment to the Blind Persons Act 1920: Demands shouted by 500 or so blind protesters 364 Beacon 1920: March of the Blind to London Illnesses: Blindness - 136 - Also insightful is the stigma that was associated w ith blind welfare payments, which was evident throughout the twentieth century. Hence, as well as welfare payment levels being low there was a stigma in take-up, which meant that the welfare state failed to guarantee the blind against poverty and financial exclusion 365 . 4.4 Medical Developments 1900 /barb2right 1925 During the first quarter of the twentieth century t here was no knowledge about the causes and treatment of blindness, although it was known that much of childhood blindness was caused by venereal disease. The known causes of blindness and associated childhood prevalence of these causes are shown in the table below. Table 4.6: Major causes of blindness in blind child ren as a percentage of the blind children population, 1913 -1991 (%) 366 Cause 1913 1920 1950 1991 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 24 18 16 - Syphilitic inflammation 30 31 - - Optic Atrophy - - 8 16 The table above highlights the proportion of childr en suffering from blindness caused by known congenital defects during the twentieth centu ry. Table 4.6 highlights that ophthalmia and syphilitic inflammation were both major causes of blindness at the beginning of the twentieth century and that by 2000 (and even the 1950s) these causes had been completely eliminated, which was achieved through the treatment of venereal disease. This was helped by the Local Gove rnment Board in 1914, when they made ophthalmia neonatorum a notifiable disease. The dis covery of safe and effective antibacterial treatment in the 1930s eliminated venereal diseases . This decline was partially substituted with an increase in congenital optic atrophy. 365 Borsay, \"Disability and Social Policy in Britain s ince 1750\", p. 168 366 This list is not exhaustive.

Table 4.7: Major causes of blindness in all ages of blind as a percentage of the blind population, 1922-1991 (%) 367 Cause 1922 1950 1991 Cataract 16 25 3 Congenital defects 6 10 - Glaucoma 9 13 12 Macular degeneration - 6 49 The above table considers the proportion of blindne ss distributed among major causes. The most noteworthy is the decline in congenial defects . There was a significant increase in blindness due to macular degeneration, which is not surprising if it is seen within the context of the epidemiological transition. Also noteworthy in the context of the epidemiological transition is the trend in blindness experienced by cataracts and glaucoma: both of these are related to the change in mortality and the burden o f disease. These both worsened around the middle of the century and improved by the end, whic h is a direct result of medical technological improvements that arrived by 2000 but not 1950, when these types of blindness associated with a degenerative disease environments became more prevalent. 1950 /barb2right 2000 Increasingly from the late 1950s the introduction o f cortisone diminished the risk of blindness from numerous causes, from chemical accidents in in dustry to Iritis and Iridocyclitis (inflammation of the iris). Also at this time, surgical treatment for cataracts was introduced and continued to develop throughout the second half of the twentieth century so that by the year 2000 curing cataracts was a very simple procedure, especially as by 1960 it had become possible to remove a cataract before it was fully mature (and causing co mplete vision loss). This development 367 This list is not exhaustive. Beacon 1923: Ministry of Health Departmental Committee on the Causes and Prevention of Blindness and 1950 Privy Council Medical Research Council Memorandum Number 24: The Causes of Blindness in England and Wales and 1991 D OH Statistics Bulletin Illnesses: Blindness - 138 - explains the - inverted 'U' shaped - trend of the p revalence of cataracts during the twentieth century. In 1922 16 percent of the population (25 p ercent of the blind old aged population) suffered from cataracts. At this time there was no medical procedure that could alleviate the problem and eventual blindness was inevitable. The prevalence of cataracts peaked in 1950, at 25.4 percent (43 percent for old ages), caused by t he ageing of the population without the medical developments to eliminate cataracts. By 199 1, only 3.5 percent of the blind old aged population suffered from cataracts. This is a direc t result of modern cataract surgery, and indicates the significant contribution of medical t echnology to blind quality of life. Table 4.8: Blindness (caused by cataracts, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy) in old aged blind as a percentage of the old age blind populati on, 1922-1991 (%) 368 Cause 1922 1950 1991 Cataract 25.4 43.0 3.5 Diabetic Retinopathy - - 2.2 Glaucoma 29.8 18.0 12.9 Developments similar to those for cataracts have be en made in the treatment of glaucoma, which also tends to be an old age disease. Blindnes s caused by glaucoma is a result of increased intraocular tension on the eyeball, which causes changes in the optic disk and affects vision. The solution to this disease is early diagn osis and adoption of appropriate treatment: eye drops and/or laser surgery. This can be achieve d with regular screening, which was provided by the National Health Service (NHS) durin g the last quarter of the twentieth century for relatives of glaucoma sufferers who were are ag ed 40 years or older. Finally, increased awareness about diabetic retinop athy (when the blood vessels in the retina enlarge and leak fluid which eventually causes blin dness), evident during the last decade of the twentieth century, also provided a contribution towards the reduction of blindness. In the same way as glaucoma, retinopathy can be managed th rough regular screening, which is free on the NHS for diabetics (because of the close corr elation of diabetes and vision disorders). However, there was still no curative treatment for glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy at the close of the twentieth century. 368 Ibid Illnesses: Blindness - 139 - These developments created an increase in the avera ge age of onset of blindness and a subsequent reduction in the average number of life years spent in blindness. This represents a significant improvement in the quality of life asso ciated with blindness that is especially important to measure because it is a more subtle de velopment. However, estimating the average number of years in blindness is very difficult, due to a void of detailed blind data. There is no information abo ut the age of onset of blindness and the only remaining alternative data about the prevalence of blindness only exists in 10 (sometimes 5) year blocks, which makes it impossible to determine the precise age of onset of blindness (particularly as prevalence is not equal to the con traction of blindness and the lower the frequency of data points for prevalence, the more p ronounced this difference becomes between prevalence and contraction). Moreover, unli ke the other illnesses considered in the thesis, blindness is not considered with survival r ates and it is therefore impossible to determine the average number of years spent with bl indness (per case of blindness). The combination of these problems means that the thesis is only able to provide a rough impression about the average number of blind years at different times during the twentieth century. Hence, the results yielded in Table 4.9 sh ould only be considered only as a general indication about the likely number of years in blin dness. These estimates are derived through the following m ethodological process, which entails numerous assumptions that are also outlined below. The most common age of onset of blindness was identified for 1900, 1925, 1950, 1975 and 2000. This was achieved through reviewing the percentage of the population that wer e blind at different ages (the illustration of this is shown below in Figure 4.2.i and 4.2.ii). Th is often contained two (and three in 1950) reference points in an attempt to be more represent ative about the most common ages of onset of blindness. The fundamental assumption here is th at a peak of blindness represents an increase in blindness and another subsequent peak w ill imply an additional increase in the number of blind. These assumptions are coupled with another, even more tenuous assumption, which is the estimate about the average duration of blindness from these peaks, in order to identify the average number of blind years in diffe rent eras. Because blindness was (generally) resolved in death, the age of onset of blindness in these peaks is considered relative to life expectancy at that age. Illnesses: Blindness - 140 - Figure 4.2.i: Prevalence of blindness by age, 1900, 1925, 1950, 1975 and 2000 369 Prevalence of Blindness by Age 1900-2000 0510 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 0-9 10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-69 70-74 80+ Percentage Blind 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 Figure 4.2.ii presents the same data but on a prefe rable scale.

This was necessary in order to estimate the end point of blindness (throu gh death) and subsequently identify the 369 For a more detailed graphical analysis see Appendi x 12.13.1 370 For a more detailed graphical analysis see Appendi x 12.13.1 Illnesses: Blindness - 141 - average number of blind years. This methodological process identified the most common ages of onset of blindness, which is combined with life expectancy at the age of onset of blindness in order to provide an estimate for the average num ber of years in blindness. These results are shown in Table 4.9. For completeness it is also desirable to consider t he results in Table 4.9 in their wider context. This will be achieved in Table 4.10, which consider s the proportion of the blind population that is represented in the most common age of onset of blindness. Table 4.10 will also develop this information one stage further through identify ing the number of blind years that Table 4.9 implies. This will provide an indication about the average number of blind years during different eras of the twentieth century.

These have then been compared with life expectancy in order to produce the results in colum ns seven, eight and nine, 'average number of years of blindness' in Table 4.9. This last part of the calculation is derived through considering the average age of onset of blindness w ith the average length of life (life expectancy at age of onset of blindness - average a ge of onset of blindness = average number of years of blindness) in order to determine how ma ny years are spent in blindness. These considerations in Table 4.9 enable Table 4.10 to ge nerate more aggregate indications about the 'total number of blind years (from most common ages of onset)'. This table also indicates the depth of these calculations through identifying the percentage of the blind population that are included in the most common ages of onset. Once this has been achieved, it is possible to illu strate that, although the trend has not been uniform, and although the trends are based on very ambiguous data and assumptions, there is an indication that the burden of blindness, in term s of the average number of blind years endured by the average blind person, improved betwe en 1900 (about 16 years on average), the peak in 1950 (about 34 years on average) and 2000 ( 11 years on average). Conversely, Table 4.10 highlights a substantial increase in the numbe r of people afflicted with blindness. Although this is a set back for improvements in bli ndness (related to prevalence), it does not detract from: i) improvements in the average durati ons of blindness and ii) other (aforementioned) quality of life gains for the blin d in twentieth century England. A final caveat for these findings requires a consid eration to be made about cohort effects. This is necessary to add validity to the above claims ab out the increasing most common age of onset of blindness, as part of this increased avera ge age of blindness is likely to be due to a cohort effect, as some of the 69 percent of the bli nd population who were aged over 75 in 2000 were also blind at ages 50+ in 1975. In order to provide the most accurate indication of the changes in the dynamics of the burden of blindn ess it is necessary to identify the extensiveness of these cohort effects. Table 4.11 c onsiders the magnitude of this influence. Illnesses: Blindness - 145 - Table 4.11: Cohort effects of increased average age of onset of blindness 373 Year (T) Most common age group Period T-1 Age in period T-1 Number of blind in age group in T Number of blind in age group in T-1 Cohort effect (%) % in T that are from T-1 1900 - - - - - - 1925 16-64 1900 1-39 24723 8676 35 1950 1975(6) 50-65 108360 11179 10 In Table 4.11 the most common ages of blindness are identified (and presented as a broader age group than in Tables 4.9 and 4.10) and are then considered for their relationship with the number of blind in the previous era, T-1. For examp le, in 1925 the most common age of onset of blindness was between ages 16 and 64 (this has b een conservatively estimated as 55 in the tables above). However, this could be a result of e arlier generations' blindness, e.g. if blindness was contracted between ages 1 and 39 in 1 900. Therefore, to decipher the extent of this effect, the thesis considers the number of bli nd in aged 16-64 in 1925 (T), relative to the number of blind aged 1-39 in 1900 (T-1), in order t o identify the percentage of blind who could be part of the cohort effect. These considerations about the extent of spill-over (from period T-1 to T), which are made by the thesis in order to assess the accuracy of the a verage number of blind years as considered in Table 4.9 and 4.10 show that in most eras there was an evident cohort effect but that this was not far-reaching enough to over turn the trend in t he reduction of average blind years. The most substantial cohort effects were in 1925, where 35 percent of the blind were also blind in 1900, versus 2000, which had the lowest cohort effe cts, where only 10 percent of the blind in 2000 had also been blind in 1975. The results of t his analysis indicate that although there were evident spill-over or cohort effects, these we re not large enough to drastically change the overall findings about the increasing age of onset of blindness, and the contribution that this had towards improving the quality of life of the bl ind, especially by the year 2000, when these 373 Calculated from: Census of England and Wales 1901, Government Papers: Local Authority Blind Returns. See Appendix 12.13.2 for elaboration. For 1975 there is no data of enough detail. This e stimate was derived from estimating the proportion of the blind population aged 50 to 65 out of the 16 -65 age groups. In 1950 and 2000 (for which detailed data e xists) the 50 to 65 age group = 45 percent of the e ntire 16 to 65 age group. Applying this to 1976 /barb2right 16 to 64 age group = 24843*0.45 = 11179 Illnesses: Blindness - 146 - cohort effects were least significant. The consiste ntly declining magnitude of the cohort effect also adds weight to earlier indications about a dec line in the average number of years of blindness. Finally, the key value of Table 4.11 is that it substantiate earlier judgements related to the quality of life associated with (the average number of years of) blindness in twentieth century England, which marks an important improveme nt and a valuable development, which will be analysed further in Chapter 8.2, blind quan titative results. 4.5 Summary By the end of the twentieth century socio-economic standards of living for the blind had improved to levels which were regarded as good by s ome and adequate by most, and consequently the burden, discomfort and unpleasantn ess of blindness had been somewhat alleviated. The result of this was an improvement i n the quality of life for the blind during the twentieth century. The developments in government l egislation, blind peoples' recognition and status and a move towards equal rights and opportun ities in employment and education have generated improvements in blind welfare, such that by the close of the twentieth century the blind had a satisfactory quality of life. However, there still remained considerable scope for improvement in the health and particularly welfare related quality of life associated with blindness. The extensiveness and value of these twe ntieth century changes in blind quality of life will be summarised in Chapter 7.1 and quantifi ed in Chapter 8.2. Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 147 - 5.

This chapter will highlight the health and welfare conditions faced by tuberculosis sufferers during the twentieth century and identify the changes in these conditions and ultimately the improvements in quality of life asso ciated with this disease. This will be achieved through a detailed consideration of the ke y features associated with the health and welfare experiences of tuberculosis sufferers. The chapter will begin by providing a background on this disease, in order to highlight vividly how improvements in the prognosis of tuberc ulosis affected quality of life. The thesis will provide a detailed explanation of the c hanging aetiology, pathogenesis and prognosis and the changes in related courses of the rapy associated with tuberculosis in twentieth century England. This will be followed by an outline of the statistical detail related to the mortality and morbidity burden of tu berculosis during different eras of the twentieth century. After this has been achieved this chapter will prov ide the twentieth century chronology that details the efforts made by government, charities a nd medical technology in the fight to treat, aid and cure tuberculosis. This section will concentrate on evaluating the outcome of these efforts for their contribution towards improv ing the quality of life for tuberculosis sufferers. After the improvements have been analysed it will b e desirable to identify the areas where there has been a comparative lack of progress in im proving quality of life for tuberculosis sufferers in twentieth century England. This will p rovide the final necessary details to enable comprehensive conclusions. 5.1 Aetiology and Prognosis 5.1.1 Definition Tuberculosis is an infection with the bacterium Myc obacterium tuberculosis (hereafter M.tuberculosis), which most commonly affects the lu ngs (in at least 75 percent of cases), Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 150 - where it is called pulmonary tuberculosis 378 . Extrapulmonary sites include the pleura, central nervous system, lymphatic system, genitouri nary system, and bones and joints. An especially serious form is disseminated or miliary tuberculosis, which is more common in immunosuppressed persons and in young children. Pul monary tuberculosis can co-exist with extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Additional termin ology for tuberculosis are shown in the table below .

Exposure is a result of M. tubercul osis being transmitted between an infectious patient and susceptible contacts via dro plet nuclei that are expelled by coughing, sneezing and other forceful respiratory activities380 . In order to develop the disease a victim must have contact with a source case. The probability of transmitting tuberculosis depend s upon: the infectiousness of the carrier (quantity expelled), environment of exposure, durat ion of exposure, virulence of the 378 Wikipedia (2005), \"Tuberculosis\" .

Retrieved 24 February 2005, from: http://www.hopkins-id.edu/diseases/tb/tb_class.html Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 151 - organism, and susceptability of the contact. The ch ain of transmission can be stopped by isolating patients with the active disease (pre 195 0 this was the common solution) and starting effective anti-tuberculous therapy (which became increasingly effective and commonplace from the 1950s). The outcome of exposure is dependent upon individua l susceptibility to disease. A number of conditions are associated with altered host immu nity and increase the risk of developing tuberculosis, e.g. HIV infection, extremes of age, immunosuppressive therapy, cancer, end stage renal disease, diabetes, severe malnutrition and some upper gastrointestinal surgeries 381 . In addition, injection drug use is associated wit h an increased risk of developing tuberculosis (for reasons that are not w ell described). Close contacts (i.e. persons with prolonged, frequent or intense contact ) are at highest risk of becoming infected. During the twenteith century this infection rate (i .e. the chance of an individual being infected after close contact with a contagious tube rculosis agent) fell to about 22 percent from a level much closer to 100, largely as a resul t of improvements in standards of living 382 . 5.1.3 Pathogenesis The pathogenesis of tuberculosis is relatively comp lex as a result of the variety of possible temporary and permanent states associated with an i nitial exposure to the tubercle bacillus bacteria. Most noteworthy is the distinction betwee n tuberculosis infection and disease. A diagnostic staging system for tuberculosis is shown below. 381 Ibid 382 Wikipedia (2005), \"Tuberculosis\".

This can occ ur soon after infection, primary tuberculosis or post primary, secondary, reactivati on tuberculosis disease of dormant bacilli 384 . About five percent of infected persons will devel op the tuberculosis disease in the first two years, and another five percent will develop the disease later in life 385 . In aggregate, about 10 percent of infected persons wit h normal immune systems will develop the tuberculosis disease in their lifetime 386 . However, while only 10 percent of tuberculosis infections progresses to tuberculosis disease, when untreated (in earlier parts of the twentieth century) the death rate was more in the r egion of 50 percent. Symptoms of developed tuberculosis include a prolon ged cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis. Systemic symptoms include fever, chills , night sweats, appetite loss, weight loss and easy fatigability 387 . Some medical conditions increase the risk of progre ssion from tuberculosis infection (or latent tuberculosis) to disease.

Other such conditions include drug injection, substance abuse, recent tuberculosis infection (within two years) or a history of inadequately treated tub erculosis, a chest X-ray suggestive of previous tuberculosis (fibrotic lesions and nodules ), diabetes mellitus, silicosis and prolonged corticosteroid therapy 388 .

Exposure Sub clinical Infection R R R Non- Infectious Tuberculosis Infectious Tuberculosis DEATH R / TB5 TB3 TB3 TB4 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 154 - 5.2 Tuberculosis Data Concerns about tuberculosis were rife at the beginn ing of the twentieth century, and consequently, there are numerous data, from varied sources which provides detailed information about tuberculosis morbidity and partic ularly mortality. Since 1927 tuberculosis deaths have been registered in compliance with WHO regulations, which provides a consistent and reliable mortality index for tuberculosis, although this does not escape the general problems of death regis tration and also displays some classification inconsistencies. Tuberculosis morbidity data is more problematic. Al though some very vague estimates for the beginning of the twentieth century exist, it wa s not until the 1950s that this data became more common place and reliable. This is desp ite continual government efforts to create an accurate index of the prevalence of tuber culosis morbidity. For example, the Public Health Act 1896 legislated the \"provision for the notification (to the medical off icer of health of sanitary authorities) of cases of pulm onary tuberculosis occurring amongst the inmates of Poor Law institutions, or amongst person s under the care of the district medical officers...\" 391 . Despite these efforts, under notification was a c onsistent problem throughout the twentieth century: even after the in troduction of the NHS the Ministry of Health recognised that \"notification remained incomplete and delayed\" 392 . These morbidity data shortcomings before 1950 are n ot overly problematic because it is not until about 1950 that mortality declined signif icantly, such that notification rates (which are a proxy for morbidity) became the premie r index of the burden of tuberculosis. 5.2.1 Mortality Data Figure 5.3 highlights the significant twentieth cen tury decline in tuberculosis mortality. This decline began in the late nineteenth century, for example in 1881 the death rate from pulmonary tuberculosis per 10,000 was 18.25, in 189 1 it was 15.99 and in 1901 it was 12.64. This trend gathered pace throughout the twen tieth century, such that, by 1980 tuberculosis had virtually been eliminated. 391 The National Archives: MH55(521): Compulsory Notif ication of Pulmonary and Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis : Public Health (Tuberculosis) Act 1912 392 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 1 28 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 155 - Figure 5.3: Tuberculosis deaths, 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 Year TB Deaths The trend in Figure 5.3 is verified when the declin e in tuberculosis mortality is considered in conjunction with all mortality. Figure 5.4 highl ights that the substantial decline in the level of tuberculosis mortality is genuine, as this trend is maintained when considering the tuberculosis morbidity rate. Figure 5.4: Tuberculosis mortality rate: tuberculos is deaths as a percentage of all deaths, 1901-2000 394 Tuberculosis Deaths as a Percentage of All Deaths 1 901-2000 0246810 12 1901 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 Year TB Deaths % of Total 393 Calculations from: Office of National Statistics, \"Twentieth Century Mortality: 100 Years of Mortalit y Data in England and Wales by Age, Sex, Year and Underlying Cause\" 394 Ibid Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 156 - In Figure 5.3 and 5.4 there is a significant declin e between 1901 and 1960, after which the pace slows. These figures also show that by the las t quarter of the twentieth century, tuberculosis was virtually eliminated. These improvements are accentuated when the age dis tribution of tuberculosis mortality are considered. This is shown in the graph below. Figure 5.5: Tuberculosis deaths by age, 1901-2000 395 Tuberculosis Deaths by Age 1901-2000 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 1901 1950 2000 During the twentieth century the age profile of tub erculosis mortality changed considerably. In 1901 the majority (nearly 50 perce nt) of tuberculosis deaths occurred in ages 25-54, and ages 0-4 accounted for nearly 20 pe rcent of tuberculosis mortality. The age distribution continually improved such that, by 200 0 nearly 75 percent of deaths occurred at ages 65+. The only exception to this trend was i n 1920, possibly due to reporting issues associated with World War One. These improvements can be further elaborated by con sidering age specific tuberculosis mortality in relation to all deaths in the populati on, i.e. the death rate by age. 395 Calculations from: Office of National Statistics, \"Twentieth Century Mortality: 100 Years of Mortalit y Data in England and Wales by Age, Sex, Year and Underlying Cause\" Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 157 - Figure 5.6: Tuberculosis deaths as a rate of all de aths by age 1901-2000 396 Tuberculosis Deaths as a Rate of All Deaths by Age 1901-2000 050 100 150 200 250 300 350 1,000 deaths 1901 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 Figure 5.6 shows a consistent improvement in the bu rden of tuberculosis, which was generally evident throughout the twentieth century (with the exception of the 1920 anomaly). An additional detail that deserves mention is the d istribution of tuberculosis by gender. Figure 5.7: Tuberculosis deaths by gender, 1900-200 0 Tuberculosis Deaths by 1901-2000 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 Number of Deaths Male Female 396 Calculations from: Office of National Statistics, \"Twentieth Century Mortality: 100 Years of Mortalit y Data in England and Wales by Age, Sex, Year and Underlying Cause\" Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 158 - Figure 5.7 highlights that for the entire twentieth century tuberculosis mortality was greater in males than in females for the corresponding deca de. The extent to which this was evident ranged from female mortality only being 37 percent of male in 1960 to 93 percent in 1920. Table 5.4: Tuberculosis deaths: female as a percent age of male, 1901-2000 Year 1901 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2 000 F as a % of M 74 80 93 81 74 60 37 45 49 45 78 One possible explanation for this is the higher mal e labour force participation rates, which would have meant that male exposure to the tubercul osis disease was greater than female. This potential explanation is supported by Figure 5 .8, which illustrates the age distribution of deaths by gender. Figure 5.8: Tuberculosis deaths by age and gender, 1901-2000 Tuberculosis Deaths by Gender and Age 1901-2000 01000 2000 3000 4000 1960 1980 and 2000 The most noteworthy feature in Figure 5.8 is the hi gher male mortality in the oldest ages, which differs from the majority of causes of death. Also evident is the higher prevalence of male mortality in the youngest and working age grou ps, although decreasingly pronounced Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 159 - as the twentieth century unfolded. The only other p ersistent trend is the consistently higher female mortality in ages of about 15 and 20s. 5.2.2 Morbidity Data A factor that needs to be noted when comparing mort ality and morbidity statistics for twentieth century tuberculosis in England is that t he mortality data includes all forms of tuberculosis, whereas the morbidity data only consi ders pulmonary tuberculosis. This is because pulmonary tuberculosis is the only form of tubercle bacillus that is highly contagious and therefore a public health threat tha t warranted notification. Table 5.5 indicates the extent to which the above aggregate t uberculosis mortality data reflects pulmonary tuberculosis. Table 5.5: Pulmonary tuberculosis deaths as a perce ntage of total tuberculosis deaths, 1901-2000 397 Year Total TB deaths Pulmonary TB deaths Pulmonary TB deaths as a % of total TB deaths (%) 1970 1,506 1,345 89 1980 587 529 90 1990 378 340 90 2000 366 310 85 During each time period of the twentieth century pu lmonary tuberculosis was the major component of aggregate tuberculosis, although the e xtent to which this was the case varied slightly. 397 Calculations from: Office of National Statistics, \"Twentieth Century Mortality: 100 Years of Mortalit y Data in England and Wales by Age, Sex, Year and Underlying Cause\" Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 160 - Since the introduction of chemotherapy (in the 1950 s) it has become necessary to consider tuberculosis morbidity in order to obtain the most accurate picture of the health related welfare burden of tuberculosis. The most viable way to assess tuberculosis morbidit y is through the notifications made to the medical officer. This data needs to be analysed with much caution due to the strong prospect of under and uneven reporting. Although th is distortion is more pronounced in the earlier years it should be regarded as applicable t o the entire twentieth century, despite numerous efforts to improve reporting, e.g. through the 1948 National Health Service Act, numerous [Infectious Disease] reporting regulations , and compulsory notification of all smear positive patients in 1973, there were still l ikely to be many undetected and unreported cases. Although problematic, under repo rting notifications is not thought to be significant enough to affect the overall trends in the number of notifications in twentieth century England and Wales, as shown in Figure 5.9. Figure 5.9: Number of tuberculosis notifications, 1 1930 1935 1940 1945 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 197 5 1980 1990 1992 2000 Number of TB Notifications Figure 5.9 illustrates the decline in the incidence of tuberculosis during the twentieth century, which was particularly pronounced between 1915 and 1955 when the prevalence of tuberculosis was halved, largely due to an impro vement in environmental factors. The decline between 1955 and 2000 is nearly entirely at tributable to medical developments, which will be explained in detail later in this cha pter. This fall in prevalence was not 398 1920 to 1980: Citron et al, \"Tuberculosis Today\", 1990: Watson et al, \"Notifications of Tubercu losis in England and Wales, 1982-1989\", p. R13. 1992 and 2000: Joint Tuberculosis Committee of the British Thoracic Society, \"Control and Prevention o f Tuberculosis in the UK: Code of Practice 2000\", p . 887 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 161 - consistent because of the increase in 1945/1950, wh ich is thought to be a result of the Second World War 399 and 1990-2000, which is likely to have been caused by increased deprivation particularly among ethnic minorities. E .g. in 1998 the crude incidence rate of tuberculosis per 100,000 populations in indigenous white residents in England and Wales was 4.4 compared with 121 in Indian sub-continent g roups and 210 per 100,000 in black African ethnic groups 400 . As with tuberculosis mortality, it is possible to g ain a more detailed understanding about the burden of tuberculosis morbidity by considering the age and gender distribution. Figure 5.10 and 5.11: Tuberculosis notification rat e: male and female, 1940-2000 401 Tuberculosis Notification Rate: Male 1940-2000 050 1965-1970 2000 Tuberculosis Notification Rate: Female 1940-2000 1960-64 1965-1970 2000 Figures 5.10 and 5.11 highlight trends which are si milar to those identified for tuberculosis mortality. In all years except 1940 male notificati ons were higher than female, except for 399 Citron et al, \"Tuberculosis Today\", p. 6 400 Joint Tuberculosis Committee of the British Thorac ic Society, \"Control and Prevention of Tuberculosis in the UK: Code of Practice 2000\", p. 887 401 1940 and 1950: Logan & Benjamin, \"Tuberculosis Sta tistics for England and Wales 1938-1955: An Analysi s of Trends and Geographical Distribution\", p. 12. 1960-1970: Springett, \"Tuberculosis Epidemiolog y in England and Wales\", p. 422. 2000 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 162 - ages 15-24. This heightened level of female tubercu losis morbidity in 1940 could have been a result of increased female participation in factories as part of the war effort 402 . Also noteworthy is the increase in male notificatio ns between 1940 and 1950 versus the significant decline in female notifications during this period. This could be related to reporting inaccuracies associated with World War Tw o, especially as by 1960, male notification rates had declined to something simila r to the female notification levels. An additional factor which needs to be considered w hen analysing the incidence of tuberculosis in the population is the size of the p opulation, i.e. the notification rate. Figure 5.12: Tuberculosis notifications: number and rate, 1920-2000 1,000) Population (per 1,000) Number of Notifications Notification RATE (per 1,000) Figure 5.12 highlights that there was a decline in the number of notifications between 1920 and 1980, and that between 1980 and 2000 this trend was reversed when notifications increased from 6000 to 6087 (shown by the blue bars and the left-hand side Y axis). The trend for the notification rate (shown by the t urquoise line and the right-hand side Y axis) is slightly more optimistic. When considering the number of notifications in conjunction with the population (shown by the pink bars and the left-hand side Y axis), 402 Bryder, \"Below the Magic Mountain: A Social Histor y of Tuberculosis in Twentieth Century Britain\", p. 111 403 1920 to 1980: Citron et al, \"Tuberculosis Today\", p. 6. 2000: Joint Tuberculosis Committee of the Bri tish Thoracic Society, \"Control and Prevention of Tuberculosis in the UK: Code of Practice 2000\", p. 887 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 163 - there is a decline. This is better illustrated by F igure 5.13, which makes the same considerations as Figure 5.12 for 1980 and 2000, bu t on a magnified scale. Figure 5.13: Tuberculosis notifications: number and rate, 1980-2000 11.8 11.9 11.9 12.0 12.0 12.1 12.1 12.2 Notification Rate (per 1,000) Population (per 1,000) Number of Notifications Notification RATE (per 1,000) Figure 5.13 highlights that, when the increase in t he number of tuberculosis notifications is standardised against the increase in the population there is actually a decline in the tuberculosis notification rate. Although this is no t the most positive story about the incidence of tuberculosis (a universal decline in t he prevalence would be ideal), it still detracts from the pessimism that was associated wit h tuberculosis and its re-emergence at the end of the twentieth century. As a result of this decline in tuberculosis mortali ty and morbidity, the implications of having tuberculosis improved, such that by the end of the twentieth century tuberculosis was not associated with mortality in the way it was at the beginning. This transformation is further highlighted in Table 5.6. 404 1980: Citron et al, \"Tuberculosis Today\", p. 6. 20 00: Joint Tuberculosis Committee of the British Tho racic Society, \"Control and Prevention of Tuberculosis in the UK: Code of Practice 2000\", p. 887 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 164 - Table 5.6: Tuberculosis deaths in relation to tuber culosis notifications, 1920-2000 405 Year Notifications Deaths Deaths: Notifications (%) 1920 60,500 36,504 60 1930 54,000 35,814 66 1940 35,000 27,751 79 1950 42,000 15,953 38 1960 21,000 3,420 16 1970 9,000 1,506 17 1980 6,000 587 10 1990 5,432 378 7 2000 6,087 366 6 Table 5.6 highlights that the severity and fatality of tuberculosis declined considerably during the twentieth century. In 1900 sixty percent of tuberculosis morbidity was resolved in death, versus only six percent in the year 2000. As a result of the improved tuberculosis survival rates the probability of becoming infected with tuberculosis declined significantly. This development has provided contributions to qual ity of life that are equally as significant as the decline in the prevalence of the disease and therefore ought to be noted, particularly because of their tacit nature. I.e. th e counterfactual of 'had the prognosis of tuberculosis not improved, then the prevalence of c ases would have remained higher and increased the virus in the environment which would have heightened the risk of tuberculosis infection in the population' is not qu antified in the thesis methodology and it is therefore necessary to highlight this here quali tatively. 5.3 Government and Non-Government Initiatives towar ds Tuberculosis \"As a fundamental destructive social force tubercul osis was rivalled among illnesses only by venereal disease and insanity at the dawn of the twentieth century\" , and therefore, state intervention had the potential to play a vital role in the control of the spread of tuberculosis 406 . Because of the infectious nature of tuberculosis and the social problems that it threatened, the government faced a greater incentive to intervene in trying to reduce the number of tuberculosis sufferers. 405 Notifications: 1915-1980: Citron et al, \"Tuberculo sis Today\", p. 6. 1990: Watson et al, \"Notification s of Tuberculosis in England and Wales, 1982-1989\", p.

The culmination s of these early movements towards tuberculosis legislation are shown in the Table 5.7 , which provides a brief summary of the twentieth century legislation concerning tuberculos is. The most far reaching legislation in Table 5.7 will be analysed in further detail below. Table 5.7: Government legislation for the control o f tuberculosis Year Government legislation Provisions of governmen t legislation 1907 School Medical Service The Board of Education established the School Medic al Service, which led to the surveillance and detection of tuberculosis in c hildren and promoted the removal of causes of its occurrence 407 . 1908 Public Health (Tuberculosis) Act Regulation for the notification to the medical offi cer of health of sanitary authorities (within 48 hours) of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis occurring amongst the inmates of Poor Law institutions, or am ongst persons under the care of the district medical officers 408 . 1909 Housing and Town Planning Act The building of back-to-back houses was forbidden f or the first time 409 . 1911 Finance Act \u00a31,500,000 was made available for the construction of sanatoria 410 . Additional funds were made available for tuberculosis related research 411 . 1912 Notification of Infectious Diseases Act (1889) All forms of tuberculosis were added to this Act, w hich created the compulsory duty of notification of infectious disease upon the head of the family or the medical practitioner, with a penalty of forty shill ings for default 412 . 1912 Health Insurance Act 1912 This Act provided insurance against ill health and unemployment and applied to the majority of employed persons who received less than a stated remuneration. The Act provided funds for the treatment of tubercu losis and thus stimulated the building of sanatoria 413 . 1916 Tuberculosis (Domiciliary Treatment in England) Order Provided for treatment in the patient's own home an d was designed as a remedy to the shortage of sanatorium beds 414 . 407 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 1 20 408 The National Archives: MH55(521): Compulsory Notif ication of Pulmonary and Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis : Public Health (Tuberculosis) Act 1912 409 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 1 21 410 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 1 24 411 The National Archives: MH 81(44): Tuberculosis Tre atment and Applications by Various Bodies for Funds 193-1914 412 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 1 19 413 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 1 23 414 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 1 27 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 166 - 1921 Public Health (Tuberculosis) Act Gave the minister of health power to make arrangeme nts himself in areas where the county council or county borough council had fa iled to set up a satisfactory scheme of treatment. This Act also authorised counc ils to arrange after-care for tuberculosis sufferers 415 . 1925 Public Health Act Made additional provisions with regard to tuberculo sis, e.g. this Act provided for compulsory segregation of infectious patients, where risk was being caused to others 416 . 1929 Local Government Act Transferred the function of the Poor Law authority to the county council and county borough council. It became the duty of the L ocal Authority to finance the costs of tuberculosis treatment and recover the exp ense of treatment if the patient could not reasonably pay. This demand for p ayment (from tuberculosis patients) was often not made as many local authorit ies thought it to be in the interest of the community to provide treatment with out fee 417 . 1929 Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations Consolidated previous tuberculosis regulations of 1 912, 1921 and 1925. 1936 (1961) Public Health Act Legalised the right to force upon someone treatment / hospitalisation if they appear to have tuberculosis 418 . This Act was re-issued in 1961 for notifiable disease (which includes tuberculosis). 1943 266/T A scheme of special financial help for tuberculosis . This provided for early diagnosis and financial allowances for sufferers (a nd their dependents) who had to give up work in order to take treatment 419 . Also introduced x-rays, and implemented mass miniature radiography, for detecti ng tuberculosis. 1948 National Assistance Act This replaced 266/T (which was a war time measure) and removed tuberculosis sufferers from the Poor Law. Different provisions w ere applied to tuberculosis, such that patients who had to suffer loss of income received additional compensation. 1948 National Health Service Act Responsibility for the entire health service was pl aced on the Minister of Health. Various additional services were provided for tuber culosis, under Section 28 (which served to make arrangements for the purpose of prevention of illness, the care of persons suffering from illness to after-car e) 420 . 1969 Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations Reiterating earlier policy which states that a pers on should be notified as suffering from tuberculosis and provides the defini tion of such a person. 1984 Public Health (Control of Disease) Act Reiterating earlier legislation which states that a ll forms of tuberculosis are compulsorily notifiable. And compulsory admission t o hospitals is only possible where the person has tuberculosis of the respirator y tract. It also re-emphasises that all local authorities should have a written, a greed and integrated policy outlining their policy for tuberculosis control and prevention 421 . Another area of government policy, which was import ant although not as mainstream as the above listed, legislation was policies concerni ng milk. The link between cows and tabes mesenterica and other tuberculosis affections in children had long been assumed and increasing awareness that raw milk was a vehicle of human infection inspired legislation. 415 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 1 28 416 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 1 29 417 Ibid 418 The National Archives: MH55(2281): Removal of Infe ctious Persons to Hospitals under Section 172 of Pu blic Health Act 1936 419 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 8 6 420 The National Archives: MH55(1163): Tuberculosis an d the National Health Service: Report by British Me dical Association: Nov 1950 421 Joint Tuberculosis Committee of the British Thorac ic Society, \"Control and Prevention of Tuberculosis in the UK\", p. 887 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 167 - Table 5.8: Government legislation for the control o f bovine tuberculosis 422 Year Government legislation Provisions of governmen t legislation 1913 and 1938 The Tuberculosis Orders Provided for the slaughter of cows suffering from t uberculosis and paid compensation. (1924) The Milk and Dairies Act 1914 Regulated the production, sale and distribution of milk and prohibited the sale of tuberculosis milk 423 .

Authorised the official grading of milk. 1923 The Milk (Special Designations) Order Provided for the establishment of tuberculin tested herds. 1925 The Tuberculosis Order Made further provisions with regard to tuberculosis in cattle, their inspection and slaughter. 1925 Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations Prohibited the employment of persons suffering from tuberculosis of the respiratory tract in various br anches of the milk trade. 1926 Milk and Dairies Order Consolidated the entire provision of previous Order s under the Milk and Dairies Act. 1936 The Milk (Special Designations) Order For the first time included a pasteurised tuberculi n-tested grade in the list of designated milk. The culmination of these policies enabled Britain's dairy herds to be declared free from the tuberculosis infection by 1960, despite many of the above policies being ineffective due to problems of enforcement and the dominant representation of rural interests 425 . The biggest contribution is likely to have been gen erated from the pasteurisation of milk. This can be illustrated through a comparison of (ab dominal) tuberculosis death rates between different milk consumption environments. No milk was pasteurised until 1924 and less than 15 percent in 1930 426 and nationwide pasteurisation was not evident unti l 1950 427 . However, in larger cities, such as London, a (unkno wn) quantity of milk was flash heated to prevent souring (which can be considered as a si milar, although less effective, form of pasteurisation). In 1938 as much as 98 percent of t he milk consumed in London was effectively (flash heated) pasteurised.

However, if i t is accepted that the greater proportion of abdominal tuberculosis is due to bovi ne type infection, then the above table goes some way in attesting to the benefits of paste urisation. 1900 /barb2right 1925 By 1900 the controversy associated with Koch's anno uncement in April 1882, that tuberculosis was a communicable disease, had mostly subsided and the mainstream opinion had come into alignment with Koch. This was reflected in the government's approach to combating tuberculosis 429 . (Prior to this discovery it was generally thought that tuberculosis was a hereditary disease) 430 . During the early years of the twentieth century government policy was built upon regulations regard ing notification. Under the 1908 Public Health Act, it was the duty o f the medical officer of a Poor Law Institution: \"to within 48 hours of his first recognition of the symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in the case of a poor person who is an inmate of the institution, report to the medical officer of health of the sanitary district\"431 . This approach was enhanced as the twentieth century unfolded. The special methods tha t the government felt necessary culminated in the 1912 Notification of Infectious D iseases Act, when further regulations were made extending the compulsory reporting system to cases occurring among the in- patients or out-patients of hospitals or other simi lar institutions for the treatment of the sick. Notwithstanding the strength of the desires o f the government to control tuberculosis 428 The National Archives: MH96(1920): Treatment of Tu berculosis 1950-1957 429 Smith, \"The Retreat of Tuberculosis 1850-1950\", p. 47 430 Latham & Garland, \"The Conquest of Consumption: An Economic Study\", p. 19 431 The National Compulsory Notifi cation of Pulmonary and Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Public Health (Tuberculosis) Act 1912 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 169 - and the feeling that compulsory notification was an \"indispensable preliminary to its [tuberculosis] effective administration\" , these policies were not overly successful 432 . The success of this legislation was mixed. In certa in towns compulsory notification had been well established and in others the approach wa s haphazard and incomplete. For example, between 1915 and 1918 in England and Wales , 19 percent of deaths certified as resulting from tuberculosis had not been notified a nd 27 percent of tuberculosis deaths had occurred within three months of notification433 . Even after the Ministry of Health tightened its rules in 1921, 87 percent of tuberculosis death s in Barnsley were cases previously un- notified or notified only within six months of deat h 434 . The average duration of life after the commencement of the disease in an individual wa s about five years 435 . Even more damaging to the success of this legislati on was the disregard many practitioners had towards it. Resistance of British physicians to Koch's theory, largely because his findings devalued current therapeutic practices, le d them to settle for passive resistance: some notified without telling the patient and other s only notified if the consumption seemed active 436 . A more optimistic claim regarding government legisl ation towards tuberculosis during the first quarter of the twentieth century would be tha t it provided a foundation for later, more successful legislation. The 1911 Finance Act initiated provisions for the t reatment and cure of tuberculosis. Under Section 16 (2), various organisations were able to apply for research grants, which were underway by 1914 437 . A more far-reaching aspect of the 1911 Finance Act was the funds provided for the extension of tuberculosis treatment (\u00a31,500,000 for the UK and approximately \u00a31,116,000 went to England), which were directed towards provi ding organised expert treatment of tuberculosis in the form of sanatoria, hospital acc ommodation and dispensaries 438 . 432 Ibid 433 Smith, \"The Retreat of Tuberculosis 1850-1950\", p. 69 434 Ibid 435 Latham & Garland, \"The Conquest of Consumption: An Economic Study\", p. 11 436 Bryder, \"Below the Magic Mountain: A Social Histor y of Tuberculosis in Twentieth Century Britain\", p. 41 437 The National Archives: MH 81(44): Tuberculosis Tre atment and Applications by Various Bodies for Funds 1913-1914 438 Ibid Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 170 - The 1912 Health Insurance Act has been coined by ce rtain historians as: \"one of the greatest social measures of the century\" 439 . The crux of its contribution to welfare was the provision of insurance for practically all regularl y employed men (and their dependents) receiving less than a stated remuneration, at the d iscretion of the insurance companies 440 . The original weekly contribution (paid half by the employer and half by the employee) was four pence and a government subsidy increased this to nine pence 441 . Under this Act, the state overtook the responsibilities previously carr ied out (generally sporadically) by charities and organisations, of providing funds for the treatment of tuberculosis, particularly contributions towards sanatorium expen ses. This promoted the treatment of tuberculosis and would have helped to reduce the in fectiousness, which provided a positive contribution towards standards of living, for the s ufferer and population in general. Furthermore, the insurance committee was able to ex tend sanatoria benefit to dependents of any insured person. This Act also provided additional powers to the Min ister of Health to ensure that local authorities had satisfactory tuberculosis treatment and after-care schemes. Hence, for the first time, after-care was included in the treatmen t of tuberculosis 442 . However, this legislation only partially met the demands for afte rcare, which were persistent until the virtual elimination of tuberculosis in the 1960s. 1925 /barb2right 1950 It was not until 1929 that state policies advanced from merely notification to more welfare orientated initiatives although, even by 1950, tube rculosis legislation was by no means comprehensive. The 1929 Local Government Act provided the first de cisive step towards the unification of tuberculosis treatment centres and an improvement i n tuberculosis treatment, particularly for sufferers who were uninsured. The Act moved the treatment of tuberculosis from the jurisdiction of the Poor Law authorities to the loc al authorities and subsequently enabled Poor Law infirmaries to be developed into hospitals , which became better staffed and equipped for the treatment of tuberculosis. 439 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 1 23 440 Ibid 441 Ibid 442 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 1 28 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 171 - This unification in tuberculosis treatment arrived in 1948 under the National Health Service Act, when responsibility for the entire hea lth service was placed upon the Minister of Health and treatment was administered without in surance. Under Section 28 arrangements were legislated for the comprehensive care of tuberculosis sufferers: from prevention to medical care for sufferers, including after-care. The fundamental benefits for tuberculosis sufferers were the improvements in acc ess to treatment for their condition without the financial burden. The policy that emerged out of the government's con cern about an increase in tuberculosis due to war time conditions (associated with World W ar Two) provided a significant contribution to the welfare of tuberculosis suffere rs, with specific legislation to manage tuberculosis patients, and the recognition that the ir illness was a social disease that warranted the provision of funds and compensation f or ceasing work in order to receive treatment. This was provided under the 226/T Act du ring war time and was succeeded by the National Assistance Act in 1948, which eliminat ed the Poor Law and provided sickness benefit for those who contributed to the insurance scheme, which was the majority of the population. The rates which were applicable to pulm onary tuberculosis sufferers (as in the case of the 266/T this was the only form of tubercu losis covered) are shown in Table 5.10. Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 172 - Table 5.10: National Assistance rate, weekly allowa nces, 1948 443 Special scale for \"persons who have suffered a loss of income in order to undergo treatment for respiratory tuberculosis\" 444 . Recipient Weekly allowance s. d. (a) For a husband and wife: Of whom one is such a person 96 0 Of whom both are such persons 110 0 (b) For any other such person, being: Aged 21 years or over 65 0 Aged 18 years or over but less than 21 years 48 6 Aged 16 years or over but less than 18 years 40 0 Aged 11 years or over but less than 16 years 20 0 Aged 5 years or over but less than 11 years 17 0 Aged under 5 years 14 6 Although these rates provided a significant improve ment in provisions for tuberculosis sufferers (they were more than double the rates pro vided under 266/T), many felt that these rates only facilitated a minimum standard of subsis tence, which did not finance the special needs of tuberculosis sufferers, particularly durin g after-care or for those who received treatment at home 445 . In the pre antibiotic era the only way to combat tuberculosis was through a strong immune system (and this was the ra tionale underlying sanatoria treatment), which required a nourishing diet, warm clothing and good living conditions (including adequate fuel supply), and it was felt t hat these elements were not afforded by the National Assistance allowance. E.g. when the tu berculosis sufferer was the breadwinner, it was thought that his family could g et by on only National Assistance payouts for about a year 446 . Therefore government policy during this era was sti ll very much initiated out of desires to prevent the spread of tuberculosis and compared to many other illnesses at the time including the other conditions in the thesis, namel y the rights experienced by sufferers of 443 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 1 39 444 Ibid 445 Ibid 446 Ibid Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 173 - blindness and cancer, tuberculosis sufferers experi enced poor levels of recognition and rights. 1950 /barb2right 2000 During the second half of the twentieth century the only tuberculosis legislation that was passed was regarding the management of the contagio usness of this disease, through strengthening existing notification and segregation policies, under the 1969 Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations and the 1984 Publ ic Health (Control of Disease) Act. And, between 1950 and 1960 there were consideration s about strengthening regulations on immigration policy, although there was never any le gislation passed on this issue 447 . Table 5.11 indicates that, although many immigrants were tested, very few of these were refused entry into England. Table 5.11: London airport tuberculosis in immigran ts: number medically examined, x- rayed and refused entry into England and percentage that were refused entry as a percentage of the number medically examined, 1965 448 Date Number medically examined Number x-rayed Number refused entry into England Percent refused entry into England 12.2.65 - 31.3.65 2,494 165 3 1 % 1.4.65 - 2,547 253 1 0 % 17.5.65 - 11.6.65 1,465 164 5 3 % Therefore, during the second half of the twentieth century and especially the final quarter there was very little activity by the government to improve the standards of living of tuberculosis sufferers and despite the continued ef forts to enforce notification during this period it was still noted \"how much tuberculosis existed in a community at an y one time has never been known since many cases do not come t o the notice of a doctor or having done so fail to be notified\" 449 . Finally, despite the lack of commitment shown by th e government towards improving the standards of living of tuberculosis sufferers, ther e were other areas that made considerable efforts towards a significant boost to the welfare related quality of life of tuberculosis patients, namely, charities, committees, organisati ons and the medical profession. 447 The National Archives: MH 55(2277): Tuberculosis a mong Immigrants 448 The National Archives: MH 148(29): X-rays for Tube rculosis The MH 154(53): Tuberculosis: C Pattern Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 174 - 5.3.2 Non-Government The consideration of the roles of charities, commit tees, societies, medical organisations, etc, is important because they provided an importan t contribution to the quality of life of tuberculosis sufferers and also because they provid e an indication about the shortcomings of the government. 5.3.2.1 Charities The main role of charities was to provide financial aid to help support tuberculosis sufferers and their families, especially during the early years of the twentieth century, when less government help was available. The growth of sanatoria before 1911 was mainly a result of voluntary efforts 450 . These charities, for example, the British Red Cro ss Society and the Chest Clinic Samaritan Funds, provided assi stance for tuberculosis sufferers' treatment and household income 451 . This assistance was evident even after the introd uction of the National Assistance Act in 1948: during this time the focal point of charity initiatives became the augmentation of funds availa ble under this Act. The type of aid provided by charities was not in th e form of a regular allowance provided for the duration of a sufferer's tuberculosis infec tion, as this was beyond the financial capacity of the charities that helped tuberculosis sufferers. Instead, help was usually applied for special, non-recurring needs. Although, there were some forms of charity which were consistent and ongoing, for example, The Women's Voluntary Services (WVS) which, like the Red Cross, covered the whole country and provided a 'meals on wheels' service at a small charge. The WVS also ran depots for second hand clothing, bedding and furniture 452 . Charity services had practical importance for the s ufferer because they provided nursing equipment, food and better living conditions, which were all essential to the restoration of a patient's physical health. Additionally, numerous charities existed to try and help the patient with mental and social problems. E.g. volun tary organisations provided psychiatric help on matrimonial problems and emotional problems brought about by the onset of tuberculosis 453 . 450 Bryder, \"Below the Magic Mountain: A Social Histor y of Tuberculosis in Twentieth Century Britain\", p. 36 451 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 1 09 and 112 452 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 1 13 453 Ibid Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 175 - Despite the contribution of charities there were so me shortcomings, which were largely related to resource allocation. Gerard (1983) among others suggests that resources were not evenly distributed among those who needed them most , whereby the rich and less needy tend to receive more than their fair share 454 . Additional resource allocation problems may have been generated by the number of small tubercul osis charities, whereby greater cooperation and coordination could have generated e conomies of scale benefits and possibly more impact when campaigning for improved government commitment to helping tuberculosis sufferers. 5.3.2.2 Committees and Associations Committees (both governmental and charitable) playe d an important (largely indirect) role in boosting the welfare of tuberculosis sufferers. The Joint Tuberculosis Council and medical associat ions (especially the British Medical Association) served to campaign for improved welfar e treatment of tuberculosis sufferers. For example, the Tuberculosis Council took issue wi th the level of funds payable to patients for undergoing treatment and pushed for in creases. The British Medical Association consistently drew a ttention towards the flaws in the government's approach to tuberculosis treatment. Ev en in 1950, the BMA's National Health Service Report stated that \"the inadequacy of present provision for the diagno sis, treatment and after-care of tuberculosis in this co untry is a national scandal which can no longer be viewed with complacency\" 455 . During the 1960s the BMA (along with numerous other regional health boards and charitable tubercu losis committees) was also very active in pushing for medical examinations for immigrants upon entering England, in order to help prevent a worsening in the epidemiological sit uation associated with this tuberculosis 456 . In alignment with these observations, which highlig ht the shortcomings of government legislations, the Medical Research Council Committe e on Tuberculosis in War-time (World War Two) pointed out that \"in view of the disturbing increase in tuberculosis and in order to effect its control, it is an urgent nec essity to provide more efficient detection of 454 Gerard, \"Charities in Britain: Conservatism or Cha nge?\", p. 21 455 The National Archives: MH 55(1163): Tuberculosis a nd the National Health Service: Report by British M edical Association: Nov 1950 456 The National Archives: MH 55(2277): Tuberculosis a mong Immigrants Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 176 - cases in order to secure early treatment at an earl y stage and to reduce the prevalent source of infection\" 457 . These types of claims were also voiced by the Nat ional Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis. This organisati on was founded in 1891 and throughout the twentieth century, consistently propagated the most prominent issues facing tuberculosis sufferers. There were also organisations that consistently mon itored the progress of contemporary tuberculosis issues. Most noteworthy was the Tuberc ulosis Advisory Committee, who focused much attention towards the re-housing of tu berculosis sufferers, and more precisely, the consistent shortages (during the lat e 1950s) 458 . Additionally, the Joint Tuberculosis Council also considered tangential con cerns, e.g. the nutrition and treatment of tuberculosis sufferers 459 . A further contribution to quality of life of tuberc ulosis sufferers that these committees and organisations provided was through increasing commu nity awareness about tuberculosis, which may have in turn perpetuated charitable work. Hence, non-government organisations were important in helping to improve the standards of living of tuberculosis sufferers and had it not been for the lack of government pursuance in implementing their suggestions, their contributi on could have been much more far- reaching. However, improvements in the quality of l ife associated with tuberculosis did not really originate with the work and policies of char ities and government legislation, instead these improvements were primarily yielded from medi cal developments. Moreover, it could be argued that tuberculosis charity had a new demand at the end of the twentieth century (manifest in the unconventional tuberculosi s charity needs of infected AIDS sufferers, poor immigrants and homeless who were la rgely responsible for the resurgence of tuberculosis in England), and that charities wer e slow to adapt to this challenge. 5.4 Medical Developments The twentieth century technological developments th at were important for tuberculosis sufferers were those that were experienced in antib iotics, vaccination, radiography and environmental factors. The degree to which the last two facets contributed has been 457 The National Archives: MH 55(1141): Medical Resear ch Council: Tuberculosis in War 458 National Archives: MH 55(2280): Priority Housi ng and Re-Housing for Persons Suffering from Tuberc ulosis: Information Provided by Local Authorities 459 The National Archives: MH 57(429): Clause 5(3): Tu berculosis Allowances Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 177 - debated throughout the twentieth century and the mo st profound elements of this debate will be considered here. 5.4.1 Antibiotics Certainly one of the most important achievements of modern medicine has been the development of therapy for tuberculosis 460 . On 20 November 1944 an event of tremendous signific ance took place in the treatment of tuberculosis, when streptomycin was first successfu l in curing a patient (who had advanced pulmonary tuberculosis) at the Mayo Clinic in the U SA 461 . The streptomycin strain of streptomyces griseus was isolated in September 1943 and the first public announcement of the antibiotic was made in January 1944 462 . By 1947 streptomycin was being distributed in small quantities in the UK 463 . This discovery marked the beginning of a new era in the combat of tuberculosis as it drastically reduced the epidemiological consequence s of tubercle bacillus. Moreover, within a few years of the streptomycin revolution, the impetus for further developments in the treatment of tuberculosis had yielded positive results. Part of this impetus was a result of the shortcomings of streptomycin. Despite the fa ct that it had provided the biggest single improvement in the prospect and subsequent quality of life associated with tuberculosis, it was not potent enough to combat the entire tubercul osis problem, as the tuberculosis organism showed signs of resistance to the streptom ycin drug as early as the 1950s. Furthermore, high doses of streptomycin, necessary for the treatment of tuberculosis, produced toxic effects. E.g. streptomycin was known to have adverse effects on the hearing and balance nerves. Additionally, although of less significance, but still potentially minimally damaging for quality of life, was the way in which streptomycin was administered (because of poor absorption when given by mouth), which was through a daily intramuscular injection, which caused signifi cant pain and scarring (bruising) on the area of injection (usually the top legs/bottom) 464 . Fortunately, from the perspective of sufferers' qua lity of life, two additional medications were discovered shortly after streptomycin. Para-am ino-salicylic acid (in 1948) and 460 Iseman, \"Evolution of Drug Resistance Tuberculosis : A Tale of Two Species\", p. 2428 461 Ibid 462 Waksman, p. 260 463 Smith, \"The Retreat of Tuberculosis 1850-1950\", p. 246 464 Ross, \"Modern Drug Treatment in Tuberculosis\", p. 10 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 178 - isoniazed (in 1952) provided the necessary partners to streptomycin, such that when patients were treated with therapy combining all th ree antibiotics, not only were they cured of the disease but there was no (initial) emergence of resistance 465 . Despite the significant attributes of these discove ries, when this therapy was first devised, in the early 1950s, its implementation was problema tic, due to the uncertainty with the ideal course of therapy: courses were short (four t o six weeks), dosages were small (partly because supplies were short) and some initial resul ts were ambiguous and some physicians only viewed this chemotherapy as 'supplemental' 466 . A further drawback of this therapy regime is the continued side effects. Most notewort hy is the potential for hepatitis from the isoniazed component 467 . With the introduction and mainstream utilisation of tuberculosis combined therapy, the development of drug resistance and failure of cure became very rare 468 . This achievement was enhanced by the relatively cheap, coordinated a nd rapid mainstream utilisation of this therapy. As a result of the National Health Service access to the cure for tuberculosis was facilitated to all tuberculosis sufferers. Furtherm ore, because of the cheap and largely straightforward nature of tuberculosis therapy the scope for problems was reduced and subsequently tuberculosis treatment was largely suc cessful. This was achieved very soon after the initial introduction of a tuberculosis th erapy regime, by the late 1950s there was very little evidence of drug cost, administration o r availability issues 469 . This success can be measured in the surplus of hospital beds that wa s evident by 1955 and the closure of many former tuberculosis treatment centres 470 . Although drug treatment still required hospitalisation the treatment time had been signifi cantly reduced 471 . The only exception to the above success story was s alvage therapy which was considerably more expensive than standard therapy. Salvage thera py was necessary for the exceptional cases of standard drug resistance and was over 10 t imes more expensive than the standard, albeit available if needed 472 . 465 Ibid 466 Smith, \"The Retreat of Tuberculosis 1850-1950\", p. 247 467 Ibid 468 Ross, \"Modern Drug Treatment in Tuberculosis\", p. 20 469 Ibid 470 Bryder, \"Below the Magic Mountain: A Social Histor y of Tuberculosis in Twentieth Century Britain\", p. 262 471 Ibid 472 Ross, \"Modern Drug Treatment in Tuberculosis\", p. 37 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 179 - One of the most far-reaching benefits of these anti biotic inventions is the reduction in the contagiousness of tuberculosis that they created. T his meant that the prevalence of tuberculosis declined markedly during the second ha lf of the twentieth century. On an aggregate level this has meant that the threat of t uberculosis was no longer something that triggers anxiety and pandemonium, as it had at the beginning of the twentieth century. In the pre-antibiotic era the contraction of the tuber culosis disease almost certainly meant hardship, suffrage (physically, mentally and often economically) and often death. After the mainstream implementation of chemotherapy tuberculo sis no longer had such severe implications. Instead of years of isolation in a tr eatment centre (usually a chest clinic or sanatoria) and potentially radical resolution, for example, surgery which was rarely successful, a sufferer would now undergo a course o f therapy which had a much shorter duration (average treatment time was reduced from 2 4 to 6 months 473 ) and was almost certain to have a successful resolution. Hence, \"before the introduction of chemotherapy in the treatment of tuberculosis, treatment spread ove r long periods, patients were kept in sanatoria beds, allowed to do very little for thems elves and ceased to be productive members of the community, sometimes for years; furt hermore, although they were able to return to work and a full life few of them could be said to have been cured from the disease which was to dominate the rest of their lives\" 474 . Hence, these antibiotic developments provided a sub stantial contribution to the improved quality of life associated with tuberculosis, large ly because they substantially reduced the contagiousness and virtually eliminated tuberculosi s mortality. An indication of this feat is shown in the table below. Table 5.12: Percentage reductions in tuberculosis m ortality and morbidity, 1950-1970 and 1950-2000 475 Mortality (Tuberculosis Deaths) Morbidity (Tuberculosis Notifications) 1950 - 1970 1950 - 2000 1950 - 1970 1950 - 2000 90 98 79 86 473 Iseman, \"Evolution of Drug Resistance Tuberculosis : A Tale of Two Species\", p. 2429 474 The National Archives: MH 154(53): Tuberculosis: C hanging Epidemiological Pattern 475 Mortality: from: Office of National S tatistics, \"Twentieth Century Mortality: 100 Years of Mortality Data in England and Wales by Age, Sex, Year and Underlying Cause\".

BCG was not administered widely in England until th e 1950s, after which the incidence of tuberculosis had fallen sharply with the advent of streptomycin. Despite the vaccination being discovered thirty years earlier plus the nece ssary proof of its efficacy, the scepticism among British medical practitioners retarded introd uction of the BCG. The BCG was first tested on humans in 1921 and had been demonstrated to protect about 80 percent of the population at risk (under early clinical trial cond itions), but British doctors dismissed the information and blocked lay attempts to act on it 477 . The mainstream utilisation of the BCG vaccine was also frustrated by problems in testing of the vaccine and errors in accurate dosages. For example, during early testing of the v accine in 1930 in Lubeck the vaccine was administered to 200 children of which 54 died a nd many survivors developed tuberculosis 478 . Although it was later proved that this was an err or with vaccine administration rather than the vaccine per se, this incident was a great setback in the use of BCG 479 . The culmination of these issues meant that agreemen t on the use of the BCG vaccine was not achieved in Britain until 1949 in Britain 480 . And initially, the vaccine was only administered to those at especial risk of developin g tuberculosis (i.e. through known contact with a case). It was not until 1953 that BC G was recommended for all school children by the Ministry of Health 481 . 476 Citron et al, \"Tuberculosis Today\", p. 4 477 Smith, \"The Retreat of Tuberculosis 1850-1950\", p. 194 478 Ibid 479 Ibid 480 Bryder, \"Below the Magic Mountain: A Social Histor y of Tuberculosis in Twentieth Century Britain\", p. 244 481 Citron et al, \"Tuberculosis Today\", p. 4 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 181 - Despite the above problems regarding the introducti on of the BCG, by the 1970s it had provided a great boost in the prevention of tubercu losis in England. Evidence suggested that by the 1970s the BCG was providing a protectio n level of about 75 percent 482 . Moreover, the vaccine was thought to be so effectiv e as to have eliminated tuberculosis (in conjunction with the above developments), that ther e were some who thought the school BCG programme should be stopped as a result of a fa lling incidence of tuberculosis in the UK, during the 1970s 483 . This marks a stark contrast with the situation tw enty years earlier when it was claimed, by the government, that \"there is no scientific evidence of its [BCG vaccination] true value\" 484 . 5.4.3 Radiography A final area of improved medical technology, which was able to provide a positive contribution to the quality of life associated with tuberculosis, was radiography. Although this invention provided a significantly lower contr ibution than the other components of this chapter, the aid radiography provided in the detect ion of tuberculosis ought to be noted. Mass Miniature Radiography was introduced in 1943, under the recommendations of the Medical Research Council established by the Ministe r of Health 485 . Since its introduction mass miniature radiography made great strides in th e examination of large groups of apparently healthy individuals 486 . As a result, mass miniature radiography, was able to detect cases of tuberculosis by chance, i.e. those cases which had revealed no obvious symptoms. By the mass radiography schemes introduce d in the 1940s an active case rate of 1 per 1,000 was discovered among those previously u nsuspected of having tuberculosis 487 . It should be noted that the key contribution here w ould be related to the prevention of further cases being created. Owing to war time limitations on the production of the requisite apparatus and to the availability of manpower, it was only possible to p rovide these mass radiography units gradually in selected areas in the country. However , by the end of 1953 there were about 70 units in operation, more than double the number when the NHS was introduced, and 482 Bannon, \"BCG and Tuberculosis\", p. 80 483 Ibid 484 The National Archives: MH 55(993): Ministry of Hea lth Report: Tuberculosis in England and Wales 1949 485 Coltart et al, \"Social Work in Tuberculosis\", p. 8 6 486 Medical Research Council, \"Mass Miniature Radiogra phy of Civilians for the Detection of Pulmonary Tub erculosis\" p. 1 487 Bryder, \"Below the Magic Mountain: A Social Histor y of Tuberculosis in Twentieth Century Britain\", p. 5 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 182 - examined about two million people a year, particula rly those in industrial employment 488 . Since the 1950s the use of radiography has been use d as a means of effectively diagnosing tuberculosis. 5.4.4 Environmental Factors There is evidence that environmental factors played some role in the decline in tuberculosis, which began in the mid nineteenth cen tury before the provision of any kind of medical advances and in conjunction with significan t improvements in public health reforms which provided cleaner water, more effectiv e waste disposal, safer food handling and improved housing conditions 489 . Hence, there does seem to be strong evidence for environmental factors playing a role in the early d eclines in the tuberculosis death rate, which fell from about 22.3 per 1,000 in 1840 to 10. 6 per 1,000 in 1960, before the mainstream utilisation of antibiotics 490 . When considering environmental factors and their re lation to tuberculosis it is possible to dichotomise these features into two broad categorie s: environmental developments that reduce exposure to tuberculosis and those which inc rease resistance to tuberculosis. It should be noted that there is strong evidence of in teraction between these two broad explanations. The most popular environmental explanation relates a story about the decline in tuberculosis being related to a reduction in the ef fective contact between individuals, which is related to many factors associated with im proved standards of housing. The most obvious feature here is the reduction in domestic c rowding, as the average household size decreased, from at least five individuals per house hold in 1901 to 2.5 by 1991 491 . I.e. as the population moved away from excessive overcrowding t he mortality from tuberculosis diminished 492 . Overcrowding in housing as well as within houses was also important: in districts where all the houses were built in a back -to-back formation the death rate from pulmonary tuberculosis was 5.2 per 1,000 versus 2.8 per 1,000 in districts void of back-to- back housing 493 . 488 Ibid 489 Smith, \"The Retreat of Tuberculosis 1850-1950\", p. 2 490 Ibid 491 Ibid 492 Ibid 493 Smith, \"The Retreat of Tuberculosis 1850-1950\", p. 2 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 183 - Following on from this, the importance of general l iving conditions in determining the transmission of tuberculosis has also been studied, where the following relationship was identified: the prevalence of tuberculin sensitivit y among contacts was inversely proportional to the standards of housing 494 . Improved ventilation in housing and work environments is also thought to have helped reduce the risk of the aerosol transfer of tuberculosis 495 . In all aspects of tuberculosis it is thought that t he wealthier faired better, both before and after the introduction of chemotherapy in the 1950s . This provides one of the strongest indications that better nutrition, superior housing with less crowding and better ventilation, the ability to afford warm clothing and the necessa ry fuel were important in the reduction of tuberculosis. A final environmental facet which played a role in the early declines in tuberculosis, although to a lesser extent than the features analy sed above, is the awareness of tuberculosis and understanding about how to abate t uberculosis. For example \"a potent reason for why so many cases of consumption escape detection at the early stage among working class is the fact that working classes have not yet been educated to the point of grasping the importance of an early diagnosis\" 496 . The table below considers the effectiveness of envi ronmental factors versus medical intervention in the elimination of tuberculosis in the twentieth century. This simple comparison considers the decline in tuberculosis in the pre and post antibiotic era. I.e. any decline in tuberculosis pre 1950 can be generally r egarded as a result of environmental factors. Conversely, any reduction in tuberculosis morbidity and mortality post 1950 can be considered as a primary result of medical interv ention. 494 Ibid 495 Ibid 496 Latham & Garland, Conquest of Consumption: An Economic Study\", p. 35 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 184 - Table 5.13: Percentage reductions in tuberculosis m ortality and morbidity attributable to environmental and medical developments, 1900-2000 497 'Environmental' 'Medical intervention' Mortality Morbidity Mortality Morbidity 1900 - 1950 1900 - 1950 1950 - 2000 1950 - 2000 74 40 98 86 Table 5.13 highlights the significant contribution of improved environmental factors to the decline in tuberculosis and the improvement in the quality of life associated with this disease. The decline in mortality and morbidity in the pre 1950 eras can be considered as a result of environmental factors as this was the onl y 'therapy' available. Therefore, the table highlights that both environmental and health devel opments provided valuable contributions to the combat of tuberculosis, even t hough much of the decline in tuberculosis was well under way before the introduc tion of medical developments, although tuberculosis would not have been virtually eliminated without medical developments. 5.5 Lack of Progress Considerations The far-reaching progress in eliminating tuberculos is during the twentieth century began to halt in the 1980s 498 . During the last two decades of the twentieth cent ury tuberculosis recaptured the concerns of public health as a resul t of increases in the prevalence of this disease. Although it should be noted that this is n ot strong enough to have caused an increase in the prevalence rate (see Figure 5.13), this reversal still needs to be contemplated. The most popular reason for the re-emergence of tub erculosis in England is as a consequence of the HIV epidemic. The presence of HI V creates a substantially increased scope for the perpetuation of tuberculosis: an AIDS carrier's immune system is weakened and this helps the tubercle bacilli to survive and spread 499 . This spread is further perpetuated by the living conditions associated wit h many AIDS victims, i.e. deprived housing, poor nutritional conditions and adverse so cial circumstances. Additionally, resistance to tuberculosis therapy is a more pertin ent issue for AIDS sufferers. 497 Mortality: Calculations from: Office of National S tatistics, \"Twentieth Century Mortality: 100 Years of Mortality Data in England and Wales by Age, Sex, Year and Underlying Cause\". Morbidity: 1950: Citron et al, \"Tuberculosis Today\", p. 6. 2000: Joint Tub erculosis Committee of the British Thoracic Society , \"Control and Prevention of Tuberculosis in the UK: Code of Practice 2000\", p. 888 498 Vynnycky & Fine, \"Interpreting the Decline in Tube rculosis: The Role of Secular Trends in Effective C ontact\", p. 334 499 Bannon, \"BCG and Tuberculosis\", p. 80 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 185 - Increased migration and globalisation has also cont ributed to the re-emergence of tuberculosis in populations that have comparatively low levels of tuberculosis. Hence, in developing countries tuberculosis presents a simila r scenario to what was evident in Britain at the beginning of the twentieth century. With inc reased travel and migration the tubercle bacilli are being increasingly introduced back into populations that have achieved a very low prevalence level. In England, at the end of the twentieth century this transmission was most evident within populations from the Indian sub -continent and black Africa. For example, the tuberculosis prevalence rates in these populations, as compared with the indigenous English population were, respectively, 1 21 and 210 times higher 500 . Along a similar vein to the AIDS carriers, these immigrants tend to live in deprived and overcrowded conditions, which perpetuate the spread of tuberculosis. The increase in the number of homeless people has a lso contributed to the re-emergence of tuberculosis. Accurate estimates about the occurren ces of tuberculosis in the homeless, and even the number of homeless people, are difficult t o obtain because of definition and measurement problems and the mobility of this popul ation 501 . However, all available studies point to tuberculosis being a particular pr oblem in this group 502 . The association between tuberculosis and deprivatio n is also evident in the unequal social class distribution of tuberculosis. During the firs t half of the twentieth century, there was a strong relationship between deprivation (social cla ss being the proxy) and tuberculosis mortality, where the poorest social classes experie nced higher tuberculosis mortality. This is shown in Table 5.14. Table 5.14: Standardised mortality ratios for tuber culosis by social class: indexed (all males = 100), males aged 20-64 503 Period Social Class (All males = 100) I II III IV V 1921-23 49 81 95 97 137 1930-32 61 70 100 104 125 1950 64 62 103 95 149 500 Joint Tuberculosis Committee of the British Thorac ic Society, \"Control and Prevention of Tuberculosis in the UK: Code of Practice 2000\", p. 909 501 Ibid 502 Ibid 503 Logan & Benjamin, \"Tuberculosis Statistics for Eng land and Wales 1938-1955: An Analysis of Trends and Geographical Distribution\", p. 22 Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 186 - For all the periods in the above table there is a c onsistent trend between deprivation and mortality, such that the poorer social class experi enced greater tuberculosis mortality. Although this provides further evidence in favour o f the intuitive relationship between deprivation and tuberculosis mortality, it does not provide a causal explanation as it is not capable of indicating which deprivation variables a re fundamental. I.e. is it a story about unfavourable environmental conditions (e.g. poor nu trition) or is it a story about environmental risks (e.g. crowded housing/working c onditions)? Throughout the twentieth century and especially in the pre-antibiotic era there were persistent debates about the most fundamental envir onmental facets associated with tuberculosis mortality. The two contrasting opinion s were those which prioritised nutrition versus those that emphasised overcrowding in the ho me and increasingly industrial workplace. Cobbett (1930) claimed that diet was: \"of the utmost importance\" 504 , versus Collins (1925) who identified high mortality from r espiratory tuberculosis in printers and shoe makers despite low general mortality, both of these industries require men to work under circumstances of poor ventilation and crowdin g 505 . It is clear that both categories of environmental c onditions risks had a strong (positive) association with the tuberculosis infection, and it would seem virtually impossible to disaggregate them further and conclude upon the sin gle most important environmental factor associated with tuberculosis 506 . All of these problems of the re-emergence of tuberc ulosis have been exacerbated by inadequate medical management and ineffective publi c health surveillance programmes. In conjunction with adverse patient meddling with dosa ges by patients, physicians must also accept some of the blame for the re-emergence of tu berculosis through an increase in tubercle bacillus drug resistance 507 . Because of the virtual elimination of tuberculosi s in the years preceding the re-emergence many physicians ha ve become less knowledgeable about treatment and consequently prescribe therapy inappr opriately 508 . These problems are enhanced by inadequate monitoring of tuberculosis. Despite the introduction of the 1984 504 Bryder, \"Below the Magic Mountain: A Social Histor y of Tuberculosis in Twentieth Century Britain\", p. 111 505 Logan & Benjamin, \"Tuberculosis Statistics for Eng land and Wales 1938-1955: An Analysis of Trends and Geographical Distribution\", p. 23 506 Mangtani et al, \"Socioeconomic Deprivation and Not ification Rates for Tuberculosis in London during 1 982-91\", p. 964 507 Ibid 508 Ibid Illnesses: Tuberculosis - 187 - Public Health (Control of Diseases) Act, which reit erated the compulsory notification of tuberculosis, there are still shortcomings in the m onitoring of tuberculosis 509 . This in turn affects control of the disease and compounds the ab ove problems as it provides scope for the continual re-emergence of tuberculosis. 5.6 Summary The above analysis has highlighted that the standar ds of living associated with tuberculosis experienced significant improvements during the twe ntieth century, particularly between 1950 and 1975. Mortality associated with tuberculos is declined almost consistently throughout the twentieth century, with the exceptio n of war time increases and a marginal re-emergence in the last part of the twentieth cent ury. Although this re-emergence in prevalence detracts from the widespread improvement s it was still a very minimal setback, especially compared with the twentieth century in i ts entirety. The culmination of the developments documented in t his chapter, especially those in medicine, meant that the quality of life associated with tuberculosis had improved considerably during the twentieth century as it adv anced from 'poor' levels in 1900, which were associated with significant distress, hardship and usually death to 'good' levels by 2000, when tuberculosis was no longer a significant threat to the population, despite the marginal re-emergence in the 1990s. 509 Joint Tuberculosis Committee of the British Thorac ic Society, \"Control and Prevention of Tuberculosis in the UK: Code of Practice 2000\", p. 889 Illnesses: Cancer - 188 - 6.

This scenario had dramatic implications for the h ealth and welfare related quality of life of the population, which became inc reasingly evident as the twentieth century unfolded. Cancer is an extremely complex disease, which even by 2000 was only partially understood. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that there is no such thing as cancer per se. I.e. there is no single homogeneous disease and therefore no singular cure or preventative measure to remedy the health burden of cancer. Instead, each cancer (of which there are more than 200 different types) shou ld be considered as a different disease with a different aetiology, pathogenesis and progno sis 511 . Two of these cancers will be considered here: breast cancer and stomach cancer, both featured in the top ten most common cancers during the twentieth century. Breast cancer was one of the most heavily researched cancers during the twentieth century and will therefore be more thoroughly detailed than stomach cancer in many parts of this chapter. Throughout the twentieth century breast cancer was one of the most common cancers for women. At the end of the twentieth century (1999) o ne in four female cancers was located in the breast, with around 34,000 new cases diagnos ed per annum in England 512 . This cancer develops in the milk-producing glands in the breast, or in the passages or ducts that deliver milk to the nipples. Breast cancer can also occur in men, but this is extremely rare. 510 Cancer Research UK, (2003). \"Breast Cancer - Summa ry\". Retrieved 21 ccancers/breastcancer 511 Ibid 512 Ibid Illnesses: Cancer - 189 - Stomach cancer is another common form of the diseas e, which is especially prevalent in males (who are two times more likely to develop sto mach cancer than their female counterparts) 513 . Stomach cancer (also known as gastric cancer) is caused when cells on the inner lining of the stomach become abnormal and sta rt to divide uncontrollably, which ultimately causes a tumour. As well as the merits of considering these two dise ases independently, they also provide valuable complements in comparison. During the twen tieth century there were continual innovations in the identification, treatment and pr ognosis related to breast cancer, which was not evident for stomach cancer. This scenario p rovides a contrast about the extent and value of technological developments that have impac ted positively upon the health related quality of life of the population with breast cance r, versus those individuals suffering from stomach cancer, who did not enjoy the same improvem ents. This chapter will begin with an analysis of the exi sting data for breast and stomach cancer. This will comprise an investigation into the preval ence and survival rates during different eras of the twentieth century. The following section will improve the readers unde rstanding of breast and stomach cancer with an outline of the aetiology and pathogenesis o f breast and stomach cancer and the fundamental differences between these cancers will also be explained. After this has been achieved the thesis will provid e the twentieth century chronology that details the efforts made by government, charities a nd other bodies, in the fight to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer and evaluate how these ef forts impacted upon quality of life for cancer sufferers. Following on from this, the healt h history will be considered in order to evaluate the impact of medical improvements upon qu ality of life for breast and stomach cancer sufferers. Finally, the thesis will consider why the previousl y identified improvements have not been more marked. This will be achieved through identify ing reasons for the lack of progress in increasing the quality of life for breast and stoma ch cancer sufferers. 513 Health A-Z, (2002). Retrieved 1 October 2002, from : www.healthatoz.com Illnesses: Cancer - 190 - 6.1 Cancer Data Efforts to measure cancer exist in a variety of for ms and completeness throughout the twentieth century. Cancer registration began under the aegis of the Radium Commission in the 1920s 514 . Subsequent considerations about cancer and the e ffect that it was having upon the population appeared in the 1939 Cancer Act . Although a reporting system was not actually called for under this Act, the Ministr y of Health specified that \"clinical records relating to each patient should be kept so as to show clearly and accurately the history of the case\" 515 . By 1946 a national system of records for all canc er patients was instituted 516 . The collection and processing of these cancer sta tistics became the responsibility of the General Register Office (and its successor, the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys) when the National Health Serv ice was introduced in 1948. During the majority of the twentieth century the mo st common method for evaluating the incidence of cancer was by referencing mortality st atistics. This tendency in conjunction with the voluntary nature of reporting (evident bef ore 1971) contributed to the erroneously low level of cases registered in comparison with th e estimated total experiences 517 . For example, in 1946 5,311 individuals were registered with breast cancer and approximately 7,891 died from breast cancer and 1,684 individuals were registered with stomach cancer compared to approximately 14,171 who died from this disease 518 . Progress towards a full national registration of ca ncer scheme was slow. This is highlighted by the formation of the Cancer Registration Working Party in 1963 (with a membership of officials from the Ministry of Health and General R egister Office together with regional representation) to consider the organisation techni ques of regional cancer registries and to make recommendation for their improvement 519 . By the end of 1970 the Advisory Committee on Cancer Registration had devised a simplified scheme for the collection of cancer data , with an aim of 100 percent registration of all the patients seen at or admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of cancer, and also to define, as far as possible cases of cancer never ap parently seen in hospital, i.e. cases treated 514 Swerdlow, Silva, Doll, \"Cancer Incidence and Morta lity in England and Wales: Trends and Risk Factors\" , p. 2 515 The National Archives: MH 160 (644) : Cancer Regis tration: Advisory Committee Reports 516 The National Archives: MH 160 (71): Conference on Cancer Registration and Subsequent Working Party 517 The National Archives: MH 160 (644): Cancer Regist ration: Advisory Committee Reports 518 Death Rates from cancer: Parliamentary Papers, \"Ca ncer Statistics for England and Wales 1901-1955\" : the number is approximated by dividing the 1946-1950 figure by five.

This initiative was introduced in 1971 and coined the Na tional Cancer Registration Scheme, which provided annual information about the inciden ce and survival of each cancer and other cancer related statistics. The survival rate is facilitated by the one, five and ten year follow up of patients, which is conducted by the Re gional Cancer Registries to provide notification either of either death or survival 521 . The registration of cancer deaths also suffers from various shortcomings, despite complying with the WHO format regulations since 192 7 522 . Death data suffer more from bias and therefore criticism as death is not always correctly certified or the underlying cause correctly coded 523 . Many studies have shown wide variability in certi fication and coding. However the largest problem is not of major consequence here, as the effects are probably only a few percent or less 524 . For example, the percentage of mortality coded to ill defined conditions decreased from 2 percent in 1950 to 0.4 in 1980, but then increased to 0.9 in 1990 525 . Despite the undesirability of these inaccuracies associated with cancer mortality data, they are not of a great enough magn itude to bias the findings of the chapter, which marks a contrast with the morbidity (or incid ence) data for the early decades of the twentieth century, which significantly underestimat es the number of cancer sufferers. Neither mortality nor (and especially) incidence ra tes are ideal measures. Both will be used here as there is no better alternative and these in dices are still very indicative, particularly when used in tandem. The advantages and drawbacks o f this data are summarised in Table 6.1. 520 The National Archives: MH \"Cancer Regi Devis, \"Mortality Trends by Cause of Deat h in England and Wales 1980-94: The Impact of Intro ducing Automated Cause Coding and Related Changes in 1993\", p. 29 523 Coleman, \"Trends in Breast Cancer Incidence, Survi val and Mortality in England and Wales\", p. 590 524 Swerdlow, \"Cancer Registration in England and Wale s: Some Aspects Relevant to the Interpretation of t he Data\", p. 159 525 Ibid Illnesses: Cancer - 192 - Table 6.1: Advantages and disadvantages of incidenc e and mortality data for considering cancer Incidence Mortality Advantages: Advantages: High quality coding Virtually 100% complete Cancer site and histology Timely Low proportion of site unspecified Very long time series Incidence date known Disadvantages: Disadvantages: May not be complete Diagnostic accuracy less certain than for incidence May not be sufficiently timely Site only, no histology Evidence of under-ascertainment into the early 1970s Around 10% unspecified Deaths in any one year result from cases diagnosed over a long previous period As a result of these aforementioned weaknesses, the twentieth century analysis of cancer data has to be considered in conjunction with the f ollowing caveats. 1. Death rates will be considered in conjunction with incidence rates (although not interchangeably). This is necessary because of the varying formats of cancer data over the twentieth century, whereby the first fifty year s consider death rates and the last thirty years of the twentieth century consider the number of registered cancer sufferers. Therefore the terms 'incidence' and 'prevalence' wi ll be used loosely, so as to describe both forms of measurement. 2. Trends will be considered in favour of explicit num bers, due to the unreliability of twentieth century (especially pre 1970) cancer data . 3. When considering the survival rate it is necessary to be aware of inaccuracies related to 'loss of follow up' problems, which arise when canc er registries are unable to trace an individual who will then not be recorded as dead fr om cancer, when in fact they might be. Although this problem largely subsided by the e nd of the twentieth century (due to improved registration), it is still necessary to be aware of this distorting factor when considering survival rates. During the first fifty years of the twentieth centu ry there were significant increases in the number of breast and stomach cancer deaths. During the second half of the century mortality rates for stomach cancer experienced subs tantial declines. The increase in deaths Illnesses: Cancer - 193 - from breast cancer was generally constant between 1 900 and 2000, with the exception of a decline in the increase around the time of World Wa r Two (which might be more a product of registration problems than a genuine improvement ) and a genuine decline in breast cancer mortality during the last decade of the twen tieth century. Figure 6.1: Breast and stomach cancer mortality rat e, 1911-1997 526 Breast and Stomach Cancer Mortality Rate 1911-1997 00.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 Rate (per 1,000) Breast Cancer (F) Stomach Cancer (M) Stomach Cancer (F) Figure 6.1 shows that, in 1911 the burden of breast and stomach cancer was relatively equal. The increase in male stomach cancer deaths b etween 1911 and 1955 was more pronounced than for breast cancer and female stomac h cancer, respectively. The aggregate number of stomach cancer deaths was greater than br east cancer deaths. This trend was not maintained during the second half of the twentieth century, when mortality from breast and stomach cancer diverged, with an increase in breast cancer mortality, such that by the close of the twentieth century the burden of breast cance r mortality was more prominent than (aggregate) stomach cancer. These mortality trends are similar to the incidence rates for breast and stomach cancer during the final quarter of the twentieth century. This is shown in the graph below. Between 1972 and 2000 there was a decline in the bu rden of stomach cancer accompanied by a significant increase in the incidence of breas t cancer. Between 1984 and 1992 this increase in breast cancer prevalence was likely to be a result of improved screening, which 526 1911-1955: \"Cancer Statistics for England and Wale s 1901-1955. 1960-1997: Swerdlow, Silva, Doll, \"Can cer Incidence and Mortality in England and Wales: Trends and Risk Factors\", p. 221, 240 Illnesses: Cancer - 194 - became increasingly evident from 1988 onwards, and also more comprehensive registration, which was increasingly achieved throu ghout the period in the graph below. Figure 6.2: Rates of newly registered cases of brea st and stomach cancer (per 100,000), 1972-2000 527 Rates of Newly Registered Cases of Breast and Stoma ch Cancer 1972-2000 (per 100,000) 020 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 199 6 1998 2000 Year Newly Registered Cases (per 100,000) Breast Cancer (F) Stomach Cancer (M) Stomach Cancer (F) Figure 6.1 and 6.2 show that the incidence and mort ality rate of stomach cancer experienced much greater improvements than breast c ancer, especially if the relationship is considered for the twentieth century as a whole, wh en stomach cancer was more prevalent than breast cancer for the first half but as a resu lt of increases in the incidence and mortality rate of breast cancer and a decline in st omach cancer, the opposite was true by 2000. In order to comprehensively determine the trends in the burden of these two diseases it is necessary to consider two additional factors: the a ge distribution and the survival rate. 527 Office of National Statistics, \"Cancer Trends in E ngland and Wales\" Illnesses: Cancer - 195 - Figure 6.3: Number of breast cancer deaths by age 1 911-1955 528 Number of Breast Cancer Deaths by Age 1911-1955 01000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 0- of bre ast cancer by age, 1971-1998 529 Number of Newly Registered Cases of Breast Cancer b y Age 1971-1998 0500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 0- 1- 5- Age Group No of Registered BC Cases 1971 1974 1984 1988 1992 1996 1998 Figures 6.3 and 6.4 highlight that, in conjunction with an increase in the incidence of breast cancer there has also been an increase in the avera ge age of incidence of this disease. The peak age of incidence of breast cancer deaths incre ased from 55-60 years of age in 1911 to 65-70 in 1955. However, this trend was reversed, so that the age declined between 1992 and 1998, which is likely to be most indicative of more comprehensive screening, such that 528 Parliamentary Papers, \"Cancer Statistics for Engl and and Wales 1901-1955\" 529 Office of National Statistics, \"Cancer Trends in E ngland and Wales\" Illnesses: Cancer - 196 - women of younger ages were being tested for breast cancer, and identified as positive for this disease at an earlier stage than would have be en the case in earlier time periods. Breast cancer deaths and registrations have experienced an increase in the number of individuals at the oldest ages (85+). This is not the only age group for which there has been an increase but it highlights the only consistent trends over t he twentieth century. The incidence of stomach cancer over the twentieth century shows many similar trends and also a more complementary picture with regards to t he burden of this disease upon quality of life. Figure 6.5: Number of stomach cancer deaths by age, 1911-1955 530 Number of Stomach Cancer Deaths by Age 1911-1955 02000 4000 6000 8000 highlights the increase in the burden of stomach cancer at the oldest ages in conjunction with a decline at younger and middle ag es. If the increase in the incidence of stomach cancer at the oldest ages is seen in relati ve terms then it becomes particularly pronounced compared to the increase for other ages. For example, between 1911 and 1955 there was more than a twenty fold increase in the n umber of stomach cancer deaths at ages 85+, compared to the next largest increase, which w as about three fold for age 70. This change represents an improvement in the quality of life burden of stomach cancer as there were fewer healthy life years lost to this disease, which was also evident for breast cancer, although to a lesser extent. 530 Parliamentary Papers, \"Cancer Statistics for Engl and and Wales 1901-1955\" Illnesses: Cancer - 197 - Figure 6.6 shows that between 1996 and 1999 there w as an important decline in the number of registered cases of stomach cancer for al l ages, including (although to a lesser extent) the oldest ages. In conjunction with the fa ll in the burden of stomach cancer there was also a continual increase in the peak age of in cidence.

This is especially true for stomach cancer. One of the most indicative measures of the burden o f these diseases is the survival rate, which identifies the proportion of individuals surv iving cancer within a particular time span, usually one, five or ten years. The proportio n of cancer patients who survive five years has become the most widely reported figure fo r cancer survival. Therefore, this provides the best insight into the effects of cance r upon quality of life and life expectancy for sufferers of this disease, when considered in c onjunction with incidence and mortality measures 532 . The graphs below provide information about the ch anges in the one and five year survival rate (1Y SR and 5Y SR) for breast and stomach cancer (BC and SC) during the second half of the twentieth century, the only times at which this data exists. 531 Office of National Statistics, \"Cancer Trends in E ngland and Wales\" 532 Enstrom & Austin \"Interpreting Cancer Survival Rat es\", claim that survival rates cannot be used as a sole or primary measure of progress in cancer contr ol because factors unrelated to the efficacy of treatm ent play an important role in the determination of those rates and their trends. Illnesses: Cancer - 198 - Figure 6.7: One and five year survival rate from br east cancer, 1945-2001 533 One and Five Year Survival Rates from Breast Cancer 1945-2001 010 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1945/6 1966-71 1971-75 1976-80 BC 1YSR Figure 6.8: One and five year survival rate from st omach cancer, 1945-2001 534 One and Five Year Survival Rates from Stomach Cance r 1945-2001 0510 1YSR Figures 6.7 and 6.8 illustrate that the prognosis f or breast and stomach cancer improved between 1945 and 1990, particularly during the fina l years of this period. This is especially pronounced for the five year survival rate for stom ach cancer. Between 1945/6 and 1986- 1990 there was a 100 percent improvement in the per centage of stomach cancer sufferers surviving longer than five years, albeit at very lo w levels (from 5 to 10 percent of the total 533 1945/6: Parliamentary Papers, \"Cancer Registration in England and Wales\".. 1966-1971: Office of Natio nal Statistics, \"Cancer Trends in England and Wales 1971\".1971-1990: Coleman, \"Cancer Survival Trends in England and Wales, 1971-1995: D eprivation and NHS Region\". All of these rates are in crude terms, as this was the only available measure for pre 1971 periods and the need to make considerations about the survival rate comparable between 1945 and 1990. 199 8-2000: National Statistics Online (2005), \"Cancer Survival: Rates Improved during 1996-2001\". Retrieved 24 November 2005, from: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget_print.asp?I D=861 534 Ibid Illnesses: Cancer - 199 - number diagnosed with stomach cancer). Breast cance r survival prospects also experienced improvements but of a lesser magnitude. These survival rates highlight the different burden of these two diseases. For those who were diagnosed in 1998-2001 with stomach cancer the re was less than a 15 percent chance of survival beyond five years compared to the more favourable 80 percent chance of survival from breast cancer. The contrast in the br east and stomach cancer one year survival rates is even more pronounced. The relationship between the one and five year surv ival rate also has important implications for quality of life. There is a very s mall margin between the one and five year survival rates for stomach cancer, which implies th at many of those who are diagnosed with this disease do not survive beyond one year. T his margin is much larger for breast cancer, which provides an additional advantage in t he prognosis of this disease. I.e. many people with breast cancer will survive for longer t han a year, which is not the case for stomach cancer. The above analysis has highlighted that the prevale nce of breast cancer has increased considerably over the twentieth century, while it h as declined for stomach cancer. The age distribution of these diseases shows a general tren d of increasing average age and an increase in the burden of these diseases at older a ges, which in many cases can be regarded as an improvement in the burden of these diseases w ith respect to quality of life. Survival probabilities from these two cancers had improved o ver the second half of the twentieth century, although still remained bleak, particularl y for stomach cancer. 6.2 Definition of Breast Cancer and Stomach Cancer The human body is made up of individual units calle d cells. Cells make up the tissues and organs, such as the heart or lungs. All cells divid e to produce more cells when the body needs them, for example, when an individual is grow ing. However, sometimes cells can divide when they are not supposed to, as a result o f the cells receiving the wrong signals or if there is a mistake in the DNA 535 . If cells engage in this division and the growth o f cells gets out of control then they will form a mass of c ells, which is a tumour. There are two types of tumours: those that are harmless (benign) and those that are cancerous. Malignant 535 DNA contains the set of instructions for all cells . Illnesses: Cancer - 200 - tumours can also spread and damage other tissue, th is is known as an infiltrating or invasive carcinoma or metastasis 536 . Since the 1920s, when the staging system was introd uced 537 , malignant tumours are classified according to the tumour size and extent of metastasis in order to determine the extent of the cancer 538 . Most frequently, cancers are grouped into four st ages 539 . Stage I cancers are small, localised cancers that are usual ly curable, while stage IV usually represents inoperable or metastatic cancer. Stages II and III cancers are usually locally advanced. The precise definition of these stages is different for each cancer. In addition, it is important to realise that the prognosis for a gi ven stage also depends on the type of cancer, such that a stage II stomach cancer has a d ifferent prognosis from a stage II breast cancer 540 . For example, if breast cancer is detected when st ill confined to the breast (stage II) the cure rate is over 95 percent 541 . This is a far better prognosis than stage II stom ach cancer. The tables below provide a brief definition of the stages prescribed for breast and stomach cancer. Table 6.2: Breast cancer diagnostic stages 542 Stage Description I Early stage: tumour is less than 2cm wide and has not spread outside the breast. II Tumour is small (2-5cm wide) or has spread to ax illary (armpit) lymph nodes, or both. III Tumour is larger than 5cm wide and has usually spread to axillary lymph nodes and may have spread to the chest or overlying skin. IV Tumour of any size, usually affecting lymph node s, has spread to other parts of the body such as bones, lungs, or liver (seconda ry/ metastasic tumours). 536 Paragraph developed from AstraZeneca Patient Education on Breast Cancer\". ieved November 2003, from: in Oncology\", p. 87 538 Metastasis refers to the spread of cancer into oth er parts of the body. 539 Cancers are also often defined by the extent of th eir lymph node involvement (N0-N2) and metastasis ( Mo or M1) but this amount of detail is not necessary for the purposes of the thesis. 540 AstraZeneca (2003). \"Course Notes: Patient Educati on on Breast Cancer\".

II Tumour has grown into the muscle layer of the st omach wall. III Tumour has broken through the membrane covering the outside of the stomach. IV Tumour has grown into other organs or body struc tures nearby such as the liver or abdominal wall. 6.3 Risk Factors for Breast and Stomach Cancer Although the precise causes of breast and stomach c ancer have not been identified, several potential factors have led to increased numbers of individuals developing the disease and therefore significant risk has been associated. Gender: Both breast and stomach cancers are associa ted with this factor. Approximately half of all women who develop breast cancer have no identifiable risk factor other than being female (and ageing) 544 . Although men can also get breast cancer, the inci dence is extremely low 545 . Stomach cancer is twice as prevalent in men as it is in women 546 . Age: Besides being female, the greatest aetiologica l factor for breast cancer is age. Older women are much more likely to develop breast cancer . Figure 6.4 highlights the increase in prevalence (and therefore risk) of breast cancer be tween the ages of 50 and 70, throughout the twentieth century. The prevalence of stomach ca ncer is also a direct function of age. During the twentieth century the age incidence of s tomach cancer increased, so that during the first half the major risk ages were those betwe en 50 and 70 years old, during the second half of the twentieth century this increased to the region of 60 to 80 years of age, which is shown in Figures 6.5 and 6.6. Diet: The potential of dietary factors being relate d to the development of cancer gained much interest towards the end of the twentieth cent ury. Many epidemiological studies have indicated that dietary practices are the most promi sing area of cancer reduction to 543 Cancer Research UK, (2003) \"The Stages of Stomach Cancer\". Retrieved 21 November 2003, erhelp.org.uk 544 \"Course Notes: Patient Educati Breast Cancer\". Retrieved 21 November 2003, f rom: www.AstraZeneca.com 545 Ibid 546 Health A-Z, (2002). Retrieved 1 October 2002, from : www.healthatoz.com Illnesses: Cancer - 202 - explore 547 . The most notorious study was conducted by Sir Ric hard Doll (1980), in which he suggested that seventy percent of cancers (other than those caused by tobacco) were related to diet 548 . Breast cancer risk is believed to be increased am ong women with an unbalanced and unhealthy diet and particularly one high in animal fat and alcohol 549 . For example, women who drink a great deal are more like ly to develop invasive breast cancer than women who do not drink 550 . The most popular explanatory variable for stomach c ancer is related to diet. An extensive number of studies in many countries were conducted towards the end of the twentieth century, all of which provided a link between dieta ry factors (which extend to environmental factors) and stomach cancer 551 . The most popular aetiological link is between food preservation (and the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables) and stomach cancer 552 . Coggon et al (1989) have highlighted the link bet ween a low intake of salad vegetables and fruit and a high intake of salt bein g clearly associated with stomach cancer development 553 . Other studies have highlighted the potential harm of non-refrigeration techniques of food preservation, for example, salti ng, pickling and smoked foods 554 . Environment: The likelihood of a link between stoma ch cancer and dietary intake has led many to identify the link between improvements in r efrigeration (which occurred during the twentieth century) and the decline in stomach c ancer 555 . This ultimately identifies environmental factors as critically important (as t his sort of technological development is defined as an 'environmental factor' in the scienti fic literature). In addition to this type of environmental factor, exposure to radiation, living in close proximity to industrial areas and adverse lifestyle practices in general (i.e. sm oking, lack of exercise and an unhealthy diet) are thought to increase the risk of stomach a nd breast cancer 556 . The importance of environmental factors in the deve lopment of cancer is confirmed by cross-country comparisons about the prevalence of c ancer 557 . This has been highlighted \"Course Notes: Patient Educati on on Breast Cancer\".

The importance of environmental factors has also been confirmed by ob servations that adopted children whose adoptive parents have died of cancer have a f ive fold increased risk of getting the disease 559 . Genetic and hormonal factors are thought to play a role in the development of breast cancer. Much research has been conducted on the DNA relationships with breast cancer. This has yielded some crucial results, for example, the discovery of two breast cancer genes, namely, BRCA1 (in 1994) and BRCA2 (in 1996) 560 . Approximately five to ten percent of breast cancers occur as a result of high ly penetrant germline mutations in cancer predisposing genes and half of these are due to mut ations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 561 . Breast cancer is also related to the sex hormones 562 . Oestrogen imbalances can cause cells to grow and divide rapidly. These imbalances can oc cur for numerous reasons, e.g. prolonged periods of oestrogen production (due to t he early age of menarche and late menopause), the long term use of oral contraceptive s and late age of the first child birth or not having children 563 . Alternatively, women who have their first baby be fore the age of 30 and who breast feed are less at risk from breast ca ncer 564 . Previous exposure: several studies have identified a bacterium (Helicobacter pylori) that may cause stomach ulcers and chronic infections in the stomach may lead to stomach cancer 565 . Furthermore, individuals who have suffered from u lcers and other forms of stomach disorder could potentially be at an elevate d risk of developing stomach cancer 566 . 6.4 Government and Charity Initiatives towards Canc er Shimkin (1977) noted that man recognised cancer and named it over two thousand years ago, but for all except the last 100 years he could do little against it 567 .

Ret rieved 21 November Breslow, \"Historical Perspectives on Can cer\" Illnesses: Cancer - 204 - history of cancer, it only became a relatively (and increasingly) important public health problem only during the twentieth century. 6.4.1 Government The first significant action towards the English ca ncer problem was provided by the 1939 Cancer Act. The main purpose of this bill was to es tablish a cancer service under which, in every part of the country, modern facilities for di agnosis and treatment of cancer would be available 568 . This was to be achieved through improvements in f acilities, better liaison between local authorities, the Radium Commission, a nd local medical professionals and an increase in funding from the Exchequer to facilitat e the desired improvements in cancer services 569 . However, this Act was never actually implemented because of the war 570 . In 1948 this Cancer Act was repealed when the Natio nal Health Service Act came into force. From this time the provision of cancer servi ce was to be achieved under the National Health Service, which would provide more accessible service for the population 571 . Prior to the introduction of the NHS, healthcare was provide d under a two-tiered (voluntary [only in name, by the beginning of the twentieth century] and municipal) system, which was facing increasing financial difficulties, which wer e largely unaided by the government 572 . For example, immediately prior to the introduction of the NHS, the government (local and central) had provided less than one-tenth of hospit al funding 573 . For cancer sufferers, the principal innovation of t he NHS was twofold. The first change was improved access to existing cancer services for large groups of the population who had previously been excluded 574 . The second change arose from the introduction of state- owned and funded hospitals and the government plans to modernise and equalise hospital services in England during the 1960s 575 . Before these initiatives, cancer services had bee n very unequally distributed geographically. Therefor e, the NHS provided more accessible (and affordable) treatment for cancer sufferers. Al though, even at the end of the twentieth century, services were by no means universally acce ssible or ideal. 568 The National Archives: MH 80(14): Cancer Bill 569 Ibid 570 Ibid 571 The National Archives: MH 160(644): Cancer Registr ation: Advisory Committee Reports 572 Powell, \"Hospital Provision Before the National He alth Service\", p. 485 573 Cherry, \"Before the National Health Finan cing and Voluntary Hospitals, 1900-1939\", p. 315 574 Webster, \"The National Health Service: A Political History\", p. 29 575 The 1962 Hospital Plan envisaged a national networ k of District General Hospitals, which was to invol ve the building of 90 new hospitals and the rebuilding of 134 more, over the following 10 years . Hardy, \"Health and Medicine in Britain Since 1860 \" Illnesses: Cancer - 205 - As well as data collection policies, a major part o f the government's contribution towards increased awareness, understanding and help for imp roving the quality of life of cancer patients was born from the numerous working committ ees that the government established. The Radium Commission were initially in charge of c ancer data collection and processing, and also provided valuable advice for the governmen t in the form of policy suggestions and approaches to improve cancer facilities and pra ctices 576 . The Working Party on Cancer Registration (1962) and the Advisory Committee on C ancer Registration were also prominent as they were responsible for the introduc tion of the first comprehensive (nearly 100 percent coverage) cancer registration system in 1971 577 . The Joint Working Party on Computers in Radiotherapy (1967) provided initial i nitiatives for the electrical processing of cancer data. This working party also provided th e stimulus necessary to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of cancer (and the many years of historical statistics about the diagnosis, treatment and survival of cancer pat ients) through electronic data processing with the use of digital computers. The Standing Advisory Committee on Cancer and Radio therapy (1949) and the Central Health Services Council Standing Medical Committee on Cancer Care Organisation (1969) provided valuable considerations and findings about the most productive organisation of cancer services. The former stimulated advances in radiotherapy practices and improvements in the provision of radiology services . The latter considered the organisation of cancer care under the NHS and provided numerous recommendations for improvements, many of which were still being contemplated by equi valent committees at the end of the twentieth century. The government also supported working groups that c ould consider the nature and aetiology of cancers and subsequently recommend the optimal methods for combating these diseases. The Standing Sub-Committee on Cance r (1967), which contained members as distinguished as Sir Richard Doll, was sponsored by the state to make considerations about the effects of early diagnosis of cancer, the value of public awareness and various other issues related to the identification, diagnos is and eventual treatment of cancer 578 . 576 The National Archives: MH 160 (644): Cancer Regist ration: Advisory Committee Reports 577 The National Archives: MH 160 (71):Conference on C ancer Registration and Subsequent Working Party and The National Archives: MH 160 (644): Cancer Registration: Advisory Committee Reports 578 The National Archives: 160 (680): Early Diagnosis: Effect and Survival Rates Illnesses: Cancer - 206 - Despite the continual efforts of the government to improve registration and understanding about cancer through various initiatives and workin g parties, the 'Smithers Report' (1971) highlighted that there were numerous shortcomings i n the government's efforts to combat cancer 579 . The 'Smithers Report' painted a depressing pictur e of the limitations in data gathering, the lack of coordination, and the absenc e of standardisation in procedures in the cancer services, all of which jeopardised the early detection and effective treatment 580 . A later indictment on the NHS was their failure to ad here to any of the suggestions made in the 'Smithers Report'. By the time of the NHS reorg anisation in 1974, only four regions had produced provisional regional cancer schemes. C ontinued reflection of slow progress of the organisation of cancer services came in 1995 , when the government conceded that the quality of cancer care was patchy and variable in the skills and technology available in different hospitals and also in clinical outcomes. During the last decade of the twentieth century the government embarked on a wide ranging initiative to improve the health of the nat ion, which was incorporated in the 1992 'Health of the Nation' strategy, which was designed to identify the key areas for health improvements, set targets for such improvements and also improve knowledge and understanding of these illnesses 581 . Within this Act, the government identified cancer as one of the major burdens to the nation's health 582 . However, only certain cancers were included in the legislation: cancers of the lung, b reast, cervix and skin were singled out for special attention and numerical targets were set fo r the reduction in the incidence or mortality within a period of 10-15 years. The targe t for breast cancer was to reduce the death rate by at least 25 percent by the year 2000 (i.e. from 95.1 per 100,000 in 1990 to no more than 71.3 per 100,000) 583 . This was to be achieved through \"everyone with suspected breast cancer [being] able to see a specialist within two weeks of their general practitioner deciding they need to be seen urgently and requesti ng an appointment\" 584 . In 1995 the Calmann-Hine Report was published. This report recommended major organisational changes at the local level and an im provement in specialisation in cancer care, which, in 1997, became policy objectives. Hen ce, it was not until the 579 Webster, \"The National Health Service: A Political History\", p. 116 580 Ibid 581 Department of Health, \"The Health of the Nation: O ne Year On\" 582 Cancer was identified as a major cause of mortalit y. 583 Department of Health, \"The Health of the Nation: O ne Year On\". This target was not achieved. 584 Coleman, \"Cancer Survival Trends in England and Wa les, 1971-1995: Deprivation and NHS Region\" Illnesses: Cancer - 207 - recommendations of the Calman-Hine Report were impl emented in 1997 that cancer became a top priority and additional resources were committed to its treatment and care 585 . During the last year of the twentieth century the H ealth Secretary announced a \u00a396 million plan for reducing the number of deaths from five ma jor causes, one of which was cancer. Furthermore, this white paper, entitled 'Saving Liv es', also considered the health divide and the social inequality gradient in cancer progno sis, and aimed to improve the quality of life of the population as a whole, and not just tho se in the highest social classes 586 . Finally, in the year 2000 the government introduced 'The NHS Cancer Plan'. This established the first comprehensive national cancer programme for England. This plan had four aims: saving more lives, ensuring that patient s get the right professional support and best treatments, tackling inequalities in health (t hat mean unskilled workers are twice as likely to die from cancer as professionals) and inv estment in the cancer workforce and treatment infrastructure. These objectives are valu able in their own right and are also useful for indicating where the NHS was continuing to fail cancer sufferers most. The effects of the persistent failure of the NHS ar e vividly illustrated through international comparisons of the age standardised death rate duri ng the second half of the twentieth century, which is shown in the following tables and figures 587 . 585 Commission for Health Improvement/Audit Commission , \"NHS Cancer Care in England and Wales\" 586 Hardy, \"Health and Medicine in Britain since 1860\" , p. 172 587 The age standardised rate (world) is a summary mea sure of a rate that a population would have if it h ad a standard age structure (the most frequently us ed standard population is the world standard populatio n, which will be used here). This is necessary when comparing several populations with different age structures, due to the powerful influence of age up on the risk of cancer. The calculated mortality rat e is then called the world standardised mortality r ate and it is expressed per 100,000.

By 2000 the situation had improved suc h that females regained their 1950 rank and reduced their percentile difference with t he leader. Males had moved closer towards their comparatively more favourable 1950 ra nk and had also partially abridged their percentile lag behind the leader country. The international relationship for female breast ca ncer highlights a slightly more favourable trend. However, this could potentially b e related to the very poor starting point. In 1950 breast cancer was 83 percent lower in the l eading country (Japan) than in Britain. Out of the 19 country comparison, England only achi eved seventeenth place. By 2000 the situation had improved as England moved into twelft h place and reduced their relative excess breast cancer mortality (in relation to the leader, which was still Japan) by 19 percent (from 83 to 64 percent).

As a result of Britain's smaller relative decline in the stomach cancer death rate, her comparative position has worsened. This scenario is also evident for British females, although there has been greater convergence between the five countries and therefor e less of a difference in the stomach cancer death rate by the end of the twentieth centu ry. England's international performance for breast canc er has been more favourable. During the 1990s the UK experienced important declines in the death rate, which enabled Britain to improve their rank among the five countries.

Retrieved 1 October 2002, from: http://w ww.who.org Illnesses: Cancer - 213 - There is speculation about the precise causes of th ese lags. The most common propositions all indicate shortcomings in the operations of the NHS: problems such as a variation in the provision of services across the country, under inv estment in specialists and equipment and a failure to modernise are blamed for Britain's rel atively poor prognosis 593 . Hence, there is considerable evidence, summarised most recently in the UK Treasury's 'Walness Report', that health outcomes in the UK lag behind those in other advanced industrialised countries 594 , and this evidence had facilitated the Treasury's decision to increase NHS expenditure 595 . Concurrently, the NHS could be complimented for its policies on mammography. The English screening framework falls within the consen sus of efficient screening practices: the age range (50 to 69 years of age), the frequenc y of screening (every three years), and mammography methods are considered acceptable to wo men 596 . However it is important to recognise the debate about the efficacy of breast c ancer screening. Some have claimed that, \"the effect of the screening programme is small, if any, and the balance between beneficial (saved lives) and harmful (over diagnosis and false positive diagnosis due t o carcinoma in situ) effects is delicate\" 597 . Others have highlighted that, given the uncertain ty about the effects of screening funds may be better investing in developing Calman-Hine proposals for specialist cancer care 598 . Both of these findings are especially applicable to pre- menopausal women, but towards the end of the twenti eth century some started to consider whether these accusations are applicable to all wom en. The bottom line for the thesis is that it is not possible to conclude on the precise value of breast cancer screening here, but government provision of mammography provided women with an option for screening. The government's biggest contribution to the allevi ation of the standard of living burden of cancer came through their commitment to a better un derstanding of the disease (both through their sponsorship of a wide variety of work ing parties and also through their public awareness and target initiatives). The provisions p rovided by the National Health Service Act 1948, facilitated increasingly improved cancer treatment for the population. Finally, the strategic approach provided in the 'Health of t he Nation' 1992 legislation indicates that the government had recognised that, although life e xpectancy had improved, individuals 593 Government Papers, \"The NHS Cancer Plan, A Plan fo r Investment, A Plan for Reform\" 594 Leon et al, \"Understanding the Health of Scotland' s Population in an International Context\", p. 70 595 Ibid 596 Fletcher et al, \"Report of the International Works hop on Screening for Breast Cancer\", p. 1645 597 Gotzsche & Olsen, \"Is Screening for Breast Cancer with Mammography Justified?\", p. 131 598 Baum, \"Breast Cancer Screening for Younger Women I s Not An Efficient Use of Resources\", p. 1834 Illnesses: Cancer - 214 - were still dying prematurely and having their quali ty of life impaired by potentially avoidable ill-health 599 . 'The NHS Cancer Plan 2000' marked an increase in the government's commitment to cancer care, which had p reviously been lacking. However, the policies and initiatives introduced by the gove rnment in the last years of the twentieth century indicate that the government was still fail ing to reach its potential, especially given the various retardations in the introduction of gen uinely effective and helpful legislation for cancer sufferers. 6.4.2 Charities Another important medium for generating improvement s in the population's quality of life related to cancer was provided by the initiatives o f cancer charities, which were especially pertinent as a result of the NHS shortcomings. Incr easingly throughout the twentieth century there has been a growth in the number and d iversity of such support mechanisms. The largest in England (and Europe) was the Imperia l Cancer Research Fund, which was established in 1902 and, throughout the twentieth c entury was prominent and active in a variety of arenas, all aimed at improving the quali ty of life for cancer sufferers 600 . The objectives of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, wh ich have been maintained throughout the twentieth century, highlight this 601 : 1. To provide, extend and equip and maintain laborator ies to be devoted to cancer research. 2. To encourage research on the subject of cancer in t he UK or in the British Dominions beyond the seas. 3. To assist in the development of cancer research in various hospitals and institutions approved by the executive committee. 4. And, generally to provide means for systematic inve stigations into the causes, prevention, and treatment of cancer. Therefore, the key contributions of the Cancer Rese arch Fund and numerous other cancer charities have been the following. 599 Department of Health, \"The Health of Nations\" 600 This was then renamed the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in 1904. This organisation split into the Bri tish Empire Cancer Campaign for Research (BECC) and The Imperial Cancer Research Fund in 1923. In 1 970 the BECC was renamed The Cancer Research Campai gn. During the next 30 years these two fundamental charities worked in close collaboration and their cooperation culminated in 2002 when they merged and became Cancer Research UK. Cancer Research UK (2003) \"History of Cancer Research\". Re trieved 21 November 2003, from: www.cancerresearchu k.org of Resear ch Fund 1902-1986\", p. 323 Illnesses: Cancer - 215 - To conduct research into the biology and causes of cancer: it is through efforts of this nature that many important breakthroughs have occur red. For example, the discovery of the BRCA1 gene was partially dependent upon charity funding from the UK's 'Cancer Research Campaign' 602 . To provide authoritative information about findings from their research: many cancer charities provide the public, government, commercia l organisations and those responsible for cancer care with their research results. This i s best highlighted by campaigns aimed at eliminating smoking in an effort to reduce lung can cer. These findings are also valuable for their potential to improve treatment and prevention strategies which can be implemented by governments and physicians. Although, it could be argued that cancer charities were too conformist with the government rather than campaigning more heavily for early canc er legislation and perhaps a stronger emphasis on preventative initiatives. Hence, anothe r criticism of cancer charities is that they should have concentrated more on preventative initiatives. Through developing effective treatments that can im prove the quality of life for cancer patients: research that is conducted by cancer char ities is aimed at improving cancer cure rates and ultimately translating knowledge about th is disease into effective treatments. Research is also directed towards improving the ide ntification and diagnosis of cancer. This is best illustrated through the continual disc overies and implementation of screening for breast cancer. Hence, the demonstration in the 1980s of the efficacy of mammography in reducing mortality from breast cancer by twenty five to thirty percent led to the adoption of guidelines in a number of countries, including E ngland, to introduce routine screening on a population basis 603 . Furthermore, many charities - initiated by the in troduction of the UK National Society for Cancer Relief in 1911 - pro vide research into life prolonging medication and emotional support in an effort to en sure that for those patients whose disease cannot be cured, their quality of life is s omewhat improved 604 . Cancer charities have continually developed through out the twentieth century to remain on the leading edge of cancer research and provide a k ey support mechanism for the 602 Science Blog (2003), \"Second Breast Cancer Gene Located\" . Retrieved 20 December 2003, from: http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/1996/A/1 99600114.html 603 Shapiro et al, \"Breast Cancer Screening Programmes in 22 Countries: Current Policies, Administration and Guidelines\", p. 735 604 Lee, \"Dates in Oncology\", p. 81 Illnesses: Cancer - 216 - government, doctors and patients. This dynamism has meant that charities are often the change agents and improvement implementers, which p rovides an example for the government and the most valuable support for cancer sufferers. However, it would seem that the approach of cancer charities was generally complimentary to government policy rather than substitutive and therefore it can be ar gued that cancer charities did not manage to initiate change or policy responses. Cancer charities have played a crucial role in help ing to improve the quality of life of the English population during the twentieth century, th rough providing diagnosis and treatment innovations, identifying lifestyle risks, providing guidelines and encouraging the government and doctors about the ideal codes of con duct. Additionally, the provision of information and condolence for individuals and fami lies that have been affected by cancer has also contributed to improving the quality of li fe of cancer sufferers. However, a drawback is likely to have been that there were ine qualities in these provisions. Gerard among others claims that for all charities, the ric h receive as much as the poor and perhaps more convincingly, that the educated population enj oyed considerably higher levels of charity help 605 . This implies that to some extent there were inequ alities in charity which indicates a setback in charity provision. An exampl e of how this is manifest would be in the understanding and embracing of cancer preventio n campaigns, e.g. anti smoking campaigns, which seem to have been more effective o n richer social classes. 6.5 Medical Developments The twentieth century provided some of the most far reaching developments in medical technology, many of which provided a substantial im provement in the understanding and treatment of cancer. When analysing medical develop ments and the impact they had upon the quality of life of breast and stomach cancer su fferers there are four key areas to consider: screening and scanning, radiotherapy, sur gery, chemotherapy and hormone treatment. It will also be necessary to consider en vironmental factors 606 as changes in this broad category have provided many boosts to the wel fare of cancer patients, both independently and synergistically with medical deve lopments. 605 Gerard, \"Charities in Britain: Conservatism or Cha nge?\", p. 21 606 'Environmental' is used here in the widest sense, e ncompassing all those external influences impinging on an individual organism. Illnesses: Cancer - 217 - 6.5.1 Screening and Scanning \"The surgical revolution that occurred during the t wentieth century, which has enabled this 100 years of medical innovation to be coined ' The Golden Age of Surgery', would have been impossible without all manner of technolo gical innovations that aid surgery\"607 . The breakthrough of greatest significance for the t reatment of cancer (beyond surgical removal of tumours) was the discovery of X-rays 608 . Even in their most primitive form X- rays provided an indication of the presence of canc er, which enabled surgical removal of the cancer. A further contribution of x-rays was the foundation they provided for more sophisticated visual diagnostics. In 1972 Hounsfield pioneered a system whereby x-ray beams could be resolved with computer assistance to produce a cros s-sectional picture of the human body. The result - computer-assisted axial tomography (CA T) was a major breakthrough in the non-invasive diagnosis of disease, which provided a n important contribution to the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer 609 . The development of magnetic resonance imagery (MRI), which is specifically useful for the detecti on of abnormalities in the soft tissue of the body, has also provided a boon to the identific ation, treatment and outcome of many cancers 610 . As a result of increasingly precise mechanisms fo r identifying tumours, the potential of successfully removing cancerous tumour s before they became large and metastasised was improved with modern x-ray techniq ues, facilitated by the development and introduction of the CAT and MRI scans. Modern x-ray techniques have also helped improve ca ncer prognosis through improved and frequent screening. In 1967 mammography for det ecting breast cancer was introduced, and provided a much more efficient approach to the identification of cancerous tumours 611 . By the end of the twentieth century nearly all fema les between the ages of 50 and 69 were being screened for breast cancer on a triennial bas is. For example, between March 1991 and April 1992, 71.3 percent of women aged 50 to 64 accepted screening 612 . This exceeds the target of a seventy percent acceptance rate and is considered to be extremely satisfactory 613 . 607 Porter, \"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medi cine\", p. 233 608 In 1895 Roentgen discovered that by passing a high voltage through a vacuum tube (perfected by Crooke s), he could generate electromagnetic vibrations capable of penetrating human flesh and leaving an i mprint on a photographic plate on the other side. B y 1896 the X-ray was implemented for diagnostic purposes. 609 Porter, \"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medi cine\", p. 243 610 Ibid 611 Porter, \"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medi cine\", p. 377 612 Chamberlain et al, \"National Health Service Breast Screening Programme Results for 1991-2\", p. 353 613 Ibid Illnesses: Cancer - 218 - A final contribution of the introduction of X-rays was the discovery of the effects of radioactivity upon cell destruction and ultimately radiotherapy. 6.5.2 Radiotherapy By 1900, through the work of radium institutes (the London Radium Institute was founded in 1911, and numerous regional branches were develo ped soon after 614 ), radiology journals and societies, there were more than a hundred disea ses for which the new miracle cures had been used, although it was for cancer that the new therapies seemed to promise the most 615 . By the 1920s many surgeons were adopting radium t herapy as a substitute or an adjunct to surgery 616 . In 1929 radium therapy was officially introduced in the UK as a cancer therapy and the National Radium Trust and Ra dium Commission were established 617 . By 1937 the Ministry of Health had drafted implem entation policies for radiotherapeutic departments in general hospitals n ationwide 618 . These developments were further fostered by the 1948 NHS Act, as this provi ded the initiatives and funds necessary to install hospitals with the necessary equipment a nd increase the number of centres providing treatment 619 . Despite the improvements in quality of life that th ese preliminary developments in radium therapy were yielding, the initial enthusiasm for r adium therapy was largely uncritical and exposed patients, doctors and technicians to heavy doses of radiation, with results that were disastrous to many, most notoriously, Marie Cu rie 620 . This situation detracted from the overall contribution to improved standards of l iving provided by the introduction of radium therapy, as did the shortcomings in the NHS radiology provision objectives, which meant that, at no point in the twentieth century wa s radiotherapy care universally and equally accessible to the English population. A more comprehensive improvement in quality of life was facilitated by radiation in the post World War Two era. Technological advances (dri ven by a better understanding about the process and dangers of radiation) during this t ime resulted in the replacement of radium 614 Austoker, \"A History of the Imperial Cancer Resear ch Fund 1902-1986\", p. xv 615 Porter, \"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medi cine\", p. 243 616 Hardy, \"Health and Medicine in Britain since 1860\" , p. 104 617 Lee, \"Dates in Oncology\", p. 94 and Austoker, \"A H istory of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund 1902-19 86\", p. xv 618 Austoker, \"A History Cancer Resear ch Fund 1902-1986\", p. xv 619 The National Archives: MH 80(14):Cancer Bill 620 Hardy, \"Health and Medicine in Britain since 1860\" , p. 104. Marie Curie died of leukaemia at the age of 67, which was undoubtedly a result of prolonged exposure to high energy radiation. Illnesses: Cancer - 219 - therapy by more precise and effective radiation the rapy 621 . Since this time there have been continual innovations in the methods of utilising r adiation for the treatment of cancer, such that by the close of the twentieth century this pro vided an important complement to surgery. The ability to use a combination of complementary a pproaches improved the survival prospect of many breast cancer patients. The benefi ts of radiotherapy are more pronounced in many stomach cancer cases. Because of the nature of stomach cancer, the mild symptoms and long gestation period until the diseas e has progressed into an advanced stage means that many are faced with harrowing surg ery needs, for example, a total gastrectomy or worse still, the inability of their cancer to be cured by surgery. Radiation therapy has provided a viable option for those suff erers who, during the twentieth century were faced with the aforementioned predicaments. He nce, in many instances of stomach cancer radiation therapy has prolonged the life of sufferers. Although this therapy does not provide a cure for stomach cancer it does provide a slight retardation to the cancer process, which albeit small is an improvement in the quality of life for sufferers of this disease. 6.5.3 Surgery Cancer surgery was introduced in the 1880s. By the turn of the century there had been many extensions and improvements in technique, but it rarely yielded a cure for cancer 622 . This is because by the time the tumour had become i dentifiable (through primitive forms of diagnosis) the cancer had already advanced (metasta sised) 623 . For the first half of the twentieth century breast cancer surgery was drastically destructive. Radical mastectomies were commonplace treatment for breast cancer from the 1890s until they began to be questioned in the 1960s. This proc edure involved the surgical removal of the breast, all the lymph glands in the nearest arm pit and the chest wall muscles, and ultimately the complete disfiguration of female bre ast cancer sufferers 624 . A further blow to quality of life was the non existence of any type o f counselling for this disfiguration and the lack of life saving success yielded by this tec hnique. 621 Ibid 622 Hardy, \"Health and Medicine in Britain 1860\" , p. 103 623 Ibid 624 Porter, \"A Medical History of Humanity From Antiqu ity to the Present\", p. 604 Illnesses: Cancer - 220 - In 1964 these draconian methods started to be quest ioned. The first scientific study of breast-sparing surgery was begun at Guy's Hospital in London. This study compared tumour excision plus low dose radiotherapy with rad ical mastectomy 625 . This particular study did not achieve sufficiently powerful results to overturn the then current medical practices and mainstream beliefs about the superior ity of radical mastectomies. However, the dispute continued and escalated, such that by t he 1970s the treatment of breast cancer was one of the most argued subjects in medicine 626 . For example, a 1972 editorial in the British Medical Journal stated that \"there is more controversy about the management of breast cancer than almost any other topic in tumour therapy, and more so now than ever before\" 627 . By the 1980s it had been affirmed that breast conse rving surgery worked and that it was just as effective as radical surgery in the treatme nt of breast cancer 628 . By the 1990s only 39 percent (approximately) of consultant surgeons w ould perform a radical mastectomy 629 . This development provided the largest single improv ement in quality of life for twentieth century breast cancer sufferers. Additionally the i ncreased utilisation of adjuvant therapy (i.e. conservative breast surgery complemented by c hemotherapy, hormone therapy or radiotherapy) and the improvement in survival it fa cilitated consolidated this leap forward in standards of living. The twentieth century history of stomach cancer pro vides a comparatively mundane and unsuccessful contrast. By the beginning of the cent ury operations for the removal of stomach tumours had been introduced. These surgical interventions became increasingly sophisticated by the continual developments in the field of medicine 630 . For example, the ability to be more precise reduced the amount of st omach that had to be removed due to cancer. Furthermore, developments in radiotherapy a nd chemotherapy meant that it was sometimes possible to reduce the size of a tumour b efore surgery and consequently diminish the loss 631 . These advances in medical techniques would have p rovided small improvements in the quality of life of stomach canc er sufferers throughout the twentieth 625 Texas Cancer Centre (2005), \"The Cancer Breakthrou gh You've Never Heard Of: Breast Sparing Treatment Gains Momentum\".

The biggest contribution to cancer chemotherapy was the discove ry that substances called nitrogen mustards selectively kill a particular type of canc erous cell 633 . This provided the foundation for a continued improvement in the sophi stication of cancer chemotherapy, although cancer chemotherapy drugs were largely pal liative and consequently, the contribution of chemotherapy to improved quality of life has experienced diminishing marginal improvements since the initial revolutiona ry introduction of this therapy in 1960 634 . Around the middle of the twentieth century the pote ntial for hormone therapy to treat cancer was discovered 635 . Hormone therapies became increasingly used as adj uvant therapies for early stage breast cancer and provide d a valuable alternative to chemotherapy (in older women [usually aged 50+] who have the typ e of breast cancer that is responsive to oestrogen blocking drugs - oestrogen receptor po sitive tumours) 636 . The scope of hormone therapy was consolidated with improvements in hormone drugs, particularly the breakthrough provided by Tamoxifen . This drug was introduced in the early 1970s and over the proceeding thirty years in creasingly became the endocrine treatment of choice in breast cancer (especially du ring the 1990s when the risk-reducing benefits of Tamoxifen were unequivocally demonstrat ed) 637 . Tamoxifen has undoubtedly been one of the greatest success stories in the pha rmacological management of breast cancer and has consequently provided many valuable improvements in quality of life for post menopausal, early stage, oestrogen receptor po sitive breast cancer 638 . 632 Porter, \"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medi cine\", p. 152 633 Porter, \"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medi cine\", p. 272 634 Lee, \"Dates in Oncology\", p. 109 635 Huggins discovered hormone therapy for the treatme nt of bladder cancer in his research into the physi ology and biochemistry of prostate cancer in 1941. He also developed the use of hormones in treating f emale breast cancer. Porter, \"The Cambridge Illustr ated \"Luteinizing Hormone -Releasing Hormone Ana logues - The Rationale for Adjuvant use in Pre-Meno pausal Women with Early Breast Cancer\" 637 Baum, \"Tamoxifen - The Treatment of Choice. Why Lo ok for Alternatives?\" 638 Ibid Illnesses: Cancer - 222 - Furthermore, during the last years of the twentieth century initial discoveries were being made, such as Goserelin, which signified the birth of a new generation of hormone drugs that will eventually add new vitality and diversity to the search for an improved endocrine therapy for early breast cancer 639 . The reduction in breast cancer mortality, which has been evident during the last fifteen years of the twentieth century in England, is partl y attributable to the widespread adoption of adjuvant, systematic treatment, which includes h ormone therapies, such as Tamoxifen 640 . Certain studies have attributed these treatments to a reduction in mortality of between 12.2 and 14.9 percent by the end of the twe ntieth century 641 . Hence, hormone therapies have provided a significant improvement t owards quality of life for late twentieth century breast cancer patients, both through saving life years and through improving the general health of many females who have been living with breast cancer. 6.5.5 Environmental Factors By the year 2000 it was thought that up to a third of all cancer deaths were related to dietary factors 642 . Knowledge about the potential influence of enviro nmental factors became increasingly prominent as the century unfold ed and the cure for cancer persisted to elude modern medicine. Environmental factors resemb le potential preventions for cancer, which, at the close of the twentieth century, remai ned the most promising mechanism for superseding cancer. Many authors have emphasised the importance of diet ary factors in the prevention of cancer, especially stomach cancer. For example, die tary factors which are related to improvements in food storage and handling are thoug ht to be the leading catalysts for the worldwide reductions in stomach cancer mortality 643 . Conversely, the increase in breast cancer has often been partially attributed to incre ased fat consumption 644 . The culmination of these discoveries meant that, by the end of the twentieth century, environmental factors featured as one of the key strategies in the Britis h government's battle against cancer. For example, 'The NHS Cancer Plan 2000' five-a-day prog to 639 Ibid 640 Baum, \"Tamoxifen - The Treatment of Choice. Why Lo ok for Alternatives?\" 641 Blanks et al, \"Effects of the NHS Breast Screening Programme on Mortality from Breast Cancer in Engla nd and Wales 1990-8: Comparison of Observed with Predicted Mortality\", p. 668 642 Government Papers, \"The NHS Cancer Plan, A Plan fo r Investment, A Plan for Reform\", p. 26 643 Hoel et al, \"Trends in Cancer Mortality in 15 Indu strialized Countries, 1969-1986\", p. 315 644 Hoel et al, \"Trends in Cancer Mortality in 15 Indu strialized Countries, 1969-1986\", p. 316 Illnesses: Cancer - 223 - reduce smoking 645 . As a result of twentieth century economic and tec hnological advances, this type of diet (high in fruit, vegetables and fi bre, and low in fat, sugar and salt) has become increasingly achievable. An additional environmental harm that has received increased awareness during the twentieth century is industrial/ work related carci nogens. Some of these cancers are now so well established that they are designated as 'presc ribed diseases' entitling the victim to possible compensation 646 , e.g. skin cancer from employment in soot, tar and mineral oil industries 647 . Despite the developments in recognising these poten tially harmful environmental factors, progress to reduce these adverse factors had been s low in twentieth century England. There were very few organisations that represented the br oader public interest and lobbied the government accordingly. This marks a contrast with other developed countries, for example, America, where environmental and consumer lobbies are larger, more broadly based and have formed better alliances with trade u nions, which have been able to use their power to achieve more protection from these environ mental externalities 648 . Finally, during the twentieth century it has become increasingly recognised that the general environment is a potential source of carcinogens. I .e. that people are not only potentially at risk from their occupations and the commodities the y consume but also from the air they breathe and the water they drink. This is best illu strated by the marked difference between higher urban and lower rural rates of cancer in Eng land during the twentieth century 649 . Improvement in environmental factors provided an eb b in cancer, but not a cure. Because of the perceived trade-offs (in the short term in o rder to reduce long term risk) and the inability of many to change their circumstances (la rgely the most deprived who are faced with an excess cancer risk as a result of the afore mentioned environmental factors) a better understanding of environmental factors was not able to provide any kind of cure for the twentieth century English population. 645 Ibid 646 Doyal et al, \"Cancer in Britain: The P revention\", p. 17 647 Ibid 648 Doyal et al, \"Cancer in Britain: P revention\", p. 50 649 Ibid Illnesses: Cancer - 224 - 6.6 Lack of Progress Considerations Despite the research and funding that has been dedi cated to cancer (cures, screening, diagnosis, treatment) the returns have been scanty. For example, the prognosis and quality of life faced by stomach cancer sufferers was still poor at the end of the twentieth century. The outlook was more favourable for breast cancer s ufferers. However, breast cancer is the most heavily funded and researched cancer and there fore, in this respect the outcome is still relatively meagre compared to the investments towards curing this disease. Nevertheless, the quality of life for breast cancer sufferers has improved favourably during the twentieth century and the breakthroughs in 'pre vention' and treatment for breast cancer are commendable. This marks a stark contrast with s tomach cancer. The key frustration for stomach cancer improvements is that there is no mec hanism for early identification of the disease. Furthermore, because stomach cancers engul f a major bodily organ there are few options for remedy at a late stage. These are the r easons why quality of life improvements have not been more pronounced for stomach cancer du ring the twentieth century. Health providers, charities and governments ought t o be commended for their efforts towards trying to improve the standards of living o f cancer sufferers. Their efforts during the twentieth century, increasingly as the century unfolded provided many valuable improvements in the quality of life associated with stomach and particularly breast cancer. The main drawback was that despite substantial inve stments, the benefits that they yielded were very low. This was largely a result of the com plicated and poorly understood nature of cancer throughout the twentieth century and nume rous weaknesses in the functioning of the NHS, which have been detailed above. A final fa ctor that could have been improved, and would subsequently have improved the overall pr ognosis from breast and stomach cancer, were the socioeconomic inequalities in heal th that persisted and increased during the twentieth century. Sigerist (1956) stated that \"in any given society the incidence of illness is l argely determined by economic factors\" and that \"the problem of public health is ultimately political\" 650 . Despite the introduction of the NHS in 1948, soci oeconomic mortality [and morbidity] differences have persisted and often inc reased. E.g. for the ten most common cancers (including breast and stomach), Schrijvers (1995) identified much better five-year survival rates for affluent patients 651 . Tomatis (1995) went as far as claiming that \"the total 650 Tomatis, \"Socioeconomic Factor and Human Cancer\" 651 Schijvers et al, \"Deprivation, Stage at Diagnosis and Cancer Survival\" Illnesses: Cancer - 225 - incidence of cancer at all sites is greater in lowe r socioeconomic groups\" 652 . Kogevinas et al (1991) found that both male and female council t enants had significantly worse survival than owner-occupiers 653 . Moreover, other studies have found that this ineq uality is exacerbated for cancers with poor prognosis (e.g. s tomach cancer), as these are more prevalent in the lower socioeconomic groups 654 . These social class inequalities are not an English phenomenon and are evident in other, comparable countries. However the extent of the soc ial class inequality seems to be more severe in the UK 655 . The twentieth century evolution in social class i nequality adds a further blow to NHS progress. The breast cancer social class gradient was consist ently in favour of the professional classes, whereby their five years survival rate was higher than their social class V counterparts. Stomach cancer illustrates a differen t trend: the survival rate was equal across all social classes, but was marginally more favoura ble for lower classes, i.e. social class V, in the 1970s and probably earlier. This margin was eliminated by the later years of the twentieth century (the 1980s), when the higher soci al classes, e.g. social class I, were enjoying equal or marginally greater years of survi val. A noteworthy point to recognise for stomach cancer, when evaluating the social class mo rtality gradient, is the prevalence of stomach cancer in social class V, which was signifi cantly higher than for social class I. The social class survival rates for breast and stomach cancer are shown in the table below. 652 Tomatis, \"Socioeconomic Factor and Human Cancer\" 653 Kogevinas Differences in Can cer Survival\" 654 Ibid and Lipworth et al, \"Socioeconomic Factors in the Prognosis of Cancer Patients\" 655 Logan, \"Cancer Mortality by Occupation and Social Class 1851-1971\", p. 109 and 122 Illnesses: Cancer - 226 - Table 6.6: Five year survival rate for breast and s tomach cancer by social class (I to V), 1971-1990 (%) 656 1971-1975 1976-1980 1981-1985 1986-1990 Social Class I II III IV V I II III IV V I II III IV V I II III IV V Breast Cancer 52 49 47 45 42 57 54 51 50 47 60 56 54 52 49 63 60 59 56 53 Stomach Cancer 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 8 7 6 6 7 8 8 7 7 8 Table 6.6 highlights a clear social class gradient for survival from breast cancer, which was consistently about 10 percent more favourable for t he top social class versus the lowest. This relationship was not evident for stomach cance r, where there are marginal differences between the survival rates across the social classe s. Table 6.6 also highlights that very few sufferers survive stomach cancer. This point is par ticularly important when the prevalence of stomach cancer by social class is considered, wh ereby stomach cancer is more prevalent in the lower social classes. Therefore, there is so me form of a social class gradient for stomach cancer, which is not highlighted above but will be illustrated in the Figures below, which represent the standardised mortality rate for stomach cancer (and indicates the greater prevalence of this disease in lower social classes). The standardised mortality rate considers the level of mortality relative to the po pulation. For males and females there was generally more stomach cancer deaths in social clas s V than I and hence there is a vivid social class gradient for stomach cancer mortality. 656 Coleman, \"Cancer Survival Trends in England and Wa les, 1971-1995: Deprivation and NHS Region\" Illnesses: Cancer - 227 - Figure 6.12: Stomach cancer standardised mortality rate (SMR) by social class, males, 1911-1971 657 . Male Stomach Cancer Social Class SMR 1911-1971 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 1911 1931 1971 Year SMR SC I SC II SC III SC IV SC V With the exception of 1911 (where stomach cancer mo rtality was higher in social classes II and III than IV), there is an ordinal and increasin gly substantial social class gradient associated with stomach cancer in English males. Th e social class gradient increased throughout the period largely as a result of the de cline in stomach cancer between 1931 and 1971 in social classes I and II in conjunction with the increase in social classes III to V. 657 Logan, \"Cancer Mortality by Occupation and Social Class 1851-1971\", p. 30 Illnesses: Cancer - 228 - Figure 6.13: Stomach cancer standardised mortality rate (SMR) by social class, females, 1931-1971 658 Female Stomach Cancer Social Class SMR 1931-1971 40 60 80 100 120 140 1931 1951 1971 Year SMR SC I SC II SC III SC IV SC V The relationship for female stomach cancer mortalit y is not as clear as that for males. This is largely due to the anomaly of 1951 mortality in social class I (for which there is no obvious explanation) and also because mortality was greater in social classes I than II in 1971. The data used for the above table is somewha t hybrid (1931 considers only married women, 1951 considers only single women and 1971 co ntains an average of both) and this may be the cause of the anomalies. However there is still an evident general trend of an increasing social class female stomach cancer morta lity gradient. The causes of this socioeconomic cancer gradient ar e not as pronounced as the social inequalities themselves. This is because of the dif ficulty in measuring different social classes and also because of the incomplete knowledg e of cancer causes, which was still limited at the end of the twentieth century. Howeve r, there is a general consensus in the literature about the most likely causes of the grad ient, which are summarised in Table 6.7. 658 Ibid Illnesses: Cancer - 229 - Table 6.7: Summary of major studies and their findi ngs about the cause of social inequalities in cancer survival 659 Study Key findings Gillis & Hole (1996) There is a substantial survival benefit for patient s cared for by a specialist. Specialist care is more commonly received by higher social classes. Kogevinas (1991) Differences in treatment. Time of diagnosis. Stage at presentation: delay in seeking treatment i n lower social classes is a major contributing cause of the gradie nt. Poor host resistance among the deprived. Linden (1996) Stage at diagnosis. Richards et al (1997) Variations in the management of breast cancer in cl inics and hospitals and in surgical standards, whereby the affluent rec eive better quality treatment. Schrijvers et al (1995) Poor host resistance among the deprived (co-morbidi ty, adverse nutritional status, poor social support, likelihood of anxiety and depression due to cancer, are all more severe in de prived classes). Wells & Horm (1992) Stage at diagnosis strongly influences cancer survi val. Women of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to be di agnosed with breast cancer at a later stage. Later stage at diagnosis, poorer host resistance (r elated to nutritional and health status) and a variation in cancer treatment were largely respon sible for the socioeconomic cancer gradient at the end of the twentieth century, when social inequalities in cancer became a major public health issue. The variation in quality and provision of cancer care (as a result of NHS weaknesses) is a key factor when considering England's lag behind other comparable, developed countries 660 . It should be noted that the lack of improvement in the quality of life associated with cancer during the twentieth century could partially be a r esult of non-health and welfare related factors. Firstly, the ageing of the population as a result of the nature of degenerative diseases, which has meant that people are living lo nger and are therefore, increasing the scope for developing cancer, as a result of the nat ure of degenerative diseases. Or, as Davis 659 Gillis & Hole, \"Survival Outcome of Care by Specia list Surgeons in Breast Cancer: A Study of 3,786 Pa tients in the West of Scotland\" and Kogevinas et al, \"Socioeconomic Differences in Cancer Survival\" and Richards et al, \"Inequalities in Breast Cancer Care and Outcome\" and Schrijvers et al, \"Deprivatio n and Survival from Breast Cancer\" and Wells & Horm, \"Stage at Diagnosis in Breast Cancer\" and Linden, \" The Influence of Social Class in the Survival of Cancer Patients\" 660 Iliffe, \"The NHS: A Picture of Health?\", p. 88 Illnesses: Cancer - 230 - et al (1990) have claimed \"because the elderly have had more opportunity for exposure to carcinogens in their lifetime\"661 . Therefore, although the problems associated with ca ncer could have been more comprehensively remedied by the government, there a re aspects of this disease that continue to frustrate all of those involved in the fight against it. The key problem is the failure in finding a cure and understanding this di sease more comprehensively. And the nature of the ageing of the population has also exa cerbated the twentieth century burden of cancer. 6.7 Summary The above analysis has highlighted that the standar ds of living associated with breast and stomach cancer improved over the twentieth century, although to a lesser extent for stomach cancer. These advances are important as qua lity of life improved from a 'poor' level in 1900 to a 'good' level for breast cancer a nd a 'fair' level for stomach cancer by the year 2000. The prevalence of breast cancer increased considera bly during the twentieth century, while it declined for stomach cancer. This worsening situ ation was aided by the improvement in the age distribution and also survival prospects of these diseases (although less so for stomach cancer). Furthermore, enhancements in the q uality of life experienced by sufferers of stomach and breast cancer have also helped to re lieve the aggregate burden of these diseases upon overall standards of living. Medical developments, increased medical practitione r skills, improvements in the interaction and understanding of environmental fact ors, government initiatives and the work of charities all played key roles in initiatin g these quality of life improvements. 661 Grulich et al, \"Is the Apparent Rise in Cancer Mor tality in the Elderly Real? Analysis of Changes in Certification and Coding of Cause of Death in England and Wales, 1970-1990\" Results - 231 - PART III This part of the thesis reports the results, which are derived from the previous analysis. Chapter 7 will also provide the conversion of the p revious qualitative analysis to quantitative summary results. The first stage of these results will concentrate o n the construction of a 'quality adjusted life year' (QALY) measure from the previous qualitative analysis. The QALY that is derived below is the result of an original process, which w as necessary because of the central questions of the thesis (i.e. the historical health and welfare quality of life of sufferers had to be approximated). The best solution was to consider the historical health and welfare quality of life in detail, for a sample of illnesses. The n ext stage was to apply a mechanism that transformed this detailed qualitative analysis into a series of quantitative indices. This was achieved through applying the EuroQol standardised spectrum of development to all the key quality of life features (see Chapter 3: Tables 3.5 , 3.6 and 3.7 for an outline of the key EuroQol variables) in the qualitative analysis. Thi s yielded a series of results (or EuroQol ranks which can be converted into QALY indices) abo ut the quality of life for different illnesses, eras and aspects of health and welfare s tandards of living, which are comparable across all illnesses and eras. The justification fo r utilising this approach and a more detailed explanation about the construction of this methodol ogy (i.e. the conversion of the qualitative analysis into a quantitative QALY index through app lying EuroQol) is provided in Chapter 3: 3.5 QALY Estimating Process and 3.6 QALY Value Accreditation . Hence, the QALY in this thesis (which represents th e quantitative index) will be based upon the previous qualitative analysis. This information will be transformed from qualitative into quantitative through the thesis consistently (for a ll illnesses and eras in the thesis) gauging the qualitative results on the EuroQol spectrum. The Eu roQol results (or ranks) will then be evolved into QALY weights. The range of EuroQol ran ks (and how they translate into associated QALY weights) is shown below. Results - 232 - Table 7.1: EuroQol standardised spectrum and ranks and spectrum EuroQol Rank Correspo nding QALY value Complete quality of life 1 1 Good quality of life 2 0.8333 Fair quality of life 3 0.6667 Some quality of life 4 0.5000 Poor quality of life 5 0.3333 No quality of life 6 0.1667 The QALY results in Table 7.1 are achieved through converting EuroQol ranks into QALY ranks. On EuroQol there are 6 possible values betwe en 1 and 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. For the QALY there are 6 possible values between 0 and 1: 1 , 0.8333, 0.6667, 0.5, 0.3333, 0.1667. These QALY rank are equivalent to their respective EuroQol rank, but expressed on a different scale. This exercise provides one of the thesis' key contr ibutions to knowledge. Hence, the QALY is crucial for making quantitative considerations abou t health improvements which is facilitated by applying the EuroQol standardised spectrum of de velopment to the qualitative analysis of all illnesses in all eras in the thesis. Hence, the key value of developing and utilising a standardised spectrum, namely EuroQol, is so that the twentieth century developments in quali ty of life (documented in Part II of the thesis) can be converted into QALYs, so that morbid ity can be included in an extended (quantitative) willingness to pay (or QALE) model, which includes mortality as well as morbidity (which is comparable across all illnesses and era). This process will be utilised (in Chapter 7 and 8) in order provide quantitative answ ers to the major questions of the thesis: to what extent have improvements in mortality and morb idity improved quality of life and contributed to better standards of living and econo mic growth in twentieth century England? And, how valuable (in monetary terms) are the impro vements in quality adjusted life expectancy (QALE gains)? Results - 233 - The development and implementation of this new appr oach to measuring health (mortality and morbidity), both the qualitative and quantitative a spects of historical health and welfare related quality of life, will enable the thesis to provide robust estimates about the contribution of improved health to standards of living, which will provide an original contribution to the existing literature. Furthermore, these considerati ons and the results that the QALE methodology will yield represent a more precise hea lth measurement methodology in adherence to the criteria mentioned in earlier sect ions of the thesis (see 'Representational Measurement' in Chapter 2.2.7) and a more comprehensive 'Fisher ian' measure of twentieth century English economic development (explained und er the rationale of 'Willingness to Pay' in Chapter 3). Results: Qualitative - 234 - 7. Qualitative Findings: EuroQol Summary and Quanti tative (QALY) Transition The following chapter will consolidate the findings of Part II through providing the EuroQol summary of these results, which can then provide ov erall health and welfare associated quality of life (QALY) approximations. This chapter will su mmarise the evolution of the quality of life associated with blindness, tuberculosis and ca ncer during the twentieth century, both qualitatively and quantitatively by presenting the range of EuroQol scores and the associated QALY. This will provide a verbal and numerical answ er to the key underlying question of the chapter: what was the overall quality of life for s ufferers (in the years 1900, 1925, 1950, 1975 and 2000)? This will provide the EuroQol standardised comparat ive analysis - between the government, charity, medical developments, pain and discomfort, and ability to lead a normal life variables - of the developments that were made for blindness, tuberculosis and cancer quality of life, which are used to construct a corresponding QALY in dex. The EuroQol and subsequent QALY values that are pre sented here represent what the author deems to be the most appropriate value, from a cons ervative standpoint (this is best highlighted by the QALY result comparison in Chapte r 3: Table 3.9). The QALY values outlined here pertain to the 'Mid' values utilised in later stages of the quantitative analysis. Results: Qualitative: Blindness - 235 - 7.1 Blindness 7.1.1 Twentieth Century Qualitative Results 235 7.1.1 Twentieth Century Qualitative Results The table below provides a summary of the EuroQol r ank results for the quality of life variables (see Chapter 3: Table 3.5 and 3.7 for a detailed ex planation of these variables), for blindness in the key eras of the twentieth century considered in the thesis.

Ability to lead a normal life variable score is calculated as the average of the sub-vari ables in this category, which are presented below in Table 7.1.2. For the definitional interpretation of the EuroQol ranks shown in Table 7.1.1 see Table 7.1, above. Table 7.1.1 illustrates that, in 1900 there was 'no ' quality of life (EuroQol rank = 6) facilitated for the blind by 'government initiatives and help' . When the Blind Persons Act was introduced in 1920 government aid improved considerably and the b lind population experienced 'fair' quality of life (EuroQol rank = 3) related to government help. However this state of legal recognition and help did not improve enough between 1925 and 2000 t o move the blind to a higher indifference curve (i.e. an extra mark on the spectrum). There w ere numerous Acts designed to help the blind, which were seemingly very comprehensive, but none o f these were effective enough to become more far reaching than the 1920 Blind Persons Act. This meant that the standards of living for the blind were only partially improved by government le gislation: from 'no' to 'fair' quality of life during the twentieth century. Results: Qualitative: Blindness - 236 - After the introduction of the 1920 Blind Persons Ac t the blind experienced a considerable improvement in their levels of 'recognition' (from 'poor' quality of life to 'fair' quality of life). During the last decade of the twentieth century a s tream of legislation pertaining to equal rights helped change the perception of the disabled and im proved recognition of the blind, such that by the year 2000 the blind were experiencing 'good' qu ality of life regarding their levels of recognition (shown in Table 7.1.1 as a EuroQol rank of 2 in 2000, for 'recognition /awareness'). The introduction of the 1920 Blind Persons Act mean t that by 1925 the blind were experiencing 'some' quality of life in their 'status' compared to 'poor' quality of life which was previ ously the case. By 1950 the blind had achieved 'fair' quality of life regarding their standing, largely as a result of the improvement in employment opportuniti es (discussed below). Finally, although there were numerous government Acts which extended the ac hievements of the 1920 Blind Persons Act (especially during the 1990s) these attempts at imp roving the status of the blind population were largely unsuccessful, as the blind status did not i mprove beyond the 1950 level of 'fair' quality of life for 1950-2000. The state of 'health developments' at the start of the twentieth century contained no prevention or provisions for treatment of blindness ('no' quality of life). Increased awareness about infectious diseases causing blindness, the introduction of saf e and effective treatment, and improvements in the prevention of blindness facilitated 'fair' qual ity of life for blind health by 1950. These breakthroughs and developments were enhanced during the last quarter of the twentieth century through further technological developments, e.g. ca taract surgery, so that by 2000 the blind were enjoying 'good' quality of life levels of preventio n and treatment of blindness (shown in Table 7.1.1 as a EuroQol rank of 2 in 2000, for 'health d evelopments'). The value of the improvements in these (prevention and treatment of blindness) 'health developments' are best illustrated by (approximations about) the increasing average age of onset of blindness: in 1900 16 percent of the blind were ove r 70, in 1950, 24 percent and by 2000, 69 percent of the blind population were over the age o f 75. Consequently there would seem to be much fewer years spent in blindness: in 1900 the av erage number of years of blindness was about 16 years versus 11 years in 2000 (this is especiall y impressive as life expectancy increased by 27 years between 1900 and 2000). Even though these num bers are approximate, due to the Results: Qualitative: Blindness - 237 - assumptions that had to be made in order to conside r the prevalence by age of blindness (see Chapter 4), this trends is very important for the w elfare of the blind. The 'ability to lead a normal life' also improved for the blind population. This varia ble comprises: employment, wages and education. This breakdown and the associated EuroQol scores are shown in the table below. Table 7.1.2: EuroQol results for sub-variables in ' Ability to lead normal life' for disability Blind: EuroQol Sub-Variables Blind: EuroQol Score 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 Ability to lead a normal life 5 4 3 3 3 Employment 6 5 4 4 4 Wages 5 5 3 3 3 Education 4 3 3 3 2 The development of help and equality for the blind in the labour market was one of the slowest aspects of socio-economic quality of life to improv e. Table 7.1.2 highlights that the blind experienced 'no' quality of life in employment in 1 900, and this did not improve to 'some' quality of life levels until 1950. The developments that oc curred between 1950 and 2000 were not far reaching enough to improve the blind's quality of l ife associated with employment, beyond the 1950 level of 'some' quality of life. The increase in the blind's wages provided an impor tant development in equality, such that by 1950 the blind were experiencing 'fair' quality of life in wages. During the last quarter of the twentieth century there were no far reaching improv ements in equality of wages upon the 1950 level of 'fair' quality of life and this remained the scenario for blind wages for the second half of the twentieth century. Education was one of the most developed and equal a reas for blind welfare during the twentieth century. Table 7.1.2 highlights that as early as 19 00 the blind were enjoying 'some' quality of life in education. Between 1925 and 1975 blind children in education experienced continual improvements, so that during this time they enjoyed 'fair' quality of life in the provision and standards of blind education. The 1981 Education Ac t illustrates an initiative to provide improved Results: Qualitative: Blindness - 238 - equality, opportunity and standards for educating t he blind, and although this was not overly successful, this was still a development that marke d an improvement in blind quality of life, which meant that by the end of the twentieth century the blind were enjoying 'good' quality of life in education, even if the result of those in higher ed ucation were unsatisfactory. Therefore, the culmination of these developments (o r lack thereof) meant that the 'aggregate average quality of life' faced by the blind evolved from; 'poor' in 1900 to 'some' by 1925 and peaked at 'fair' in 1950 to 2000 (shown in Table 7. 1.1). This final aggregate EuroQol rank for the quality o f life associated with blindness can now be converted into a QALY value. Table 7.1 provides the translation from EuroQol rank to QALY value. For a detailed explanation about the nature and appeal of this process, see Chapter 3: 3.5 QALY Estimating Process and 3.6 QALY Value Accreditation . Therefore, Table 7.1.1 highlights that the blind QA LY improved from 0.3333 of a healthy life year (which is represented as 1) to 0.6667 of a healthy life year. Hence, in 1900 the collection of health and welfare standards of living meant that the blin d only enjoyed about one third of a healthy life year. By the year 2000, improvements in health and welfare enabled the standards of living for the blind to improve to about two thirds of a healthy l ife year. This numerical index will be utilised below, in the wider QALE methodology in order to es timate the value of the above improvements in the quality of life associated with blindness (s hown here, as the improvements in the QALY from 0.3333 in 1900 to 0.6667 in 2000). Finally, although the developments made in the qual ity of life for the disabled are not as far reaching as those experienced by disease sufferers, these improvements are still commendable.

Health d evelopments and ability to lead a normal life varia ble scores are calculated as the average of the sub-variables in e ach category. For the definitional interpretation o f the EuroQol ranks shown in Table 7.1.1 see Table 7.1, above. Table 7.1.2 highlights that during the twentieth ce ntury the implications of having tuberculosis improved substantially: in 1900 tuberculosis suffer ers experienced 'poor' quality of life versus 2000 when the quality of life associated with tuber culosis was 'good'. The variable EuroQol rank results in Table 7.2.1 are indicative of tuber culosis being a rampant, incurable, poorly Results: Qualitative: Tuberculosis - 240 - understood and life threatening illness, which insp ired widespread fear and anxiety and a significant threat to the public health of the nati on at the beginning of the twentieth century. And, by the year 2000 tuberculosis was an innocuous disease, which, in most cases was relatively easily cured and short-lived. Unlike the other illnesses considered in the thesis , tuberculosis had standard of living ramifications beyond the individual sufferer, becau se in addition to debilitating the health of the sufferer, tuberculosis was a destructive social force. Therefore, there are numerous developments which are far reaching but do not appe ar in Table 7.2.1 (and in the quantitative results below), for example, the contribution to th e aggregate population of the reduced infectiousness of tuberculosis. These are not direc t features of the thesis and cannot be included in the methodology, however it should be n oted that there were additional values to the documented tuberculosis reduction. This also re presents another instance where the thesis Extended Results are lowest bound estimates. 7.2.1 Nineteen Hundred Table 7.2.1 highlights that in 1900 the quality of life burden generated by tuberculosis was substantial. There was relatively little 'government help' or understanding about the specific problems and distinctive needs of tuberculosis suff erers (embodied by 'poor' quality of life associated with 'government recognition and help' in Table 7.2.1: EuroQol rank = 5). Although tuberculosis had been prevalent for nearly a century, and charities and committees were already active by 1900 (embodied by 'some' qua lity of life associated with 'recognition/ awareness' in Table 7.2.1: EuroQol rank = 4), understanding o f the aetiology of tuberculosis was still very limited (embodied by 'poor' quality of life associated with 'health developments' in Table 7.2.1: EuroQol rank = 5). The 'pain and discomfort' associated with this tuberculosis was significant and in 1900 there was relatively little that could be done to abate t he symptoms. Because of the method of treatment this physical pain was also likely to hav e been matched by emotional and mental distress as a result of the segregation that many e xperienced as a course of their treatment, and the financial burden that was placed upon a family, particularly if the sufferer was the breadwinner, and the 'anxiety' associated with the contraction of a disease that was so strongly Results: Qualitative: Tuberculosis - 241 - associated with no cure. This burden is represented by the 'poor' quality of life associated with tuberculosis sufferers' 'ability to lead a normal life' , shown as EuroQol = 5 in Table 7.2.1. This meant that the overall quality of life experie nced by tuberculosis sufferers was 'poor' in 1900. Standards of living had been slightly improve d by the work of charities, which helped promote recognition and aid for the condition, alth ough this could have been more effective and far reaching in some instances. Most detrimenta l to tuberculosis sufferers' quality of life was the complete lack of any kind of cure, which ex acerbated all of the other quality of life variables. 7.2.2 Nineteen Twenty-Five The most important quality of life variable, the cu re for tuberculosis, continued to elude the population, but there were evident developments mad e in its pursuit. By 1925 understanding of tuberculosis had fundamentally advanced, althoug h this had not managed to yield any positive results for the treatment of tuberculosis at this time. Therefore, by 1925 quality of life associated with 'health developments' had still not managed to improve from 'poor' level s, although the foundations for a later improvement we re evident. This phenomenon was also evident with tuberculosis sufferers' quality of life associated with their 'ability to lead a normal life' . The key reason for this is that the social diffic ulties, anxiety and depression invoked by tuberculosis had not declined and therefore, quality of life related to the ability to lead a normal life remain ed 'poor' in 1925. By 1925 'government initiatives and help' had begun to develop as legislation began to display that the state had adopted a more comprehen sive stance towards tuberculosis. E.g. the 1921 Public Health (Tuberculosis) Act included afte r-care legislation for tuberculosis sufferers. The increase in government involvement i n welfare issues associated with tuberculosis welfare provided an improvement in qua lity of life for tuberculosis sufferers, from 'poor' in 1900 to 'some' by 1925 (shown in Tab le 7.2.1 as an improvements in the EuroQol rank from 5 to 4). The state also ought to be partially credited with the improvement in 'pain and discomfort' associated with tuberculosis (which, like governmen t help above, improved from 'poor' to Results: Qualitative: Tuberculosis - 242 - 'some' quality of life between 1900 and 1925). The most important mechanism for this improvement is related to the expansion and improve ment in treatment facilities for tuberculosis, generated by the state subsidising th e provision of treatment for tuberculosis. E.g. under the 1911 Finance Act \u00a31,500,000 was provided for the building of sanatoria and, under the 1912 National Health Insurance Act funds were p rovided for the treatment of tuberculosis and, the 1916 Tuberculosis (Domiciliary Treatment i n England) Order enabled treatment in the home in an attempt to alleviate the shortages i n sanatoriums. During this period the efforts and campaigns of cha rities continued to provide a contribution to the plight of tuberculosis sufferers and as a resul t continued to yield a 'fair' quality of life for tuberculosis patients, regarding 'recognition and awareness' (this is shown as EuroQol = 3 for recognition/ awareness in 1925 in Table 7.2.1). The culmination of these developments and persisten t frustrations was an improvement in the 'aggregate average quality of life' associated with tuberculosis: from 'poor' in 1900 to 'some' in 1925 (this is shown in the final row of Table 7. 2.1, where the EuroQol rank improves from 5 to 4). 7.2.3 Nineteen Fifty By the middle of the twentieth century improvement in the health and welfare related quality of life for tuberculosis sufferers had made signifi cant progress: Table 7.2.1 highlights that nearly every variable enjoyed an improved EuroQol r ank between 1925 and 1950. The most impressive improvements were related to 'medical developments' . By 1950 streptomycin had been established and was widely av ailable. However, this antibiotic did not provide a universal cure for tuberculosis (due to r esistance problems), and it was not until 1975 that this aggregate 'health developments' variable achieved 'complete' quality of life for tuberculosis sufferers. Nonetheless, by 1950 this 'cure' sub-variable of 'health developments' had improved from a level of 'no' quality of life t o a level of 'some' and was rapidly on the way to 'complete' quality of life. This development drove the improvement in overall 'health developments' from 'poor' in 1900 and 1925 to 'some' by 1950. Results: Qualitative: Tuberculosis - 243 - As a result of the improved medical profile associa ted with tuberculosis, the pain, discomfort, anxiety, depression and adverse social circumstance s triggered by tuberculosis had all improved by 1950 (shown in Table 7.2.1 as the impro ving EuroQol rank for the 'ability to lead' a normal life variable and associated sub-variable s). However, because streptomycin did not actually provide a universal cure and as a resu lt of the newness of this treatment, the general stress and burden associated with tuberculo sis welfare was still only at a level of 'some' quality for the 'ability to lead a normal life' . The 'pain and discomfort' associated with tuberculosis had improved to a level of 'fair' qual ity of life for tuberculosis sufferers (shown in Table 7.2.1 as EuroQol rank = 3). By 1958 the work of charities and committees and va rious organisations had helped to highlight the conditions and additional needs assoc iated with tuberculosis and to an extent provide these accordingly, and therefore by 1950 ch arities were providing 'good' quality of life. The government also improved their contributi ons to tuberculosis welfare during this period. The main contributions from the state were an improvement in medical access for tuberculosis sufferers and an improvement in welfar e payments, which also improved the standards of living associated with tuberculosis. H owever, there still were numerous flaws in legislation and the state's approach to the problem s of tuberculosis sufferers, such that 'government initiatives and help' had only reached 'fair' levels of quality of life for tuberculosis sufferers. As a direct result of government and charity aid an d also a reduced severity of tuberculosis (as a result of medical advances), the 'financial burden' of tuberculosis had declined and this variable was now associated with 'fair' levels of q uality of life. Therefore, by 1950 the most widespread range of twe ntieth century improvements had occurred for the health and welfare quality of life for tuberculosis sufferers. This can be largely attributed to the early developments in ant ibiotics that had begun to provide a cure and valuable improvements in the profile of tuberculosi s. As a result of these far-reaching developments the overall or 'aggregate average quality of life' associated with tuberculosis had reached 'fair' levels by 1950 (shown in the fin al row of Table 7.2.1 as EuroQol rank = 3). Results: Qualitative: Tuberculosis - 244 - 7.2.4 Nineteen Seventy-Five The most remarkable and important improvement in th e tuberculosis story had been achieved by 1975. In the 1960s tuberculosis therapy became c ommon place and changed the entire aetiology and pathogenesis of tuberculosis, such th at this disease was no longer associated with death. Hence, by 1975 the 'cure' for tuberculosis had achieved 'complete' quality o f life levels. This was not the case for the 'understanding' of the disease and 'treatment' , largely because there was still evidence of problems of notificatio n and therapy and although the new antibiotics were able to prevent mortality they sti ll had adverse side effects which detract from overall quality of life. However, these variables h ad improved in general and particularly in comparison to the levels they were at during earlie r eras of the twentieth century. By 1975 'understanding' and 'treatment' of tuberculosis had reached 'good' levels. Therefo re, by 1975 overall levels of 'health development' had reached 'good' levels of quality of life for tuberculosis sufferers. These improvements in 'medical developments' had a positive impact on the 'pain' and 'anxiety' associated with tuberculosis, which both had also improved to 'good' levels by 1975. Further improvements were evident in the 'financial burden' and 'social difficulties' related to tuberculosis, which had improved to 'complete' leve ls of quality of life. This meant that the overall 'ability to lead a normal life' , despite having the tuberculosis disease had impro ved to 'complete' levels. By 1975 there had been no genuine advances in 'government initiatives' beyond 1950s levels. The state was providing the curative medical therap y which provided a significant contribution to improved quality of life, but this was evident i n 1950 under the 1948 National Health Service Act. Therefore, the level of government ini tiatives remained at 'fair' quality of life for tuberculosis sufferers. Finally, the work of charities and committees in ra ising 'recognition and awareness' , which had been so fundamental in early quality of life im provements for tuberculosis sufferers, declined significantly in importance during this ne w era, when tuberculosis was curable. Charities and committees were still evident but the ir importance and popularity had declined Results: Qualitative: Tuberculosis - 245 - substantially and they were therefore unable to pla y as much of a role as they had in previous times. Consequently, the contribution for 'recognition and awareness' worsened from 'good' levels in 1950 to 'fair' levels in 1975. However, i t should be noted that the major reason for this is positive. I.e. recognition and awareness di minished because tuberculosis was no longer a subject of concern to the population. Although it could be argued that this decline was too exaggerated when considering the re-emergence of tu berculosis in the later years of the twentieth century. Therefore, the combination of these developments me ant that the 'aggregate average quality of life' facing 1975 tuberculosis sufferers had reached 'go od' levels. 7.2.5 Two Thousand By the close of the twentieth century there had bee n no further improvements (upon the 1975 level) in health and welfare related quality of lif e for tuberculosis sufferers. This is not to say that the conditions did not improve slightly, as th ey did, but it was more a micro consolidation of earlier developments rather than any macro achie vements. Despite the void of any further EuroQol rank improv ements in the last era of the twentieth century, those which had been evident by 1975 ought to receive credit for their substantial contribution to the quality of life associated with tuberculosis, this is most true for 'medical developments' and least for 'government initiatives' . The culmination of this progress meant that during the twentieth century the 'aggregate average quality of life' associated with tuberculosis improved from 'poor' to 'good' levels and in doing so provided one of the most significant contributions to standards of living fo r the twentieth century English population. These improvements in the aggregate average EuroQol have facilitated equally far reaching improvements in the QALY. Table 7.2.1 highlights th at, the tuberculosis QALY improved from 0.3333 of a healthy life year (which is repres ented as 1) to 0.8333 of a healthy life year. Hence, in 1900 the collection of health and welfare standards of living meant that tuberculosis sufferers only enjoyed about 30 percent of a health y life year. By the year 2000, improvements largely in health but also welfare enabled the stan dards of living associated with tuberculosis to improve to a level that represents about 80 perc ent of a full healthy life year. The numerical indices will be utilised below in the wider QALE me thodology in order to estimate the value Results: Qualitative: Tuberculosis - 246 - of the above improvements in the quality of life as sociated with tuberculosis, which was extensive.

By the year 2000 cancer was more feared (as it was seen as the fundamental killer, for example, several population surveys have shown that cancer is perceived with more alarm and considered more seriously than any other disease) but was less disabling, unmanageable, painful and fatal662 . This outcome, which is very valuable for the population was created by the developments in medical technology, government initiatives and the work and campaigning of chariti es. The twentieth century transition of these developments, documented by the EuroQol standardise d spectrum, are shown in the table below. 662 Fallowfield, \"Breast Cancer\", p. 4 Results: Qualitative: Cancer - 248 - Table 7.3.1: EuroQol results for breast and stomach cancer and EuroQol aggregate average conversion into QALY Breast Cancer: EuroQol Variable Breast Cancer: Euro Qol Score and Equivalent QALY 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 Government initiatives and help 6 6 4 3 3 Recognition/ awareness 6 4 4 3 2 Health developments 5 5 4 3 2 Pain and discomfort 5 5 4 3 2 Ability to lead a normal life 5 4 4 4 3 Aggregate Average EuroQol Score Equivalent QALY 5 0.3333 5 Stomach Cancer: Eu roQol Score and Equivalent QALY 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 Government initiatives and help 6 6 4 3 3 Recognition/ awareness 6 4 4 3 2 Health developments 5 5 4 3 3 Pain and discomfort 5 5 4 3 3 Ability to lead a normal life 5 4 4 4 3 Aggregate Average EuroQol Score Equivalent QALY 5 0.3333 5 0.3333 0.6667 3 Table 7.3.1 the aggregate average is calcu lated as the average score (to the nearest whole nu mber) of the key variables: government initiatives and help, rec ognition/ awareness, health developments, pain and discomfort, ability to lead a normal life. Health d evelopments and ability to lead a normal life varia ble scores are calculated as the average of the sub-variables in e ach category. The sub-variables for cancer are the same as those presented in Table 7.2.1 for tuberculosis, but are not presented here and the following text provides no crucial reference to these sub-variables. 7.3.1 Nineteen Hundred In 1900 cancer sufferers were not a recognised or p rominent group. There were no 'government initiatives' to help prevent, treat or cure cancer (embodied by 'no' quality of life associated with 'government initiatives and help' in Table 7.3.1: EuroQol rank = 6) and cancer charities had not been established (embodied by 'no ' quality of life associated with 'recognition/ awareness' in Table 7.3.1: EuroQol rank = 6). The state of me dical technology was largely primitive as concepts of prevention, sc reening, comprehensive treatment (e.g. adjuvant therapy) and pain relief had not yet been coined in relation to cancer (embodied by Results: Qualitative: Cancer - 249 - 'poor' quality of life associated with 'health developments' and 'pain and discomfort' in Table 7.3.1: EuroQol rank = 5). This meant that the 'aggregate average quality of life' experienced by cancer sufferers in1900 was 'poor ' (embodied by EuroQol = 5 for the 'aggregate average quality of life' in the last row of Table 7.3.1). Standards of living had been s lightly improved by limited 'health developments' namely, surgery and x-rays. And, comparatively spe aking (to the end of the century) notions of healthy life years and the hyst eria associated with cancer had not become commonplace, which alleviated some of the perceived adversities of cancer. During the early 1900s, the English population was only just departi ng from an age of epidemics which entailed widespread mortality at relatively young a ges and therefore the depression and anxiety which had been so closely linked to cancer by the 1970s was not yet evident. 7.3.2 Nineteen Twenty-Five This overall quality of life situation for cancer s ufferers had not really improved by 1925. Early developments were being made by cancer charit ies: the Cancer Research Fund had been established and was operational and the British Emp ire Cancer Campaign for Research (BECC) began to invest in detailed research to try and identify the causes of cancer 663 . Early developments were also being made in the treatment of cancer: the introduction of radium was laying the initial foundations for radiotherapy. Th ese two developments provided small improvements in the quality of life associated with 'recognition/ awareness' and the 'ability to lead a normal life' . However the overall or 'aggregate average quality of life' associated with cancer was still 'poor' in 1975. 7.3.3 Nineteen Twenty-Five to Nineteen Fifty By the middle of the twentieth century there had be en many valuable developments in the treatment of cancer and also provisions by the gove rnment to aid the battle against this disease. Many of these developments were the fruiti on of earlier inventions and also the initial benefit of new post war inventions and intervention s. The 1939 Cancer Act provided an increase in 'government initiatives and help' through its aim to ensure that every cancer patient received the medical attention they require d, even though the provision of this Act was 663 Porter, \"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medi cine\", p. 335 Results: Qualitative: Cancer - 250 - not implemented until the introduction of the NHS i n 1948. The policies of the NHS provided an important boost to the quality of life faced by cancer sufferers as it meant that treatment for their illness became more accessible, which in turn improved their prognosis and the negative effects that cancer would have had upon quality of life. However, services and provisions were by no means ideal and treatment options were severe ly limited. Therefore government changed their position from 'no' help towards impro ving the cancer related quality of life to 'some' help (shown in Table 7.3.1 as an improved Eu roQol rank, from 6 to 4). The most important development for cancer in 1950 w ere the initial breakthroughs associated with medical technology, which improved the 'health developments' and 'pain and discomfort' related standards of living for cancer from 'poor' to 'some' quality of life. Improvements in 'government help' , 'pain and discomfort' and 'medical developments' (and the stability of all the other variables in T able 7.3.1) fostered an improved 'aggregate average quality of life' score for stomach and breast cancer: the quality o f life improved from 'poor' to 'some' between 1925 and 195 0. 7.3.4 Nineteen Fifty to Nineteen Seventy-Five The period between 1950 and 1975 included some of t he most important inventions and innovations of the twentieth century, from the pers pective of care for cancer that could improve the quality of life of sufferers. During th is time the 'government initiatives' provided an important contribution to knowledge through thei r sponsorship of numerous working parties that catered for many aspects of cancer, fr om the causes to diagnosis, statistical recording and analysis of cancer prevalence to the potential benefits of screening. This awareness, about the potential benefits of screenin g was shared by cancer charities. The fusion meant that by 1963 a screening programme had been i ntroduced for breast cancer, which was especially beneficial for quality of life, as it me ant that mammography could identify cancer much earlier and consequently reduce many of the po tential adversities of later stage cancer. The invention of the CAT scan in 1972 provided one of the most valuable weapons in the therapeutic armamentarium against cancer. This equi pment allowed a substantially heightened precision in scanning for cancer, thus improving th e prognosis and conditions faced by cancer sufferers and ultimately the quality of life associ ated with cancer. However the availability of Results: Qualitative: Cancer - 251 - CAT scans was severely limited, largely due to cost s \"which were beyond the capacities of many district health funds and hospitals\"664 . Nonetheless, this benefit facilitated developments in screening and improved this aspect of quality of life. During this time some of the largest gains were exp erienced in adjuvant therapies. Chemotherapy experienced many improvements that wer e largely facilitated by the post World War Two pharmaceutical revolution. Radium the rapy became much better understood and as a result much safer and more effective. It w as during this time that hormone therapy was introduced and significantly enhanced the manag ement of breast cancer. This meant that by 1975 adjuvant therapy for breast cancer had beco me increasingly systematic and was contributing to a reduction in recurrence rates and mortality from breast cancer 665 . This created a 'good' quality of life for 'medical developments' in breast cancer treatment and 'fair' quality of life for stomach cancer. The combination of these factors meant that by 1975 the overall or 'aggregate average quality of life' associated with cancer had reached levels that wer e considered 'fair'. 7.3.5 Nineteen Seventy-Five to Two Thousand During the final quarter of the twentieth century t he foundations of the aforementioned developments were built upon. Surgical techniques b ecame more advanced, which yielded more precision, accuracy and less disruption to an individual's 'ability to lead a normal life' . Another development in surgery was provided by reco nstructive surgery. This provided the biggest boost to breast cancer sufferers, who under went mastectomies. Hence, it was possible to remove the cancer, even a large stage II type tu mour, and not loose a breast as it was possible to recreate one artificially. Chemo, hormo ne and radio therapies also became more sophisticated and effective. The combination of the se developments and screening meant that many cases of breast cancer were survivable by the end of the century. This was not the case for stomach cancer, which, despite these improvemen ts, was still associated with a harrowing prognosis, even by the year 2000. 664 Webster, \"The National Health Service: A Political History\", p. 114 665 Richards et al, \"Variations in the Management and Survival of Women Under Fifty Years with Breast Can cer in the South East Thames Region\" Results: Qualitative: Cancer - 252 - Another development which provided a glimmer of hop e for eventual reduction in cancer rates and in an overly idealistic form, a potential cure was the increasing understanding of environmental factors and their ability to prevent the onset of cancer. The combination of these developments in prevention , screening and treatment created an improvement in 'medical developments' and 'pain and discomfort' which had reached 'good' (breast cancer) and 'fair' (stomach cancer) quality of life levels by the year 2000. Table 7.3.1 highlights how this marks an improvement over the 1 975 health related quality of life for breast cancer and that stomach cancer did not impro ve beyond its 1975 level. This emphasises the value of improvements in surgery and therapy fo r breast cancer. During the last decade of the twentieth century the government provided valuable initiatives, which were aimed at reducing the number of cancer d eaths through: improved screening (ensuring that all women between the ages of 50 and 64 received mammograms every three years, which continually achieved its targets since its introduction in 1988-1991 666 ), trying to educate the public about the risks of cancer, and t heir efforts to eliminate social inequalities in cancer incidence. The government should be complime nted with at least part of the improvements in the quality of life associated with cancer mortality and morbidity. However, the improvements in government efforts and NHS cancer treatment during the last quarter of the twentieth century were not far reach ing enough to improve 'government initiatives and help' related quality of life above levels that were 'fai r' for cancer sufferers. Hence, by the close of the twentieth century the go vernment had failed to achieve ideal or even 'good' levels of quality of life for cancer pa tients. This is largely a result of decades of under-investment in the people and equipment involv ed in the fight against cancer. The NHS has too few cancer specialists of every type for ex ample, at the close of the twentieth century, England had approximately eight oncologists per mil lion population, which is less than half the number in other comparable European countries 667 . All of these factors had contributed to England lagging behind comparable economies (namely , America and European Union members) in cancer survival rates at the end of the twentieth century and, consequently, not 666 The NHS breast cancer screening programme has cont inued to meet its target rates for uptake, recall, biopsy, benign biopsy, and detection of cancer. Qui nn et al, \"Changes in the Incidence of and Mortality from Breast Cancer in England and Wales since Introduct ion of Screening\", p. 1394 667 Government Papers, \"The NHS Cancer Plan, A Plan fo r Investment, A Plan for Reform\", p. 19 Results: Qualitative: Cancer - 253 - achieving any fundamental or genuine improvements i n government related quality of life during the last quarter of the twentieth century. During this time cancer charities enhanced their ef forts and there was increased collaboration between the two largest cancer charities: the Imper ial Cancer Research Fund and the Cancer Research Campaign, which helped the plight of cance r sufferers. This meant that charity support had achieved 'good' quality of life levels by the year 2000 for 'recognition and awareness' associated with stomach and breast cancer. 7.3.6 Two Thousand By the close of the twentieth century the 'aggregate average quality of life' associated with breast cancer had improved further to reach a level that could be considered to be 'good', and stomach cancer had improved to a lesser extent, to quality of life levels that were 'fair'. This should be considered as an important development fr om the 1900 level of 'poor', although less so for stomach cancer. The final row for the breast and stomach cancer sections in Table 7.3.1 shows the QALY equivalent of the aggregate EuroQol score, which evolved from 0.3333 in 1900 to 0.6777 in 2000 for stomach cancer and 0.833 3 for breast cancer. Both of these QALY transitions, although especially breast cancer, rep resent important developments in the quality of life for cancer sufferers. The precise value of this gain will be estimated below. Results: Quantitative - 254 - 8. Quantitative Findings This Chapter will contain the quantitative analysis that is evolved from the previous qualitative results. The twentieth century improvem ents that have been identified for morbidity (defined by the QALY weights which were t ransformed from EuroQol, above) and the improvements in life expectancy (defined by the death rate) will be considered here, in conjunction with other crucial facets of t he thesis' quantitative, extended willingness to pay or QALE methodology. The theoret ical details of the thesis' QALE methodology are provided in Chapter 3. Before this methodology is applied it is desirable to reiterate the key features and mechanics of this methodology, which will be achieved here, with the aid of the flow chart summary of the thesis' methodological process. This will also identify the location of all the componen ts of the QALE methodology (in earlier chapters of the thesis) and highlight the interacti on of these features in this quantitative section.

These processes are summarised here (in accordance with the numbering i n Figure 8.1). 1) Define measurement scale and select illnesses: A d etailed outline and justification of the thesis methodology and illnesses applied to this QA LE calculation is provided in Chapter 3. To summarise: the methodology used here is an or iginal adaptation of willingness to pay, where quality of life improvements in mortalit y and morbidity are valued, which forms an extended willingness to pay or quality adj usted life expectancy, QALE. The morbid states that are utilised in this QALE method ology are: blindness, tuberculosis, and breast and stomach cancer. A key contribution of th is measurement is the evaluation (and later quantification) of the quality of life associ ated with morbidity over the twentieth century. 2) Detailed qualitative review of C20th history of il lness: This provides an introduction to the thesis (and is subsequently presented in Part I of the thesis). This provides a valuable foundation for the more detailed and specific consi derations and claims of the thesis. This exercise is also valuable because it provides a pra ctical justification for the selection of the thesis illnesses. 3) Detailed qualitative analysis: The literature is c urrently void of any historical (pre 1970) QALY estimates for illnesses and therefore the thes is had to make an informed best estimate from reviewing major literature sources fo r the thesis morbid states (namely, breast and stomach cancer, tuberculosis and blindne ss). This warranted a comprehensive account of the conditions associated with the thesi s morbid states for different eras of the twentieth century, from a health and welfare perspe ctive for quality of life. This was formulated around the thesis' spectrum of key stand ardised variables: government help, recognition and awareness, health developments, pai n and discomfort, ability to lead a normal life (for an elaboration see Chapter 3: Tabl e 3.5 to 3.7). These considerations represent the main body of the thesis and are prese nted in Part II. 4) Summary EuroQol rank: In addition to a detailed an d standardised qualitative analysis about the health and welfare related quality of lif e of the thesis' morbid states, the thesis has also gauged these on a standardised spectrum of development, namely EuroQol. This was necessary so that the qualitative analysis (sum marised by EuroQol) could be evolved Results: Quantitative - 257 - into quantitative indices (summarised by the QALY). EuroQol is explained in more detail in Chapter 3 and applied in Chapter 7. 5) EuroQol rank (1-6) /barb2right QALY (0-1 or 0%-100%): This stage is crucial for t he quantitative thesis methodology because it provides the conversion from qualitative to quantitative. In doing this, it also provides one o f the thesis' key contributions to knowledge. Hence, the QALY is crucial for making qu antitative considerations about health improvements. The QALY is derived by applyin g the EuroQol standardised spectrum of development to all illnesses in all era s considered in the thesis. This has facilitated a quantitative index (QALY) from the de tailed qualitative analysis in the thesis (summarised by EuroQol). The summary EuroQol and su bsequent QALY are in Table 7.3.1 a nd the QALY summarised in the table below. Table 8.1: QALY estimates (derived from EuroQol ana lysis) for thesis illnesses and eras 668 Year QALY (as a proportion of one healthy life year ) Blind Breast cancer Stomach cancer Tuberculosis VSL represents the valuation for t he decline in mortality. It was therefore necessary to identify the most plausible VSL so that the twentieth century declined in mortality could be most accurately valu ed. This was achieved through adopting the VSL multiples that were presented by Miller's s tudy. The table below provides the VSL values utilised in the thesis, which uses the V SL multiple approach (VSL multiple * 668 See Appendix 12.6.1 and 12.6.2 for alternative QAL Y values and calculations. Results: Quantitative - 258 - GDP per capita at mid point) in order to yield the VSL. The rationale and selection of Miller's best VSL estimate are outline in Chapter 3 .

Hence, the VSHLY represents the valuation for the decline in morbidity and is a fun ction of the VSL and the QALY (for the selected illnesses and eras). The table below provi des the VSHLY values utilised in the thesis, which uses the VSL identified in Table 8.2 combined with the QALY values identified in Table 8.1 (average QALY of the era un der consideration, e.g. for breast cancer 1900-2000, the 1900 QALY = 0.3333 and 2000 Q ALY = 0.8333 and therefore, the average QALY for 1900-2000 = [0.3333 + 0.8333)] / 2 = 0.5833) for the associated illness and era (VSL * QALY = VSHLY) in order to yield the VSHLY. The explanation and justification for the VSHLY is outlined in Chapter 3. 669 Miller, \"Variations between Countries in Values of Statistical Life\", p. 180. See Appendix 12.1.1 for alternative 'High' and 'Low' VSL estimates used in the sensitivity analysis.

This QALE methodology is outlined in Equation 8.1 below. 670 See Appendix 12.1.1 (Diseases) and 12.1.2 (Disabil ity) for alternative 'High' and 'Low' VSHLY estimat es used in the sensitivity analysis Results: Quantitative - 260 - Equation 8.1: Summary of the thesis methodology: qu ality adjusted life expectancy (QALE) Willingness to Pay Morbidity (MB): MB WTP Considers increased quality of life with an illnes s or disability /barb2right MB WTP = VSHLY * population weighted fall in the burden of disease/disability (or the change in the morbidity burden ) = morbidity gain For MB WTP this would have to be calculated for each type of i llness and disability and their associated QALY ( ) This will then be combined with the equivalent info rmation for mortality improvements Willingness to Pay Mortality (MT): MT WTP Considers increased life expectancy /barb2right MT WTP = VSL * population weighted fall in the death rate (or the change in the mortality burden ) = mortality gain Quality Adjusted Life Expectancy (QALE): Such that MB WTP + MT WTP OR morbidity gain + mortality gain = QALE improvement: * ( *) ( [ ]) dc u c d\u00b5 \u00b5 =+ + + ( *) u c = the goods value of life, *c= consumption, = the pure rate of individual time preference, \u00b5= set of mortality rates, ( Pr[ =Condition D at t + k] * [QALY for D at t + k]) 10) Combined overall results = QALE: Hence, the QALE i s a function of the following: i) Morbidity Gain (QALY * prevalence yields the change in the morbidity burden. The change in the morbidity burden * VSHLY = morbidity gain). This is simultaneously valued with ii) Mortality Gain (change in the mortality bu rden [embodied in the death rate]*VSL = mortality gain). Results: Quantitative - 261 - This will provide results about the (monetary) valu e of improvements in 'quality adjusted life expectancy' (QALE), which is the combined meas ure of the mortality and morbidity gains and forms the basis of the thesis' extended w illingness to pay methodology. These results will be presented in absolute (monetary for m) and also as an additional proportion (percentage) to GDP growth for the era under consid eration. 11) Sensitivity analysis: This QALE result will be app lied to a series of sensitivity analyses in order to provide a range of results and escape f rom accusations of bias. This analysis has been designed to consider the most contentious vari ables in VSHLY range: The sources of contention for these variables are outlined in Chap ter 3. The thesis will overcome these as far as possible through considering a 'Hig h' and 'Low' value estimates as well as the existing 'Mid' estimate for these three variables (VSL, QALY and VSHLY). These calculations will require the QALE methodolog y to be reformulated (with alternative QALY, VSL and VSHLY values) and this wi ll entail recalculating the QALE in the same process as was explained above (from stage 5 to stage 10). 11d) Considerations about age weighting: The appeal and approach of this sensitivity analysis are outlined in Chapter 3. Ess entially, Murray's weights for different ages will be applied to the QALE results in order to provide estimates that adhere to claims of different QALE gain values for different ages. 12) Aggregate QALE results (presented as a range): Due to the subjective and often controversial nature of illness and welfare measure ment, the estimates of the burden of disease will be provided as a range of possible val ues and will be presented in a tentative fashion, whereby the reader will be invited to cons ider the results as a function of what they are willing to believe, rather than stating th e results as a definitive estimate. I.e. this approach will provide results that are dependent up on whether or not the reader will accept a given scenario. Chapter 8.3 will provide a range of estimates, based on the sensitivity analysis for the results in Chapters 8.1 and 8.2, f or the entire twentieth century (1900- 2000). The quantitative analysis (which has been explained above: through the flow chart worked example) will be applied to 'Disability' (i.e. blin dness in Chapter 8.2) and 'Disease' (i.e. Results: Quantitative - 262 - cancer and tuberculosis in Chapter 8.1) separately (i.e. in separate chapters) due to the subtle but profound differences in the aetiology, p rognosis, burden and ultimate measurement of illness linked with disease and disa bility. The most noteworthy difference between disease and disability is their relationship with death, whereby disease is more closely linked with death. Even though cases of disease are not necessarily resolved in death, as increasingly in the twentieth century they increasingly resulted in a cure, disability is not usually a dir ect cause of death. Following on from this observation is the generally more confined nature o f disease relative to the more ambiguous prognosis for disabilities. For example, tuberculosis and cancer are associated with a survival rate throughout the twentieth centu ry, usually five years from the date of diagnosis in the context of the thesis, which essen tially provides a time period for the burden of illness, which is either resolved in surv ival/cure or death. There is no equivalent notion for disability, where the average duration o f disability, in the context of the thesis, varied from 26 to 4 years 671 . Because of the different nature of disease and disa bility, the key quality of life considerations are also different. Hence, EuroQol ( the thesis' foundational measuring tool) is considering slightly different facets. For examp le, disability is much more concerned with rights and status experienced by sufferers whe reas quality of life associated with infectious disease is more affected by antibiotic t herapy. These distinctions and the key variables for measurement associated with disease a nd disability are explained in Table 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 in Chapter 3: Methodology. The res ult of this is that there is a slight variation in the QALY for disability and disease be cause the base measure (EuroQol) is measuring slightly different features. Although the burden of illness for disability and d isease are very similar and both equally crucial for the thesis' consideration of twentieth century quality of life it is necessary to consider them separately at a first approximation. Once this has been achieved it will be possible to combine these results, in Chapter 8.3 a nd Chapter 9. This is possible because Chapter 8.3 is a summary and Chapter 9 makes more b road and generalised considerations, which are based on conservative estimates from the major sources of illness burden (analysed in detail in the thesis) in order to extr apolate forward from the thesis illness 671 See Appendix 12.13.1 for an elaboration Results: Quantitative - 263 - results and provide a lower bound estimate about th e value of improved quality of life associated with illness for all morbidity and morta lity in twentieth century England. Chapter 8.1 will contain the more detailed quantita tive disease (tuberculosis and cancer) analysis. Chapter 8.2 will make the same quantitati ve considerations for the thesis' sample disability, blindness. Chapter 8.3 will provide an aggregate (disease and disability) quantitative summary and range or results about the twentieth century value of QALE gains for the diseases and disability considered in the thesis. This will enable the reader to identify their most preferred QALE gain result from the extensive range (i.e. this represents stage 12 in the flow chart example). The se results from Chapter 8 will then be used as the foundation for the Extended Results cal culations in Chapter 9.

These developments have provided important contributions to the quality of life of the population and to wider, more Fisherian notions of economic de velopment 672 . This chapter will provide the quantitative estimates of the value of these health improvements, through applying the QALE methodology to the thesis disease s: breast and stomach cancer and tuberculosis. Through applying the QALE methodology to the mortal ity and morbidity data and providing a value for the mortality and morbidity g ain this chapter will provide a first approximation about the (monetary) value of increas ed life expectancy and improved quality of life associated with health. After the m ethodology has been applied to the data and the QALE gain identified, it will be possible t o consider a broader range of QALE gain results through recalculating the QALE with a range of different weights for the most tenuous variables within the QALE methodology: the VSL, VSHLY and QALY. This sensitivity analysis represents an important part o f the thesis' quantitative results as this exercise will generate 27 estimates (instead of one ) for each disease and era and in aggregate, 405 estimates (instead of 15) 673 . These sensitivity analyses will be further compleme nted through applying all of the above ranges of results to an age-weighting function. Thi s will yield results about the range of possible (monetary) values of improved health, from an un-weighted and age-weighted perspective. The appeal of such considerations has been outlined in Chapter 3. 672 Fisherian growth is a notion that was coined by No rdhaus (1999) and is defined as the maximum amount that a nation can consume while ensuring that members of all future generations can have life tim e utility that is at least as high as that of curre nt generations. When this yardstick is utilised, li fe expectancy and in the context of the thesis, quality adjusted life expectancy, are included in the production fun ction and the value of improvements in mortality ca n be accounted, in terms of consumption.\" 673 Calculation: 27 results for three illnesses and fi ve eras = (27*3)*5 = 405 versus one result for thre e illnesses for five years = (1*3)*5 = 15. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 265 - It will then be possible to add further significanc e to these results through considering them in conjunction with the growth of national income ( represented as Gross Domestic Product [GDP hereafter] or most frequently, GDP per capita [GDP pc] in the thesis) for different eras during the twentieth century. This will add si gnificance to the previously identified QALE gain for disease through standardising the val ue of improved health. This exercise will authenticate Fisherian type claims about the d esirability of including health in some form of extended national income measure, because t he contribution of improved health to economic growth, identified here for twentieth cent ury England, has been considerable compared to GDP per capita only (as shown by Table 8.1.15). 8.1.1 Primary Valuation of Improvements in Morbidit y The first stage in valuing morbidity improvements i s the calculations of the QALY. Chapter 7 of the thesis provides the qualitative su mmary (of Part II) and also the first stage in evolving these qualitative interpretations into quantitative indices, through using EuroQol to summarise these developments. Once the E uroQol rank had been identified, it was converted into a QALY (this represents stage 5 in the previous flow chart example). The results of this conversion for the thesis disea ses are shown above, in Table 8.1, where the QALY is reported for the thesis diseases for di fferent eras of the twentieth century. The bounds of the QALY are 0.1 and 1, whereby 1 is a full healthy life year and zero approximates death. Therefore the closer the QALY i s to 1, the better the quality of life illness sufferers were experiencing. In Table 8.1 t uberculosis reached a level very close to 1 or 100 percent of a healthy life year (0.8333 or 83 percent by 1975) and stomach cancer remained at a much less favourable standard, closer to 50 percent of a healthy life year (0.6667 or 67 percent in 2000). Breast cancer, like tuberculosis, also experienced important improvements in quality of life (0.8333 or 83 perce nt by 2000). These improvements have occurred for numerous reasons, which have been anal ysed in previous qualitative chapters of the thesis 674 . When this QALY is utilised in the wider thesis QALE methodology (i.e. stages 8, 9 and 10 in the flow chart example above) it will be compute d inversely. For example, breast cancer in 1900 achieved a QALY of 0.3333 (which has been e volved from a EuroQol rank of 5 = 'poor quality of life' (see Tables 7.3.1 and 8.1 ab ove) in the QALE methodology the QALY will be computed as 1 - QALY = 1 - 0.3333 = 0. 6667. This is because of the 674 See Part II and Chapter 7 of the thesis Results: Quantitative: Disease - 266 - difference in approach of measurement between the E uroQol QALY and the subsequent QALY in the QALE methodology. Although these are me asuring the same features, they are considering these features from different angle s: in the thesis EuroQol (and the subsequent thesis QALY) is measuring the fraction o f a healthy life year that is achieved and the QALE methodology is considering the QALY as an adjustment for the fraction of a healthy life year that is lost. Therefore, to sta ndardise the thesis QALY in the QALE calculation it is necessary to calculate 1-(EuroQol ) QALY. In the next stage of the thesis QALE methodology th ese QALY results can be combined with prevalence for the associated disease and era, in order to calculate the morbidity burden, which comprises the number of disease suffe rers (prevalence) multiplied by the burden (i.e. 1-QALY in the context of the QALE meth odology considering the amount of life year lost [rather than the initial EuroQol QAL Y considering how much of a life year gained]) of this disease (QALY). In an attempt to generate the most precise estimate s of the morbidity burden (= prevalence*QALY) there are two additional specifica tion for the morbidity burden calculation: i) the burden and prevalence are calcu lated by age group in order to provide more detailed estimates 675 , and ii) these age specific morbidity burden estim ates are standardised for the age distribution across the po pulation structure at the start and end point of the era under consideration. This process yields two sets of results for any era (the change in the morbidity rate [or morbidity burden b y age relative to the population by age] fixed to either the start [T1] point or end [T2] po int population), which are then averaged in order to present the most indicative estimate ab out the change in the burden of disease, while accounting for the changing age structure of the population between the start and end point in any era. This represents a standard weighi ng/index number process and using the mid-point or average represents an orthodox approac h. The morbidity burden results differ for the start a nd end point populations because of the distribution of morbidity across ages. E.g. in the thesis breast and stomach cancer represent diseases that are most prevalent at the oldest ages : if there is a significant increase in the old age population (as there was over the twentieth century), then the rate of this morbidity burden will be less at the end point (2000) than at the start (1900) because the rate represents the number of morbidity incidents per po pulation size. Therefore, to try and 675 The data is divided into the following - standardise these external influences the thesis wi ll consider the rate for the both the start and end point population structures and use the ave rage of these values as the final morbidity burden estimate. This process is desirabl e as it provides additional necessary detail about the morbidity environment, standardise d to the era being considered. This process of calculation will be applied to the thesis diseases, but not the disability as there is not (age-specific prevalence) data of enou gh detail to perform such calculations. After the morbidity burden has been identified for different eras it will be possible to identify the change in the morbidity burden between these eras. This change in the morbidity burden will then be valued (using the VSH LY) in order to estimate the morbidity gain, which is essentially the value of a decrease in the morbidity burden over time. With reference to the flow chart example at t he start of Chapter 8, identifying the value of the morbidity gain (change in the morbidit y burden * VSHLY) represents stage 9. Hence, in order to estimate the morbidity gain, the change in the morbidity burden needs to be valued. This is achieved through establishing th e VSHLY and applying it to the change in the morbidity burden. The VSHLY is equated throu gh combining the VSL and the QALY for the illness and period being considered (V SL * QALY = VSHLY). Calculating the VSHLY represents stage 7 in the above flow char t (Figure 8.1) explanation and Table 8.3 provides the calculations and result of the VSH LY. Because of the level of detail in the base morbidit y burden calculations (as a result of the age standardised population considerations explaine d above) only the final results (about the change in the morbidity burden) will be present ed here. However, this will be supplemented by a detailed worked example of this m eticulous methodological process utilised in the thesis in order to estimate the mos t accurate morbidity gain (see Table 8.1.2.i and 8.1.2.ii). The detailed calculations are shown in Appendix 12.3. (In reference to the flow chart analysis above, this worked example prov ides a more detailed explanation of stage 9). Once the morbidity burden changes have be en identified they will be applied with the VSHLY to determine the morbidity gain. This sta ge of the calculation will be shown below (in Tables 8.1.3, 8.1.4 and 8.1.5), after the worked example indicating the calculation of the morbidity burden change. This wo rked example will consider breast cancer for 1900-2000. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 268 - The morbidity burden change for breast cancer betwe en 1900 and 2000 is established through considering the prevalence of breast cancer multiplied by the QALY for breast cancer at the start and end point of the period: 19 00 and 2000. In an effort to yield the most accurate results, this calculation will be done on an age standardised population basis. Table 8.1.1 shows the non-age standardised, or aggr egate prevalence and QALY information. For example, the aggregate morbidity b urden for breast cancer in 1900 and 2000: 15,980 cases of breast cancer in 1900 with a (1-QALY) of 0.6667 (in simplistic aggregate terms, this translates into a morbidity b urden of 10,654 cases {15,980 * [1 - 0.3333=] QALY for calc purposes 676 = 10,654) versus the 2000 burden: 87,915 cases of breast cancer with a (1-QALY) of 0.1667 which translates into a morbidity burden of 14,655 cases (87,915 * [1-0.8333 =] 0.1667 = 14,655). These aggregate key components for the the sis disease morbidity burdens (aggregate prevalence and QALY) are shown in the ta ble below. Table 8.1.1: Calculation of morbidity burden of the sis diseases: breast cancer, stomach cancer and tuberculosis 677 Year Breast Cancer Stomach Cancer Tuberculosis Prevalence a subtle and important trend . For modern type illnesses, i.e. breast and stomach cancer, a major improvement in the morb idity burden (shown below in Tables 8.1.3 and 8.1.4) is facilitated by an improved QALY as the prevalence generally increases. This trend is most pronounced for breast cancer (an d not consistently evident for stomach cancer), due to both a significant increase in prev alence and an improvement in the QALY (especially after 1950). This trend is crucial beca use it illustrates one of the key claims of the thesis: even though the prevalence of disease a nd disability increased as the twentieth 676 Considering the inverse QALY is necessary when cal culating prevalence, because EuroQol in the thesis (and the subsequent thesis QALY) is measuring the fraction of a healthy life year that is achieve d and the QALE methodology is considering the QALY as an adjustment for the fraction of a healthy life year that is lost. Therefore, to standardise the thesis QALY in the QALE calculation it is necessary to cal culate 1-(EuroQol) QALY. I.e. EuroQol and the subsequent thesis QALY consider how much of a life year, the QALY in the QALE methodology considers th e burden or how much of an unhealthy life year /barb2right 1-(EuroQol) QALY = QALY in QALE methodology. 677 Table 8.1.1 considers the burden of morbidity for different eras of the twentieth century, which is c alculated by considering the prevalence multiplied by the inverse QALY. The more detailed and age-specifi c calculations of the morbidity burden see Appendix 12.2. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 269 - century unfolded the quality of life associated wit h these diseases and disabilities improved. Although many have speculated whether thi s phenomenon is genuine, the results contained in this thesis provide a more sub stantiated indication about the accuracy of such speculation. Table 8.1.1 also shows a series of trends which all indicate an improvement in the burden of disease as the twentieth century unfolded. Tuber culosis displays the most straightforward example of this claim, where the pr evalence fell consistently and markedly during the twentieth century and the QALY experienc ed equally impressive improvements, such that the morbidity burden of tuberculosis was minor by 2000 (see Table 8.1.5). Breast and stomach cancer show more mixed and seemingly co ntradictory (stomach cancer) results. For stomach cancer there was an improvemen t in the morbidity burden, which was largely a result of a fall in prevalence as the QAL Y associated with stomach cancer did not improve substantially over time. Conversely, breast cancer shows a large increase in prevalence which was compensated by far reaching im provements in the QALY, to the extent that the morbidity burden began to decline f rom 1950 onwards, to such a degree that the year 2000 morbidity burden (prevalence*QALY) ha d returned to a level similar to the year 1900 morbidity burden. The next stage of the thesis methodology is to cons ider this burden as a rate of the population for which it relates. Table 8.1.2.i cons iders the morbidity rate or age specific morbidity index (shown as MBR/1000) which is calcul ated through dividing the morbidity burden number by the population number for the corr esponding age group. Also shown in Table 8.1.2.i is the percentage of population by ag e group for 1900 (T1) and 2000 (T2). Results: Quantitative: Disease - 270 - 8.1.2.i: Morbidity burden rate (morbidity/populatio n) by age: breast cancer: 1900 and 2000 678 1900: Breast Cancer 2000: Breast Cancer Age % Population Age % Once the calculations in Table 8.1.2.i have been ma de, the morbidity burden - standardised to the age structure of the population - has been i dentified for the start (TI) and end (T2) point of the period. Also the distribution of the p opulation has been identified for T1 and T2. The next stage in the QALE calculation (for morbidi ty) is to calculate the difference (or change) in the morbidity burden (MBR/1000) between T1 and T2. This is derived by identifying the weighted morbidity rates (WTD MBR) for T1 and T2, which is achieved by multiplying the relevant MBR/1000 and % population. The process and result of this calculation is shown below in Table 8.1.2.ii, where the difference in MBR/1000 (fixed to the population at the start and end point) is calcu lated to estimate the change in the morbidity burden (standardised for the population). The final stage of this calculation is to convert the result from a rate into a number, shown in Table 8.1.2.ii as 'Morbidity Burden'. This conversion was achieved through multiplying th e 'Decrease/1000' (of the WTD MBR) by the relevant population number. The T1 and T2 'Morbidity Burden' numbers are averaged in the next stage of the thesis methodolog y (see Table 8.1.3, 8.1.4, 8.1.5). The Table below makes the 1900-2000 breast cancer morbi dity burden change calculations fixed to the start point (T1) population and then t he end point (T2) population. 678 Extract from Appendix 12.3 and 13.1 Results: Quantitative: Disease - 271 - Table 8.1.2.ii: Morbidity burden rate (morbidity/po pulation) and morbidity burden change calculation b y age: breast cancer: 1900-2000 679 1900-2000: Fixed to MBR % Pop MBR/1000 WTD MBR Decrease/1000 1900 1900&1900 1900 2000 1900&2000 0-4 0.114068 0 0 0.114068 0 0 0 0 5-9 0.107086 0 0 0.107086 0 0 0 0 10-14 0.102585 0 0 0 0 MBR % Pop MBR/1000 WTD MBR Decrease/1000 2000 2000&1900 2000 2000 2000&2000 0-4 0.060645 0 0 0.060645 0 0 0 0 5-9 0.064774 0 0 0.064774 0 0 0 0 10-14 0.065449 0 0 0 0 13.1 Results: Quantitative: Disease - 272 - Hence, between 1900 and 2000 the morbidity burden o f breast cancer decreased by 8931 (fixed to start point [T1]) - 13,836 (fixed to end point [T2]). This represents the change in the morbidity burden. Hence, it is this change in t he morbidity burden (prevalence*QALY, for the age standardised population) of breast canc er shown in Tables 8.1.2.i and 8.1.2.ii (and all other morbid states in the thesis) that is then valued between different eras (this can be done between any two eras) to yield the morb idity gain. As has been explained above, the next stage in the thesis QALE methodology is to value the change in the morbidity burden in order to esti mate the morbidity gain. In order to identify the morbidity gain (which is the value of the change in the morbidity burden), it is necessary to identify the value of a statistically healthy life year (VSHLY) and apply this to the morbidity burden change. The calculation of the VSHLY has been outlined above, as stage 7 in the flow chart example, and in Table 8.3 . Continuing with the 1900-2000 breast cancer example , the VSHLY is identified by determining the VSL multiplied by the average QALY for the period. The VSL is determined through identifying the most reasonable approximate of a VSL multiple value and the GDP per capita at the mid-point of the peri od being considered 680 . These two numbers are then multiplied together to provide the VSL. Therefore (as in Table 8.2), the VSL multiple = 128 and GDP per capita in 1950 (mid- point between 1900 and 2000) = 6,907 (1990 international $) and multiplied togethe r to yield the VSL = 0.88 (millions of 1990 international $). The VSHLY is the sum of the VSL (0.88 million) multiplied by the QALY for 1900-2000, which is 0.5833 (shown in Table 8.3). Hence, the VSHLY for 1900- 2000 breast cancer is 0.88*0.5833 = 0.51 (millions of 1990 international $). The morbidity gain can now be calculated through co mbining the change in morbidity burdens (shown above in bold in Table 8.1.2.ii) wit h the VSHLY ([8931 * 0.51 + 13,836 * 0.51]/2), which yields an average morbidity gain of 5,806 (millions of 1990 international $). This represents the value of an improved breast cancer burden between 1900 and 2000. This process and result is shown in the final row o f Table 8.1.4, for breast cancer. Calculation of the morbidity gain is shown for all illnesses and eras in the thesis in Tables 8.1.3, 8.1.4, and 8.1.5, below. 680 See Chapter 3 for a more detailed explanation abou t the VSL utilised in the thesis. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 273 - Once the morbidity gain has been identified it can be combined with the mortality gain in order to calculate the QALE gain. This process and the evaluation of the mortality gain will be explained below. First, the above example (for breast cancer 1900-20 00) will be animated through providing the results about the morbidity gain for the thesis illnesses. As has been outlined above, this is shown in a summarised format (from the base results in appendices 12.3, 12.4, and 13.1) because of the intricacy of the base calculat ions: the thesis diseases have been considered by age, i.e. the morbidity burden rate h as been considered for each age subsequent percentage of the population that this age group re presented. It was necessary to weight these calculations to age profiles at the start and end point (T1 and T2, respectively) of the populations being considered. This process yields t wo sets of results (T1 and T2) for the change in the morbidity burden and the subsequent m orbidity gain. The reason for the difference in these results is the different distri bution of the population across age groups coupled with the different decline in the morbidity burden for different age groups over time. E.g. in 1900 there was a greater proportion o f the population in the youngest age groups compared to 2000: if these youngest age grou ps experienced significant declines in morbidity then results that are fixed to the popula tion distribution in 1900 will yield a greater value. In order to avoid any bias caused by this feature the thesis will utilise the mid point between these two sets of results. The de tailed calculations for this process are contained in appendices 12.3 and 13.1. The summaris ed results of this analysis are shown in the series of tables below (and Appendix 12.4). Table 8.1.3, 8.1.4 and 8.1.5 consider the value of declines in the burden of morbidity through: first, applying the above exercise of iden tifying the change in the morbidity burden (prevalence * QALY) weighted to the start (T 1) and end (T2) point populations, which is then applied to the VSHLY estimate to gene rate the monetary value of improvements in morbidity, the morbidity gain. Thes e are then averaged through identifying the mid point between the T1 and T2 mor bidity gain, in order to provide a single morbidity gain estimate (morbidity burden ch ange 1 * VSHLY = morbidity gain 1 and morbidity change 2 * VSHLY= morbidity gain 2 /barb2right [morbidity gain 1 + morbidity gain 2] / 2 = morbidity gain). Results: Quantitative: Disease - 274 - It is noteworthy that in all of the tables in Chapt er 8 and 9, that the result for 1900-2000 does not equal the sum of the previous five entries in these tables. This is because all of these entries are considering averages that relate to the specific numbers of each period. For example, the VSL and VSHLY and QALY and prevale nce all differ for each era (i.e. 1900-2000 is not simply summing the results of all the other eras) and the subsequent interaction in the methodology yields different ave rage estimates. Furthermore, when considering growth (which is achieved in Table 8.1. 14, 8.1.15, 8.2.8, 8.3.4, and 9.3) the methodology is considering a compound average rate of growth, which again considers an average (rate) that is different for each computati on of the twentieth century 681 . Table 8.1.3: Morbidity gain (morbidity burden chang e*VSHLY): monetary value of improvements in the burden of morbidity: stomach ca ncer (millions of 1990 international $) 682 Period Morbidity Burden Change 1 Morbidity Burden Change 2 VSHLY Morbidity Gain T1 Morbidity Gain T2 Morbidity Gain Average 1116 1510 0.21 234 morbidity gain. Morbidit y burden 1 and 2 are calculated in appendices 12.3 and 13.1 (which consider the morbid ity burden rate change for the age distribution of the population, in the same format as Table 8.1.2.i and ii). The morbidity burden changes 1 and 2 are calculated as the differ ence in the morbidity burden in T1 versus T2, fixed to the corresponding age distribut ion of the population in T1 (morbidity change 1) and T2 (morbidity change 2). The morbidit y gain T1 and T2 are the result of: morbidity burden change 1 and 2 multiplied by the V SHLY. The morbidity gain average is the median of morbidity gain T1 and morbidity gain T2. The most far reaching morbidity gains related to st omach cancer (in Table 8.1.3 above) were evident for 1900-2000. This was closely follow ed by the morbidity gains in the 681 This note applies to all of the tables in this res ults section, which consider the morbidity, mortali ty and QALE gain consider the 1950-1975, 1975-2000 an d 1900-2000. 682 For detailed calculations underlying the results i n Table 8.13 see Appendix 12.3 and 13.1. For summar y results shown in Table 8.1.3 see Appendix 12.4. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 275 - second half of the twentieth century: 1950-1975 and 1975-2000. The reasons for the chronology of this trend are largely related to qua lity of life and prevalence improvements. Hence, Table 8.1.1 implies that between 1950 and 19 75 there was the greatest decline in the morbidity burden as a result of reductions in p revalence (17,300 in 1950 declined to 14,098 in 1975) and, more importantly, the improvin g QALY (the burden, represented by 1-QALY improved from [in QALE terms, a loss of] 0.5 000 to only 0.3333 of a healthy life year). The morbidity gain in the following period, 1975-2000, was a function of only reductions in prevalence as there was no QALY impro vement. The morbidity gain for 1900-2000, which was the most far reaching, was a r esult of both improved prevalence and QALY (Table 8.1.1 shows a decline in prevalence fro m 7,989 to 7,705 enhanced by a decline in the burden of a healthy life year [=1-QA LY] from 0.6667 to 0.3333). Also noteworthy is that relative to the other thesi s diseases, the values of the stomach cancer morbidity gains were not substantial. This i s largely a result of the failure to significantly increase the quality of life (as refl ected by the QALY in Table 8.1 or 1-QALY in Table 8.1.1) for stomach cancer sufferers, espec ially when this is compared to the other illnesses in the thesis. This is also because of a more limited prevalence relative to breast cancer and especially tuberculosis. Breast cancer (see Table 8.1.4) experienced a simil ar phenomenon to stomach cancer, in that the most valuable morbidity gains were evident during the second half of the twentieth century. This result is not surprising, as Part II has outlined, there were few advances in (the key quality of life variable) medical technolo gy associated with cancer before 1950. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 276 - Table 8.1.4: Morbidity gain (morbidity burden chang e*VSHLY): monetary value of improvements in the burden of morbidity: breast can cer (millions of 1990 international $) 683 Period Morbidity Burden Change 1 Morbidity Burden Change 2 VSHLY Morbidity Gain T1 Morbidity Gain the most substantial morbidi ty gains for breast cancer were in the period 1975 to 2000. This is not surprising because as the twentieth century unfolded the morbidity gain for breast cancer became increasingl y valuable. Compared to stomach cancer, breast cancer experienced many more far rea ching improvements in quality of life (as reflected by the QALY in Table 8.1 or 1-QALY in Table 8.1.1), which explains the greater morbidity gain experienced by breast cancer in the second half of the twentieth century. However, during the period 1900-1950 breas t cancer achieved worsening morbidity gains (versus stomach cancer), which was largely as a result of substantially increasing prevalence of breast cancer (from 15,980 in 1900 to 61,477 in 1950) and the failure of the QALY to improve until 1950. This tre nd also explains why when the twentieth century is considered as a whole, the mor bidity gain is of similar magnitude for breast and stomach cancer. This post 1950 breast cancer morbidity gain is part icularly important because, as has been outlined above, this occurred during an era when th e prevalence of breast cancer was always increasing (as shown in Table 8.1.1) and the refore the constantly improving QALY burden is the factor which drives the morbidity gai n, especially between 1975 and 2000, which experienced considerable increases in prevale nce (from 68,953 in 1975 to 87,915 in 2000, shown in Table 8.1.1) that were entirely offs et by improvements in the quality of life associated with breast cancer (in Table 8.1.1, the burden, represented by 1-QALY improved from 0.3333 in 1975 to only 0.1667 of a he althy life year in 2000). 683 For detailed calculations underlying the results i n Table 8.14 see Appendix 12.3 and 13.1. For summar y results shown in Table 8.1.4 see Appendix 12.4. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 277 - Tuberculosis sufferers also experienced considerabl e morbidity gains (see Table 8.1.5), some of which can be ascribed to the significant im provements in quality of life related to tuberculosis, particularly during the second half o f the twentieth century. The substantial decline in the prevalence of tuberculosis also cont ributed to the morbidity gains outlined in Table 8.1.5. Table 8.1.5: Morbidity gain (morbidity burden chang e*VSHLY): monetary value of improvements in the burden of morbidity: tuberculos is (millions of 1990 international $)684 Period Morbidity Burden Change 1 Morbidity Burden Change 2 VSHLY Morbidity Gain T1 Morbidity Gain highlights the tremendous tuberculosis morbidity gains as a result of improvements in both the prevalence and the QALY. T his was most pronounced for the period 1900-2000, as would be expected, because the prevalence of tuberculosis declined consistently throughout the twentieth century. Also of relatively very high magnitude was the morbidity gain between 1950 and 1975, which is a likely result of significant improvements in the QALY (in Table 8.1.1, the burde n, represented by 1-QALY improved from 0.3333 in 1950 to 0.1667 in 1975) and a signif icant decline in the prevalence during this period (from 42,024 in 1950 to 7,119 in 1975, shown in Table 8.1.1), both of which were a result of medical developments (see Part II: Chapter 5 and Part III: Chapter 7.2 for an elaboration). Along a less positive vein is the relatively minimal morbidity gain between 1975 and 2000. This is largely a result of minor sc ope for further improvements, as the QALY nearly reached the ideal level (when consideri ng 1-QALY, the ideal level would be 0 and the tuberculosis 1-QALY had reached 0.1667 by 1975, which can be considered as nearly ideal) and the prevalence declined so that a very marginal proportion of the population were infected with tuberculosis. 684 For detailed calculations underlying the results i n Table 8.1.5 see Appendix 12.3 and 13.1. For summa ry results shown in Table 8.1.5 see Appendix 12.4. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 278 - When the morbidity gains for the three diseases are compared, the most striking feature is the greater magnitude of the tuberculosis morbidity gain. E.g. if the morbidity gain for these diseases are considered for the twentieth cen tury as a whole (1900-2000), the tuberculosis morbidity gain was about five times gr eater than the breast cancer morbidity gain and about six times greater than the stomach c ancer morbidity gain (26,313 versus 5,806 and 4,183, respectively [all in 1990 internat ional $]). A key reason for the greater magnitude of the tuberculosis morbidity gain relati ve to the other illnesses in the thesis is the dramatic decline in the prevalence of this dise ase. For example, in 1900, tuberculosis represented nearly 10 percent of all deaths in the English population. This is a greater proportion than breast cancer and stomach cancer co mbined, at any point during the twentieth century, and any improvements are going t o be more far reaching because of the greater number of healthy life years that are achie ved out of reducing the prevalence and morbidity burden associated with tuberculosis. This trend also explains part of the reason for breast cancer experiencing higher morbidity gai ns versus stomach cancer. Hence, the greater the prevalence of a disease, the greater is the scope for the morbidity gain, as there are more life years that will be effected by any QA LY improvements. Therefore, Tables 8.1.3 to 8.1.5 highlight the valu e of improvements in morbidity. This is particularly pronounced for tuberculosis, which wou ld be expected as this disease had transformed from being one of the major health thre ats in 1900 to being virtually eliminated by 2000 (due to the availability of safe and effective antibacterial agents). Breast cancer also experienced important gains asso ciated with improved quality of life (QALY), which were especially far reaching as they were capable of counteracting increases in prevalence. Lastly, although compared to these two diseases stomach cancer was less significant, the associated morbidity gain s were still noteworthy and also contribute to the overall conclusions of the thesis in a similar way to breast cancer and tuberculosis, although to a lesser extent. Now that the morbidity gain for the thesis diseases has been established, the final aspect of the methodology is to combine this with the mortali ty gain as this provides the overall health gain or in the context of the thesis' method ology and terminology, the QALE gain. In order to form the overall QALE methodology, the morbidity gain (above) will be combined with the mortality gain (below). The metho dology and result of the mortality gain calculation will be explained below. With refe rence to the flow chart example at the Results: Quantitative: Disease - 279 - beginning of Chapter 8, this next stage of valuing the morbidity gain relates to stage 8 in the flow chart and WTP mortality in Equation 8.1. 8.1.2 Primary Valuation of Improvements in Mortalit y The results below highlight twentieth century impro vements in mortality through a very similar process to that which was utilised for morb idity, but instead of considering the burden of illness, the death rate burden is utilise d and the change in the death rate burden is valued with the VSL (rather than the VSHLY which wa s used to value the change in the morbidity burden). Selecting the VSL represents sta ge 6 in the above flow chart example and included in this outline is Table 8.2, which pr ovides the calculation and result of the VSL values for different eras of the twentieth cent ury. The first step in identifying the mortality gain is to identify the change in the mortality burden. This is established through considering the change in the death rate. This is a much more simplistic and straightforward process compare d to disease as the change in the death rate has been recorded for the entire twentieth cen tury and it is a straightforward statistic (i.e. there is no ambiguity about whether someone i s registered as 'dead' or remains alive). Hence, once the change in the death rate has been i dentified, it is possible to value this through applying the VSL to the change (always a de cline in the twentieth century) in the death rate. The result of this calculation (decline in death rate*VSL) will yield the mortality gain. This process is highlighted below i n Table 8.1.6. Also in common with the above calculation of the ch ange in the morbidity burden, the change in the death rate burden was considered rela tive to the age distribution of the population. Therefore, it was necessary to weight t hese calculations to age profiles at the start and end point (T1 and T2, respectively) of th e populations being considered and then identify the mid point between these two sets of re sults and utilise this as the mortality gain. The summary of this process is shown below in Table 8.1.6 and the detailed calculations for this process are contained in appe ndices 12.3 and 13.1. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 280 - Table 8.1.6: Mortality gain (mortality burden chang e*VSL): monetary value of improvements in the burden of mortality (millions o f 1990 international $) 685 Period Mortality burden change T1 Mortality burden change T2 VSL (millions) Mortality gain T1 process a nd result of valuing the decline in the death rate. I.e. the mortality burden change column s multiplied by the 'VSL' column yields the mortality gain columns. The mid point between t hese two mortality gain columns can then be identified to yield the 'average mortality gain' result, which will be utilised. The most substantial mortality gains in the above t able are those that exist for the entire twentieth century. This is essentially a result of the fact that this era includes the largest scope for death rate reductions and subsequent mort ality gains. Also noteworthy is the value of the mortality gain in 1975-2000, which is larger than any of the preceding eras. This is a result of continued improvements in the l ife expectancy and also because of an increased value of these improvements. I.e. the VSL for 1975-2000 is nearly double the VSL for the preceding era, 1950-1975, which is also higher than all other VSL values (1975-2000 VSL = 2.05 and [199 0 international $]) 686 . The reasons for this difference are explained in Chapter 3, whe re the rationale and construction of the VSL are detailed. Lastly, it is important to note that all eras consi dered in the table experienced important mortality gains, which is essentially a result of t wentieth century improvements in mortality that were unprecedented, such that the en tire twentieth century mortality gain was worth 13,769,000,000 or approximately fourteen billion (1990 international $). 685 For detailed calculations underlying the results i n Table 8.1.6 see Appendix 12.3. For summary result s shown in Table 8.1.6 see Appendix 12.4. 686 For details of the the VSL see Appe ndix 12.1.1. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 281 - An improvement in the death rate and a subsequent v aluable mortality gain has been recognised in the literature and is therefore not o ne of the original contributions of the thesis. However, calculating these quantitative gai ns for morbidity has not, to date, been attempted. Moreover, combining these quantitative m orbidity gain evaluations with the mortality gain in a universal health measure, namel y, the QALE, is also one of the original key contributions to knowledge. This final aspect o f the methodology (combining the mortality and morbidity gain) is achieved below wit h the QALE gain valuation, where the novelty of the thesis' original QALE methodology is highlighted. This QALE methodology, which combines the WTP morbidity and W TP mortality gain represents stage 10 in the flow chart example provided at the beginning of Chapter 8 and is also the final stage in Equation 8.1. 8.1.3 QALE Gain Valuation This subsection of results combines the morbidity g ain and mortality gain that have been calculated above, in order to estimate the QALE gai n (i.e. morbidity gain + mortality gain = QALE gain). In Table 8.1.7 the QALE gain is considered for the three thesis diseases independently. Hence, 'QALE Gain stomach cancer' comprises the mor bidity gain for stomach cancer (calculated above in Table 8.1.3) summed with the m ortality gain (calculated in Table 8.1.6), and so forth for each disease. In theory al l three disease morbidity gains and the mortality gain could be summed together (along with the thesis QALE gain for blindness, which will be achieved in Chapter 8.3), as well as all disease and disability morbidity in the economy (which will be achieved in Chapter 9). However, for analysis purposes the three diseases and disability will be kept separate and each will be independently summed with the mortality gain. This calculation is shown below in Table 8.1.7. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 282 - Table 8.1.7: QALE gain (morbidity gain + mortality gain): monetary value of improvements in the burden of morbidity and mortality for thesis diseases: breast cancer, stomach cancer, tuberculos is (millions of 1990 international $) 687 Period Mortality Gain Morbidity Gain: Stomach cancer QALE Gain Stomach cancer Morbidity Gain: Breast cancer QALE Gain Breast cancer Morbidity Gain: mortality gain is derived from T able 8.1.6, where it was calculated. The morbidity gain for stomach cancer is derived from Table 8.1.3, for breast cancer from Table 8.1.4 and for t uberculosis from Table 8.1.5, where these diseases morbidity gains have been calculated. The QALE gain columns in the above table are the sum of the mortality gain column and the associated disea se morbidity gain column. For example, continuing with breast cancer between 1900 and 2000 : the morbidity gain has been calculated (in Table 8.1.4) as 5806 (1990 international $) for 1900-2000 and the mortality gain for 1900-2000 is 1 3769 (1990 international $), the QALE gain is the s um of these two facets = 19575 (5806 + 13769), which is shown in the above table for the Q ALE gain for breast cancer between 1900 and 2000. 687 For detailed calculations of the QALE gain in Tabl e 8.1.7 (which is considering the QALE gain as the sum of the morbidity gain [Table 8.1.3, 8.1.4, 8.1 .5] and the see Appen dix 12.5. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 283 - Hence, Table 8.1.7 considers the value of the morbi dity gain (for the specific illness) summed with the mortality gain, which represents th e QALE gain. This table illustrates a trend which is expected: for all eras where the mor bidity gain was positive, the QALE is higher than the mortality gain and for all eras whe re there was a worsening in the morbidity gain (i.e. a morbidity loss) the QALE gai n is lower than the mortality gain. The direction and magnitude of these combinations can b e deduced from the above table and this will be considered in Figure 8.1.1 overleaf, i n order to try and indicate the contribution of the morbidity gain and mortality gain towards th e overall QALE gain. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 284 - Figure 8.1.1: QALE gain: value and composition of t he morbidity gain and mortality gain towards QALE g ain for thesis diseases: stomach cancer (SC), breast cancer (BC) and tuberculosis (TB), 190 0-2000 (millions of 1990 international See Appendix 12.5 for QALE gain and the compositio n of the morbidity and mortality gain towards the Q ALE gain. QALE Morbidity Mortality Value of QALE Gain (millions of 1990 international $) QALE Gain: Value and Composition (mortality gain an d morbidity gain) Results: Quantitative: Disease - 285 - Figure 8.1.1 illustrates the contribution of the mo rtality gain (blue bar connected to the x axis) and the morbidity gain (orange [stomach cance r], pink [breast cancer], red [tuberculosis] bars on top of the blue, mortality b ars) to the overall QALE gain (height of both bars for each disease and era). Hence, the hei ght of these bars (composed of blue and orange or pink or red segments) represents the valu e of the QALE gain. Furthermore, the placement of the morbidity bars also represents the direction (positive or negative) of the morbidity contribution to the overall QALE gain. If the morbidity bar is on top of the mortality gain bar then the morbidity gain has prov ided a positive contribution to the QALE gain and if the morbidity bar is below the mor tality bar the morbidity gain is negative and has caused a reduction in the QALE gai n. This latter phenomenon only occurred twice: for breast cancer in 1900-1925 and 1925-1950. For example, if we continue with twentieth century breast cancer: Table 8.1.7 has calculated the QALE gain by summing the mortality g ain (calculated in Table 8.1.6) and the morbidity gain for breast cancer (calculated in Table 8.1.4). The relationship of these three variables is illustrated in Figure 8.1.1 thro ugh, first presenting the mortality gain (represented by the blue bar, at a value of 13,769 [shown in Table 8.1.7 and Figure 8.1.1 where it is represented by the height of the blue b ar = 0 to 13,769]), second is the morbidity gain which is represented by the pink bar (which sits directly on top of the blue bar and represents a value of 5,806 [shown in Table 8.1.7 and Figure 8.1.1 where it is represented by the height of the pink bar = 13,769 to 19,575, so 19,575 - 13,769 = 5,806]), lastly, the QALE gain is represented by the combine d height of the blue and pink bar which indicates a QALE gain value of 19,575 (millio ns of international $) for breast cancer between 1900 and 2000. This is calculated by summin g the mortality gain and the morbidity gain in accordance with the QALE methodol ogy (see Figure 8.1 for a reminder of this methodology). Finally, because the pink bar is on-top-of the blue bar, this highlights that the morbidity gain has provided a positive con tribution to the overall QALE gain. Hence, for ease of review Figure 8.1.1 illustrates the QALE gain segmented for the contribution of the mortality gain and morbidity ga in. This illustrates the direction of the morbidity gain (or loss) and the magnitude of the m orbidity gain in order to highlight how mortality and morbidity are driving the change in t he overall QALE gains. Through considering the magnitude and direction of the morbidity gain relative to the mortality gain, in order to determine the contribut ion of improved morbidity to the QALE, Results: Quantitative: Disease - 286 - Figure 8.1.1 illustrates two key points. First, tha t there were only two instances where there were negative contributions from morbidity (breast cancer in 1900-1925 and 1925-1950, shown by the pink bar being below the blue bar in F igure 8.1.1) and there was only one zero contribution (from stomach cancer in 1925-1950 , shown by only a blue bar for the mortality gain as there was no morbidity gain, whic h is represented by a zero contribution). Hence, in 12 out of 15 instances, morbidity provide d a positive contribution to mortality. This finding provides a strong justification about the value of twentieth century improvements in morbidity and the need to measure t his in conjunction with mortality. The other striking feature of Figure 8.1.1 is the m agnitude of morbidity gains relative to mortality gains in many instances. The reason for t his is very important and is essentially because of the difference in the inherent nature of morbidity and mortality, with regards to their influence upon the population. Mortality is a one time only event whereas morbidity has, in theory, an infinite number of possible even ts (which can even occur concurrently, i.e. co-morbidity), confined only by the one time o ccurrence of mortality. I.e. while an individual is alive, there is scope for an infinite number of morbidity events but once one mortality event has occurred there is scope for no more as the individual is dead. Furthermore, as the twentieth century unfolded the disease environment evolved such that the most prevalent illness burdens switched to chro nic and not infectious diseases, which augmented the persistence of morbidity. This realit y provides a subtle but very powerful message about the importance of considering more th an just mortality when trying to gauge the health of the nation, as there are many ( more) improvements evident for morbidity. This finding helps to bolster one of the foundational claims of the thesis: the need to measure health (morbidity) in some form of model that can calculate mortality and morbidity improvements in tandem. Furthermore the momentous improvement in tuberculos is also fills a significant historical void. To date, the contribution of improvements in this infectious disease is likely to have been underestimated as it was not possible to make the above quantifications, which yield important results about morbidity. Furthermore, thi s trend is likely to be consistent with the vast majority of infectious diseases and therefore provides an even greater boost to existing credit for the medical revolution which eliminated this category of morbidity and mortality. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 287 - Along a similar vein, the results for breast and st omach cancer are also momentous, largely for the evidence against pessimistic commentaries o f the epidemiological transition that they provide. Hence, even though the prevalence of these diseases has increased (to replace infectious diseases) during the twentieth century, the improvements in quality of life associated with these diseases (fostered by advance d medical technology and welfare initiatives) has been significant enough (in the ma jority of instances) to have created a more favourable morbidity situation over the twenti eth century, illustrated by the increase in the morbidity gain (pink and orange bars) in Fig ure 8.1.1. Finally, when considering breast and stomach cancer , the magnitude of the QALE gain for these diseases in the period 1900-2000 is noteworth y. This similarity was identified below Table 8.1.4 but deserves an additional consideratio n. This statistic seems misleading at an initial approximation, especially if it is viewed i n conjunction with Table 8.1.1, which highlights the differing prevalence and burden of s tomach and breast cancer. However, it is necessary to maintain that the QALE gain is actuall y considering the compound average change in the morbidity burden [and an identical mo rtality gain for breast and stomach cancer] which yields relatively similar results tha t are accurate when the entire twentieth century is considered. A key reason is that the val ue of the change in the morbidity burden between 1900 and 2000, which, by coincidence are re latively similar for breast cancer and stomach cancer, and also because of the QALY for 19 00-2000, although this is higher for breast cancer. These illnesses share the same 1900 QALY and the higher breast cancer QALY by 2000 actually serves to contribute to the c oincidental (but not wrong or anomalistic) similarity in the breast cancer and st omach cancer morbidity gains for 1900- 2000. The key feature to note from the above analysis (il lustrated in Figure 8.1.1) is the largely positive contribution provided by the morbidity gai n (which embodies improvements in the prevalence and/or the burden of morbidity) and the mandate this provides for adopting a fuller notion of health and the indication it provi des about the inaccuracy of pessimist claims about the worsening morbidity associated wit h improving mortality, which is not true when a more rounded view of morbidity is adopt ed, which has been achieved here for the first time in the literature (for example, if t he pessimists were correct then every morbidity bar in Figure 8.1.1 would be below the co rresponding mortality bar, as this represents morbidity detracting mortality gains, wh ich is simplistically what the pessimist Results: Quantitative: Disease - 288 - school are claiming). The above findings and conclu sions will be verified below through a series of sensitivity analyses. 8.1.4 Sensitivity Analyses In order to highlight the veracity of the above fin dings and the more general claims of the thesis which are based upon this analysis, it is de sirable to test the results through considering different values (Low and High as well as the existing Mid value, utilised above) for the most tenuous variables in the thesis , namely, QALY, VSL and VSHLY 689 . This will generate a broad spectrum of possible res ults (precisely 378) about the QALE gain. A final aspect of the sensitivity analysis is age-w eighting. Murray's age weighting function will be applied to the range of QALE gain results i n order to provide estimate that account for claims in the literature that these gains have been more and less valuable for certain ages. For an elaboration of the appeal and process of age weighting see Chapter 3. This will provide an additional series (containing 378 r esults) of QALE gain estimates. Essentially this section will repeat the above meth odological procedures (of identifying the morbidity gain then mortality gain and the subseque nt QALE gain) but using different QALY, VSL and VSHLY variables. These alternative QA LE gain results (as well as those identified in Table 8.1.7) will also be applied to Murray's age-weighting function. This part of the methodology is represented by stage 11 in the flow chart example at the beginning of Chapter 8 (and also draws on stages 5 to 10 as it is repeating the above methodological process). 8.1.4.1 QALY Weights The QALY was established through an intricate and o bjective qualitative analysis of the health and welfare related quality of life for diff erent illnesses and eras of the twentieth century (conducted in Part II of the thesis). Devel oping a QALY for different illnesses and eras is one of the thesis' core contributions to kn owledge. The QALYs used here are totally unique and wide reaching as they have been derived from a detailed review of the literature and data relevant to the key aspects of health and welfare related quality of life for the thesis illnesses during the twentieth century. Beca use of the potential scope for subjectivity 689 The author of the thesis believes the 'Mid' age-we ighted estimates to be the most accurate and plausi ble, but has provided a series of coherent alternatives in an effort to validate the estimates and overall conclusions of the thesis. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 289 - and/or opinion variance in the thesis' analysis and also associated with QALYs in general, a range of QALY estimates will be considered. With reference to the flow chart example at the beginning of Chapter 8, this represents stage 1 1b of the methodology and will also heavily utilise stage 5 as the QALY is reconsidered . Stages 5 to 10 will also be implemented as the QALE methodology is recalculated using an alternative QALY for the morbidity burden (=prevalence*QALY). The range of QALY estimates used in this analysis c onsiders the mid QALY estimate, which is depicted by 'Mid' in conjunction with a 'L ow' and 'High' estimate. These two estimates were derived through identifying the QALY level below and above the 'Mid' estimate (which has been presented above in Table 8 .1). This is likely to be an exaggeration of the variance that a critic would wa nt, but is intended to provide an extreme range in order to highlight the veracity of the the sis claims. The range of QALY estimates, for the diseases considered in the thesis are shown below. For a more detailed explanation about the QALY and QALY value eliciting in the thes is, see Chapter 3 and the flow chart example at the beginning of Chapter 8. Table 8.1.8: Alternative QALY values (Low, Mid, Hig h) for thesis diseases: breast cancer, stomach cancer, tuberculosis 690 Year Breast Cancer Stomach Cancer Tuberculosis Low Mid High Low Mid High Low Mid High illustrates the mid QALY, which has bee n derived through the thesis' analysis in the 'Mid' column, shown in bold, and this is san dwiched between a lower ('Low') and upper ('High') estimate. This part of the sensitivi ty analysis is designed to address concerns about the accuracy of the valuation of unh ealthy life year estimates, and therefore an exaggerated margin of error has been considered for the value of the QALYs. The alternative positive margin is presented in the 'Hi gh' column. I.e. this provides a more generous QALY estimate for the reader who is concer ned that the thesis (mid) QALY 690 See Part II and Chapter 7 and Chapter 3 and see Ap pendix 12.6.1 for alternative QALY weights. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 290 - estimates are too pessimistic, and the negative mar gin is presented in the 'Low' column and addresses observer concerns about the thesis (m id) QALYs being too generous. Once the values of the QALYs have been estimated it is possible to apply them to the methodology in the same way that has been achieved above for the 'Mid' QALY. Hence, the first stage is to estimate the morbidity burden , through the same process outlined previously in this chapter: the morbidity burden is estimated through identifying and combining (multiplying) the prevalence and the QALY (as above, when doing the calculation 1-QALY is utilised) associated with the disease and era, for the age standardised population structure in T1 and T2 (whi ch is later average through identifying the mid-point between T1 and T2). Once this has bee n achieved it is possible to measure the change in the morbidity burden between the star t [T1] and end [T2] point of the period. This change in the morbidity burden can then be val ued through combining it with the VSHLY, which will yield the morbidity gain, in this instance for higher and lower QALY variable. These alternative (higher and lower) QALYs will be utilised in two places in the methodology: i) when estimating the morbidity burde n (prevalence * QALY) and ii) when estimating the VSHLY (VSL * QALY). As in the above methodological process, this morbid ity gain (for higher and lower QALYs) can then be combined with the mortality gain (which will remain the same as it was in the previous section because the QALY change only affec ts the morbidity features of the QALE methodology) in order to estimate the QALE gai n. This is achieved below for alternative QALY weights for the QALE gain, where t he mortality gain utilised is the same as that presented in Tables 8.1.6 and 8.1.7 and the morbidity gain is considered for the 'Mid' QALYs (which are the same as the existing est imate in Tables 8.1.3, 8.1.4, 8.1.5 - Table 8.1.9: QALE gains for thesis diseases: breast cancer (BC), stomach cancer (SC), tuberculosis (TB) with alternative (Low, Mid, High) QALY values (millions of 1990 international $) 691 Period LOW QALY MID QALY HIGH 8.1.9 is making the same considerations that were made earlier in Table 8.1.7, but in less detail. Hence, the above table presents the fi nal QALE gain result (for different QALY values), whereas Table 8.1.7 made the same calculat ion (using the mid QALY) but included the mortality gain and the diseases specif ic 'morbidity gains' as well as presenting the final result, the QALE gain. These d etailed calculations for alternative QALY weights are conducted in appendices 12.7.1 and 13.2.1. The QALE gain results in the above table are genera lly what would be expected. Hence, the higher the QALY weight (i.e. increasing from 'L ow' to 'Mid' to 'High'), the greater the magnitude of the QALE gain. This is for two key reasons; as the QALY approaches one, the burden of the disease declines and provide s a greater morbidity (and subsequent) QALE gain and also, the higher the QALY (closer to one), the higher the VSHLY becomes, which also contributes to increasing the v alue of the morbidity (and subsequent) QALE gain. With reference to the flow chart example and specifically the EuroQol to QALY conversion table (Table 7.1), the higher the Q ALY, the closer the quality of life for illnesses sufferers was to 'complete quality of lif e', which would represent a lower morbidity burden. However, there are exceptions to this trend: breast cancer in 1900-1925 and 1925-1950, and stomach cancer in 1925-1950. These are a result of the morbidity gain being negative 691 Table 8.1.9 is based on the same type of calculati ons as Table 8.1.7. See of gain using alternative QALY wei ghts (see mid VSL, mid VSHLY with low, mid, high QA LY). Results: Quantitative: Disease - 292 - or zero (in the case of stomach cancer). Hence, und er these circumstances, increasing the QALY increases the amount of value lost and the sub sequent detraction for the QALE gain. This phenomenon (of a negative or zero morbid ity gain) is the same as that which was identified for the mid QALY QALE gain shown in Table 8.1.7. Also noteworthy is the similarity of the values yie lded, regardless of the QALY weight. This adds credibility to the estimates of the thesi s as it indicates that, regardless of the QALY value chosen (within a very generous margin) t he aggregate conclusion is the same. Hence, the general results of this QALY sensitivity analysis highlight that when the QALY is higher the contribution to overall health and th e relationship with mortality is higher and vice versa when the QALY is lower. In some cases th e contribution is negative as a result of a worsening morbidity profile. When the QALE con tribution is negative, the higher the QALY the more negative the QALE gain (or loss) beco mes. 8.1.4.2 VSL and VSHLY Weights The thesis has already presented the disputes assoc iated with the identification of the correct VSL and subsequent VSHLY (see Chapter 3). T his will be abated as much as possible through considering the QALE gain with a s eries of additional ('Low' and 'High') weights for the VSL and VSHLY components of the met hodology. This aspect of the sensitivity analysis makes the same methodological calculations as above (i.e. morbidity gain + mortality gain = QALE gain), but will do thi s with alternative VSL (for valuing the mortality gain) and VSHLY (for valuing the morbidit y gain) weights, namely, a lower and a higher weight series to enhance the mid weights t hat have been utilised above. With reference to the stages in the above flow char t example, this represents stage 6: selecting the VSL and stage 7: calculating the VSHL Y, and also an integral aspect of stages 8 and 9: the valuation of the mortality burd en change (VSL) and the valuation of the morbidity burden change (VSHLY), respectively. Afte r which stage 10 will be conducted, where the new morbidity gain and mortality gain are summed to estimate the QALE gain (for alternative VSL and VSHLY weights). More speci fically, this process relates to stage 11a and 11c, as this represents the sensitivity ana lysis of the VSL and VSHLY. Alternative VSL and VSHLY values are derived throug h considering the low and high estimates of Miller's VSL multiple, provided in Cha pter 3: Table 3.3. With reference to the Results: Quantitative: Disease - 293 - worked example above in Chapter 8, Table 8.2 illust rates the calculation of the VSL (VSL mid multiple [128] * GDP per capita at mid point). In the VSL sensitivity analysis here, the thesis will be changing the VSL multiple (from 128 to 101 and 154) in order to estimate a lower and higher VSL. The GDP per capita component remains the same. The VSHLY is a function of the VSL and the QALY (VS L*QALY=VSHLY). With reference to the above worked example in Chapter 8, Table 8.3 shows the construction of the mid VSHLY. The VSHLY calculation involves: i) a new VSL (higher or lower, explained above) and ii) the same, mid QALY for the VSL*QALY=VSHLY calculation. The results presented in this VSL and VSHLY sensiti vity analysis (presented in Table 8.1.10) are derived from an intricate consideration of all the possible combinations of VSL and VSHLY within the QALE methodology (shown in App endix 13.2.1). Table 8.1.10 (below) presents the QALE gain results for VSL and VSHLY mid values (which are equal to the pre sensitivity analysis results, shown in T able 8.1.7) and the most extreme values t cancer (BC), stomach cancer (SC), tuberculosis (TB) with alternative VSL and VSHLY va lues (millions of 1990 international $) 692 Period Low VSL Low VSHLY Mid above considers the QALE gain with a seri es of different weights for the valuation of the change in the mortality burden (VS L) and for the change in the morbidity burden (VSHLY). Table 8.1.10 presents QALE gain res ults which utilise the mid and most extreme (lowest and highest) VSL and VSHLY values. The overall trend is the positive correlation between the value of the VSL and VSHLY and the value of the QALE gain. 692 Table 8.1.10 is based on the same type of calculat ions as Table 8.1.7, but with alternative VSL and SHLY values. See Appendix 12.1.1 for VSL and VSHLY range of values to be included in sensitivity analyses and Appendix 13.2.1 for calculations (see mid QALY with low, mid, high VSL and VSHLY). Results: Quantitative: Disease - 294 - This is expected because the higher the value of im provements in these health valuation variables (embodied in the VSL being applied to the change in the mortality burden and VSHLY to the change in the morbidity burden), the h igher the QALE gain. The results in Table 8.1.10 provide a substantial i ndication about the consistency of the value of improvements in mortality and morbidity, r egardless of which VSL and VSHLY variables are utilised. This finding is important a s it provides a justification for earlier claims in the thesis that the precise value of the VSL was not paramount because of the nature of the VSL and also the magnitude of improve ments in health. This is highlighted by Table 8.1.10, where there is variance in the val ue of the QALE gain depending on the VSL and VSHLY, but this variance is not great enoug h to contradict any of the other QALE gain results in the thesis (based on different VSL and VSHLY values). In order to fully justify the above claims that the values of the VSL and VSHLY will not affect the overall findings of the QALE methodology , it is desirable to briefly consider the QALE gain value that would be yielded according to the VSL elasticities argued by Costa versus Viscusi. Chapter 3: Table 3.4 has highlighte d the divergence in opinion about the elasticity of the VSL and subsequent change in the VSL over the twentieth century. The table below summarises the estimate of an alternati ve VSL and subsequent QALE gain for Costa (who claims a VSL income elasticity of approx imately 1.6) versus Viscusi (who claims that the VSL is income inelastic over time i n the region of 0.6) versus the mid (unitary elasticity) VSL that has been used in the thesis (derived from Miller's estimates). Results: Quantitative: Disease - 295 - Table 8.1.11: VSL value and subsequent mortality an d QALE gain for thesis diseases when assuming diffe rent levels of VSL income elasticity: Costa versus Viscusi, 1900-2000 (millions of 1990 nternational $) 693 Study VSL income elasticity 1900-2000 VSL value (millions) Mortality Gain QALE Gain Breast cancer QALE Gain Stomach cancer QALE Gain Tuberculosis Costa & Kahn the gain that is y ielded through including alternative VSL and VSHLY weights. This process is the same as what has been achieved above in Table 8.1.10 for 'Low' a nd 'High' VSL and VSHLY weights (relative to the th esis 'Mid' estimate, derived from Miller, which is shown in Tables 8.1.7, 8.1.10 and here in Table 8.1.11). Hence, the QALE gain yielded here in cludes a mortality gain and morbidity gain that have been calculated in the same way as above. The difference is the weight of the mortality and morbidity change valuation variables (VSL and VSHLY). In Table 8.1.11 the VSL and VSHLY have been chosen in accordance with Costa and Viscusi (w hereas in Table 8.1.10 the alternative valuation weights [VSL and VSHLY] were selected in accordance with Miller's estimates of a 'Low' and 'High' VSLs). The results in Table 8.1.11 are not surprising when the mortality and QALE gains are considered as a f unction of the VSL (and corresponding VSHLY, shown in Appendix 12.7.3). Viscusi's results are consistently higher than the thesis (Miller) a nd Costa results, respectively. This is because the Viscusi VSL (and subsequent VSHLY [= VS L * QALY]) is higher than the thesis and Costa VSLs . Moreover, the magnitude of difference between these QALE gains is also not sur prising, as they reflect the difference in magnitud e between the VSLs. 693 See Appendix 12.7.3 for more detailed calculations 694 Costa & Kahn, \"Changes in the Value of a Statistic al Life, 1940-1980\", p. 1 695 Viscusi & Aldy, \"The Value of a Statistical Life: A Critical Review of Market Estimates Throughout Th e World\", p. 44 696 The thesis estimates are based on Miller, where un itary elasticity is implied Results: Quantitative: Disease - 296 - The most noteworthy and important observations, for the thesis, are identified when Table 8.1.11 is compared to Table 8.1.10. Both of these t ables provide VSL and VSHLY sensitivity analyses (although the rationale is dif ferent). The VSL and VSHLY weight variance is more pronounced for the VSL weights in Table 8.1.11 (this can be highlighted by comparing the VSL weights in Table 8.1.11 with t hose in Table 8.1.10 and subsequently the QALE gain result range is greater in Table 8.1.11. For example, once again, considering breast cancer for 1900-2000, the (underlying) VSL range in Table 8.1.10 is 0.70 - 1.06 and VSHLY is 0.41 - 0.62 comp ared to the (underlying) VSL range in Table 8.1.11 is 0.64 - 1.18 and VSHLY is 0.37 - 0.69 in Table 8.1.11. The result is that the range of the QALE gain estimates (for different VSL and VSHLY weights) is broader in Table 8.1.11. In Table 8.1.10 the QALE gain for breast VSHLY) compared to the greater range in Table 8.1.11 of 14 ,226 (Costa) to 26,530 (Viscusi) in Table 8.1.11. The most remarkable feature about the above observa tion is that, although the results in Table 8.1.11 provide a broader range of QALE gain e stimates, they still accord with the results in Table 8.1.10 and the general QALE gain c onclusions throughout the thesis. Moreover, because of the evident variance in the li terature (highlighted by Costa versus Viscusi estimates in Table 8.1.11), it is possible to argue that the thesis VSL selection provides a respectable mid-point between the varian ce in the literature and a representative estimate. Therefore, the consistent trend of the above result s is that the higher the value of the VSL and subsequent VSHLY, the greater the mortality gai n and morbidity gain and ultimate QALE gain (as this is the sum of the mortality and morbidity gain). Finally, in Table 8.1.10 (and Table 8.1.11) there i s a fundamental, clear and consistent trend which is valuable in the context of the thesi s because it confirms that, whatever weight (within the thesis' broad range) is adopted for the VSL (and subsequent VSHLY), the QALE gain is still substantial. Hence, the over all conclusions of the thesis remain unchanged and the only alteration is the magnitude of the QALE gain, which always contributes to the same conclusion about the value of twentieth century improvements in health. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 297 - 8.1.4.3 VSL and VSHLY and QALY Weights To complete the thesis sensitivity analyses it is d esirable to combine the above two versions of sensitivity analysis and consider one a ggregate series of different results for considering the full range of values ('Low', 'Mid, 'High') for all methodological variables (QALY, VSL, VSHLY). Once this has been achieved all variables of the methodology will have been considered for all their possible ranges and combinations of ranges and subsequently the QALE will yield the broadest serie s of estimates possible (within the thesis sensitivity analysis), in order to provide t he broadest indication about the value of improvements in health. With reference to the flow chart example at the beg inning of Chapter 8, this represents the combination of stages 11a, 11b and 11c. Also, as wa s the case in the QALY sensitivity analysis and the VSL and VSHLY sensitivity analysis , stages 8, 9 and 10 will also be utilised as the QALE will be recalculated for alter native QALY, VSL and VSHLY weights. In an effort to simplify the mass of possi ble results (provided in appendices 12.7.1 and 13.2.1) the table below will provide a summary about the 'Mid' and most extreme results: gains for thesis diseases: breas t cancer (BC), stomach cancer (SC), tuberculosis (TB) with alternative QALY, VSL and VS HLY values (millions of 1990 international $) 697 Period Low VSL, Low VSHLY, Low QALY the same type of calculat ions as Table 8.1.7 and 8.1.9 dix 12.1.1 for VSL and VSHLY range of values to be included in sensitivity analyses and Appendix 12.6. 1 for range of QALY values and Appendix 12.7.1 and 13.2.1 for calculations. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 298 - Table 8.1.12, consider the most extreme (highest an d lowest) and mid point combinations of the VSL, VSHLY and QALY (for the thesis') sensit ivity analysis weights, which was achieved through recalculating the change in the mo rbidity burden using a lower and higher QALYs (than the mid that was used in the ini tial part of Chapter 8.1), and then valued, to calculate the morbidity gain, through us ing a lower and higher VSHLY (comprised of all combinations of a lower and highe r VSLs and QALYs, as VSL * QALY = VSHLY). The same considerations were applied to m ortality, through recalculating the value of the change in the mortality burden with al ternative lower and higher VSL values. This exercise has created a range of QALE gain valu es, which are a function of the variable weights (i.e. low or high QALY, VSL and VS HLY). The results from this exercise (in Table 8.1.12) sh ow a general trend, which is expected: as the value of the VSL, VSHLY or QALY weight increase s the value of the QALE gain also increases. This result is logical as the more value is attributed to the change in the mortality and morbidity burden, the higher the QALE gain will be. The level of variance between the results in Table 8.1.12 is greater than for previous QALE gain calculations in the thesis (shown in Tabl e 8.1.6 for the 'Mid' QALE gain and in Table 8.1.8 for the QALE gain with alternative Q ALYs and in Table 8.1.10 for the QALE gain with alternative VSL and VSHLY weights). This result is what would be expected, because the thesis is considering differe nt weights for a greater number of variables in Table 8.1.12, than in any previous tab le that is using the alternative thesis variable weights (i.e. Table 8.1.11, which consider s alternative author weights is not included in this observation). The most noteworthy observations, particularly from the perspective of the thesis, is that, regardless of whatever QALYs, VSLs and VSHLYs are u tilised, when the twentieth century is considered in its entirety all illnesses provide a valuable contribution to mortality gains, and the overall QALE estimate, whi ch reinforces the value of improved health and substantiates the robustness of the thes is conclusions. 8.1.4.4 Age Weights A final process of sensitivity analyses is to consi der claims that the value of mortality and morbidity improvements are not constant across all age groups. The rationale and theories surrounding this have been covered in detail in Cha pter 3. Figure 8.1.2 (below) illustrates Results: Quantitative: Disease - 299 - the weights that will be applied to the QALE gain e stablished above. This calculation represents stage 11d in the flow chart example at t he beginning of Chapter 8. The age weighting function (shown in Figure 8.1.2) will only be applied to the central or mid QALE gain results. This is desirable because it provides an indication of the effect of considering age weighting for the QALE gain without an excess of data that would confuse the conclusions of this exercise. For the more comp rehensive reader these calculations have been made for every combination of the QALE ga in (i.e. the age weighting function has been applied to all of the sensitivity analyses , above) in appendices 12.8 to 12.10 and 13.3 to 13.5. Furthermore, the summary twentieth ce ntury QALE gain results (presented in Chapter 8.3) provides an age weighted equivalent fo r all QALE gain variable weight combinations for 1900-2000. The procedure here is to recalculate the (central) QALE gain results of the thesis (shown in Table 8.1.7) with the age weighting function shown in Figure 8.1.2. I.e. so far the QALE gain results have valued mortality and morbidity ga ins as equal across all age groups of the population, whereas the age weighting function is a ccounting for differences in the value of morbidity and mortality gains at different ages. E.g. in Figure 8.1.2 a life year at ages 0- 4 are only worth 30 percent of a life year versus a ges 15-34, which are worth 1.5 times a life years. Therefore, in simplistic terms, the QAL E gain would need to be reduced by 70 percent for ages 0-4 and inflated by 50 percent for ages 15-34, and so on. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 300 - Figure 8.1.2: Murray's age weight function of DALYs : relative value of a year of life lived at different ages 698 Relative Values of a Year of Life Lived at Differen t Ages 00.20.40.60.811.21.41.6 Age Relative Weight Age Weight 0.3 1.0 1.5 1.5 1.3 1.1 0.9 0.7 a weighting is very straigh tforward because the weights provided by Murray (1996) are clear and versatile. Moreover, because the thesis has consistently considered the morbidity and mortality gain for the age distribution of the population, Murray's age weighting can be directly applied to the existing data and this will document a reduction or increase in the (mortality gain, mor bidity gain and subsequent) QALE gain of the different age groups, by the magnitude outli ned in Figure 8.1.2. 698 Murray, \"Rethinking DALYs\", in Murray & Lopez, \"Th e Global Burden of Disease\", p. 60 Results: Quantitative: Disease - 301 - Table 8.1.13: Age weighted QALE gains (using mid v alue QALY, VSL, VSHLY variables) for thesis disease s: breast cancer, stomach cancer, tuberculosis (millions of 1990 international $) 699 . Period Mortality Gain Morbidity Gain: Stomach cancer QALE Gain Stomach cancer Morbidity Gain: Breast cancer QALE Gain Breast cancer Morbidity Gain: Tuberculosis a summary of the age-weighted Q ALE gain for the mid QALY, VSL and VSHLY sensitivit y analysis variables. I.e. this is essentially the same calculation as in Table 8.1.7 but it is then applied to the age-weighting functio n illustrated in Figure 8.1.2 to generate the resul ts shown in Table 8.1.13. Table 8.1.13 relays generally consistent result abo ut the effect of applying an age weighting function to the mortality gain, morbidity gain and QALE gain. All of these observations are derived fr om comparing Table 8.1.7 with Table 8.1.13. The cha nge in the mortality gain when applied to the age weighting function is an effect which consi stently (and relatively significantly) reduced the value of the mortality gain. 699 Table 8.1.13 is considering the QALE gain, which i s the sum of the morbidity gain (Table 8.1.3, 8.1.4 , 8.1.5) and the mortality gain (Table 8.1.6), whic h has been conducted for individual illnesses here. Table 8.1.13 is making the same considerations as Table 8.1.7 but applied to Murray 's age weighting function (shown in Figure 8.1.2). See Appendix 12.8, 12.9, 12.10.1, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5 for detailed calculations. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 302 - The change in the morbidity gain when applied to th e age weighting function is similar to mortality but there are some important exceptions. First is that in five instances in Table 8.1.13 applying the age weighting function created an increase in the value of the morbidity gain compared to the un-weighted equivale nt in Table 8.1.7: breast cancer in 1900-1925 and 1925-1950, stomach cancer in 1925-195 0, tuberculosis in 1925-1950 and 1950-1975. The episodes related to breast and stoma ch cancer are quite clearly a result of the morbidity gain being negative (i.e. a change in the morbidity burden that was negative) and therefore when the age weighting function is ap plied the negative change in the morbidity burden is reduced (as the age weighting f unction generally reduces the magnitude, as has been outlined above) which create s a more valuable (albeit still negative in most instances morbidity gain). This seemingly p erverse effect for tuberculosis between 1925 and 1975 is more ambiguous. It seems most like ly that this could be a result of a significant decline in tuberculosis in the 1920s th at was much more pronounced for middle/working ages (i.e. approximately ages 20-44, this is illustrated in Chapter 5: Figure 5.6 and 5.8) which receive a greater age weight tha n all other ages in Murray's age weighting function. This trend was also evident, al though to a much lesser extent around the 1960s (illustrated in Chapter 5: Figure 5.8). Finally, the change in the QALE gain when applying to the age weighting function is also similar to mortality, with only one important excep tion, which was the continuation of the tuberculosis phenomenon between 1925 and 1975. A final important observation of the effect of appl ying an age-weighting function to the thesis QALE gain is the difference in the magnitude this effect has upon the mortality and morbidity gain. Precisely, the change in the morbid ity gain for breast and stomach cancer is smaller than for mortality. This result implies that there have been greater improvements in middle aged morbidity associated with cancer tha n for tuberculosis and mortality, where the most improvements have been at the youngest and oldest ages, which receive a lower value when the age weighting function is applied. This observation is very important for the thesis a s it adds additional weight to the arguments of the thesis concerning the need to incl ude morbidity in health measures. Hence, a comparison of the mortality and morbidity gains in Table 8.1.7 (un-weighted) and Table 8.1.13 (age-weighted) indicates clear improve ments in health that are not evident for Results: Quantitative: Disease - 303 - mortality (namely an improvements in the age burden of disease) and therefore these subtle morbidity gains need to be represented. These findings complete the sensitivity analyses of the thesis through reiterating that regardless what values are chosen (within the gener ous range of thesis variable weights) the QALE gain consistently generates results that c onfirm the conclusions of the thesis. I.e. the value of health improvements and the subsequent need to measure health is highlighted by all of the above results, regardless of the vari able weights. This finding will be reinforced throughout the remainder of Part III of the thesis, when these results are considered in an extended measure of economic devel opment, i.e. for their contribution to economic development (as an appendage to GDP per ca pita growth, below) and also (in Chapter 9) when the limited number of illnesses ana lysed in Chapter 8 will be extrapolated forward in order to provide a lowest bound estimate about the value of all twentieth century morbidity (and existing aggregate mortality ) improvements. 8.1.5 Value of QALE Gains Relative to GDP To bring greater significance to the above findings it is possible to consider the QALE gain in conjunction with GDP growth. This exercise is al so important because it will highlight the authenticity of the thesis claims to consider w ider notions of economic development that include health, e.g. through appending some fo rm of health statistic to national income measures to account for improvements in health and standards of living. Hence, as well as standardising the above QALE gains with economic gr owth the information below will provide a more accurate account of aggregate twenti eth century economic welfare growth. This analysis will utilise the age-weighted 'Mid' o r central QALE gain results that have been derived above, in Table 8.1.13, because these are deemed to be the most accurate. Therefore, the mortality, morbidity and QALE gain r esults presented in Table 8.1.13 will be used here to calculate the compound average rate of growth for each of these variables (see Table 8.1.14) so that the difference in value of growth can be identified between: mortality, morbidity, QALE and GDP. This will enabl e the two key benefits of this section to first to highlight the extensiveness of health d evelopments relative to GDP, and second, emphasise the demands of the thesis about the need to include health measures in some form of extended national income. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 304 - After this has been achieve the QALE growth will be considered in conjunction with GDP growth in order to present a single, rounded growth estimate, where the value of the QALE gains will be added to the value of GDP for the era under consideration and the combined compound average growth rate will be calculated (se e Table 8.1.15) in order to provide a first approximation about what the extended nationa l income would have been for twentieth century England.

This is achieved through applying the most credible mortali ty gain, morbidity gain and QALE gain estimates (wh ich are deemed by the author to be the age-weighted mid values presented in Table 8.1.13) to the compounding formula, in order to generate a n estimate about average growth per annum for the twentieth century. Once this has been achieved it is possible to consi der the relative value of mortality, morbidity and QALE gains versus GDP gains. This consideration reiterates the need to consider both mortality and morbidity: given the magnitude of ave rage annual growth of mortality gains and morbidity gains. For example, in Table 8.1.14, mort ality gain growth was approximately as much as GDP growth during the entire twentieth century, and in the earlier years (1900-1950) morta lity growth gains were greater than GDP growth gain s. 700 See Appendix 12.11 for GDP per capita compound ave rage growth rate calculations and see Appendix 12.1 2.1 and 13.6.1 for mortality and morbidity gain gro wth calculations. Results: Quantitative: Disease - 306 - Table 8.1.14 also highlights the value of morbidity gains relative to mortality and GDP gains, although the relationship is not as consiste nt as the contribution of mortality to GDP. Tuberculosis experienced the greatest morbidity gai n growth for the twentieth century in general, which was exceptionally pronounced between 1925 and 1975, when tuberculosis morbidity gains were contributing more to welfare g rowth than mortality or GDP. Between 1950 and 1975 breast cancer also experienced import ant gains which were more pronounced than mortality and GDP growth. A final crucial point that is reflected in Table 8. 1.14 is the magnitude of mortality and morbidity gains (and especially the combination of these facets embodied in the QALE gain) in nearly every single era of the twentieth c entury relative to GDP growth. This reinforces the need to consider health in some form of extended GDP measure (which will be reiterated below) and also the need to ensure th at morbidity (as well as mortality) is included in health measures. Table 8.1.15 (below) aggregates the results of Tabl e 8.1.4 in order to provide an indication of what a more rounded welfare national income woul d represent. This is achieved through imputing GDP per capita growth with QALE growth (bo th shown independently in Table 8.1.14), in order to create a series of 'Adjusted G rowth' estimates, which essentially represent national income growth adjusted for twent ieth century gains in QALE.

This exercise provides 'Ad justed Growth' levels that are very noteworthy, as they highlight the significance of o verall health improvements to the value of historical economic development. Hence, the find ings in Table 8.1.15 justify the need to consider health or QALE gains in an extended form o f GDP. Therefore, the above tables suggest that taking acc ount of QALE gains creates a much more favourable indication of the improvements in e conomic growth and particularly living standards in twentieth century England. The results highlight the need to rethink the way in which national income and health are conside red and computed and specifically the need to provide national income data that incorpora tes utility and health measures that include morbidity. These findings will be reinforced in the following chapter when similar considerations and calculations are made for the thesis' disability, b lindness. This data provides the first genuine quantitative indication about the value of improvements in disability (to match those made above for disease) for twentieth century England. 701 See Appendix 12.11 for GDP per capita compound ave rage growth rate calculations and see Appendix 12.1 2.1 and 13.6.1 for QALE gain growth calculations.

The process below will derive a quantitative estimate for the value of these improv ements. This will be achieved in a very similar process to the methodology that has been ou tlined above (in Chapter 8 and 8.1). All stages of the flow chart example apply to the calcu lation of the QALE gain for blindness (in a very similar way as it was calculated for dis eases above). The key benefit of this exercise is to provide an i ndication of the value of improvements in quality of life associated with disability that can be combined with the QALE gain for disease. This will also provide results which are n ecessary so that the findings about disability can be represented in the 'Extended Resu lts' (Chapter 9) of the thesis. The first stage of this quantitative analysis for d isability is to calculate the prevalence and summarise the quality of life (QALY) associated wit h blindness for the eras considered in the thesis. In accordance with the thesis methodolo gy outlined in the flow chart example, this represents stage 5 (identifying the QALY from EuroQol) and also part of stage 9 (compiling illness data). Once both of these data s ets have been identified it will be possible to calculate the morbidity burden (prevale nce * QALY), which provides the foundation for stage 9 and eventually identifying t he morbidity gain and subsequent (when applied to the mortality gain identified in Chapter 8.1) QALE gain. These primary calculations are summarised below in Table 8.2.1 (p revalence) and 8.2.2 Quantitative: Disability - 309 - Table 8.2.1: Number of blind persons and average nu mber of blind years and corresponding prevalence of blindness in 1900, 1925 , 1950, 1975 and 2000 702 Year Number of blind persons Average number of years of blindness Total blind years Blind years per annum / Prevalence 10069 23 1900 8520 8 11 1197856 47914 Estimating the prevalence of blindness in the econo my is more complicated than identifying disease prevalence (which was achieved above in Chapter 8.1). This is largely because of the nature of disabilities (more protrac ted and ambiguous in duration and cure) and the subsequent way in which disability data is collected and recorded (without any detail or follow-up). Therefore, an alternative app roach to estimating the prevalence of blindness is adopted here: the prevalence data abov e is derived from considering the number of people who are blind and the average numb er of years that they spent in blindness (which is equivalent to the number of yea rs of life expectancy at the age of onset of blindness). This is necessary as there are no of ficial estimates of the prevalence of blindness. In Table 8.2.1 prevalence is estimated with two (th ree in 1950) entries for the number of blind persons and years because there were generall y two (three in 1950) most common ages of blindness, which were considered in the est imation of the prevalence of blindness. A detailed explanation of the calculations and resu lts of this unique disability prevalence estimating process is provided in Chapter 4: Table 4.9 and 4.10. 702 In Table 8.2.1 the number of blind years': est imated from the age distribution and profile of blindness in the relevant era, for an elaboration a nd base calculations see Chapter 4: Tables 4.9 and 4.10 and Appendix 12.13.1, 'Total blind years': multiplying the 'Blind yea rs per annum': 'Total blind years'/25 to achiever p er annum estimates. Note: these are period estimate s, which provide a snapshot of prevalence for the year stated in column 1 of Table 8.2.1. Results: Quantitative: Disability - 310 - A noteworthy feature associated with the prevalence of blindness calculated in Table 8.2.1 is the improvement in the approximate average numbe r of years of blindness during the twentieth century, which declined from nearly 16 ye ars in 1900 and a peak of 34 years in 1950 to about 11 years of blindness by 2000 (calcul ated by averaging the 'average number of years of blindness' entries in Table 8.2.1 for e ach year). Although this is only an estimate, because of the problems associated with i dentifying blind prevalence by age, the results are still important. In contrast to the ave rage number of blind years the 'prevalence' of blindness (used in the thesis) has increased fro m approximately 11,990 blind years per annum in 1900 to 47,914 in 2000 (shown in Table 8.2 .1) 703 . The next key variable, which is also considered con sistently across the thesis (although contains slightly different facets for disability a nd disease) is the quality of these blind life years, QALY704 . The QALY is the variable that represents the burd en of illness through considering its consequence upon a healthy life yea r, such that the QALY is the fraction (greater than 0 which approximates death) of 1, whi ch represents a full healthy life year. These results about the QALY for blindness during d ifferent eras of the twentieth century are shown in Table 8.2.2. In the same way as for di seases, the blind QALY has been derived in Chapter 7 (through EuroQol). Table 8.2.2 also reports 1-QALY, which is the index needed for calculating the morbidity burden, because of the way in which the QALY is considered in the QALE methodology (this has bee n explained in more detail above in Chapter 8.1: Section 8.1.1). Table 8.2.2: 8.2.2 highlights that the quality of life ass ociated with blindness improved between 1900 and 1950, and that despite marginal improvemen ts in the quality of life during the 703 It should be noted that the prevalence statistic c alculated here (Table 8.2.1) differs from the 'prev alence of blindness in twentieth century England' s tatistic provided earlier in the thesis (see Figure 4.1 in C hapter 4). The reason for the difference is that th e prevalence (here, in Chapter 8.2) considers 'blin d years' and not just the number of blind who returned an au thentic BD8 form, in order to register as such. 704 See Chapter 3: Subsection 3.5.1: Key Variables for an elaboration 705 See Appendix 12.6.2 for blind QALY calculations. Results: Quantitative: Disability - 311 - second half of the twentieth century (outlined in C hapter 4 and summarised in Chapter 7.1); none of these were far reaching enough to imp rove blind persons' quality of life into a more superior (EuroQol [in Chapter 7.1] and subse quent) QALY between 1950 and 2000. The impact of the change in the prevalence (outline d above in Table 8.2.1) and the QALY (shown in Table 8.2.2) will be combined in order to calculate the morbidity burden (prevalence * QALY) and identify the change in the morbidity burden over time, which can subsequently be valued (using the VSHLY) in ord er to estimate the morbidity gain. This methodological process is the same as the calc ulation of the disease morbidity gain in Chapter 8.1, except that for disability (blind) the morbidity burden (and subsequent gain) will be calculated in aggregate and not by age, for the age distributional profile of the population as was achieved for diseases in Chapter 8.1 because the data to make this more sophisticated calculation does not exist for blindn ess. 8.2.2 Morbidity Gain As in Chapter 8.1 the morbidity gain highlights the value of improved morbidity facilitated by an improvement in the burden of diseases or disa bility morbidity. An improvement in the morbidity burden can be generated by an improve ment in the QALY and/or the prevalence. In order to highlight the morbidity gain it is nece ssary to first document the change in the morbidity burden of blindness, which is achieved in Table 8.2.3. (After the change in morbidity burden has been estimated it will be poss ible to combine this with the associated VSHLY and calculate the morbidity gain). Table 8.2.3: Calculation of morbidity burden of the sis disability: blindness Year Prevalence (1-QALY) Morbidity burden considers the number of blind years 'pr evalence' (derived from Table 8.2.1) and the associated quality of these years 'QALY' (T able 8.2.2) in order to determine the morbidity burden (prevalence * 1-QALY 706 ) of blindness. This calculation is the equivalent of the more detailed process outlined in Chapter 8.1 (Tables 8.1.2.i and 8.1.2.ii) but different because the blind morbidity burden is calculated aggregately with no accounting for the changing age profile structure o f the population. Although the results in Table 8.2.3 represent a more approximate estimate o f the morbidity gain (versus those identified for diseases in Chapter 8.1) the results are still valuable and indicative. Table 8.2.3 highlights that there were improvements in the burden of blindness during the twentieth century, although this was not linear, du e to the worsening around the middle of the twentieth century and an increase in the preval ence of blindness at the end of the century (which was a result of an increase in the n umber of blind as the average duration of blindness declined over the twentieth century [show n in column 3 of Table 8.2.1]). This set back in the decline in the prevalence of blindness in 1950 was a result of (accidental) adverse medical intervention (for the administratio n of oxygen to premature babies), which caused a condition of blindness known as Retrolenta l Fibroplasia and a subsequent increase in the number of blind at birth. The resul t of this adverse medical intervention was a worsening in period estimates about the burden of blindness for 1950 (shown in the table above) but was not significant enough (as the effec ts of such were identified and largely rectified by the 1960s) to show up in the next coho rts estimates 707 . Although, it should be noted that part of the morbidity burden decline bet ween 1950 and 1975 is excessively high due to this increase in the prevalence of blindness in 1950. This occurrence is also noteworthy as it indicates that medical progress ha s not always been linear during the twentieth century, an important historical detail t hat is not illustrated by the other morbidity states in the thesis. The table below provides the next stage of the disa bility quantitative analysis which is considering the above blind morbidity burden change in conjunction with a value (presented as the VSHLY) of this decline in order t o estimate the morbidity gain. 706 1-QALY is utilised in the morbidity burden calcula tion in Table 8.2.3 in accordance with the QALE met hodology (this is explained briefly above Table 8.2.3 and in more detail in Chapter 8.1). 707 Silverman, \"Retrolental Fibroplasias: A Modern Par able\", Chapters 3, 8, 9, 11 Results: Quantitative: Disability - 313 - Table 8.2.4: Morbidity gain (morbidity burden chang e*VSHLY): monetary value of improvements in the burden of morbidity: blindness (millions of 1990 international $) 708 Period Morbidity burden change VSHLY Blind morbidity gain 1900-1925 8.2.4 illustrates the process of calculating the morbidity gain. The first stage of this calculation is to identify the change in the morbid ity burden, which is achieved through considering the change between T1 and T2 (shown in the final column of Table 8.2.3) For example, the 1900-1925 morbidity burden change = mo rbidity burden in T1 (1900 in this example) minus the morbidity burden in T2 (1925 in this example), i.e. 7,994 - 7,425 = 569. The next stage of the calculation in Table 8.2.4 is to value the change in the morbidity burden, which is yielded by applying the VSHLY to t he morbidity burden change (morbidity burden change * VSHLY = morbidity gain). The VSHLY is estimated by considering the VSL and the QALY (VSL*QALY), in the same way as was outlined in detail in Chapter 8.1 (and is also outlined in the flow chart example [stage 7] at the beginning of Chapter 8). For example, continuing wi th the period 1900-1925, where the identified morbidity change was 569, this is then a pplied to the VSHLY for blindness in the period 1900-1925 (which is yielded by multiplyi ng the VSL with the QALY for the [millions of international $]). Once the VSHLY has been cal culated it is then applied to the change in the morbidity burden in order to estimate the morbidity gain. In the example of blindness between 1900 and 1925, the morbidity gain = the change in the morbidity burden*VSHLY (569*0.27=154), which results in a mor bidity gain of 154 (million 1990 international $) for blindness between 1900 and 192 5. 708 See Appendix 12.7.2 (mid estimates) for base calcu lations underlying the results in Table 8.2.4. Results: Quantitative: Disability - 314 - The above table highlights both positive and negati ve trends in the morbidity gain. The negative morbidity gains in 1925-50 and 1975-2000 a nd 1900-2000 are as a potential result of a worsening in the burden (prevalence and/or QAL Y) of blindness. More precisely a worsening in the prevalence of blindness and not th e QALY as this improved in the period 1925-1950 and especially in the period 1900-2000 an d was maintained between 1950 and 2000, as Table 8.2.2 highlights. Therefore, it should be noted that the worsening in the morbidity gain in 1925-1950, 1975- 2000 and 1900-2000 is entirely a result of increase d prevalence of blindness and despite the extensiveness of this increase it is partially compensated by improvements in the QALY (and also, for the periods 1975-2000 and 1900- 2000 it is largely a function of an increase in life expectancy). I.e. if there were no QALY improvements for blind sufferers during the twentieth century and the same substanti al increase in blind prevalence then the morbidity gain (or loss as is the case) would have been more than twice as unfavourable (- 8780 instead of -3059 (derived through conducting t he same calculation in Table 8.2.3 and 8.2.4 but holding the QALY constant at the 1900 lev el709 ). This dramatises the value of improvements in the quality of life (QALY). Additionally, if there were no improvements in life expectancy between 1900 and 2000 710 then the prevalence of blindness would have been on ly 26,135 in 2000 and the subsequent burden of blindness (prevalence [26135] * QALY [0.3 333]) would have been 8,711 in 2000, which is only marginally greater than the 190 0 burden of 7,994, which would mean that the blind morbidity gain (loss in this case) w ould be -315 instead of -3509 (the level that is largely a result of increased life expectan cy). Following the same methodological process outlined in the flow chart example and also adhered to in Chapter 8.1, the next stage in estima ting the QALE for blindness is to identify the mortality gain (so that this can be su mmed with the morbidity gain [presented above for blindness in Table 8.2.4] in order to life expectancy at 75 for 1900 and 200 0. Life expectancy by age data: Figures based on th e 'Office of National Statistics/Government Actuaries Department' England and Wales mortality d atabase. This is still subject to revisions.

Results: Quantitative: Disability - 315 - 8.2.3 Mortality Gain The mortality gain results utilised here are the sa me as those that were yielded above in Chapter 8.1 (Table 8.1.6). To recap: the first step in identifying the mortality gain is to identify the change in the death rate or mortality burden. This is established through considering the change in the death rate. Once the change in the mortality burden has been identified it is possible to value this, through ap plying the VSL to the change (always a decline in the death rate in the twentieth century) in the mortality burden. The result of this calculation (decline in mortality burden * VSL) wil l yield the mortality gain. These results are shown in the second column of Table 8.2.5. For a more detailed review of the mortality gain, see Chapter 8.1: Section 8.1.2: Primary Valuation of Improvements in Mortality . 8.2.4 QALE Gain Following the same methodological process as in Cha pter 8.1, the next stage in estimating the QALE gain is to combine the morbidity gain and the mortality gain. This represents stage 10 in the flow chart example at the beginning of Chapter 8. The QALE gain for blindness is presented below in Table 8.2.5. Table 8.2.5: QALE gain (morbidity gain + mortality gain): monetary value of improvements in the burden of morbidity and mortali ty for thesis disability: blindness (millions of 1990 international $) 711 Period Average mortality gain Blind morbidity gain QALE gain calculation and results of the QALE gain for blindness (mortality gain + blind morbidity gain = QALE gain). These bli nd QALE gain result highlight that in 1925-1950, to a lesser degree in 1975-2000, and in 1900-2000, the morbidity burden associated with blindness worsened and therefore pr ovided a negative contribution to the QALE gain. I.e. the blind morbidity gain was negati ve and therefore unable to provide extended QALE gains in addition to the mortality ga in. This was particularly pronounced 711 See Appendix 12.7.2 (mid estimates) for base calcu lations. Results: Quantitative: Disability - 316 - for 1925-1950, which was outlined earlier, as the r esult of Retrolental Fibroplasia. Conversely, in 1900-1925 and 1950-1975 the morbidit y burden for blindness improved and was able to provide a positive contribution to the QALE gain. As has been mentioned above, the mortality gain was positive in all the t hesis eras of the twentieth century and therefore always provided a positive contribution t o the QALE gain. The relationship between the mortality gain and mor bidity gain within the overall QALE gain can be considered in order to provide a more v ivid indication of the key contributor to the QALE gain associated with blindness. This compa rison is shown below in Figure 8.2.1. Figure 8.2.1: QALE gain: value and composition of t he morbidity gain and mortality gain towards QALE gain for thesis disability: blindness (millions of 1990 international $) 712 -6000 -4000 Gain: Mortality Gain + Blind Morbidity G ain Mortality Gain Morbidity Gain Figure 8.2.1 illustrates the contribution of the mo rtality gain (blue bar) and the morbidity gain (pink bar) to the overall QALE gain (height of blue bar + pink bar). Furthermore, the placements of the morbidity bars also represent the direction (positive or negative) of the morbidity contribution to the overall QALE gain. If the morbidity gain bar is on top of the mortality gain bar then the morbidity gain has prov ided a positive contribution to the QALE gain, and if the morbidity bar is below the mo rtality bar the morbidity gain is negative and has caused a reduction in the QALE gai n. This trend was evident in 1925- 1950, 1975-2000 and 1900-2000. 712 See Appendix 12.7.2 for the QALE gain and the comp osition of the morbidity and mortality gain towards the QALE gain. Value of QALE Gain (millions of 1990 international $) Results: Quantitative: Disability - 317 - Through considering the magnitude and direction of the morbidity gain relative to the mortality gain, in order to determine the contribut ion of improved morbidity to the QALE gain, the above figure illustrates a very important finding: in only two instances were there positive contributions of blind morbidity to the bl ind QALE gain (1900-1925 and 1950- 1975 [which was partially a result of the worsening in the blind morbidity gain in the previous era, 1925-1950]). This finding marks a sta rk contrast to the morbidity gains achieved by the thesis disease morbidity (see Figur e 8.1.1 for a direct comparison), where the morbidity gains were usually positive and in ce rtain instances more valuable than the mortality gain. This indicates that, in general, mo rbidity gains for disabilities were often negative and generally much less valuable than the morbidity gains associated with diseases in twentieth century England. Although, it should be noted that a major driver of blind morbidity increases was prevalence (not the Q ALY as this improved during the twentieth century) and more specifically, more indi vidual cases of prevalence as the average number of blind years declined per sufferer . These features are not accounted for in the above analysis but should be recognised as t hey abate a small aspect of the poor performance of the blind morbidity burden in twenti eth century England. The above results and analyses are powerful in high lighting the nature and extensiveness of improvements in blind morbidity. The final exerc ise below will ensure that the trends above are accurate through applying detailed sensit ivity analyses. In keeping with Chapter 8.1 this will contain additional (Low and High) est imates about the VSL, VSHLY and QALY. However, this will not include an age-weighti ng exercise as the data does not exist to make these considerations. With reference to the flow chart example at the beginning of Chapter 8, the following section will apply the (QA LE gain) results from stage 10 (identified above) to stages 11a, 11b, and 11c. When the same sensitivity analysis stages were appl ied to the disease QALE gain (in Chapter 8.1 above), each stage (11b then 11a+11b th en 11a+11b+11c) was initially conducted separately and then all stages of the QAL Y, VSL, VSHLY sensitivity analysis were considered in aggregate (see Table 8.1.12). Th is chapter benefits from this previous gradual and detailed explanation, and will therefor e only consider the aggregate sensitivity analysis that comprises all variables: QALY, VSL, Analyses: QALY and VSL and VSHLY Weights In this section the sensitivity analysis the morbid ity and mortality calculations will be conducted with the extremes (Low and High) and mid- point (Mid) value weights for the methodology variables: QALY, VSL and VSHLY. Once th is has been achieved this chapter will yield the broadest possible range of e stimates about the value of the QALE gain for blindness. In reference to the flow chart example this process will repeat stages 5 to 10 through applying the sensitivity analysis (st ages 11a, 11b, and 11c) alternative weights. The alternative weights that will be used for the blind morbidity gain (QALY and VSHLY) and the mortality gain (VSL) are shown in Ta ble 8.2.6 below. Table 8.2.6: Alternative (Low and High) and Mid: QA LY, VSL, VSHLY weights for QALE gain sensitivity analysis: thesis disability: blind ness (millions of 1990 international $) 713 Year QALY VSL VSHLY Low Mid High Low 0.70 0.88 1.06 0.35 0.44 0.53 Table 8.2.6 presents the values for the different v ariable weights used in the thesis' sensitivity analysis for the blind QALE gain, where 'Mid' represents the central values that have already been utilised above (in Table 8.2.5) a s the mainstream values for the blind QALE gain. 'Low' represents an exaggerated weight f or the reader who believes that the thesis has over emphasised the extensiveness and va lue of the morbidity gain (QALY and VSHLY) and over valued the mortality gain (VSL). Fo r the reader that believes the opposite, i.e. that the thesis' central weights (re presented in 'Mid') have underestimated the value of the morbidity and mortality and subseq uent QALE gain, the 'High' weights are provided. As has already been explained, the QALY for blindne ss during different eras of the twentieth century was established through an intric ate review of all relevant information sources and forms the nucleus of the blind analysis in the thesis. Despite this wide survey it 713 See Appendix 12.1.2 for alternative VSL and VSHLY values and Appendix 12.6.2 for alternative QALY val ues for thesis disability: and Appendix 13.2.2 for QALE gain calculations. Results: Quantitative: Disability - 319 - is impossible to identify a definitive and undisput ed QALY value. In recognition of this and to highlight that the thesis results still hold without an identical QALY to the ones utilised above, the analysis below will consider th e QALE gains with alternative (Low and High) QALYs. The method for calculating these alter natives (lower and upper bound estimates for the blind QALY) utilises the same pro cess as Chapter 8.1, where a lower and upper bound QALYs are used to represent 'Low' and ' High' in addition to 'Mid', which was identified by the thesis' detailed analysis. In common with the QALY, the VSL has endured much c riticism and a lack of consensus about a definitively correct value. Therefore, in a n attempt to recognise this and overcome any claims of bias the thesis will consider the bli nd morbidity and QALE gain for a range (Low and High) of VSL and subsequent VSHLY values. This consideration is in alignment with the analyses conducted for diseases in Chapter 8.1. Hence, the rationale for considering the QALE gain for all combinations of sensitivity analysis is the same for the blind QALE gain as it was for the diseases QALE gains outlined (in more detail) above, in Section 8.1. To this end, Table 8.2.7 will provide the results of calculating these alternative QALY, VSL and VSHLY weights in the QALE gain methodology (for blindness). Also in common with Ch apter 8.1, in an effort to simplify the mass of possible results (the full range of which a re provided in appendices 12.7.2 and 13.2.2) the tables below will provide a summary abo ut the 'Mid' and most extreme results, in order to provide the broadest possible array of estimates. This will be achieved through considering the highest possible QALE gain estimate (High VSL, High VSHLY, High QALY) and the lowest possible (Low VSL, Low VSHLY, Low QALY), in conjunction with the mid estimates (Mid VSL, Mid VSHLY, Mid QAL Y). Results: Quantitative: Disability - 320 - Table 8.2.7: QALE disability: blin dness with alternative QALY, VSL and VSHLY values (millions of 1990 international $) 714 Period Low QALY, Low VSL, Low VSHLY tre nd for the blind QALE gain: as the value of the QALY, VSL and VSHLY increase so does t he value of the QALE gain, with the exception of 1925-1950, which displays the oppo site trend, whereby increasing the weight of the variables (i.e. moving from 'Low' to 'High') increases the magnitude of the loss or increasingly reduces the QALE gain. This ca n be considered as a result of an increasingly valuable opportunity cost of the negat ive morbidity gain. The general trend in Table 8.2.7 (shown for all other years) is sensible as the QALY, VSL and VSHLY are the valuation aspects of health improvements (QALY and VSHLY for the morbidity gain + VSL for the mortality gain, which all contribute to the QALE gain) and therefore, when the magnitude of these variables increases so do the mo rbidity and mortality gain, which subsequently increases the QALE gain. A final noteworthy trend in Table 8.2.7 is the cons iderable variance between the lowest and highest estimates, i.e. the values in 'Low QALY , Low VSHLY'. This variance in the QALE gain can be interpreted to be a result of the very broad sensit ivity analysis (utilised in the thesis), which encompasses a range of twenty seven estimates (inst ead of one estimate) as a result of considering QALY: Low, Mid, High; VSL: Low, Mid, Hi gh; VSHLY: Low, Mid, High, and all possible combinations of these estimates in the QALE methodology. Despite the wide range of estimates and the conside rably lower value of the disability QALE gain (compared to the diseases QALE gains iden tified in Chapter 8.1) these blind QALE gain results are still important as they provi de a broader indication of twentieth 714 Table 8.2.7 is based on the same type of calculati ons as Table 8.1.7 and 8.1.11 and 8.1.10. See Appen dix 12.1.2 for VSL and VSHLY range of values to be included in sensitivity analyses and Appendix 12.6. 2 for range of QALY values and Appendix 12.7.2 and 13.2.2 for calculations. Results: Quantitative: Disability - 321 - century health (encompassing disability as well as disease) and, although relatively minimal (and negative in 1925-1950), these blind QA LE gains still contribute to the claims and conclusions that have been made throughout the thesis about the importance of twentieth century trends in health and the need to measure this in some form of extended national income. 8.2.6 Value of QALE Gain Relative to GDP It is desirable to consider these results relative to twentieth century GDP per capita. Chapter 3 and Chapter 8.1 have explained and justif ied (in more detail) the appeal of considering the QALE results in conjunction with GD P growth. The process conducted in Chapter 8.1 will be applied here in order to highli ght the contribution of the QALE gain for disability relative to GDP, and subsequently estima te a more accurate national income index that accounts for disability (in addition to disease which has already been calculated in Chapter 8.1). Results: Quantitative: Disability - 322 - Table 8.2.8: Compound average growth rates of GDP p er capita, mortality gain, morbidity gain and QALE gain and GDP per capita growth adjusted for QALE gain (using mid value QALY, VSL, VSHLY var iables and age weighting mortality) for thesis disa bility: blindness (percentage per annum) 715 Period GDP pc Growth Mortality Gain Growth Blind Morbidity Gain Growth Blind QALE Gain Growth 'Adjusted Growth' (QALE + GDP pc) 1900-1925 0.3 2.2 0.1 2.3 2.6 1925-1950 1.4 2.0 -3.2 -1.3 0.1 1950-1975 2.2 0.7 1.1 1.7 3.9 1975-2000 1.8 1.3 -0.3 0.9 2.7 1900-2000 1.4 1.4 -0.5 0.9 2.3 Table 8.2.8 considers the compound average growth r ate of GDP per capita, and mortality, morbidity and QALE gain growth (for blindness). This is achieved through applying the most credible mortali ty gain, morbidity gain and QALE gain estimates for blindness (which are deemed by the author to be the mid morbidity gain values, presented in T able 8.2.5 and the age-weighted mid mortality gain values presented in Table 8.1.14) to the compounding formula, in order to generate an estima te about average growth per annum of these variable s for the twentieth century. Once this has been achieved it is possible to consi der the relative value of mortality gains, morbidit y gains and QALE gains versus GDP gains. This consideration reiterates the limited magnitude of t he blind morbidity and QALE gain relative to the mo rbidity and subsequent QALE gains for the diseases considered in the thesis. For example, in Table 8.2.8, the blind morbidity gain growth was le ss than the mortality gain in 1900-1925, 1925- 1950, 1975-2000 and 1900-2000 (i.e. in every period other than 1950-1975). Furthermore, this detractio n was so extensive that the blind QALE gain was less valuable than the mortality gain in 1925-1 950, 1975-2000 and 1900-2000. 715 See Appendix 12.11 for GDP per capita compound ave rage growth rate calculations and see Appendix 12.2 and 12.12.2 and 13.6.2 for QALE gain growth ations. Results: 323 - Table 8.2.8 also considers 'Adjusted Growth' (shown in the final column), which represents what GDP per capita per annum growth wou ld be if it was extended to include gains in health or QALE (i.e. 'Adjusted Growth' = G DP per capita growth + QALE gain growth). The above trend of a generally negative bl ind QALE gain growth is reflected here as the contribution of the blind QALE gain to 'Adju sted Growth' is nearly entirely a result of the morbidity gain (as the blind morbidity gain tended to be minimal or negative). Therefore, the above analysis has highlighted the v alue of twentieth century improvements in the quality of life associated with blind morbid ity. Although when the blind morbidity gain is compared to GDP per capita and the mortalit y gain (and the disease morbidity gains) the results are less impressive, this should not detract from the previous findings in this chapter, which highlight important improvement s in the quality of life for the blind (embodied in the improved QALY [shown in Table 8.2. 2] and a decline in the average number of blind years per episode [shown in Table 8 .2.1]). Finally, the contrast in the twentieth century history of disability and disease is highlighted by the analysis here, which provides an additional (and not necessarily p redictable) important historical detail for the story about the health and welfare related quality of life of the population in twentieth century England.

With reference to the flow chart example at the beginning of Chapter 8, this r epresents stage 12, where the reader is able to identify the value of the QALE gain (for tu berculosis, breast and stomach cancer and blindness) associated with what they believe ab out the value of the QALY, VSL and VSHLY used in the thesis and also whether they agre e that Murray's age weighting function should be applied to the results. Figure 8.3.1 (below) provides a summary flow chart of the QALE methodology sensitivity analyses, which contains different variable weights ('Low', 'Mid', 'High' values for the QALY, VSL and utilised to calcula te the morbidity (QALY and VSHLY) and mortality (VSL) gains and then combined to form the QALE gain. Figure 8.3.1 has been provided to illuminate the methodolo gical process of the QALE gain sensitivity analysis and help the reader decipher w hat they believe to be an accurate QALE gain value. Following on from this flow chart, Table 8.3.1 prov ides a translation of the flow chart decisions. I.e. if the reader decides that: i) they are not willing to accept the thesis QALY and ii) that this is because they deem the QALY val ues outlined in the qualitative illness chapters as too high, Table 8.3.1 will translate wh at QALY value this reader favours (this is shown as the 'Low value' for the QALY [in the se cond row of Table 8.3.1]). Once the reader has made these considerations for all of the thesis QALE methodology variables (i.e. answered all stages of the flow chart) they w ill have created their profile of QALY, VSL and VSHLY values for use in the QALE gain metho dology. Table 8.3.2 presents all of the possible combinatio ns for the QALE methodology variables that the reader could have chosen from the flow cha rt in Figure 8.3.1. Hence, once the reader has chosen their preferred variable weights (from answering the flow chart questions) these are translated into the QALE gain methodology terminology (i.e. from 'flow chart term' to 'methodological term') in Results: Quantitative: Summary: Disability and Dise ase - 325 - possible QALY, VSL and VSHLY and age weighting comb inations, which are numbered to accord with the final two tables (8.3.3 and 8.3. 4) in Chapter 8.3. Once the reader has identified the number that thei r profile QALE methodological variable weights have been given (shown in Table 8.3.2) they can identify their preferred QALE gain result (in Table 8.3.3 and 8.3.4), through fin ding the same number on these two tables. Table 8.3.3 and 8.3.4 provide the series of all pos sible QALE gains for the thesis sensitivity analysis variable weights. Table 8.3.3 shows all combinations of the QALE gain (i.e. this is the consideration made in Table 8.1.1 2 and 8.2.7). Table 8.3.4 shows this QALE gain in terms of QALE gain growth per annum fo r the twentieth century, which can the be appended to GDP per capita growth (referred to as 'Adjusted Growth' in Chapter 8.1 and 8.2) to represent an extended national inco me growth that accounts for improvements in health (or 'QALE gain growth' in Ta bles gain growth pr esented in Table 8.3.4 needs to be summed with GDP growth of 1.4 percent for 1900-2000 . This process is presented below, starting with Figu re 8.1.3, the flow chart for the QALE gain methodology choice of variables, and then cont inues in the sequence outlined above.

The f inal option in Figure 8.3.1, which is age-weighting, can be deciphered by a simple 'Yes' or 'No' decision. I.e. either the reader agrees with age-weighting ('b' in the tables below) or does not ('a' in the tables below). The blind QALE gain age-weighting only applied to the m ortality gain component of the QALE gain (as the data does not exist to perform the age weighting calculations to the blind morbidity gain) and therefore answer 'b' for blind represents the blind QALE gain that comprises: un weighted blind morbidity gain + age w eighted mortality gain.

The se estimates exist for all the time periods (in addition to 1900-2000, presented here) considered in the thesis (in Appendix 12.7, 12.10, 12.2 and 13.2, 13.5, 13.6) but for sim plicity in answering the key questions of the thesis, about twentieth century improvements in health, only the twentieth century as a whole will be considered here. In both tables the QALE gain (Table 8.3.3) and QALE gain growth contribution to GDP growth per annum (Table 8.3.4) there are two column s for all illnesses. As has been explained above, these represent the un-weighted (a ) and age-weighted (b) estimates. It is important to explain why column b is consistently l ower in value and contribution than column a. As was identified in Chapter 8.1, when th e age-weighting is applied the QALE gain results become more circumscribed than their u n-weighted counterparts, because certain ages receive lower weighting than others: a nd the QALE gain (improved morbidity + mortality) was often skewed towards the youngest and oldest age groups (which receive a lower weighting than middle ages) in twentieth ce ntury England. However, it should be noted that, although the age weighting function doe s noticeably reduce the QALE gain (both in absolute terms [Table 8.3.3] and in percen tage growth per annum [Table 8.3.4]), this reduction does not change the overall conclusi ons of the thesis. Another remarkable feature in Table 8.3.3 and 8.3.4 is that, in the 'blind' columns, the lowest overall estimate is not yielded by LLL and t he highest overall estimate is not yielded by HHH. At a first approximation this resul t seems counter intuitive and perhaps incorrect. However, this is not the case. The reaso n for this relationship is the negative morbidity gain for blindness between 1900 and 2000, which means that the interaction between the QALY, VSL and VSHLY variables in the th esis QALE methodology is not consistent or reinforcing. Hence, when the QALE gai n is negative: making the QALY and the VSHLY positive increases the magnitude of the l oss, as the QALE gain becomes increasingly negative and increasing the VSL would help (as this would make the mortality gain component of the QALE gain methodology more va luable) but this in turn will cause detractions from the morbidity gain (as the morbidi ty gain = the morbidity burden change * VSHLY and the VSHLY = VSL * QALY). Results: Quantitative: Disability ase - 333 - Table 8.3.3 and 8.3.4 (and the previous analysis) h ighlight that: however low the values of the QALE methodology variables (within the realms o f those provided in the thesis' analysis) the QALE gain still yields significant re sults which provide an important contribution to economic development and standards of living. This is even true for blindness, which in the above analysis did not expe rience marked QALE gains. Conversely, this optimistic conclusion about the QA LE gain is most applicable to tuberculosis, which is to be expected as this disea se experienced a considerable improvement during the twentieth century, along wit h the general class of infectious diseases which were largely eliminated or much more easily managed during the twentieth century. The veracity of these claims concerning the contrib ution of improved health, and morbidity in particular will be reinforced in the following c hapter when these results are extended to estimate the significance of twentieth century impr ovements in the aggregate QALE. Extended Results: Quantitative: Disability and Dise ase - 334 - 9. Extended Results (Disability and Disease) 9.1 Introduction 334 9.2 Aggregate QALE Gain 337 9.3 Value of Aggregate QALE Gain Relative to GDP 342 9.4 Value of Aggregate Health (QALY) Gains 34 5 9.5 Summary 347 9.1 Introduction In an attempt to add greater significance to the fi ndings of the thesis it is desirable to consider the wider implications of the results from the three diseases and one disability analysed previously (in Chapter 8.1 and 8.2). The o bjective of this exercise is to highlight the extensiveness of improvements in health through providing a lower bound estimate about the value of aggregate QALE improvements in t wentieth century England. The aggregate QALE gain will be estimated using the following structure. The entire twentieth century profile of diseases will be diffe rentiated into four states: i) infectious (proxied by tuberculosis), ii) non-infectious (prox ied by stomach cancer), iii) disabilities (proxied by blindness) and iv) the residual. In ord er to adhere to the objective of producing lowest bound estimates, these states will be consid ered with the following constraints. Infectious diseases will be represented by only tub erculosis and will assume: (1) 'The only improvements in twentieth century health and welfare related quality of life for infectious diseases were for tuberculosis' This is conservative because of the breadth (preval ence) and depth (quality of life) of twentieth century QALE adjustments associated with infectious diseases, such that at no time did tuberculosis represent more than 12 percen t of this category. The extensiveness of the twentieth century decline of infectious mortali ty is illustrated by Figure 2.3.2 (which outlines the burden of disease [infectious and othe r key categories of mortality] at the start and end of the twentieth century). Non-infectious diseases will be conservatively esti mated through applying the twentieth century stomach cancer quality of life profile to a ll non-infectious diseases. The non- infectious series of calculations will assume: (2) 'All non-infectious diseases had the unfavourable q uality of life experienced by stomach cancer' Extended Results: Quantitative: Disability and Dise ase - 335 - This is conservative because it is almost certain t hat the average burden of non-infectious diseases was not as detrimental to quality of life as stomach cancer. The severity of the stomach cancer burden is highlighted in Table 7.3.1 in Chapter 7.3 and Table 8.1.1 in Chapter 8.1. Hence, breast cancer is also classifie d as a non-infectious disease and therefore comparing the margin in the QALY between these two diseases highlights the conservativeness of the assumptions in this chapter . Moreover, although the QALY improvements associated with breast cancer are impr essive (e.g. Table 7.3.1 shows that the breast cancer QALY improved from 0.3 of a healthy l ife year in 1900 to 0.8 in 2000), these are not necessarily representative of the most far reaching improvement in non-infectious diseases. For example, circulatory diseases affecte d more of the population (more fractions of healthy life years) and experienced a more susta ined decline in prevalence and (likely) improvement in quality of life. Therefore, this pro vides further justification for the stringency with which the non-infectious component is being estimated in this chapter. The twentieth century burden of all disabilities wi ll be most conservatively approximated through utilising only blind quality of life to rep resent all twentieth century quality of life improvements for disabilities: (3) 'The only disability to experience quality of life improvements in the twentieth century was blindness and therefore this represents all twe ntieth century quality of life improvements in disabilities' This is conservative because of the likelihood that blindness experienced more limited developments in quality of life than an 'average' d isability and subsequently, because there is no accounting for a positive, aggregate disabili ty improvement. Moreover, in a similar way to the role of stomach cancer in the non-infect ious category, blindness was a greater burden to quality of life than the 'average' disabi lity during the twentieth century. The final category is the residual, which includes all illnesses that cannot be classified into infectious, non-infectious and disability. The twen tieth century fall in the morbidity burden of this category is likely to be sizeable, because of general quality of life improvements and more substantially, because of the decline in t he size of this category. The residual has shrunk over the twentieth century as disease classi fication became more precise: from 192 categories in ICD1 used in 1900 to 5,292 in ICD9 us ed in 2000. I.e. as illnesses have Extended Results: Quantitative: Disability and Dise ase - 336 - become more precisely categorised the residual has declined: the extent of this precision is highlighted by the substantial growth of the number of ICD categories 720 . Because of the ambiguity involved in estimating the residual and the associated negative influence on the justifiability of the extended res ults, the residual will be eliminated altogether and none of the residual QALE gains will be included, as: (4) 'No residual illness will be evaluated' After the results have been presented for the above assumptions the thesis will highlight that even with these lowest bound estimate assumpti on constraints, the contribution of improved health was substantial. This will be vivid ly highlighted in Table 9.4 which calculates the value of twentieth century improveme nts in health. The above assumptions (1) to (4), which will be app lied throughout this chapter in order to yield the most conservative estimate for the aggreg ate twentieth century QALE gain are summarised in Table 9.1. 720 Calculated from: Office of Population, Censuses an d Surveys, \"Twentieth Century Mortality\" Extended Results: Quantitative: Disability and Dise ase - 337 - Table 9.1: Definition of aggregate QALE morbidity c ategories used in extended results Illness Definition / Context Infectious Tuberculosis is used to represent an excessively co nservative situation in which tuberculosis was the only infectious disease to imp rove. The magnitude of improvement would be significantly greater if all infectious di seases were included and profiled with the tuberculosis QALY improvements. Non-Infectious Non-infectious diseases have been conservatively es timated through the application of the stomach cancer profile (which is excessively pessim istic compared to the majority of non- infectious diseases) to all twentieth century non-i nfectious diseases. Disability The improved quality of life associated with blindn ess has been used to represent all disabilities and subsequently, provides a conservat ive proxy for the value of twentieth century disability gains, especially as blindness c an be considered as a particularly adverse disability. Residual The residual represents all other causes of death t hat are not contained in the above three categories. Because of the varied and hybrid nature of this category it is impossible to generate a reliable summary measure and therefore, the residual gains will not be estimated. TOTAL This contains the sum of the above categories and t herefore represents the entire twentieth century morbidity burden (based on a most conservat ive forward extrapolation of the thesis illnesses). In addition to making these stringent assumptions ( summarised in Table 9.1) this chapter will utilise the lowest bound estimates possible. I n Chapter 8.1 and 8.2 the sensitivity analysis included the estimation of the QALE gain u sing all 'Low' variables (i.e. 'Low' QALY, 'Low' VSL and 'Low' VSHLY) which represent th e variables that will be used here 721 . 9.2 Aggregate QALE Gain Chapters 8.1 and 8.2 have highlighted the importanc e of considering the QALE gain (mortality gain + morbidity gain) in order to gauge a more accurate account of twentieth century economic development. In the previous chapt ers the morbidity (and QALE) gain was a direct function of the illness to which it wa s related. I.e. the morbidity (or QALE) gain for breast cancer between 1900 and 2000 depend s on the morbidity burden 721 See Appendix 12.7.and 13.2 for detailed calculatio n of the 'Low' combination of all variables in the tuberculosis and blind morbidity gain, respectively. These lowest bound QALE variable weig hts will be utilised here. also utilise 'Low' QALY, VSL and VSHLY variable weights. It should be noted that because of the interaction between the n umbers and variables (which are features not strictly related to the QALE considera tions of the thesis) it is possible to find values which are lower than the 'Low' QALY, VSL and VSHLY estimates ( for example, see Table 8.3.3 and the subsequent explanation about this phenomeno n). Hence, it should be noted that what needs to be evaluated here in order to provide original estimates about the lowest bound approxim ation of the value of QALE in twentieth century England is the QALE gain that encompasses t he lowest variable weights as these are based on th e most stringent assumptions about the value of improvements in QALE. Extended Results: Quantitative: Disability and Dise ase - 338 - (prevalence * QALY) of breast cancer and the morbid ity gain (change in the morbidity burden * VSHLY [= VSL * QALY]) of breast cancer, an d (when combined with the mortality gain), the QALE gain for breast cancer be tween 1900 and 2000. The exercise below makes slightly more ambiguous calculations, w here the QALE gain represents more than only one underlying illness. The assumptions t hat will be used in this chapter, to yield a more aggregate QALE gain estimate are outlined in Table 9.1. For example, in Chapter 8.1, the QALE gain for stomach cancer was (directly and only) related to the morbidity gain for stomach cancer (+ the mortality gain). In the Chapter 9 analysis (below), the stomach cancer morbidity gain profile will be used to proxy all non-infectious diseases, through utilising the stomach cancer variables (QAL Y, VSHLY) and applying these to the non-infectious prevalence. The results of this proc ess will be a (lower bound) estimate of the QALE gain (stomach cancer morbidity gain variab les + non-infectious morbidity gain prevalence = non-infectious morbidity gain /barb2right non-infectious morbidity gain + mortality gain = non-infectious QALE gain) for all non-infect ious diseases. This process (of using the QALY and VSHLY profile [ for the specific disease, presented in Chapter 8] combined with the more broad disease class prevalence [presented here]) is (the aggregate QALE gain methodology) utilised only for non-infectious diseases. This is because the QALE gain for infectious diseases and d isability requires a different approach (due to the nature of these broad morbidity classes ). Chapter 8.1 has highlighted the substantial QALE ga ins associated with tuberculosis (see Table 8.1.7 and 8.3.3 722 ), which can be considered as a typical twentieth c entury trend for infectious diseases (e.g. Part I of the thesis has indicated the nature of twentieth century morbidity through the epidemiological transition, w hich represents a decline in infectious morbidity that was replaced by non-infectious). The refore, Chapter 9 will present the lowest QALY, VSL, 'Low' VSHLY an d QALE gain for tuberculosis (see Table 8.3.3) as the infectious disease QALE gain. This represents the lowest bound infectious QALE ga in for two reasons: because it is the lowest bound tuberculosis QALE gain and also becaus e it is utilising the assumption that: 'The only improvements in twentieth century health and welfare related quality of life for infectious diseases were for tuberculosis' 722 The values utilised in Chapter 9 are derived from Table 8.3.3 'b' columns (and not Table 8.1.7 or 8.2 .7) because Table 8.3.3 considers the age weighted, 'Low' QALY, VSL, VSHLY morbidity and QALE gain, lowest bound estimate. Extended Results: Quantitative: Disability and Dise ase - 339 - This creates a significant underestimate of the pot ential QALE gain for all types of infectious morbidity (additional to tuberculosis). The QALE gain for disability, presented here will u tilise the QALE gain for blindness from Chapter 8.2. In a similar way to the abovement ioned QALE gain for infectious diseases (where only tuberculosis was valued for th e entire infectious gain) only the blind QALE gain will be used as the representative of all disability improvements. This is conservative because of the likelihood that blindne ss experienced more limited developments in quality of life than an 'average' d isability and subsequently, because there is no accounting for a positive, aggregate disabili ty improvement (as the 1900-2000 blind morbidity gain is negative). Hence, in a similar wa y to the role of stomach cancer in the non-infectious category, blindness was a greater bu rden to quality of life than the 'average' disability during the twentieth century. Therefore, Chapter 9 will present the lowest bound ('Low' QALY, 'Low' VSL, 'Low' VSHLY) morbidity (see Table 8.3.3 723 ) as the disability QALE gain. Table 9.2 (below) applies the above methodological assumptions to produce estimate about the morbidity, mortality and QALE gain for the hypo thetical disease environment that Chapter 9 has generated (summarised in Table 9.1) i n order to provide a lower bound estimate about the aggregate QALE gain in twentieth century England. Table 9.2: Aggregate QALE gain (morbidity gain + mo rtality gain): monetary value of improvements in the burden of morbidity and mortali ty for aggregate disease environment, 1900-2000 (millions of 1990 international $) 724 Illness Morbidity Gain Mortality Gain QALE Gain the thesis QALE gain methodo logy, where the morbidity and mortality gain are calculated (through valuing [usi ng the VSHLY and VSL] the change in the morbidity and mortality burden) and summed to e stimate the QALE gain. The data 723 Ibid 724 See Appendix 13.3 (age weighted, Low VSL) for mort ality gain calculation. See Appendix 13.4 (age-weig hted, Low VSL, VSHLY and QALY estimate) morbidity See 12.10 and 13.5 (age-weighted, Low VSL, VSHLY calculations. Extended Results: Quantitative: Disability and Dise ase - 340 - about the prevalence, QALY, VSL and VSHLY for the d isease categories in Table 9.2 are outlined in detail in Appendix 12.14.1. This repres ents stages 8, 9 and 10 in the flow chart example at the beginning of Chapter 8. Also, the se nsitivity analysis stages 11a, 11b, 11c and 11d are utilised as these values represent the QALE gain for the 'Low' thesis variables that have also been age weighted. I.e. the results here, for infectious (which equals tuberculosis) and disability (which equals blindnes s) are the same as the age weighted, 'Low' QALY, VSL, VSHLY QALE gain results in Table 8 .3.3. Hence, the table above presents the morbidity gain, mortality gain and subsequent QALE gain for the aggregate diseases environment. For in fectious diseases this is the same calculation that was made in the first row (column 8 [Tuberculosis: b]) of Table 8.3.3, which represents the which is then subjected t o Murray's age weighting function. Tuberculosis represents all infectious diseases (QA LE gains) here because of the conservative assumptions of this chapter (outlined in Table 9.1). For disability the result in Table 9.2 is also deri ved from the same calculation that was made in the first row of Table 8.3.3 (column 10 [Bl ind: b]), which represents Murray's age weighting function is also applied to the mortality gain (but not to the morbidity gain is not because the data does not exi st to make this calculation). The second row of Table 9.2 represents the non-infe ctious morbidity, mortality and QALE gain. The mortality gain is derived from the same c alculation as for disability and infectious diseases (i.e. through using a 'Low' VSL in the mortality gain methodology and using Murray's age weighting function). The morbidi ty gain is derived through a slightly different process: this calculation is constructed through combining the prevalence of non- infectious diseases (as the total number of reporte d diseases that are non-infectious and not in the residual, shown in Appendix 12.14.1) with th e stomach cancer variable (QALY and VSHLY) profile, which is thought to be worse than t he average variable profile for non- infectious diseases. Hence, the non-infectious morb idity burden is calculated as: non- infectious disease prevalence * stomach cancer ['Lo w'] QALY) and the subsequent morbidity gain is calculated: change in the morbidi ty burden (between 1900 and * ['Low'] VSHLY Disability and Dise ase - 341 - The mortality gain shown in column three of Table 9 .2 represents the lowest possible estimate of the mortality gain throughout all of th e thesis' analysis. This was derived through valuing the change in the mortality burden with a 'Low' VSL, and also through subjecting this mortality gain to Murray's age weig hting function (Chapter 8.1 has explained why this reduced the mortality gain). Finally, the QALE gain column is established by sum ming the morbidity gain and the mortality gain, for each disease category (this acc ords with the thesis QALE methodology and is explained in detail in Chapter 8.1). The fin al row of the QALE gain column (Total QALE gain) represents the aggregate QALE gain. This is calculated by summing all the morbidity gains with the mortality gain (i.e. 11047 + -7467 + -2792 + 7372 = 8160), which yields an aggregate QALE gain of 8,160 (thousand 19 90 international $) or in excess of 8 billion (1990 international $) for twentieth centur y England. Hence, Table 9.2 highlights the extensiveness of im provements in health, which were most significant for infectious causes, as a result of a substantial decline in the prevalence and an improvement in the QALY. Table 9.2 illustrates that the infectious QALE gain was so extensive that it was able to entirely offset the l osses for non-infectious and disability. Similarly although not to the same extent, the mort ality gain was positive and significant as a result of a substantial decline in the death rate and secondarily, the value (even at a lowest approximation) of this improvement. The othe r two broad categories of morbidity (non-infectious and disability) reflect a less posi tive trend: where the QALY has improved but the prevalence has increased (see Table 8.1.1 f or tuberculosis and Table 8.2.3 for blind) to such an extent that there is a negative morbidit y gain and a subsequently lower QALE gain. This was most noteworthy for non-infectious d iseases between 1900 and 2000. However, even in this lowest bound exercise, from a quality of life perspective, the actual situation was more optimistic than what is implied in the table, because the pessimism is more associated with prevalence than the QALY. It s hould also be noted that in actuality these improvements would be much more substantial t han they are here, as the thesis extended results aggregate QALE gain is trying to c alculate the lowest bound value (in order to escape from accusations of bias). As well as generating an approximate lowest bound v alue of the aggregate QALE gain (which was substantial, at about 8 billion [1990 in ternational $]), Table 9.2 is also valuable Extended Results: Quantitative: Disability and Dise ase - 342 - for reiterating the thesis message about the value of morbidity gains and the need to measure these in tandem with mortality gains. This is most crucial for the morbidity gain associated with infectious diseases, which was more valuable than the mortality gain for the twentieth century, which highlights that only c onsidering mortality would create a serious underestimate of twentieth century health g ains. 9.3 Value of Aggregate QALE Gain Relative to GDP In common with Chapter 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3, the value of the aggregate QALE gain results in Table 9.2 can be further emphasised by comparing th em with national income growth in twentieth century England. Also in common with Chap ter 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 this exercise will highlight the authenticity of the thesis claim s to consider wider notions of economic development that include health, e.g. through appen ding some form of health statistic to national income measures to account for improvement s in health and standards of living. Hence, as well as standardising the aggregate QALE gains with economic growth the information below will provide a more accurate acco unt of twentieth century economic development. This analysis will use the mortality, morbidity and subsequent QALE gain values presented in Table 9.2, which will be utilised here to calculate the compound average rate of growth for each of these variables so that the d ifference in value of growth can be identified for mortality, morbidity, QALE and GDP. After this has been achieved the QALE growth will be considered in conjunction with GDP growth in order to present a single, rounded growth estimate (presented here as 'Adjusted Growth'), where the growth of the aggregate QALE will be added to the growth o f GDP. This will provide a first approximation about what the extended 'Fisherian' n ational income would have been for twentieth century England. Extended Results: Quantitative: Disability and Dise ase - 343 - Table 9.3: Compound average growth rates of GDP per capita, mortality gain, morbidity gain and QALE ga in and GDP per capita growth adjusted for aggregate QALE gain, 1900-2000 (percentage per annum) 725 Illness GDP pc Growth Mortality Gain Growth Morbid ity Gain Growth QALE Gain Growth 'Adjusted Growth' GDPpc) 4.1 Non-Infectious -1.1 -0.01 1.4 Disability -0.4 0.8 2.2 TOTAL 1.4 1.1 0.1 1.2 2.6 Table 8.2.8 considers the compound average growth r ate of GDP per capita and the mortality, morbidity and QALE gain growth (for infectious and non-infectious diseases and for disability) for the aggregate twentieth century QALE. This is achieved through applying the mortality, morbidity and QALE gain for the morbid states used in Chapter 9 t o the compounding formula, in order to generate an estimate about average growth per annum for the twentieth century. The reason that the mortality gain growth in this t able is different to that which was present in Chap ter 8 in Tables 8.1.14 and 8.2.8 is because these tables utilised the age-weighted 'Mid' mortality ga in and Table 9.3 utilises the age-weighted 'Low' mo rtality gain. This is also the reason that the infectious morbidity gain does not equal the tuberc ulosis morbidity gain in Table 8.1.14 and the disab ility morbidity gain does not equal the blind morbidity gain in Table 8.2.8. The infectious and d isability QALE gains presented in Table 9.3 do corr espond with the same indices in Table 8.3.4 (tuberculosis in row 1 column 8 [b] and blindness i n row 1 column 10 [b]) as these are the same (age w eighted 'Low' QALY, VSL, VSHLY) measures. 725 See Appendix 12.11 for GDP per capita compound ave rage growth rate calculations and see Appendix 12.1 4.2 and 13.6 for calculations in Table 9.3. Extended Results: Quantitative: Disability and Dise ase - 344 - It is possible to consider the relative value of mo rtality gains and morbidity gains and QALE gains versus GDP gains. This consideration rei terates the negative nature of the non-infectious and to a lesser extent the disabilit y morbidity gain. On a more positive note the substantial infectious morbidity gains are evid ent in Table 9.3, and are calculated to be grater than GDP growth and the mortality gain, whic h provided a valuable addition to economic development. These results are also reflec ted in the QALE gain column for each morbid state, i.e. the QALE gain for infectious was substantial at a twentieth century per annum growth of 2.6 percent (nearly double GDP grow th for the same era, which was 1.4 percent). The QALE gain for non-infectious diseases was negative as a result of the magnitude of the negative non-infectious morbidity burden and the disability QALE gain was positive but small, also as a result of the neg ative morbidity gain (which was not as severe as for non-infectious diseases and this is w hy the disability QALE gain is positive). Possibly the most important QALE gain in Table 9.3 is the total QALE gain, because this presents the aggregate QALE gain growth contributio n to twentieth century GDP growth. This is also noteworthy because of the magnitude of the aggregate QALE gain growth, which was nearly as significant as the compound ave rage rate of GDP growth per annum in twentieth century England (1.2 percent versus 1. 4 percent per annum, respectively). Table 9.3 also considers 'Adjusted Growth' (shown i n the final column), which represents what GDP per capita per annum growth would be if it was extended to include gains in health or QALE (i.e. 'Adjusted Growth' = GDP per ca pita growth + QALE gain growth). This shows that for infectious diseases and disabil ity there would be an increase in 'Adjusted Growth' and for non-infectious a marginal decrease (of 0.01 percent). Moreover, when GDP growth is combined with aggregate QALE gai n growth this shows the magnitude of 'Adjusted Growth', where accounting fo r the aggregate QALE gain nearly doubles existing levels of economic growth. This is significant for two key reasons: the relative value of QALE gains compared to GDP gains (where GDP is 1.4 percent and the QALE gain is 1.2 percent) and also, if this per ann um growth gain is considered for the entire twentieth century then this represents a lot of growth (e.g. approximately an additional 120 percent of twentieth century economi c growth). Hence, if improved twentieth century health was inc luded in some form of extended national income measure, then growth would have bee n more like 2.6 percent per annum Extended Results: Quantitative: Disability and Dise ase - 345 - rather than the GDP only measure of 1.4 percent per annum, where the difference between these two represents the value of improvements in h ealth in twentieth century England. 9.4 Value of Aggregate Health (QALY) Gains Finally, an alternative method for illuminating the extensiveness of the twentieth century aggregate QALE gains is to consider the value of th e QALE gain with and without the documented QALY improvements in the morbidity part of this methodology. To recap, the QALY is multiplied with the prevalence to estimate the morbidity burden (prevalence * QALY). The change in the morbidity burden is then v alued (by applying the VSHLY, which equals the VSL * QALY), to estimate the morbi dity gain, which can then be combined with the mortality gain to calculate the Q ALE gain (see the QALE methodology flow chart worked example at the beginning of Chapt er 8 for a more detailed outline of the thesis QALE gain methodology, especially stages 5 t o 10). As has been outlined above, the QALY is utilised to calculate the morbidity burden (prevalence * QALY ) and the morbidity gain (change in the morbidity b urden * VSHLY [= QALY * VSL]). Also outlined above, is that the QALY (for all thesis illnesses) improved over the twentieth century. It was these i mprovements (embodied in the QALY) that were very valuable and provided one of the maj or contributors to the QALE gain. In order to highlight this point, which will also reaf firm the thesis claims (about the extensiveness of health improvements, the value of these QALE gains and the subsequent need to measure them in some form of extended natio nal income), it is necessary to recalculate the morbidity burden change, morbidity gain and subsequent QALE gain, with a constant QALY value (i.e. one that has not improv ed beyond the 1900 level). This can then be compared to the genuine morbidity burden ch ange, morbidity gain and QALE gain (using the actual dynamic and improving QALY betwee n 1900 and 2000) in order to identify the margin of difference (i.e. how much mo re valuable the latter QALE gain is than the former), which represents the value of the changing QALY or the value of health improvements in twentieth century England. Extended Results: Quantitative: Disability and Dise ase - 346 - Table 9.4: Value of twentieth century health improv ements for aggregate disease environment, 1990-2000 (millions of 1990 internatio nal $) 726 Illness Mortality Gain Morbidity Gain (with no health improvements) Morbidity Gain (with health improvements) QALE Gain Value of health improvements Infectious 506 11047 Non-Infectious -8811 -7467 Disability -23950 -2792 7372 -32760 788 -25388 8160 33548 In Table 9.4 the mortality gain estimate is the sam e as what has been calculated above (see Table 9.2). The morbidity gain estimate (with healt h improvements) is also the same as the morbidity gain that was calculated in Table 9.2. Th e subsequent QALE gain for health improvements (which is the sum of all health improv ement morbidity gains and the mortality gain [11047 - 7467 - 2792 {=788} + 7372=8 160]) is also the same calculations as in Table 9.2. The morbidity gain (with no health improvements) ha s been calculated by conducting the same QALE gain methodological process (morbidity bu rden [prevalence * QALY] /barb2right morbidity burden change between 1900 and 2000 /barb2right value of the change in the morbidity burden [change in the morbidity burden * VSHLY = VS L * QALY] = morbidity gain /barb2right morbidity gain + mortality gain = QALE gain) but in stead of allowing the QALY to improve between 1900 and 2000 (as it did), this ver sion of the QALE gain holds the QALY constant. The results shown as the morbidity a nd QALE gain (with no health improvements) represent the results of this calcula tion. The appeal of calculating the aggregate QALE gain ( with no health improvements), achieved through holding the QALY constant (at 1900 levels) is so that the difference between this calculation and the aggregate QALE gai n (with health improvements) 726 In Tale 9.4 the mortality gain and morbidity gain (with health improvements) and subsequent QALE gain (health improvements) are derived from earlier analysis in Table 9.2 and Appendix 12.14.1. See App endix 12.14.3 for morbidity gain (with no heal impr ovements) QALE gain (no health improvements) calculations. Extended Results: Quantitative: Disability and Dise ase - 347 - calculation can be estimated in an effort to identi fy the value of twentieth century health gains: the difference between these two results equ als the value of twentieth century health improvements. In Table 9.4 the final result, 'value of health improvements' is the difference between the result in the previous two c olumns (i.e. 33,548 is the magnitude of the difference between -25,388 and 8,160). Therefore, through holding the QALY aspects of the thesis methodology constant, Table 9.4 highlights the significance of the twentieth ce ntury gains in morbidity that has been solely a result of improvements in the health and w elfare related quality of life. The result of this exercise provides significant results, wher e these health and welfare quality of life (or QALY) improvements were worth approximately 33, 548 million (1990 international $) or 33.5 billion (1990 international $). This findin g in Table 9.4 provides the single biggest evidence for the claims of the thesis: about the va lue of twentieth century improvements in health and the subsequent need to measure these far reaching developments. 9.5 Summary The key objective of this extended results chapter was to calculate a lowest bound estimate that is (as far as possible) verified, in order to highlight the authenticity of the thesis claims. Hence, the author recognises that the figur es derived here are not precise or even a close approximation about the actual twentieth cent ury aggregate QALE gain (as this would be considerably higher, albeit unjustified). However, what is undeniable is the illustration that improvements in health in twentie th century England were substantial. Therefore, the previous results reiterate the claim s of the thesis about the value of improved health (mortality and morbidity) and the n eed to include this index in some form of economic development measure. Chapter 9 has subs tantiated these claims through extending the (thesis morbidity and QALE gain) resu lts in order to indicate a lower bound estimate about the value of the twentieth century a ggregate QALE gain. Hence, in this chapter the calculations made stringent assumptions which were applied to the existing thorough findings of the thesis evaluations about h ealth, in order to justify the claims of the thesis. This process has also generated more univer sal and therefore meaningful findings, which fill an important void in the literature to d ate. The key feature to note from the above analysis is the largely positive nature of the aggregate QALE gain (which embodies improvements in the prevalence and/or the burden Extended Results: Quantitative: Disability and Dise ase - 348 - of morbidity and improvements in the burden of mort ality) and the mandate this provides for adopting a fuller notion of health (rather than only gauging mortality improvements): both because of the need to more accurately propaga te improvements in health (namely, infectious diseases) and also because of the need t o better specify and understand the dynamics of twentieth century health improvements ( i.e. the nature and magnitude of changes in health across all disease classes). This adds weight to the literature that has made similar claims (but with less evidence) about the need to measure health in some form of extended national income. For example, Ushe r claims that measures of economic development are seriously misleading without accoun ting for health improvements, wich have been empirically justified here: in simple ter ms, not accounting for health developments reduces economic development by nearly half (e.g. 1.4 percent versus 2.6 percent). The full implications of such extensive a nd valuable developments in the QALE will be highlighted in the following chapter: Concl usion. Moreover, identifying and measuring more detailed a spects of health provide important contributions to the existing literature and debate s about the twentieth century health transition in England. The trends in health identif ied here (i.e. the aggregate QALE gain which has been evaluated in Chapter 9) confirm the accuracy of the epidemiological transition and also provide evidence against the mo re pessimistic theories associated with the next stage of the epidemiological transition. F or example, the 'failure of success' hypothesis (which is explained in detail in Chapter 2: Section 2.1.2.3, and essentially insinuates that the products of twentieth century m edical developments have served more to prolong diseases and increase the proportion of morbidity in the economy, instead of diminishing disease and enriching life 727 ) marks a contrast with the thesis findings about the existence and value associated with twentieth c entury health and welfare related quality of life (embodied in the QALY), which is shown in T able 9.4. The thesis has also provided evidence in support of the more optimistic theories (e.g. 'compression of morbidity', 'dynamic equilibrium' and to a lesser extent stage' of the epidemiological transition hypothesis 728 ), which will be outlined in detail in the followin g chapter. 727 Gruenberg, \"The Failure of Success\", p. 5 728 For a detailed explanation of these theories see P art I: Chapter 2.1: Section 2.2.2.3: Implications of the Epidemiological Transition in G eneral . Conclusion - 349 - 10. Conclusion The thesis has highlighted both qualitatively and q uantitatively that during the twentieth century the English population experienced far reac hing improvements in health and that the quality of life implications of these improvements were substantial. In addition to creating a methodology capable of yielding a detailed spectrum of results about the value of improved health, the thesis has also filled a historical voi d, about the nature of health improvements and their contribution to twentieth century improvement s in standards of living and more utility based economic development. Throughout the thesis, health has been considered a s a dual entity, comprising mortality and morbidity. The mortality component accounted for im provements in the death rate or increased life expectancy and the morbidity compone nt accounted for improvements in the prevalence of disease and/or the burden (i.e. the h ealth and welfare related QALY). These two health indices have been combined and simultaneousl y measured in the thesis QALE methodology in order to provide an accurate and com prehensive health measure which is capable of providing credible answers to the centra l questions of the thesis: what was the extent and value of improvements in health? And, wh at has been the impact of these health improvements upon standards of living and economic development in twentieth century England? One of the thesis' most important contributions to knowledge is the developments of a representational health measurement methodology tha t can account for historical health improvements, from a health and welfare related qua lity of life perspective. Blindness, tuberculosis and cancer (breast and stomach) were e valuated in intricate qualitative detail and all aspects that were important for the health and welfare related quality of life were considered and gauged on the thesis' universal meas urement spectrum (EuroQol). Once this had been achieved it was possible to derive QALY we ights for different eras of the twentieth century for each of these illnesses, which were the n utilised as the core morbidity component in the quantitative model. As well as providing a d etailed justification for the QALY values, this enabled considerations about the extent to whi ch health (mortality and morbidity, proxied by these three broad illnesses) had improved and th e monetary value of these improvements Conclusion - 350 - and the implications of such valuable contributions upon the entire burden of mortality and morbidity in twentieth century England. Hence, the thesis has transformed the qualitative m orbidity analyses into indices which were utilised for the foundation of the quantitative mor bidity measurement. This was partnered with mortality in order to provide an original quantitat ive (monetary) measure of the contribution of improved health (mortality and morbidity) for the t hesis illnesses (Chapter 8). These findings then formed the basis of calculations about the ent ire burden of health (aggregate QALE) in twentieth century England in order to provide conse rvative estimates about the value of improved health, which has been estimated as extrem ely valuable and significant in the thesis (Chapter 9). Moreover, the findings of the thesis h ighlight that even for disabilities and diseases that have experienced a sizeable increased prevalence rate during the twentieth century, there have been improvements related their prognosis, for example, although the calculations are very approximate, there seems to b e improvements in the average length of duration of morbidity between 1900 and 2000. E.g. t he blind prevalence rate increased substantially but when the approximate average year s of blindness are estimated (16 years in 1900 versus 11 in 2000), the implications become mu ch more positive 729 . Furthermore, the burden of all morbidity experienced an improvement in the health and welfare related quality of life for all illnesses in the thesis (highlighte d by the 2000 QALY always being more favourable than its 1900 counterpart). This scenari o is greatly exaggerated through considering diseases that have experienced an improved burden ( QALY) and a decline in the prevalence rate, as the morbidity contribution of a declined p revalence rate and a reduced burden of illness provides very far-reaching contributions. F or example, this has been highlighted with the tuberculosis considerations made throughout the thesis. The findings of the thesis seem sensible, since mor tality and morbidity improvements in twentieth century England have been substantial and health gains are valuable to individuals (which is highlighted by the magnitude of the VSL a nd VSHLY). The calculations of such valuable developments even at the lowest bound, pro vides considerable weight to claims for measuring health. Hence, the findings that, at a lo wer bound estimate, the value of twentieth century health improvements of 33,548 million (1990 international $) adds to a new view of 729 See Chapter 8.2: Table 8.2.1. Conclusion - 351 - the economics of health 730 . This new view is that improvements in health have been a major contributor to economic welfare in twentieth centur y England and have provided considerable additions to the growth of national income defined on a utility basis. The above types of claim, which, towards the end of the twentieth century became increasingly more commonplace in the health and dev elopmental literature, are reiterated by the findings of the thesis. The most notorious prop onents of these claims and the associated contribution of the thesis to these claims are outl ined below. Usher (1980) propagated the need to measure health in some form of extended national income through claims that the growth of GNP alone significantly understates the extent to which current generations are better off than earli er generations731 . The thesis has empirically justified Usher's claims through considering the co ntribution of the aggregate QALE gain to GDP per annum for the twentieth century, to highlig ht that, in simple terms, not accounting for twentieth century health (mortality and morbidity) developments reduces economic development by nearly half: GDP average growth for the twentieth century was 1.4 percent per annum versus 1.2 percent per annum for QALE (or health) gains, and a subsequent 'Adjusted Growth', which combines GDP growth with t he aggregate QALE gains of 2.6 percent per annum 732 . Nordhaus (1999) has claimed that twentieth century improvements in health have provided a substantial contribution to standards of living, wh ich was justified by his study about the WTP for mortality improvements 733 . The thesis has complimented Nordhaus' findings th rough considering the WTP for morbidity as well as mortal ity, which has facilitated a more comprehensive bolster for his claims (that were bas ed solely on mortality gains). The most substantial justification that the thesis provides for these claims is the identified value of twentieth century improvements in health improvemen ts, which is shown in Table 9.4, as being in excess of 33 billion 1990 international do llars. 730 See Chapter 9: Table 9.4. 731 Usher, \"The Measure of Economic Growth\", p. 228 732 See Chapter 9: Table 9.3 733 Nordhaus, \"The Health of Nations: The Contribution of Improved Health to Living Standards\", p. 21 Conclusion - 352 - Crafts (2005) also conducted a WTP mortality study which allowed him to illustrate that since 1870 increases in life expectancy in the UK have co ntributed a great deal to the growth of real national income per head defined on a utility basis734 . The thesis has added weight to these findings through reiterating the WTP mortality gain s that Crafts originally identified and also through extending these with original WTP morbidity gains. When these components are combined (WTP mortality + WTP morbidity) the QALE g ain is calculated in order to provide a more rounded approximation of the contribution of increased life expectancy and improved health. The thesis has shown that the QALE gain has contributed even more (than mortality only) to the growth of real income per head defined on a utility basis. For example, Table 9.3 highlights that GDP or national income per annum co mpound average growth was 1.4 percent, the mortality gain contributed an additional 1.1 pe rcent and the morbidity gain 0.1 percent, or the QALE gain (mortality gain + morbidity gain) con tributed an additional 1.2 percent to national income (1.4 percent) when defined on a uti lity basis, which contributes to Crafts' original findings about the contribution of WTP mor tality in twentieth century England. Bradford DeLong (2000) has highlighted the astronom ical income that would be necessary to compensate an individual enjoying their health in t he year 2000 to return to the health conditions that were evident in 1900, and the chanc e that no amount of income could compensate for improved health 735 . The thesis has made provisional estimates about t he value of improved health, which, given their magnitude -i n excess of 33 billion 1990 international dollars - accord with the claims of Bradford DeLong736 . Hence, the above types of claims, which, towards th e end of the twentieth century became increasingly more commonplace in the health and dev elopmental literature, are in tandem with the findings of the thesis and in places the findin gs of the thesis provide a valuable contribution for confirming the veracity of these t heories. This is for two fundamental reasons: first, the thesis provides results about mortality which accord with the implications of the above claims, second, the thesis has gone a step fu rther to provide an initial and, to date, the only existing estimates about the value of morbidit y improvements, which provides an 734 Crafts (2005) \"The Contribution of Increased Life Expectancy to Growth of Living Standards in the UK, 1870-1998\", p. 10. Retrieved 17 June 2005, from: www.york.ac.uk/res/wpeg/documents/crafts.pdf 735 Bradford DeLong, \"Cornucopia: The Pace of Economic Growth in the Twentieth Century\", p. 22 736 See Table 9.4 'value of improvements in health' re sult. Conclusion - 353 - important contribution to existing measures and cla ims, which are generally based upon only mortality improvements. The findings of the thesis also provide a more invo lved contribution to one of the most pertinent twentieth century health debates (which i s more applicable to the later years of the century), which relates to the collection of theori es that have evolved out of the epidemiological transition, which has generated a r ange of opinions and theories about: the meaning of current trends in health, the outlook fo r future scenarios, and the general nature of the link between mortality and morbidity (i.e. the 'optimists' versus the 'pessimists'). The (qualitative and quantitative) findings of the thesis provide evidence against the more pessimistic theories associated with the next stage of the epidemiological transition. Hence, 'the failure of success' hypothesis, which represen ts the pessimist school of thought, essentially contends that: the twentieth century pr oducts of medical developments have served more to prolong disease and increase the proportion of the population suffering from disabling and chronic illnesses instead of diminishing diseas e and enriching life 737 . I.e. for the pessimists, most noteworthy, Kramer (1980) 738 and Gruenberg (1977) 739 , medical improvements have merely postponed death and not ne cessarily improved health and subsequently have prolonged disease and increase th e portion of the population suffering from disabling and chronic illness 740 . The thesis highlights the shortcomings of such a theory, through the detailed qualitative analysis which has charted the evolution of improved prognosis and therapy regimes associated with illne sses and most importantly, a significantly improved quality of life (QALY) profile as a result of improved medical technology. The quantitative analysis of the thesis provides a vivi d indication about the value of the improving QALY and the subsequent aggregate QALE, which has g enerated substantial results. Hence, although the pessimist claims about increased preva lence are sometimes correct (e.g. for disability and non-infectious illnesses), their the ories and reasoning about the mechanisms that are perpetuating this trend and the result of this trend seem erroneously pessimistic. 737 Gruenberg, \"The Failure of Success\", p. 5 738 Kramer, \"The Rising Pandemic of Mental Disorders a nd Associated Chronic Diseases and Disabilities\" 739 Gruenberg, Success\" 740 Gruenberg, \"The Failure of Success\", p. 5 Conclusion - 354 - A preferable set of theories for according with the findings of the thesis are the more optimistic schools of thought from this epidemiolog ical debate, for example, the theory of 'dynamic equilibrium', which claims that in the lon g term chronic illness will be confined to the last few years of life so that the proportion o f a healthy life will increase. The thesis analysis provides justification of this trend throu gh estimates about the decreasing average number of years spent in blindness (shown quantitat ively in Chapter 8.2: Table 8.2.1) and also the later average age of onset of breast cancer and stomach cancer as the twentieth century unfolded (shown qualitatively in Chapter 6: Table 6 .4 to 6.7). Along a similar vein, the theory of the 'compressio n of morbidity', which envisages the reduction in the national illness burden by postpon ing the age of onset of chronic infirmity relative to the average life duration, such that th e period of morbidity is compressed between an increasing age of onset and a relatively fixed l ife expectancy also receives some agreement from the thesis 741 . Although this is better considered as a possible next stage, the thesis does show some evidence that this is possible (and perha ps still more viable than the pessimistic theories). This accordance is best highlighted by t he compliance of the thesis results with the 'dynamic equilibrium' theory, which can be consider ed as a first stage of the more exaggerated 'compression of morbidity'. Hence, the thesis has shown a postponement in the average age of onset but this has not been as large as the postponement in the average age of mortality. Therefore, the findings of the thesis provide addit ional support for the 'dynamic equilibrium' type hypothesis, which mark a stark contrast with t he pessimistic literature and also, but to a much lesser extent the overly optimistic theories ( 'compression of morbidity and especially the 'fourth stage' hypothesis, which is an even mor e optimistic theory, outlined in Chapter 2.1: Section 2.1.2.3). A final contribution of the thesis to contemporary debates and literature is the implications that the thesis' analysis and results have for the possi ble contribution of the NHS during the second half of the twentieth century. A consistent theme i n the qualitative analysis has been the inefficiency of the NHS, most notoriously confirmed by the social class inequality in mortality 741 Fries, \"The Compression of Morbidity: Near or Far\" , p. 208 Conclusion - 355 - and (although in a more ad hoc fashion) morbidity, and that in many instances this has worsened to the disadvantage of the poorer social c lasses during the second half of the twentieth century. Given that one of the objectives of the NHS was to reduce this gradient and provide universal health care to the British popula tion, this marks a serious shortcoming. This failure of the NHS is exacerbated by its under fund ing and comparative mediocrity compared to other developed economies. All of these problems contribute to creating an impression of an inefficient health service. When the output of the NHS is evaluated a very diff erent impression is generated. Current measures of national income or GDP only account for the inputs of the NHS, i.e. as a cost, and do not appraise any of the benefits, returns, or ou tputs of this spending. The quantitative analysis of the thesis and most precisely, the aggr egate QALE gain 'Adjusted Growth' considerations (made in Table 9.3, where GDP growth is summed with aggregate QALE growth or health output growth) provide an estimate of the returns on this spending. When the magnitude of these QALE gains or health benefits ar e considered relative to GDP and the cost of achieving these gains, it would suggest that the image of an unproductive healthcare system is far off the mark. It should be noted that not all QALE gains are attr ibutable to the NHS. A suitable approximate would be that fifty percent of the documented QALE gain is attributable to the NHS 742 . Moreover, until a detailed comparative study of hea lth services has been conducted, it is difficult to provide a substantiated appraisal of t he NHS. Nonetheless, the results of this thesis highlight a need to reconsider the healthcare system in an effort to quell the disquiet, which seems rather un founded if the value and contribution of healthcare spending identified in the thesis is con sidered. Furthermore, the thesis has provided much detail that indicates the major contribution o f technological medical improvements in the reduced mortality and particularly morbidity bu rden. For example, out of all the (EuroQol) variables considered in the thesis for their effect upon health related quality of life of sufferers, medical developments have provided the largest over all contribution to quality of life improvements. And for all the morbidity and mortali ty states considered in detail in the thesis, 742 Cutler et al, \"The Value of Medical Spending in th e United States, 1960-2000\", approximate 50 percent of health gains are due to medical spending. This provides a good estimate for which t o consider the contribution of the NHS Conclusion - 356 - the most significant health gains have tended to be during the second half of the twentieth century, after the introduction of the NHS (althoug h this is less consistent for tuberculosis and especially blindness). This reinforces the value of the NHS output and the possible need to reconsider the value of the NHS. In addition to the benefit of a more detailed histo rical account about twentieth century standards of living in England the contribution of the thesis is also important because of the initial developments it has made towards a more rou nded and accurate health measure, which provides results that have not necessarily been pre dicted and would have been unidentifiable without the thesis QALE gain methodology. Most note worthy is the point that: although the prevalence of certain disease groups has increase ( namely, chronic, degenerative diseases) and, as a result of the nature of these illnesses a nd advancements in medical technology, there are more unhealthy life years associated with these later twentieth century illnesses, the quality of life gains associated with these illnesses have often outweighed the increase in their prevalence. Hence, the findings of the thesis not o nly provide a mandate for including improvements in mortality (previous measures of hea lth) in some form of extended GDP measure, but they also illuminate an endorsement fo r including a morbidity index in conjunction with mortality. Therefore, the thesis has provided an important con tribution to knowledge regarding the history and value of health improvements. However, there are still numerous facets that could benefit from a more detailed and thorough analysis in order to provide an increasingly indicative estimate towards the actual value of imp roved health in twentieth century England. Many of these problems are generally insurmountable (and not just in the confines of the thesis), but still ought to be recognised. The most obvious features for improvement are the m ethodological variables (QALY, VSL and VSHLY) that were subject to detailed sensitivit y analyses. Although the thesis has highlighted that regardless of where in the range t he value is selected, the contributions have still been noteworthy, it would be ideal to identif y universally accepted values as this would lead to a more agreeable result about improved heal th. Conclusion - 357 - Although verging on the impossible, it would be ide al to consider a much greater number of illnesses in the same detail as has been conducted as a major component of the thesis. The amount of detail is necessary and desirable in orde r to yield the most potentially accurate (QALY) results. Failing this, and more realisticall y, it should be possible to proxy and manipulate the results identified here, in order to provide an estimate of the effect for all illnesses in the epidemiological environment during the twentieth century, which is more accurate than the findings presented in the thesis' Extended Results. Both of these objectives are highly desirable because they would enable a fu ll picture to be provided about morbidity. Additionally, it would be desirable to approximate the influence of co-morbidity for any set of QALE gain results. The thesis has provided a valuab le first attempt and most conservative estimate, but it would be ideal to have a much more varied and far-reaching pool of morbidity indices. Finally, in answering the two nucleus questions of the thesis: what has been the value of health improvements and what is the impact of these health improvements upon standards of living and economic development, the thesis has provided a valuable contribution to knowledge through the following key mechanisms. First, it has provided qualitative and quantitative historical detail. This detail has been utilised to provide a thorough and pragmatic indication about the contribution of improved health to standa rds of living and economic development in twentieth century England. Second, this has highlig hted how valuable and far-reaching health improvements have been and subsequently added weigh t to existing claims about the need to include health (output) in the national accounts. T hird, this thesis has added more optimistic and accurate detail to many of the debates associat ed with health. Fourth, the findings of the thesis add to the overall scholarship concerning th e contribution of reduced illness and increase longevity towards economic gains. This rei nforces the work of Nordhaus, Crafts and Hickson 743 . Lastly, the thesis also enhances these works, thr ough making the same considerations, but for morbidity as well as mortal ity. This has served to reinforce these claims and, if anything strengthens existing arguments abo ut the value of improved health and its far- reaching impact on standards of living and economic development. The findings of the thesis also add weight to claims about the need to conside r national income measures that account for health utility. 743 Nordhaus, \"The Health of Nations: The Contribution of Improved Health to Living Standards\".

The VSL represents the value of a statistical life, a term that is fundamental in the methodology for estimating the willingness to pay o r value of improved life expectancy. In order to estimate societies willingness to pay it i s necessary to establish the amount that a group of people would be willing to pay for a reduc tion in the current period probability of death. VSL studies estimate the value of fatal risk reduction in the expectation of saving one life (of an unidentified person) in the current period, and therefore estimate the VSL and societies willingness to pay for improved morta lity. For example, if people are on average willingness \u00a310 for a safety improvement th at will reduce their individual risk of death during the coming year by 1 in 100,000, this risk reduction would mean that on average, in group of 100,000 people there would be 1 fewer premature deaths. These 100,000 people would between them, be willing to pa y \u00a310 * 100,000 = \u00a31,000,000 for the prevention of 1 statistical fatality. Hence in this example the VSL is \u00a31,000,000. The main body of the thesis (Chapter 3) has highlig hted the mass of VSL studies and subsequent wide range of estimates of the value of death averted. The thesis has adopted one of the most plausible VSL results that was gene rated by Miller's detailed statistical analysis and endeavour to identify a best estimate VSL, based on applying this detailed statistical analysis to a range of most credible UK VSL studies. As well as providing a single VSL estimate the Mill er study has also generated associated VSL multiples: a VSL index number (101, 128 and 154 , representing a low, mid and high VSL multiple estimate) that is then multiplied with the corresponding GDP per capita value (which is GDP per capita for the mid-point of the period under consideration). This is the approach used here. After the VSL has been identified, which will be ac hieved in the thesis through applying the low, mid, and high VSL multiple, this multiple (101, 128, and 154) will multiplied with mid-point GDP per capita for the periods: 1900-1925 (1913 GDP per capita), 1925-1950 (1938 GDP per capita), 1950-1975 (1963 GDP per capi ta), 1975-2000 (1988 GDP per capita) and 1900-2000 (1950 GDP per capita). Once t his process has been conducted the (low, mid, and high) VSL will have been identified for the above eras that the thesis is considering. This VSL has two primary uses in the thesis methodo logy: i) to provide a valuation for the decline in mortality (i.e. the change in the mortal ity burden * VSL = the value of improved mortality or the mortality gain) and, ii) to provid e part of the VSHLY. The VSHLY provides the morbidity equivalent of the VSL, where the VSHLY values the improvement in the burden of illness or the morbidi ty burden. The VSHLY represents a more tenuous index than the VSL, as the thesis has approximated the VSHLY through combining the VSL and the QALY (VSL*QALY=VSHLY). Th e QALY was derived from the detailed analysis of the thesis and is illness and era specific. The results for the range of QALYs derived for the thesis illnesses and eras are outlined below in Appendix 12.6. The result for this VSHLY (as well as the VSL) is s hown below, where the range of low, mid and high VSHLY is considered for the thesis mor bidity states and eras. 12.1: VSL and VSHLY Values - 382 - Hence, Appendix 12.1.1 considers the mortality gain (the change in the mortality burden*VSL) that is yielded from different VSL (mul tiple and era) values. The VSL is derived by multiplying the VSL multiple (identified by Miller) with GDP per capita for the mid point of the period under consideration. The thesis utilises three VSL multiples: 128*mid po int GDP which is used as the central or 'Mid' estimate of the VSL. In the sensitivity analy sis the thesis considers a VSL multiple that is lower: 101*mid point GDP, which is referred to as 'Low' and a VSL multiple that is higher: 154*mid point GDP, which is referred to as 'High'. The VSHLY values have been derived through consider ing the VSL value in conjunction with the QALY in order to account for the health ad justment for the according illness and era. This has been conducted for the thesis disease s (Appendix 12.1.1) and disability (Appendix 12.1.2). The VSHLY will considere d with a 'Low' and 'High' VSL estimate, as well as 'Mid'. Sources GDP data 1900 and 1925: Maddison, \"Monitoring the World Econ omy Econom y: A Millennial Perspective\" Maddison presents these historical GDP estimates in 1990 international $ (and therefore the subsequent VSL in the thesis is represented in this currency). VSL The VSL (multiples) data comes from Miller, \"Variat ions between Countries in Values of Statistical Life\". QALY (for use in the VSHLY) The QALY data comes from the thesis, the underlying rational is presented in Part II and the summary results are presented in Chapter 7 and summarised at the beginning of Chapter 8.

It was necessary to estimate the prevalence of all thesis illnesses for the purpose of the thesis QALE methodology. This is because the burden of ill ness or the morbidity burden is a function of both how many life years were affected by illnes s (= prevalence) and also how severely these life years were affected by illness (= QALY). Hence the morbidity burden = prevalence * QALY. The prevalence of morbidity is approximated through estimating the number of people in the economy with the referenced diseases for any one ye ar. This is a measure that is not readily available in the data for any of the thesis morbidi ty states. Therefore it was necessary to estimate the prevalen ce of morbidity for the key eras considered by the thesis: 1900, 1925, 1950, 1975, and 2000. The d ata needed to make these morbidity prevalence approximations is: i) a survival rate an d, ii) the death rate. This data has been derived and in some case approximated (see below) from the illness specific information in Part II of the thesis. Due to unique idiosyncrasies and illness sp ecific limitations in the data, these calculations were achieved in a slightly different way for each illness in the thesis. Breast Cancer : Prevalence data only exists for the 1970s onwards and therefore it was necessary to estimate a prevalence figure for the period 1900 to 1970. This process: 1. Assumes 1945 1 year survival rate (1 YSR) for all y ears preceding 1945. 2. For years after and including 1945, the actual 1YSR for the according year has been used. The prevalence is calculated through utilising the 1 YSR to identify the percentage of breast cancer deaths (which is the inverse of survival). T he mortality data is then utilised to identify the number of deaths that the I YSR percentage of death s relates to. Once this has been achieved it is possible to calculate the number of survivors (thro ugh establishing the number of deaths that the inverse of the survival rate relates to it is possi ble to subsequently identify the number of survivors represented by the I YSR. Both of these n umbers are then summed (due to the inherent assumption that breast cancer mortality for any one year represents prevalence for that year [as an individual needed to first suffer from breast cance r to die of it] and likewise for those who survived from breast cancer. This was estimated for the age groups utilised in l ater sections of the thesis quantitative analysis (see Appendix 12.3), which was necessary to facilit ate a more detailed analysis and ultimate QALE gain result in the thesis, which is estimated by using age specific prevalence. Stomach Cancer : The prevalence for stomach cancer was calculated in exactly the same way as for breast cancer. The nature of cancer data is the same for all cancers, especially from the 1970s onward when the national cancer registry was implem ented, which is responsible for collating and compiling national cancer data in the UK. Tuberculosis : Prevalence data exists but only as an aggregate f or all ages. Because of the age specific analysis in the thesis it was necessary to identify the age specific prevalence of tuberculosis. This was estimated through identifyin g the age specific mortality data and combining this with the aggregate prevalence data i n order to identify a survival rate for each age group, which could then be applied to the mortality data (in a similar way as for breast and stomach cancer) in order to estimate the age specif ic prevalence of tuberculosis. Hence, this process: 12.2: Prevalence, QALY and Morbidity Burden: Diseas e 389 - 1. Identify the relationship between notification/prev alence and total deaths which provided an estimate for the survival rate. 2. This rate was then applied to the existing death da ta for each age group. 3. The 1900 approximate for tuberculosis is based on t he 1900 mortality data and the 1915 tuberculosis notification (as the 1900 data does no t exist in this format). When estimating the prevalence for all of the thesi s diseases an equal survival rate across all age groups has been assumed. It should be noted that th is is not likely to be the case in actuality but there is no alternative due to data limitations. I. e. aggregate prevalence did not exist for cancer before 1970 and for tuberculosis there is no offici al data about the age specific prevalence or survival rate. However, it is also important to not e that this data problem does not affect the aggregate results. It was also necessary to estimate a prevalence rate for the disability: blindness. This has been conducted through a different methodology (due to t he differences in the data and is explained in Chapter 8.2 and Appendix 12.13.1). Once the prevalence has been identified it is possi ble to combine this data with the QALY in order to estimate the morbidity burden. Hence, prev alence * QALY = morbidity burden. This is calculated here.

The change in the mortality and morbidity burden is identified for the age specific burden of mortality and morbidity, i.e. the mortality and morbidity burdens are considered relative to the size of the age group in the era that they r elate to. This provides a mortality or morbidity burden rate. The appeal of identifying an d utilising such an index is that the mortality or morbidity considerations are standardi sed to a population and are therefore more meaningful and accurate, which provides a more indicative measure of the change in the burden of mortality or morbidity. This rate wil l be reversed for the morbidity gain once the calculations have been completed, i.e. the fina l stage of the morbidity burden change calculation below, 'Actual Morbidity Gain', which c onverts the morbidity burden back into an actual number. This is desirable as it i) f acilitates a more detailed considerations of the change in the morbidity rate and, ii) converts the change in the morbidity burden into the same format as the other (disability and Chapte r 9) morbidity burden used in the thesis that lack the data which is necessary to make the t ype of morbidity rate calculations that are contained here. The first stage in identifying the change in the mo rtality or morbidity burden is to identify the rate of mortality or morbidity within the popul ation. This is achieved by dividing the mortality or morbidity burden by the number of popu lation for each age group. This provides an age specific mortality or morbidity bur den index. Presented here as the mortality or morbidity burden per 1000. After this has been achieved the mortality or morbi dity burden change will be compared across different eras (and the correspondingly diff erent populations and mortality / morbidity profiles and mortality / morbidity rates) . This is achieved through weighting the change in the burden of morbidity to either the sta rt [T1] or end point [T2] population between two eras, which is referred to as the weigh ted mortality / morbidity rate (WTD MR / WTD MBR). The calculation for the change in th e mortality and morbidity rate is conducted for a WTS MR or WTD MBR to T1 and T2: onc e this has been achieved the average of these two results represents the change in the mortality or morbidity burden. After this has been achieved the results for the mo rbidity gain are transformed into actual numbers, i.e. this is shown as 'morbidity burden ch ange' for morbidity. This is achieved by achieved through transforming the morbidity burden from an age rate back into the actual morbidity burden. The 'mortality burden change' con siders the mortality rate per million. This represents the mortality indices that are util ised in the main body of the thesis. These considerations are made for mortality and all diseases morbidity (tuberculosis, breast cancer and stomach cancer) in the thesis for all of the thesis eras: 1900-1925, 1925-1950, 1950-1975, 1975-2000, and 1900-2000. Because of the density of these calculations, they are provided on the attached CD Rom. See Appendix 1 3.1 for all of these calculations. The thesis will provide an indication of these calculat ions here: mortality, breast and stomach cancer and tuberculosis for the period 1900 to 2000 are presented below. The reason that 1900-2000 have been selected to provide an example of the methodology contained in Appendix 13.1 is because 1900-2000 is the most refe renced era throughout the thesis and especially in the case of breast cancer as this was used to represent a detailed worked example throughout Chapter 8.1. 12.3: Changes in Mortality and Morbidity Burden: Di sease - 394 - It is noteworthy that these calculations are not ma de for the thesis disability because the necessary data (prevalence by age) does not exist a nd it is not possible to generate an accurate estimated about the disability prevalence by age trend. Therefore, blindness will be considered in aggregate which is achieved below in Appendix 12.13.1.

The next stage in the thesis QALE methodology is to value the change in the mortality and morbidity burdens that have been identified in Appe ndix 12.3 (and in more detail in Appendix 13.1). This is achieved through identifyin g the average change in the morbidity burden (between the change weighted to T1 and T2) a nd then valuing this change. For the change in the mortality burden the VSL is used to v alue the change and estimate the mortality gain. The change in the burden of morbidi ty is valued by applying the VSHLY to the change, which yields the morbidity gain (the VS L and VSHLY values that are multiplied by the morbidity and mortality change ar e contained in Appendix 12.1). Hence: the mortality gain = change in the burden of mortality * VSL. In the case below, the precise calculation = (change in morbidity burd en 1 * VSL = mortality gain 1 and change in morbidity burden 2 * VSL = mortality gain 2) /barb2right (mortality gain 1 + mortality gain 2) / 2 = Average mortality gain. This process is the same for the morbidity gain (but using morbidity and the VSHLY instead of mortality and the VSL). This process is necessary because of the weighting of the change in the burden of morbidity to either the start [T1] or end point [T2 ] population. Mortality and morbidity change 1 represents the change in mortality and mor bidity fixed to T1 and the mortality and morbidity change 2 represents the result fixed to T2. Once these have both been applied to the VSL or VSHLY the corresponding morta lity / morbidity gain is derived. This is then average to provide a single estimate, which is the mid-point between the results for the two populations. The mortality and morbidity gains here utilised the mid VSL and VSHLY values.

The next stage in the thesis methodology is to comb ine the mortality gain and the morbidity gain in order to identify the QALE gain. This is achieved in two stages below. Stage one, which is the top series of data summaris es the results generated above, where the mortality and morbidity gains here are the same as those presented as the average mortality and morbidity gain above in Appendix 12.4 . The second stage provides the QALE gain, which is achieved by summing the mortali ty gain and the morbidity gain. This consideration is made for independent diseases belo w. Hence, it is possible to sum all diseases and mortality (which will be considered la ter in the Appendices) but for initial analysis purposes the mortality gain will be summed with each individual morbidity gain.

The QALY represents the index for the burden of mor bidity. This QALY provides a standardised index, across all thesis illnesses and all thesis eras. The series of QALYs used in the thesis have been constructed by the detailed qualitative analysis in Part II of the thesis. This was achieved through considering the t wentieth century health and welfare history of the thesis morbidity states and summaris ing this evolution on a standardised spectrum, which considers all illnesses and their l evel of development, namely, EuroQol. Once all thesis illnesses and eras had received a E uroQol rank (summarised in Chapter 7) these ranks were then converted into QALYs. Although the QALY values utilised in the thesis and presented below are unique to the thesis, the general concept of a quality adjusted l ife year is not new. Economists have designed a series of econometric scaling techniques in an attempt to assign a numerical value to health status. These are known as utility ratings, of which the most famous is the QALY. QALYs have become increasingly used in the es timation of cost-effectiveness of different forms of medical intervention. As well as making similar QALY considerations to th e existing literature, the thesis QALY is also subject to a variety of contentions associa ted with trying to identify the burden of morbidity and summarise this in the QALY. A pertin ent problem with the QALY is their potential to misrepresent consumer preferences. Man y have highlighted that QALYs fail to accurately represent an individuals' preferences, a nd the high potential for bias due to the problems of framing effects influencing the results . Although these problems cannot be avoided, they will be recognised and accommodated b y the methods of the thesis. The QALY in this thesis is based upon a comprehensi ve analysis of the changing health and welfare conditions faced by illness sufferers a s the twentieth century unfolded. Moreover, due to the subjective and often controver sial nature of illness and welfare measurement, the estimates of the burden of disease in the thesis are presented as a range of possible values, these are shown below. The key advantages of this approach are that is rec ognises and therefore to an extent overcomes many of the contentions associates with t rying to determine QALY weights. Furthermore, because the results will be presented in a range (shown below for each illness and era considered in the thesis) they will provide a broader consideration about the contributions of improved health. Finally, the anal ysis that forms the basis of the QALY weights represents a significant proportion of the volume of the thesis, and therefore will be available for the reader to identify the evidenc e from which the conclusions (QALYs) have been drawn. Hence, the QALYs presented below, for the illnesses (blindness, breast and stomach cancer and tuberculosis) and eras (1900, 1925, 1950 , 1975, and 2000) considered in the thesis have been derived through a detailed qualita tive account of the twentieth century health and welfare associated quality of life faced by sufferers of the illness in question. Furthermore, the thesis has created a foundational standardised measurement spectrum (EuroQol), which has generated a consistent account of the effects of the thesis morbidity states upon quality of life at different historical points during the twentieth century. After EuroQol was utilised to summarise all states of the sis morbidity for all eras considered in the thesis, these EuroQol ranks were converted into a QALY indices, which will represent 12.6: Alternative QALY Weights - 409 - the changing (diminishing) burden of different illn esses upon quality of life. This will essentially provide the morbidity measure component of the thesis. The results of this process, the QALY indices, are shown below. These a re represented by 'Mid'. The other QALY values shown below, 'Low' and 'High' represent the provision of a range of QALY estimate, the appeal of which has been outlined abo ve. This QALY has two primary uses in the thesis method ology: i) to provide a morbidity burden index (which is combined with the prevalence in order to estimate the morbidity burden) and, ii) to provide part of the VSHLY, whic h is used to value the change in the morbidity burden and estimate the morbidity gain (V SHLY = VSL * QALY) and (morbidity burden change * VSHLY = morbidity gain). In the tables below the QALYs are presented in two formats: i) as a QALY for the years or periods the thesis has identified the quality of li fe through EuroQol (1900, 1925, 1950, 1975, and 2000) and, ii) as a QALY for the eras tha t the thesis applied the QALE methodology (1900-1925, 1925-1950, 1950-1975, 1975- 2000, and 1900-2000). The detailed analysis in the main body of the thesis th at has generated EuroQol ranks and subsequent QALY weights has conducted this for spec ific years. The QALE methodology used throughout Chapter 8 and 9 considers periods. These QALY values are converted into era estimates through identifying the mid value of the QALY between the start and end point of the era under consideration. This is shown below. Appendix 12.6.1 presents the range of QALY weights for the thesis diseases: breast cancer, stomach cancer, tuberculosis. Appendix 12.6.2 prese nts the range of QALY weights for the thesis disability: blindness. Sources: QALY The QALY data comes from the thesis, the underlying rational is presented in Part II and the summary results are presented in Chapter 7 and summarised at the beginning of Chapter 8. This data is also summarised in Appendix 12.6. 12.6.1: Alternative QALY Weights: 410 12.6.1: QALY Weights: Disease Breast Cancer Low QALY Stomach Cancer - - QALY Weights Stomach Cancer Low QALY Period QALY Value QALY Value QALY Weights for Alternative VSL and VS HLY and QALY Weights - 414 - 12.7: Value of QALE Gain for Alternative VSL and VS HLY and QALY Weights This Appendix relates to Tables 8.1.9 and 8.1.10 in the main thesis. This appendix combines the analysis of the previous Appendices in order to provide a range of QALE gain estimates. Appendix 12.1 conside red the range (low, mid, high) of VSL and VSHLY values and Appendix 12.6 considered t he range (low, mid, high) of QALY values for all of the thesis illnesses (diseas es and disability) and eras. The analysis below will repeat the QALE gain calculation (shown in Appendix 12.4 and 12.5) but for all ranges and subsequent combinations of QALY, VSL and VSHLY weight, for all illnesses and eras. Hence, the methodological process here is essential ly the same as Appendix 12.5, but it applies the series (Low, Mid or actual, High) of va riable weights in order to consider the full array of sensitivity analysis QALE gain result s, instead of only considering the 'Mid' QALY, VSL and VSHLY estimates, which is the case in Appendix 12.5. These results represent the foundation of the thesi s sensitivity analysis. The desire of making this series of considerations is to provide the reader with the broadest (within the bounds of the thesis analysis) range of results fro m an exaggeratedly large margin of error. Hence, one of the ways in which the thesis aims to overcome issues of bias and variable selection is to provide the reader with the broades t possible range of estimates. This allows the reader to identify a QALE gain with an alternat ive (lower or higher) variable value, for the QALY, VSL, VSHLY, or all of these variables, in whichever combination (lower or higher or mid) the reader prefers. The starting point of the QALE methodological varia bles has been outlined in detail in the main body of the thesis: the VSL and VSHLY were con sidered in Chapter 3 and the QALY is substantiated by the qualitative analysis i n Part II of the thesis, which is summarised in Chapter7. For the reader who is still unsure of what they believe to be the most accurate weight, these sections should be reco nsidered. Hence, instead of only providing one estimate of th e QALE gain for each illness and era, this analysis enables the thesis to provide twenty seven different estimates for each illness and era. Additionally, this section also considers alternati ve VSL values that are selected from sources not within the thesis. Appendix 12.7.3 cons iders the VSL and VSHLY and subsequent QALE gain that is generated by utilising the VSL suggested by Costa and Viscusi. Costa suggests that the VSL over time has an income elasticity of 1.6, which basically means that as income rises, the value of life is increasing at 0.6 times the rate (1) of the income rise. An alternative view is that rep resented by Viscusi who contends that over time the VSL is income inelastic, such that th e VSL is only increasing 0.6 times as much as income over time. A final appeal of this exercise is to highlight tha t whichever weights for the QALY, VSL, and VSHLY are preferred by the reader, the overall QALE gain is still significant and still contributes to the same overall conclusions of the thesis. The full veracity of this claim is highlighted best in Appendix 13.2, which provides t he full range of twenty seven estimates for each of the four morbidity states and five eras considered in the thesis. Because of the density of this analysis the majority of the result s are contained in the CD-Rom Appendices. This Appendix will present the most ext reme and mid point estimates, i.e. the 12.7: Value of QALE Gain for Alternative VSL and VS HLY and QALY Weights - 415 - QALE gain results using a low, mid, and high QALY, VSL and VSHLY. For all other variable weight combinations, see Appendix 13.2. Ap pendix 12.7 will also contain the alternative QALE gain for the Viscusi and Costa wei ghts.

Chapter 3 of the thesis has highlighted that there is evidence about the VSL not being constant across all age groups. I.e. the value of s aving one life year of an unidentified person varies with the age of the person. Therefore a more valuable approach for estimating society's willingness to pay would be to include a methodology that considers the potential for different ages to have varying VS L values. There are disputes in the literature about the stan dpoint from which age weighting should be conducted. Some theorist have called for equity to be the key function in age weighting: where age weights reflect the feeling that everyone is entitled to some normal span of life and anyone failing to achieve this has been cheated , while anyone living longer is getting more than their fair share. In this type of theory, younger ages receive a higher age weight. At the other end of the spectrum, some theorist cla im weights should be related to the value of human capital or income. The main body of the thesis has emphasised an alter native and more commonly utilised method of age weighting, which considers the relati onship between age and efficiency, through reflecting an individuals social role, wher e: the population is supported by others during infancy and old age but support others durin g adulthood and therefore greater importance needs to be attached to these years. Thi s form of age weighting is best represented by Murray. This is the age weighting ap proach that is used in the thesis. Murray's age weight function also provides a desira ble mid-point between age-weighting theories. Murray's age weighting function is not flawless but it does still represent the most attractive model for the purposes of the thesis. Th e main flaws of Murray's model is the static nature of the age weights for the thesis whi ch considers a historical period of one hundred years, which almost certainly would have ex perienced some movement in the most valuable ages. Murray's age weights can be applied to the mortalit y and the morbidity (except blindness were the data is not age specific) QALE gain calcul ations in the thesis. This is achieved through adjusting the VSL for Murray's age weight. For example, for mortality in 1900- 1925 using a Low VSL, when there is no age weightin g the VSL = 0.64 for all age groups (shown in Appendix 12.1.1) when there is an age wei ght the VSL = 0.64 * 0.3 (age weight for 0-4 age group) = 0.192 (shown in the first row of Appendix 12.8). These age weighting considerations are made for all the previous QALE gain sensitivity analysis calculations. Appendix 12.8 considers the low, mid, high VSL mortality gain calculations and Appendix 12.9 considers the low, m id, high VSL, VSHLY, QALY morbidity gain calculations. Because of the density of these calculations, the bulk of the age weighted QALE gain calculations and results are provided in Appendix 13.3 (age weighted mortality) and 13.4 (age weighted morbidit y). The mid VSL estimates will be shown for the age weighted mortality gain below. In Appendix 12.9 the mid VSL, QALY and subsequent VSHLY will be shown.

After the mortality gain and morbidity gain have be en applied to Murray's age weighting function (as has been achieved in Appendix 12.8 and 12.9) they can be combined in order to identify the age-weighted QALE gain. This is ach ieved here. The analysis below will repeat the QALE gain calcul ation for all ranges and subsequent combinations of QALY, VSL and VSHLY weight (shown i n Appendix 12.7), for all illnesses and eras, applied to Murray's age weighti ng function.

This is necessary to address one of the main questions o f the thesis, about the value of improved QALE and what this contributes to twentieth century welfare economic development. Hence, the main body of the thesis has consistently emphasised the need to consider more comprehensive or utility inclusive measures of nati onal income. This exercise is conducted in the following Appendix (12.12). However, in orde r to illuminate the veracity of this thesis claim it is desirable to compare GDP growth and GDP+QALE gain growth. GDP growth is calculated here (and QALE gain growth is calculated in Appendix 12.12). The compound average growth rates of GDP pc (which is the average rate of annual growth within a defined period) was calculated usin g the natural exponential function S = Pe rt , for all five eras considered in 1925-1950, 1950-1975, the Maddison, \"The World Economy: Perspect ive\" Compound average growth rate methodology Dowling, \"Mathematical Methods for Business and Eco nomics\" 12.11: GDP per capita Compound Average Growth Rates - 439 - GDP per capita Compound Average Rate of Growth per annum Period GDPpc at Start (t1) GDPpc at End (t2) of QALE Gain relative to GDP per capit a Growth - 440 - 12.12: Value of QALE Gain relative to GDP per capit a Growth This Appendix relates to Tables 8.1.15, 8.2.8, and 9.3 in the main thesis. The main body of the thesis has consistently emphas ised the need to value and standardise health improvements in twentieth century England. A s a result of this objective the QALE gain methodology was developed in such a way that t he QALE gain results generated by this methodology could be compared to the national income measures. Following on from this, another consistent objective of the thesis ha s been to provide a more thorough and accurate account of economic developments from a st andards of living or welfare economics perspective, i.e. a Fisharian measure of economic development, which essentially represents a more rounded utility natio nal income. Hence, the thesis will ultimately generate an alternative estimate for nat ional income growth that includes the value of the QALE gain. This extended GDP or utility national income is est imated by calculating the compound average rate of GDP per capita growth and the compo und average rate of QALE gain growth. These are then summed to provide 'Adjusted Growth', which represents utility national income or Fisharian growth, or extended GD P growth. In addition the mortality and morbidity gain growth are also considered here (as this provides the foundation level and a more detailed i ndication of the QALE gain growth construction). Finally, another layer of detail is that these considerations are made for the un-weighted and age-weighted QALE gain results show n above in Appendix 12.7 and 12.9, respectively. Appendix 12.12 provides the mortality gain and morb idity gains. Appendix 12.12.1 presents the QALE gain growth for the thesis diseas es and Appendix 12.12.2 makes the same consideration but for the thesis disability. B ecause of the density of the calculations in Appendix 12.12.1 and 12.12.2, the bulk of these results will be presented in Appendix 13.6.1 and 13.6.2 in the CD-Rom Appendices. The mos t extreme (low and high) and mid calculations for the un-weighted and age-weighted c alculations will be shown here and the complete set of calculations are contained in the C D-Rom appendices.

450 - 12.13.1: Years in Blindness In order to highlight the trends of an increased a ge at onset of blindness and the subsequent fewer years of blindness it is necessary to estimat e the average number of years spent in blindness at different times during the twentieth c entury (namely, 1900, 1925, 1950, 1975 and 2000). This is exceptionally difficult to estimate as a r esult of the following: o The ideal method of estimating the average number of years spent in blindness would be to consider the most common age of onset of blin dness in conjunction with average life expectancy (at the average age of onset) for e ach period during the twentieth century. This is not possible for the following rea sons: 1. The main problem is related to the data for blin dness, whereby the data for the prevalence of blindness is only provided in 5 to 10 year blocks, so it is impossible to determine the exact age within a bloc k. For example, in 1901 the greatest numbers of blind persons were aged between 65 and 74. 2. This problem is exacerbated by the nature of lif e expectancy data, whereby life expectancy is only an average. This problem is evid ent throughout the twentieth century. The calculations will overcome this proble m as far as possible through using age specific life expectancy, for the average age of onset of blindness. o Therefore, the combination of these problems means that it is only possible to provide an indication of the likely number of years spent i n blindness at different times during the twentieth century. This will be achieved below. Along a more positive vein, this exercise still vi vidly highlights the improved trend in the age of onset of blindness (as it is possible to illustrate the increase in the average age of blindness and therefore the decline in the number of years sp ent in this less than optimal state). The average age of onset of blindness and the subs equent average number of years spent in blindness will be estimates through graphically ide ntifying the most common ages of blindness for the eras considered by the thesis (1900, 1925, 1950, 1975 and 2000). This will often contain three reference points, where blindness was most common. Once the most common ages of blindness have been i dentified this information will be considered in conjunction with life expectancy in o rder to identify the number of average years spent in blindness. After the profile of estimates about the average n umber if years in blindness has been constructed, consideration will be made about doubl e counting and cohort effects. 12.13.1: Years in Blindness - 451 - 1900 Prevalence of Blindness at Different Ages - 1900 0246810 12 14 16 18 total blind Age The graph above illustrates the percentage of blin d in each age group in 1901. Between the ages of 35 and approximately 77 were the most cases of blindness. Hence, the most common age of onset of blindness is somewhere between thes e two ages. This implies that during this time, there were two trends for the prevalence of blindness. 1. The onset of blindness during middle age, where an indi vidual would be blind for 23 years (using 45 as age of onset of blindness and life expectancy [LE 45 ] in 1900 of 23). 2. The second trend was the onset of blindness very late in life, at an age greater than life expectancy, which implies that very few years were spent in blindness on average. This is particularly apparent in the graph above as there is a decline in blindness after age 65 and a substantial decline above the age of 8 5. This is not likely to be due to improvements in the prevalence, but instead as a re sult of there being much fewer people at these ages as a result of a relatively lo w age of life expectancy. The onset of blindness here is averaged at 71 years of age, w here an individual would be blind for 8 years (using 71 as age of onset of blin dness and life expectancy [LE 71 ] in 1900 of 9). 1900: Row 2: most common ages of onset of blindness and s ubsequent average number of blind years per registered blind person Row 3: Percent of blind represented in above age gr oup Row 4: Number of blind and subsequent total number of blind years for most common ages of onset of blindness (total number of blind years [29 9747] = {number of blind 1 [10069] * average years of blindness 1 [23] = average years of blindn ess 1 [231587]} + {number of blind 2 [8520] * average years of blindness 2 [8] = average years of blindness 2 [68160]}) Average most common age of blindness 1 (Age) Average most common age of blindness 2 (Age) LE x Life Expectancy at age of onset of blindness (Years) 1 2 Average years of blindness 1 (Years) Average years of blindness 2 (Years) Total number of blind years for most common ages of onset 35-55 /barb2right 45 65-77 /barb2right 71 23 8 23 8 Percent of blind 39 33 Number of blind 10069 8520 231587 68160 299747 Age Percentage of total blind 12.13.1: Years in Blindness - 452 - 1925 Prevalence of Blindness at Different Ages - 1925 0510 15 60-70 70 Percentage of total blind Age In 1925 the incidence of blindness above age 16 wa s a direct function of age; as age increased so did the prevalence of blindness. This means that there was an increasing number of old aged blind and a proportionate decrease in the numb er of younger blind. However as a result of increased life expectancy i t was still possible that a blind persons spent many years in this state. 1. If this onset of blindness occurred at about age 50. The onset of blindness here is averaged at 55 years of age, where an individual wo uld be blind for 19 years (using 55 as age of onset of blindness and life exp ectancy [LE 55 ] in 1925 of 19). 2. However many more of the blind were increasingly likely to obtain this disability towards the end of their life and therefore spend a much smaller fraction of time with this burden. For example, the most common ages for contracting blindness were those aged 70 and older. The onset of blindness here is estimated to be 70 years of age, where an individual would be blind for 9 years (usi ng 70 as age of onset of blindness and life expectancy [LE 70] in 1925 of 9). 1925: Row 2: most common ages of onset of blindness and s ubsequent average number of blind years per registered blind person Row 3: Percent of blind represented in above age gr oup Row 4: Number of blind and subsequent total number of blind years for most common ages of onset of blindness (total number of blind years [37 1244] = {number of blind 1 [10956] * average years of blindness 1 [19] = average years of blindn ess 1 [208164]} + {number of blind 2 [18120] * average years of blindness 2 [9] = average years of blindness 2 [163080]}) Average most common age of blindness 1 (Age) Average most common age of blindness 2 (Age) LE x Life Expectancy at age of onset of blindness (Years) 1 2 Average years of blindness 1 (Years) Average years of blindness 2 (Years) Total number of blind years for most common ages of onset 50 70 19 9 19 9 Percent of blind 26 43 Number of blind 10956 18120 208164 68160 371244 Percentage of total blind Age 12.13.1: Years in Blindness - 453 - 1950 Prevalence of Blindness at Different Ages - 1950 0510 15 of Total Blind This is a very unusual and unexpected pattern. Thi s unexpected increase was a result of a condition known as Retrolental Fibroplasia and was caused through problems with the administration of oxygen to premature babies, which caused blindness. There are three trends of interest here, although only 1 of them seems to be in alignment with the situation during the rest of the twentieth century (increase in the old aged blind). 1. There is a comparatively high number of blind fr om birth or very young childhood in 1950. About 12 percent of the 1950 blind cohort spe nt virtually their entire life in blindness. The onset of blindness here is at birth: subsequent ly an individual would be blind for 68 years (using 0 as age of onse t of blindness and life expectancy [LE 0] in 1950 of 68). 2. A slightly more common trend was the onset of bl indness during middle age. From the ages of 40 to 60 there were a sizeable number o f individuals contracting blindness. These individuals represent about 24 per cent of the blind population in 1950. The onset of blindness here is averaged at 50 years of age, where an individual would be blind for 24 years (using 50 as age of onset of blindness and life expectancy [LE 50 ] in 1950 of 24). 3. Finally, there was an evident trend of very old aged blind. There were about 22 percent of the blind contracting this impairment af ter age 70. The onset of blindness here is estimated at 70 years of age, whe re an individual would be blind for 10 years (using 70 as age of onset of bli ndness and life expectancy [LE 70 ] in 1950 of 10). 12.13.1: Years in Blindness - 454 - 1950: Row 2: most common ages of onset of blindness and s ubsequent average number of blind years per registered blind person Row 3: Percent of blind represented in above age gr oup Row 4: Number of blind and subsequent total number of blind years for most common ages of onset of blindness (total number of blind years [13 66204] = {number of blind 1 [10572] * average years of blindness 1 [68] = average years of blindn ess 1 [718896]} + {number of blind 2 [19517] * average years of blindness 2 [24] = average years o f blindness 2 [468408]} + {number of blind 3 [17890] * average years of blindness 3 [10] = avera ge years of blindness 3 [178900]}) Average most common age of blindness 1 (Age) Average most common age of blindness 2 (Age) Average most common age of blindness 3 (Age) LE x Life Expectancy at age of onset of blindness (Years) 1 2 3 Average years of blindness 1 (Years) Average years of blindness 2 (Years) Average years of blindness 3 (Years) Total number of blind years for most common ages of onset 0 /barb2right 0 40-60 /barb2right 50 70 /barb2right 70 68 24 10 68 24 10 Percent of blind 13 24 22 Number Years in Blindness - 455 - 1975 Prevalence of Blindness at Different Ages - 1975 010 20 30 40 50 60 0-4 5-15 16-64 65-74 75+ Age Percentage of Total Blind In 1975 there were two main ages of blind onset. 1. There were a considerable number (which represen ts about 25 percent of the blind population in 1975) of blind persons at working age , somewhere between 16 and 64. Due to the format of the data for this period it is not possible to stipulate whether the onset of blindness was at the beginning or end of t his age group, although from what is available (18-49=10% and 50-64 = 8%) it seems best to adopt a conservative estimate for the average age (during working age) of onset o f blindness, for example 50 years old. Hence, the onset of blindness here is estimated at 50 year s of age, where an individual would be blind for 26 years (using 50 as age of onset of blindness and life expectancy [LE 50 ] in 1975 of 26). 2. The second trend which is very noteworthy, in re lation to all the previous years, is the substantial increase in the number of blind aged 75 and older. Approximately 54 percent of the blind population contracted this imp airment in the last few years of life. The onset of blindness here is estimated at 75 year s of age, where an individual would be blind for 9 years (using 75 as age of onse t of blindness and life expectancy [LE 75 ] in 1975 of 9). 1975: Row 2: most common ages of onset of blindness and s ubsequent average number of blind years per registered blind person Row 3: Percent of blind represented in above age gr oup Row 4: Number of blind and subsequent total number of blind years for most common ages of onset of blindness (total number of blind years [11 31447] = {number of blind 1 [24900] * average years of blindness 1 [26] = average years of blindn ess 1 [647400} + {number of blind 2 [53783] * average years of blindness 2 [9] = average years of blindness 2 [484047]}) Average most common age of blindness 1 (Age) Average most common age of blindness 2 (Age) LE x Life Expectancy at age of onset of blindness (Years) 1 2 Average years of blindness 1 (Years) Average years of blindness 2 (Years) Total number of blind years for most common ages of onset 50 75+ 26 9 26 9 Percent of blind 25 54 Number of blind 24900 53783 647400 484047 1131447 12.13.1: Years in Blindness - 456 - 2000 Prevalence of Blindness at Different Ages - 2000 010 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 0-4 5-17 18-49 50-64 65-74 75+ Age Percentage of Total Blind The graph above highlights what would appear to be a considerable improvement in the conditions surrounding blindness. This is result of a massive increase in the average age of onset of blindness. 1. There is only one situation above, and this repr esents 69 percent of the blind population who were aged 75 and older in 2000. This means that the vast majority of the blind population were only in this less than op timal state for the last years of life. Hence by 2000 there has been an important reduction in the disabling and adverse effects of blindness, as it is now an old age disab ility rather than a burden that could strike at any age during the most productive years of life. The onset of blindness here is estimated at 75 years of age, where an indi vidual would be blind for 11 years (using 75 as age of onset of blindness and li fe expectancy [LE 75 ] in 2000 of 11). 2000: Row 2: most common ages of onset of blindness and s ubsequent average number of blind years per registered blind person Row 3: Percent of blind represented in above age gr oup Row 4: Number of blind and subsequent total number of blind years for most common ages of onset of blindness (total number of blind years [11 97856] = {number of blind 1 [108896] * average years of blindness 1 [11] = average years of blindn ess 1 [1197856]}) Average most common age of blindness 1 (Age) LE x Life Expectancy at age of onset of blindness (Years) Average years of blindness 1 (Years) Total number of blind years for most common ages of onset 75+ /barb2right 75 11 11 Percent of blind 69 Number of blind 108896 1197856 1197856 12.13.1: Years in Blindness - 457 - The above situations and the distribution and aver age years of blindness for 1900, 1925, 1950, 1975 a nd 2000 are summarised in the tables below: summary table for estimates of the average n umber of years spent in blindness during the twenti eth century and the percentage and number of blind this represented.

As a result, by 2000 the most common age of onset of blindness (by a significant majorit y 69 percent) was older than 75. When an individual contracts blindness at this age they are only burdened with it for a few years. This has meant th ere has actually been a reduction in the average nu mber of blind years. 12.13.3: Blind Income Details - 459 - 12.13.2: Cohort Effect Calculations There was a substantial increase in the average ag e of blindness during the twentieth century. It is crucial to determine whether this is a genui ne effect or a result of the ageing of many blind. I.e. the increase in the 75+ population with blindn ess in 2000 could be a result of the 1975, 50+ age group getting older. This will be achieved through the following proces s: 1. Identifying the age group where blindness was mo st prevalent in time T. 2. Determining the age group that this would have b een in the previous (-25 years) time period = T-1. 3. Identifying the number of blind people in the mo st common age group in time T. 4. Identifying the number of blind people in the mo st common age group in time T-1. 5. Calculating what percentage of the number in T-1 as a percentage of T to identify the proportion of the blind in T that had also been in T-1. E.g. for T = 1925 where the most common age group was 16-64. Period T-1 = 1900 and T-1 population age would be -9 to 39, i.e. 0-39 (as in 25 years time this would be the 16-25 age group). The number of blind aged between 0 and 39 i n 1900 was 8676 and the number aged 16-64 in 1925 was 24723. Therefore 8676/24723*100 = 35.09 /barb2right 35 percent of the 1925 blind are carried over from 1900. Hence, the cohort effec t is 35 percent. These calculations have been done for all of the n ecessary years and are shown in the table below.

The calculations here represent variations of those tha t are presented throughout the thesis. The QALE gain methodology is consistent here but the da ta that is used differs from that which has been presented above. This is because Chapter 9 (and this corresponding appendix) considers the entire burden of morbidity through ex trapolating forward the findings about the thesis disease and disability morbidity (contai ned in the previous appendices). 12.14.1: Lowest Bound Estimates for Key Morbidity C ategories Appendix 12.14.1 presents the lowest morbidity gain estimates for the extended results illnesses. This utilises the methodology applied in Appendix 12.3 and 12.4. The values that have been utilised here are the Low VSL and VSHLY ( presented in Appendix 12.1) and the Low QALY (presented in Appendix 12.6). The infectious morbidity gain is equal to the lowes t tuberculosis morbidity gain (as a result of the conservative assumption of Chapter 9: that t uberculosis was the only infectious disease to experience a morbidity gain), shown in A ppendix 13.4. The disability morbidity gain is also equal to the lowest blind morbidity ga in in the thesis. This is equal to the blind morbidity gain shown in Appendix 12.7.2 (for an exp lanation see Table 9.1). The non-infectious morbidity gain is an additional calculation to the previous appendix. This applied the ('Low') stomach cancer VSHLY and Q ALY profile to the aggregate number of non-infectious deaths in twentieth centur y England. This is because of the conservative assumptions in Chapter 9 (see Table 9. 1 for details).

Hence, this s ection provides the detailed outline of the quantitative willingness to pay: mortality and morb idity methodology. This methodology was outlined in Chapter 3 and applied in Chapters 8 and 9 of the thesis. 12.16.1 Contains the methodological algebra for imp rovements in the death rate, or mortality. 12.16.2 Contains the methodological algebra for con sidering improvements in the quality of life of additional years of life expectancy. 12.16.3 Contains the methodological algebra for the combination of improved mortality and the improved morbidity associated with these additional life years. Sources: Mortality gain algebra is derived from: Nordhaus, \"The Health of Nations: The Contribution of Improved Health to Living Standards\" Morbidity gain algebra is derived from: Cutler Algebra: Mortality This approach had been refined by Nordhaus to provi de a method of measuring the gain in real income from improved life expectancy, in the contex t of the life-cycle model of consumption. This approach represents part of the Hickson QALE method ology. An individual is assumed to value consumption and h ealth according to a lifetime utility function: ( ) [ ; , , ] ( ) [ ] t t t t t V c u c e S dt \u00b5 \u00b5 = (1) Where [ ; , , ] t t V c \u00b5 is the value at time t of the consumption stream, now and in the future, faced be an individual of age ; ( ) tcis the stream of instantaneous utility or felicity consumption; is the pure rate of individual time preference; [ ] tS\u00b5is the set of survival probabilities; and t\u00b5is the set of mortality rates. The key assumption here is that ut ility is a function of the expected value of consumption weighted by the probability of survival . It is also assumed that the survival function is exponential, and therefore equation (1) becomes: ( )( ) [ ; , , ] ( ) t t t t V c u c e dt \u00b5 \u00b5 + = (2) This equation can be further simplified by assuming that the real interest rate faced by the individua l is equal to the mortality adjusted rate of time pre ference ( ) \u00b5 +. Given these assumptions, an individual will choose a consumption annuity that y ields constant consumption during the individual's lifetime, tc= *c. Integrating equation (2) yields a simpler outcome : ( *) [ ; , , ] ( ) t t u c V c \u00b5 \u00b5 =+ (3) Equation (3) shows that the total utility value of consumption, discounted by a discount rate that equals the sum of the force of impatience and the f orce of mortality. 12.16.1: Methodological Algebra: Mortality - 478 - An individual will often face a trade-off between h ealth and wealth. At age , changes in consumption and health yield: '( *) * ( ) dV u \u00b5 =+ Hence, between consumption and mortal ity is: * ( *) [ '( *)( )] dc u c d u c \u00b5 \u00b5 =+ (5) It is then possible to further simplify through mak ing two normalisations. First, utility is defined s o that one unit of utility is one extra unit of the c onsumption good, by setting '( *) u c = 1. Second, the pure rate of time preference is set equal to zero, such that when the utility of consumption is ( ) u c = 0, the individual is indifferent between life and d eath. This implies that there is zero utility after death. Given these assumptions, equation (5) can be reduced to: * ( *) ( ) dc u c d\u00b5 \u00b5 =+ (6) Or without discounting: *( *) dc Tu c d\u00b5= (7) Where, T is life expectancy (T=1/ \u00b5). The interpretation here is that a uniform change in mortality rates at every age will produce a welfare change eq ual to the number of years of life (T) times the goods value of life, given by u(c*). 12.16.2: Methodological Algebra: Morbidity - 479 - 12.16.2: Methodological Algebra: Morbidity In this methodology health capital is defined as: 0[ ] (1 ) t t k k kE H Lr + =+ (8) Where tHrepresents a person's quality of life in any year ( scaled on a 0 to 1 basis, where 0 = death and 1 = perfect health) or the QALY. L represents t he value of a year in perfect health and r is the real discount rate and k is the number of years of life. After identifying health capital the next stage in the methodology is to consider the quality of life. The starting point for this (more difficult) measur ement is the probability that a person is alive or dead in each year of the future. This can be achiev ed through considering life expectancy and life tables. These survival rates then need to be adjust ed for the prevalence of disease. Quality of life weights also need to be attached to every condition considered in the methodology and for the variance of the QALY over time. Hence, combining es timates of the share of the population who are still alive, at t+k , the prevalence of people with particular conditio ns, where d is the range of conditions a person could have, and the quality of life for people with those conditions, quality of l ife can be estimated as: Pr[ t k H+=alive at t+k ] * ( Pr d=[condition d at t+k ] * [QALY ]) QALE The two above methodologies consider measuring the value of mortality and morbidity, the thesis QALE methodology considers the value of mortality a nd morbidity in a single methodology that combined the two above approaches to measuring life and health. The result of combining the two above approaches is a methodology that considers th e value of improvements in life expectancy whilst considering the quality and subsequent value of these additional years from a health (or QALY) perspective. This QALE (quality adjusted life expectancy) methodology is expressed as: * ( *) ( [ ]) dc u c QALE d\u00b5 \u00b5 = = + + + (10) Where, ( *) u c = the goods value of life and *c= consumption. \u00b5 represents the set of mortality rates and ( Pr d=Condition D at t + k] * [QALY for D at t + k]), whi ch is essentially the consideration for the health aspect of improved mortality rates, where d represents the range of possible health conditions. = the pure rate of individual time preference. Fina lly, it should be noted that, *dc d\u00b5 +> 0 because individuals are likely to forego some consu mption in return for improved healthy life years. 13. Appendix: CD-Rom - 481 - 13.
