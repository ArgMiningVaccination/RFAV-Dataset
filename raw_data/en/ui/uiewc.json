They are a central theorem in the growing field of energy medicine. The theorem states that you have seven chakras which start from the base of your spine and travel up to the top of your head. These seven energy points are considered more spiritual and invisible in nature. Interestingly, these unseen energy points in your body also require a moderate portion of food for sustenance. When the chakras in your body are balanced and open, they operate at their fullest, drawing in fresh energy from the unified field to nourish and replenish your energy field.

The NeuroEndoMetabolic (NEM) Stress Response is your body's natural shield against stress. During stressful conditions, the NEM stress response signals your adrenal glands for secreting anti-stress hormone cortisol. However, repeated stress overburdens your adrenals decreasing cortisol secretion level which reduces your body's ability to deal with stress. This leaves you feeling fatigued. [Working on your energy chakras](/blog/adrenal-fatigue-recovery-right-track/) can help accelerate your adrenal recovery process.
