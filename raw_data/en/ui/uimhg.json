She takes the time to really listen. I love that she is always thinking about how she can better treat me~ her knowledge base is amazing but she is always looking to grow. On more than one occasion I have shown up for an appointment and she tells me about the research or consultation she's done to see what she could be doing different to find the right balance in my treatment. I highly recommend giving Dawn a call. "}
