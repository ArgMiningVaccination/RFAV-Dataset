We made a conscious decision to go back to the basics with our products: natural, non-toxic ingredients that are integral to Ayurveda (based on over five thousand years of science that we really believe in). We want you to be able to focus on the most important things in your life and trust us to give you the most natural, simple and effective skincare products. Our promise is that we will always be honestand transparent. Our name Nalen () means lotus in sanskrit. The lotus flower has strong symbolism of purity inIndian culture and its flower blooms even in muddy and dirty water. Nalen Ayurveda products protect and nourish your skin to ensure it's always cherished no matter what the external environment, just like the lotus flower. INSPIRATION The colours on our products and packaging are based on the five elements of nature in Ayurveda. Space (akasha), Air (vayu), Fire (tejas), Water (jala), and Earth (prithvi). OUR FOUNDERS Valentina Santamaria and Namrata Sandhu are the founders of Nalen Ayurveda. They previously lived in London where they met and formed Nalen Ayurveda out of a mutual passion for helping people live a healthy, balanced and happy life. | | Valentina grew up in Caracas, Venezuela and has previously lived in the U.K. and currently lives in Barcelona.
