Foreword It has been known for several years that person s with serious mental illn ess die younger than the general population. However, rece nt evidence reveals that the rate of serious morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) in this population has accelerated. In fact, persons with serious mental illness (SMI) are now dying 25 years earlier than the general population. Their increased morbidity and mortality are largel y due to treatable medical conditions that are caused by modifiable risk factors such as smok ing, obesity, substance abuse, and inadequate access to medical care. This report reviews the causes of excess morbidity and mortalit y in this population and makes recommendations to improve their care. It presents a roadmap for strategic approaches to reduce excess illness and premature death among the persons served by State Mental Health Authorities. State Mental Health Authority (SMHA) stakeholders need to embrace two guiding principles: 1. Overall health is essential to mental health. 2. Recovery includes wellness . This is the thirteenth technical report devel oped by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) Medical Dire ctors Council. It is based on a relevant literature review, a series of work-group conference calls, and a two-day meeting of medical directors, commissioners, researchers, and other technical experts. This report provides the overarching context for two previous reports, Polypharmacy and Integrating Primary Care with Behavioral Health and our forthcoming report on Smoking Policies and Practices . We must all work together to fight this epidemic of premature deat h and its contributing causes. Joe Parks, MD Chair, Medical Directors Council II. Executive Summary A. Overview\u2014The Problem People with serious mental illn ess (SMI) die, on average, 25 years earlier than the general population. State studies documen t recent increases in death rates over those previously reported. This is a serious public health problem for th e people served by our state mental health systems. While suicide and injury account for about 30-40% of excess mortality, 60% of premature deaths in persons with schizophre nia are due to medical conditions such as cardiovascular, pulmonary and infectious diseases. People with serious mental illness also suffer from a high prevalence of m odifiable risk factors, in particular obesity and tobacco use. Compoun ding this problem, people with serious mental illness have poorer access to established monitori ng and treatment guidelines for physical health conditions. B. Increased Mortality and Morbidity are Largely Due to Preventable Conditions Among persons with SMI, the \"natural causes\" of death include: Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 5 Cardiovascular disease Diabetes (including related conditions such as kidney failure) Respiratory disease (incl uding pneumonia, influenza) Infectious disease (including HIV/AIDS) The rates of mortality from these diseases for the SMI population are several times those of the general population.

Schizophr Bull. 1999;15(1)81-89. There are a number of other factors that place people with SMI at higher risk of morbidity and mortalityi, including: Higher rates of modifiable risk factors \u0083 Smoking \u0083 Alcohol consumption \u0083 Poor nutrition / obesity \u0083 Lack of exercise \u0083 \"Unsafe\" sexual behavior \u0083 IV drug use \u0083 Residence in group care facilitie s and homeless shelters (exp osure to tuberculosis and other infectious diseases as well as less opportunity to m odify individual nutritional practices) Vulnerability due to higher rates of \u0083 Homelessness \u0083 Victimization / trauma \u0083 Unemployment \u0083 Poverty \u0083 Incarceration \u0083 Social isolation Impact of symptoms associated with SMI \u0083 Example: paranoid ideation causing fear of accessing care \u0083 Example: disorganized thinking causing difficulty in following medical recommendations Symptoms can mask symptoms of medical/somatic illnesses Psychotropic medications may mask symptoms of medical illness and contribute to symptoms of medical illness and cause metabolic syndrome Polypharmacy Lack of access to appropriate health care and lack of coordination between mental health and general health care providers C. The Impact of Medications Beginning with the introducti on of clozapine in 1991, and the subsequent introduction of five newer generation antipsychotics over the next decade or so, antipsychotic prescribing in the US has move d to the use of these second generation antipsychotics. This has occurred despite their significantly greater cost, larg ely due to a decrease in neurologic side effects a nd the perception that people using them may experience better outcomes, es pecially improvement in negative symptoms. However, with time and experience the second generation antipsychotic medications have become more highly associated with weight gain, diabetes, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome and the superiority of clinical response (except for clozapine) has been questioned. Other psychotropic medications that are associated with weight gain may also be of concern. Modifiable Risk Factors Affected by Psychotropics Overweight/ obesity Insulin resistance Diabetes/hyperglycemia Dyslipidemia D. Access to Health Care Drussii suggests that having SMI may be a risk factor and lead to problems in access to health care because of: Patient factors: Amotivation, f earfulness, social instability Provider factors: Competing demands, stigma System factors: Fragmentation He also provides us with examples from his re search and that of colleagues regarding Overuse, Underuse, and Misuse ( Three Types of Poor Quality , Chassin 1998) of services related to the population with SMI: Overuse: Persons with SMI have high use of somatic emergency services (S alisberry et al 2005, Hackman et al 2006) Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 6 Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 7 Underuse: Fewer routine preventiv e services (Druss 2002) Lower rates of cardiovascular procedures (Druss 2000) Worse diabetes care (Desai 2002, Frayne 2006) Misuse: During medical hospitalization, persons with Schizophrenia are about twic e as likely to have infections due to medical car e postoperative deep venous thrombosis and postoperative sepsis (Daumit 2006) E. What Should Be Done? - Re commendations and Solutions These proposed recommendations and solutions are or ganized at four levels of action: national; state; provider agencies and clinicians; and, persons served, families and their communities. We have identified several major actions necessary to address the issues desc ribed in this report. 1. Prioritization of the public health problem of morbidity and mortality and designation of the population with SMI as a priority health disparities population. 2. Tracking and monitoring of morbidity and mo rtality in populations served by our public mental health systems (surveillance). 3. Implementation of established standards of care for prevention, screening, assessment, and treatment. 4. Improved access and integration with physical health care services. National Level 1. Designate the Population with SM I as a Health Disparities Population a. Federal designation of people with SMI as a distinct at-risk heal th disparities population is a key first step, followed by development and adaptation of materials and methods for prevention in this population as well as inclusion in morbidity and mortality surveillance demographics. 2. Adopt Ongoing Su rveillance Methods a. Establish a committee at the federal level to recommend changes to national surveillance activities that will incorporate information about health status in the population with SMI. b. Engage at the national and state levels, per the IOM report, in developing the National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) to assure that EHR and PHR templates include the data elements needed to manage and coordinate gene ral health care and mental health care. 3. Support Education and Advocacy a. Share information widely about physical health risks in pers ons with SMI to encourage awareness and advocacy. Educate the health care community. Encourage persons served and family members to advocate for wellne ss approaches as part of recovery. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 8 b. Build on the development of SAMHSA evidence-based practices by creating a toolkit that is focused on health status and healthy lifestyles. c. Promote adoption of recommendations in th e NASMHPD Technical Reports on Polypharmacy and Smoking to implement policies and progr ams addressing these risk factors. State Level 1. Prioritize the Public Health Probl em of Morbidity And Mortality and Designate the Population with SMI as a Priority Health Disparities Population. a. Collect surveillance data on morbidity and mortality in the population with SMI. b. Apply a public health approach and population based interventions. 2. Improve Access to Physical Health Care a. Require, regulate, and lead the public behavior al health care system to ensure prevention, screening, and treatment of general health care issues. b. Build adequate capacity to serve the physica l health care needs of the SMI population. 3. Promote Coordinated and Integrated Mental Health and Physical Health Care for Persons with SMI a. Utilize the system transfo rmation recommendations from the New Freedom Commission, Institute of Medicine and SAMH SA to achieve a more person-centered mental health system. Specifically, implement the following selected recommendations, as identified in the IOM report, and modified to address the morbidity and mortality issues. Create high-level mechanisms to improve collaboration and coordination across agencies Promote integration of general heal thcare and mental health records Revise laws and other policies to su pport communication between providers b. Implement the recommendations found in the 11th NASMHPD Technical Paper: Integrating Behavioral Health and Primary Care Services. 4. Support Education and Advocacy a. Develop and implement toolkits and guidelines to help providers, self-help/peer support groups and families understand how to facilitate healthy choices while promoting personal responsibility. b. Establish training capacity. A k ey component of this plan will be training and technical assistance for the mental health work force on the importanc e of the issues. c. Involve academic and association partn ers in planning and conducting training. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 9 d. Address stigma / discrimination. 5. Address Funding a. Assure financing methods for service improvem ents. Include reimbursement for coordination activities, case management, transportation and other supports to ensure access to physical health care services. b. As a health care purchaser, Medicaid should: Provide coverage for health education and preven tion services (primary prevention) that will reduce or slow the impact of disease for people with SMI. Establish rates adequate to assure access to primary ca re by persons with SMI. Cover smoking cessation and weight reduction treatments. Use community case management to improve engagement with and access to preventive and primary care. 6. Develop a Quality Improvement (Q I) Process that Supports Increased Access to Physical Health care and Ensures Appropriate Prevention, Screening and Treatment Services. a. Establish a system goal for qual ity health care with the same priority as employment, housing or keeping people out of the criminal justice system. b. Join with the Medicaid and P ublic Health agencies at the state level to develop a quality improvement (QI) plan to support appropriate scr eening, treatment and access to health care for people being served by the public mental health system, whether Medicaid or uninsured. c. Assure that all initiatives to address morbidity and mortality have concrete goals, timeframes and specific steps. Gather performance measur ement data and use to manage overall system performance. d. Use regulatory, policy and other progra mming opportunities to promote personal responsibility for making health y choices by changing the locu s of control from external (program rules, regulations, staff) to the in dividuals we serve (se lf-control and management). e. Continue to promote adoption of recommenda tions in the NASMHPD Technical Reports on Polypharmacy and Smoking to implement policies and programs addressing these risk factors. Provider Agencies / Clinicians 1. Adopt as Policy that Mental Health and Physical Healthcare Should Be Integrated. 2. Help Individuals to Understand the Hopeful Messag e of Recovery, Enabling their Engagement as Equal Partners in Care and Treatment. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 10 3. Support Wellness and Empowerment of Persons Served, to Improve Mental and Physical Well-Being a. Support personal empowerment and individual re sponsibility, enabling i ndividuals to make healthy choices for recovery to promote their individual recovery efforts; this means engaging people with SMI in their he alth care in new ways. 4. Ensure the Provision of Quality, Evidence-Based Physical and Mental Health Care by Provider Agencies and Clinicians. a. Utilize the system transfo rmation recommendations from the New Freedom Commission, Institute of Medicine and SAMHSA to achieve a more person-centered mental health system. b. Implement standards of care for prevention, screen ing and treatment in the context of better access to health care. c. Improve comprehensive health care evaluations. d. Assure that all initiatives to address morbidity and mortality have concrete goals, timeframes and specific steps. Gather performance measur ement data and use to manage overall system performance. 5. Implement Care Coordination Models. a. Assure that there is a speci fic practitioner in the MH system who is identified as the responsible party for each person's medical hea lth care needs being addressed and who assures coordination all services . Persons Served / Fa milies / Communities 1. Encourage the Persons We Serve, Families and Commun ities to Develop a Vision of Integrated Care. a. Share information so that the mental health community and others become more aware of the co-morbid physical health risks and integrated care approaches. 2. Encourage Advocacy, Education and Successful Partnerships to Achieve Integrated Physical an d Behavioral Health Care. a. Encourage integrated physical and behavioral he alth care as a high priority similar to employment, housing and staying out of the criminal justice system. 3. Pursue Individualized Person Ce ntered Care that is Recovery and Wellness Focused. a. Support individualized partnership s, between the person served and the care provider, for integrated behavioral an d physical health care. III. Overview\u2014The Problem People with serious mental illness served by our public mental health systems die, on average, 25 years earlier than the general population . This has been demonstrated in a number of recent studies. While suicide accounts for about 30% of excess mortality, about 60% of premature deaths are due to \"natural causes\", such as cardiovascular an d pulmonary disease. Cardiovascular mortality in Schizophrenia increased from 1976 to 1995, with the greatest increase in Standardized Mortality Ratios in men from 1991 to 1995. Many of the risk factors for these \"natural causes\" of death, such as smoking, obesity, and inadequate medical care, are modifiable. Increased attention from policy makers as well as persons served, family members, and the mental health and ge neral health care system is needed. Since about 5,865,000 peopleiii are served by the public mental health system each year, this is a serious public health problem that is poorly recognized and rarely addressed. 16 State Study Resu lts: Years of Potential Life Lost Previous research s uggested that people with schizophrenia died 10 years earlier than age- matched contemporaries This data suggests that people with SMI are dying at least 25 years earlier Year AZ MO OK RI TX UT VA (IP only) 1997 26.3 25.1 28.5 1998 27.3 25.1 28.8 29.3 15.5 1999 32.2 26.8 26.3 29.3 26.9 14.0 2000 31.8 27.9 24.9 13.5 (Lutterman et al., 2003) A. Findings from Studies at the State Level 1. Sixteen State Study Mortality data were submitted by public mental health agencies in eight states as part of the Sixteen-State Study on Ment al Health Performance Measures (Lutterman et al., 2003). Seven of the eight states (Arizona, Missouri, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, and Vermont) submitted data on persons served in both inpatient and outpatient services during the period 1997 through 2000. These data were analyzed using age-adjusted death rates, standardized mortality ratios, and years of potential life lost. The Age-Adjust ed Death Rate (AADR) is the crud e death rate adjusted to US standard population\u2014the age-specific death ra te population percentage for that age group. The Standardized Mortality Ratio (S MR) is the actual number of d eaths divided by the expected number of deaths. The Mean Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) is the sum of (life expectancy - age of death) divided by the number of deceased individuals. iv In all eight states it was found that people served by the public mental health system had a higher relative risk of death , with the SMR ranging from 4.9 to 1.2, higher than the general populations of their states. Deceased public mental health clients had di ed at much younger ages and lost decades of potential life when compared with their living cohorts nationwide. For the six states that could provide detailed data, individuals with a major mental illness diagnosis died at an even younger age , on average 1 to 10 years earlier , than those with a non major mental illness diagnosis. Most of these individuals died of natural causes. The leading cau ses of death were similar to those found in the general population nationwid e and statewide. The causes include heart disease, cancer and cerebrovascular, respiratory and lung diseases. Heart disease was the leading Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 11 cause of death among people served by the public me ntal health system as well as in general state populations and the United St ates. Cancer was second in the general populations of the states and the United States. Percentages of thos e served by the mental health system who died of cancer were lower than for the general population. The percentages of those who died from suicide and accidents were higher than the gene ral population and contribute significantly to the years of life lost.

Massachusetts Study Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 13 The Massachusetts Department of Mental Health (DMH) first conducted and presented the results of a study that led to the Sixteen State Mortality Study as well as other states' surveillance studies. Of note are the increased rates of death from heart disease, particularly in DMH populations under 55. In 1998 - 2000, among persons 25 to 44, cardiovascular mort ality was 6.6 times higher among DMH clients than the general population. Age and selected disease specific rate comparisons are illustrated in the accompanying graphs. The DMH deceased population was younger, less educated, and had a higher proportion of African Americans than the general population. vMassachusetts Study: Deaths from Heart Disease by age group/DMH Enrollees compared 25-44 Pneumonia/Influenza DMH clients, ages 25-64 3. Ohio Study Persons discharged from Ohio public psychiatric hospitals were matched against Ohio Department of H ealth death records. This resulted in identifying 608 deaths among 20,018 unique individuals ov er the five year period 1998 - 2002.

Death from cancer, which is the second leading cause of deat h in the total population and most frequently arises in persons 55 years and older, was not increased in this sample, perhaps because people tended to die before reaching the age Table 2: Standardized Mortality Ratios Cause N Ratio All causes of death 608 3.2* Intentional self-harm (Suicide) 108 12.6* Symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings NEC 32 9.7* Pneumonia and influenza 16 6.6* Chronic lower respiratory diseases 31 5.5* Accidents (unintentional injuries) 83 3.8* Diseases of the heart 126 3.4* Diabetes mellitus 18 3.4* Assault (homicide) 10 1.7 of greatest risk for death from cancer.

Maine Study Note: The percentage of patients adds to greater than 100% since some patients had more than one Axis III diagnosis Using an age-matched sample of Medicaid enrollees with SMI and Medicaid enrollees without SMI, Maine has added to the knowledge base in regard to mo rbidity in the population with SMI. Rates of disease for the population with SMI exceed those of the non-SMI population in every disease category . Not surprisingly, the populations with SMI or SMI and Substance Use diagnoses also exceed the non-SMI/SU population in the percent of individuals with multip le medical conditions. Individuals with both SMI a nd Substance Use Diagnoses, while almost equivalent to the population with SMI in percent of population with multiple medical conditions, have average health care expenses that exceed the SMI and non-SMI/SU populations. vii Maine Study: Health ConditionsPercent MembersSMI SMI/SA Non-SMI/SA Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 14 Maine Study Results: Comparison of Health Disorders Between SM I & Non-SMI Groups 59.4 33.930 28.6 28.4 22.8 21.7 16.5 and Morbidity are Largely Due to Preventable Conditions Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 15 1. Overview Increased death rates in the population with SMI are often associated with modifiable medical risk factors. As previ ously described, people with serious mental disorders are dying from similar causes as found in the general population and their standardized mortality rates are higher than those of the general public . Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder have all been associated with medical causes of death which are often 2 to 3 times that of the general population. Schizophrenia: Natural Causes of Death Higher standardized mortality rates than the general population from: - Diabetes 2.7x - Cardiovascular disease 2.3x - Respiratory disease 3.2x - Infectious diseases 3.4x Cardiovascular disease associated with the largest number of deaths - 2.3 times the largest cause of death in the general population a. Medical Risk Factors In The General Population Medical risk factors are often modifiable. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for persons in the United States. Risk factors for cardi ovascular disease are well studied. The Framingham study described major risk factors and the cumulative sum of their individual risks. Smoking, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are described in the attached graphic. As suggested by th e Framingham study, they are often interrelated and one may influence the other. For example, obesity may influence insulin needs and eventual insulin resistance and the development of Cardiovascular Risk Factors - Overview BMI = body mass index; TC = total cholesterol; diabetes mellitus; >220Single FactorsMultiple Risk + BMI2 Smoking + BMI + TC >2203 Smoking BMI + TC >220 + DM + HTN5 The Framingham Study diabetes.

Smoking Smoking as a natural risk factor for increased mortality is very common among the US population. The World Health Association states that half of long-term sm okers will die from their tobacco usexi. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that fourteen percent of all state Medicaid expenditures are related to smoking xii. Adult men and women smokers lost 13.2 and 14.5 years of life respectively due to their smoking. xiii Smoking prevalence is among the highest for people with mental illness. Seventy-five percent of individuals with either addictions or mental illness smoke cigarettes as compared with 23% of the general population. Rates of smoking among treatment staff in mental health and addictions treatment facilities are also higher than the general population. On average, in mental health settings , approximately 3xivMental Disorders and Smoking Higher prevalence (56-88% for patients with schizophrenia) of cigarette smoking (overall U.S. prevalence 25%) More toxic exposure for patients who smoke (more cigarettes, larger portion consumed) Smoking is associated with increased insulin resistance Similar prevalence in bipolar disorder George TP et al.

The Obesity and Diabetes Epidemics a nd Related Risk Factors and Conditions a. The General Population We begin by looking first at wh at has happened with the general population in regard to diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors. There is an epidemic of obesity and diabetes. There is a relationship between obesity and increasing risk of multiple medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease. The obesity and diabetes epidemic since 1990 is depicted by the following graphics. By 2010 it is estimated that 10 % of the US population will have diabetes mellitus.

Increased risk of diabetes in people with Schizophrenia Obesity among persons with serious mental disorders is far greater than among the general population. See graphic above. Increased Body Mass Index (BMI) is one of the strongest predictors for insulin resistance and diabetes, thus there is a significantly increased risk of Type II diabetes (onset in adult years) in the SMI population. People with Schizophrenia ar e at increased risk for developing diabetes . Several hypotheses have been proposed for this link. There may be a genetic link between Schizophrenia and diabetes. The medications taken for treating Schizophrenia may increase insulin resistance. The medication or the illness may increase the caloric intake or reduce the activity level. xvi Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 20 Type 2 diabetesType 2 diabetes HypercoagulabilityHypercoagulability HypertensionHypertension DyslipidemiaDyslipidemia MacrovascularMacrovascular MicrovascularMicrovascularInsulin resistanceInsulin resistance Amputations Stroke Coronary artery disease Blindness Renal failure Adapted from Opara JU, Levine JH.

Obesity, Insulin Resistance, Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes: Interrelati onships, Morbidity and Mortality Risks Insulin resistance, in which the normal actions of insulin are impaired, develops as early as 10 years prior to meeting the diagnostic threshold for diabetes . xviii Insulin resistance requires th e pancreas to increase the production of insulin in order to maintain a normal blood sugar. Many are able to maintain this increased insulin production. However, over time for some people the insulin production begins to fail and ensuing blood sugar rises resulting in the onset of Type II diabetes. Insulin resistance can develop due to inherited and/or acquired influences. xix Inherited insulin re sistance is rare. Acquired insulin resistance can be due to obesity, inactivity, smoking, aging, medi cations, illness, and high blood sugar. Adapted from: International Diabetes Center (IDC).

Type II Diabetes damage may begin even before the diagnosis. Hypertension, abnormal blood lipids and changes in blood clotting may also occur. Prolonged insulin resistance can even tually result in Type II Diab etes, which is more common in persons with SMI. Diabetes is associated w ith tissue damage in many organs. Diabetes isxx A major cause of vascular disease #1 cause of adult blindness #1 cause of end-stage kidney disease #1 cause of non-traumatic amputations Insulin resistance is linked to developing metabolic syndrome. d. Identification of The Metabolic Syndrome The cumulative effect of multiple risk factors can lead to metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is associated with increased risk of heart attack and stroke. xxi Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed when 3 or more of the following risk factors are present: obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance (as demons trated by an elevated blood glucose level), and abnormal blood lipid (cholesterol and triglycerides) levels. These are important factors to consider because obesity, in sulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and Type II diabete s may be modifiable risk factors for the causes of in creased death among persons with serious mental illnesses. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 21 e. Increased Incidence of Metabolic Syndrome in Population with SMI In regard to metabolic syndrom e, we return to our focus on the population with SMI. Research examined the frequency of metabo lic syndrome criteria (levels of hypertension, high ch olesterol, increased blood clotting and insulin dependent diabetes) in the Clinical Antipsyc hotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) subjects as compared with a sample of the general populati on. CATIE male and female subjects exceeded general population criterion prevalence for meta bolic syndrome on every measure, except for males on one criterion.xxii The New York Times recently featured a front page story on the connection between these chronic medical cond itions and use of antipsychotic medications .xxiii HDL lipoprotein. NCEP Metabolic Syndrome obesity Men WomenDefining Level Risk Factor3 Risk Factors Required for Diagnosis 4. Alcohol and Substance Use Disorders Studies report that alcohol and other substance use disorders co-occu r in 40-70% of the population with SMI. Accidents, suicide and aggressive acti ons are known to be increased among persons with co-occurring disorders. Alt hough not a focus of this review, substance use disorders are a known health risk for many health conditions and also associated with early death. 5. Infectious Diseases The prevalence of hepatitis and HIV are reporte d to be increased in persons with SMI, (Rosenberg, 2004). The risk of tuberculosis asso ciated with group living and poverty may also be increased among persons with SMI. 6. Suicide The New Freedom Commission noted that, \"Suicide is a serious public health challenge that has not received the attention and degree of nati onal priority it deserves. Many Americans are unaware of suicide's toll and its global impact. It is the leading cause of violent deaths worldwide.\" Many states have in itiated Suicide Prevention campai gns targeted at the broader community, with educational materials that fo cus on age and gender cohorts. Suicide has traditionally been a focus of concern for mental health professionals. Broadening our view to the other causes of de ath should not reduce our vigilance regarding the risk of suicide in the people we serve. C. The Impact of Medications Beginning with the introducti on of clozapine in 1991, and the subsequent introduction of five newer generation antipsychotics over the next decade or so, antipsychotic prescribing in the US has move d to the use of these second generation antipsychotics. This has occurred despite their significantly greater cost, larg ely due to a decrease in neurologic side effects a nd the perception that people using them may experience better outcomes, es pecially improvement in negative symptoms. However, with time and experience the second generation antipsychotic medications have become more highly associated with weight gain, diabetes, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome and the superiority of clinical response (except for clozapine) has been questioned. Other psychotropic medications that are associated with weight gain may also be of concern. One example is mood stab ilizing agents such as valproic acid and lithium. The concern may be heightened especially when these agents are used in combination with second generation antipsychotics.

McEvoy JP et al. Schizophr Res . 2005;(August 29). D. Access to Health Care 1. System Issues a. Structure and Funding of Health Care Delivery System Affects Access to Care Access to physical health care for people with SMI is hindered by both the structure and the under-funding of the publicly supported physical health and behavior al health systems of care. Issues include: Lack of reimbursement for coordinated care across service systems Lack of reimbursement for health e ducation, support and family services Inadequate and under-skilled case management services to support self management and linkage to services Poor coordination between health care and behavioral health care systems Lack of integrated treatment for co-occurrin g mental health and substance use disorders which lead to inadequate diagnosis and treatment of substa nce use disorders. xxiv b. Lack of Capacity Rural communities may not have an y health care providers. In many st ates, safety net health care clinics are stretched to capacity. c. Stigma / Discrimination Research suggests that people with SMI frequently face discrimination in accessing and receiving appropriate health care . This may be due to: Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 23 Unease of primary care providers with the needs of the SMI population Decreased expectations of c lients as partners in care The graphic below tells us that there is a differe nce (which could be labe led discrimination) in the care that people receive. The VA system offe rs better health care access and more support for recommended monitoring and disease management than is available to many people with SMI. Yet, in the VA system, the odds were greater that a diabetic w ith a psychosis or substance use disorder would not receive standa rd of care diabetic monitoring (e.g., HbA testing, LDL testing, eye examination), with predictable results of poor blood sugar and blood pressure control. This may be \"the best case scenario\" cu rrently experienced by di abetic individuals with SMI\u2014those without health care coverage and/ or a medical home would likely receive less monitoring and disease management.

Worse diabetes care (Desai 2002, Frayne 2006) Misuse: During medical hospitalization, persons with Schizophrenia are about twic e as likely to have infections due to medical car e postoperative deep venous thrombosis and postoperative sepsis (Daumit 2006) e. Lack of Adequate Health Care Coverage It is challenging for people with Medicaid or no insurance to find primary care and specialty physicians who will see them. Lack of health care coverage represents an enormous barrier to addressing the health care needs of the uninsured population with SMI. A large proportion of the people served by the public mental health system are insured for their health care needs by Medica id and Medicare (many are dual eligibles). The morbidity and mortality described in this repo rt suggests an enormous impact on the past and future costs of these programs. It is often difficult for Medicaid enrollees to find providers who will see them. One of the rationales for Medicaid managed care is to impr ove access to routine care and to reduce use of emergency room care. Yet in many states, the po pulation with SMI, cove red under the disability aid codes of Medicaid, is not included in Medicaid managed care contracts. Further, work on integrating mental health services into primary care settings has demonstrated that there is a number of barriers in how Medicai d reimbursement is structured (e.g., disallowance of more than one type on encounter on the same day). 2. Monitoring and Treatment Guidelines are Underutilized with SMI Populations Approaches to improve the detection of medical comorbidities in people with Schizophrenia and other serious mental disorders are available. They focus on the prevalence and causes of medical comorbidities, providing quality health care, improving lifestyle, and guidelines for integrated models of care for persons with SMI. xxv xxvi xxvii xxviii These approaches identify patient related elements, the nature of the illness, the medical system and available resources, and practitioners attitudes. Early detection, diet, physical activity, smoking, obesity, alcohol use, lipids, diabetes and the role of antipsychotics are some of the guidance provided (see tables in Lambert and guidelines in Goff). Interventions can have very meaningful effects, as demonstrated in the graphic at right or the following example: The National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute has outlined the health benefits of modest weight loss (5-10%): xxixGoals: Lower Risk for CVD Blood cholesterol - 10% = 30% in CHD (200-180) High blood pressure (> 140 SBP or 90 DBP) -4 - 6 m m H g = 16% in CHD; 42% in stroke Cigarette smoking cessation - 50%-70% in CHD Maintenance of ideal body weight (BMI = 25) - 35%-55% in CHD Maintenance of active lifestyle (20-min walk daily) - 35%-55% in CHD Hennekens CH. Circulation. 1998;97:1095-1102. Decreased blood glucose and insulin levels Decreased blood pressure Decreased bad cholesterol (LDL- C/triglycerides) Increased good cholesterol (HDL-C) Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 25 Decreased sleep apnea Reduced degenerative join t disease symptoms We should begin our interventi ons in the mental health system, which we manage, versus recommending actions that cannot be accomplished without major modifications (e.g., cross system funding, st affing primary care within the CMHC, etc). Thus we should begin with psychiatric medical staff, add focus and requirements such as the APA/ADA guidelines, add time to do this, add staff (e.g., RN, APN) to support care and improve referral protocols (e.g., to primary care medical staff) within and without the mental health system. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 26 The American Diabetes Association, American Psychiatric Association, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and the North American Association for the Study of Obesity held a Consensus Development Conference on Antipsychotic Drugs and Obesity and Diabetes in 2004. xxx Despite having been available for the past several years, these ADA/APA guidelines are often not followed. Patient, physician and system factors are not well aligned to promote this practice. For example, adequate time to explain the risk factors and to encourage adherence to medication use along with physical status and laboratory monitoring, requires change in practice. This must be supported by funding and availability of resources (e.g., measuring blood pressure, weight and a bdominal circumference at regular intervals), blood draw ing and laboratory testing, and funding and time to discuss these more recently recommended services. Diabetes Care. 2004;27:596-601.

It is recommended that planning for physical activity and diet be integrated into activities that are/were pl easurable for the individual\u2014handing a person educational material and telling them that they ne ed to exercise and diet will not have the desired effect. Motivational interviewing t echniques will be useful as a part of staging and framing the change process. The ADA has developed widely av ailable patient education mate rials that are in multiple languages and currently being modified for peopl e with SMI. These materials can be used by individuals, family members, pe ers, and care managers as well as by psychiatrists and nurses to initiate individual educat ion and health planning. Preventive strategies for peopl e with Schizophrenia at risk for diabetes include:xxxi Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 27 Screen for diabetes: Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) or 75-g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), particularly before prescribing Minimize risk of weight gain: \u0083 Lifestyle changes \u0083 Appropriate medication selection Check weight/BMI/waist circumference regularly Baseline lipids and blood pressure Repeat baseline measures in 6 weeks and fa sting blood sugar every 3 months on medication Be alert to possibility of diabetic coma Patient education A single metabolic screening and monitoring form that is based on ADA and ATPIII guidelinesxxxii summarizes the standard of care for the general population (see Appendix H). The standard of care for the general population shou ld also be the standard of care for the population with SMI, as the data shows higher degrees of risk and di sease for the population with SMI than that of the general population. IV . National Policy Background A. The President's New Freedom Commission This report is grounded in the Final Report of the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, which asserted that there must be a relationship between mental health and general health and that Recovery is integral to the work of the public mental health system (Appendix B extracts key references).xxxiii These ideas are reflected in the excerpts belo w from the Final Report. For each, we have proposed a corollary statement. New Freedom Commission NASMHPD Proposed Corollary Goal 1: Americans Understand that Mental Health is Essential to Overall Health Understanding that mental health is essential to overall health is fundamental for establishing a health system that treats mental illnesses with the same urgency as it treats physical illnesses. Understanding that overall health is essential to mental health is fundamental for establishing a mental health system that treats physical illnesses with the same urgency as it treats mental illnesses. Goal 2: Mental Health Care is Consumer and Family Driven The plan of care will be at the core of the consumer- centered, recovery-oriented mental health system. The plan of care addresses the whole person, including health status and wellness, to ensure that recovery goals are not impeded by the individual's early death or chronic medical illnesses. B. Institute of Medicine The Institute of Medicine (IOM) convened th e Committee on Crossing the Quality Chasm: Adaptation to Mental Health and Addictive Di sorders in 2004. The committee was charged with adapting the quality improvement framework contained in the predecessor IOM report, Crossing Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 28 the Quality Chasm\u2014A New Health System for the 21st Century. The scope of adaptation is across mental and substance-use (M/SU) conditions , the public and private sectors, and the comprehensive range of issues identified and addressed in the Quality Chasm report. The report of the Committee, Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions, was published in late 2005. There are two overarching recommendations: IOM Overarching Recommendation 1 : Health care for general, mental, and substance-use problems and illnesses must be delivered with an understanding of the inherent interactions between the mind/brain and the rest of the body. IOM Overarching Recommendation 2 : The aims, rules and strategi es for redesign set forth in Crossing the Quality Chasm should be applied throughout mental/substance use health care on a day-to-day operational basis but tailored to reflect the characteristics that distinguish care for these probl ems and illnesses from genera l health care. (See Appendix E for the Quality Chasm Ten Rules.) Within the IOM report, Chapter 5: Coordinating Care for Better Mental, Substance-Use and General Health, provides definitions , summarizes the body of research and makes recommendations specific to the issues of in tegration of care. The definitions include: Communication exists when each clinician caring for the patient shares needed clinical information about the patient to other clinicians also tr eating the patient. Collaboration is multidimensional, requiring: \u0083 A shared understanding of goals and roles, \u0083 Effective communication, and \u0083 Shared decision making. Care coordination is the outcome of effective colla boration and corres ponds to clinical integration. Clinical integration is the extent to which patient ca re services are coordinated across people, functions, activities, and sites over tim e so as to maximize the value of services delivered to patients. The recommendations in Chapter 5 include: Recommendation 5-1 : To make collaboration and coordina tion of patients' M/SU health care services the norm, providers of the services should establish clinically effective linkages within their own organizations and between pr oviders of mental health and substance use treatment. The necessary communications and interactions should take place with the patient's knowledge and cons ent and be fostered by: \u0083 Routine sharing of information on patie nt's problems and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments among and be tween providers of M/SU treatment \u0083 Valid, age-appropriate screening of patients for comorbid mental, substance-use and general medical problems in these clinical settings and reliable monitoring of their progress. Recommendation 5-2: To facilitate the delivery of coordinated care by primary care, mental health, and substance-use treatment providers , government agencies, purchasers, health plans, and accreditation organizations should implement policies and incentives to Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 29 continually increase collabor ation among these providers to achieve evidence-based screening and care of their patients with ge neral, mental, and/or substance-use health conditions. (Detailed specific measures follow this recommendation; please see full report.) Recommendation 5-3: To ensure the health of persons for whom they are responsible, M/SU providers should: \u0083 Coordinate their services w ith those of other human-serv ices and education agencies, such as schools, housing and vocational rehabi litation agencies and providers of services for older adults, and \u0083 Establish referral arrangement s for needed services. Providers of services to high-risk populations \u2014such as child welfare agencies, criminal and juvenile justice agencies, and long-term care facilities for older adults\u2014should use valid, age-appropriate and culturally appropriate technique s to screen all entrants into their systems to detect M/SU problems and illnesses. Recommendation 5-4: To provide leadership in coordination, DHHS should create a high- level continuing entity reportin g directly to the secretary to improve co llaboration and coordination across its mental, substanc e-use and general health care agencies ...DHHS also should implement performance measures to monitor its progress toward achieving internal interagency collaboration and publicly report its pe rformance on these measures annually. State governments should create an alogous linkages across state agencies. Daniels and Adams have integrated the findings and recommendations of the original IOM Quality Chasm report, the President's New Fr eedom Commission report, SAMHSA's Federal Action Agenda and the 2005 IOM report specific to mental health and substance use, with the intent of creating a consensus framework and tools for system transformation. The 2005 IOM report provides a table of recommendations for a broad spectrum of stakeholder groups. These recommendations include specific steps that ea ch group\u2014alone and in co llaboration\u2014can take to promote meaningful transformative change a nd make the mental health system more person- centered. xxxiv C. Bazelon Center The Bazelon Center report, Get It Together: How to Integrate Physical and Mental Health Care for People with Serious Mental Disorders, was published in 2004. The report focuses primarily on integration and the problems stemming from a fragmented health care system. The report states \"In a recovery-oriented mental health system, physical health care is as central to an individual's service plan as hous ing, job training or education.\" xxxv The report describes barriers to integrated care and highlights four servic e delivery models for integrating care. Additional models are described in the R ecommendations section of this report. D. NASMHPD The NASMHPD Medical Directors Council 11th Technical Report, Integrating Behavioral Health and Primary Care Services: Opportunities and Challenges for State Mental Health Authorities, identifies three principles that continue to frame thinking a bout the relationship between behavioral health (mental and subs tance use conditions) a nd general health. Increased integration of behavioral health and health care services is a priority at the national, state, local and person levels. Good public polic y will work to sustain, support and require integration of services between the two \"saf ety net\" systems of CHCs and SMHA providers with integration ranging from coordination of care to full integration of medical and behavioral services. Physical health care is a core component of basic services to persons with serious mental illness. Ensuring access to preventive health care and ongoing integration and management of medical care is a primary responsibility and mission of mental health authorities. Behavioral health care is a core component of essential servic es to persons seeking primary health care. Ensuring access to preventive, ongoing, and appropriate behavioral health service is a primary responsibility and mission of general health care providers. (Appendix D contains the Executive Summary of the full report.)xxxvi This report on morbidity and mortality points the way to a new focus on assuring that the people served by the public mental health system have access to effective, high quality health care and that all care is coordinated. Quality health care should have the same priority as employment, housing or keeping people out of the criminal justice system. V . Recovery and Wellness Mental Health Recovery The American Heritage dict ionary defines Wellness as \"The condition of good physi cal and mental health, especially when maintained by proper diet, exercise, and habits.\" We assert that : ...is a journey of healing and transformation enabling a person with a mental health problem to live a meaningful life in a community of his or her choice while striving to achieve his or her full potential. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 30 Wellness is one of the ul timate goals of, and an integral part of, Recovery Recovery principles and approaches ar e necessary to achieve Wellness Holistic There are multiple aspects to Recovery, as described in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Consensus Statement on Recovery xxxvii, the full text of which can be found in Appendix C. Recovery encompasses an individual's whole life, including mind, body, spirit, and community. Recovery embraces all aspects of life, including housing, employment, education, mental health and healthcare treatment and services, complementary and naturalistic services (such as recreational services, libraries, museums, etc.) addictions treatment, spirituality, creativity, social networks, community participation and family supports as determined buy the person. Families, providers, or ganizations, systems, communities and society play crucial roles in creating and maintaining meaningful opportunities for consumer access to these supports. Self-Direction Individualized and Person-Centered Empowerment Holistic Non-Linear Strengths-Based Peer Support Respect Responsibility Hope Of these, the Holistic principle pa rticularly speaks to th e issues under considera tion in this report. The holistic nature of Recove ry includes \"body...and healthca re treatment and services\". The essential role of Recovery principles in good health care is clear from the IOM definition of Patient-centered\u2014\"providing care that is respectf ul of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions.\" An inherent link between Recovery and Wellne ss is noted in the New Freedom Commission Report under Goal 2: Mental Health Care is Co nsumer and Family Driven: \"Giving consumers the ability to participate fully in their communities will require a few essentials: ....Access to health care\". The Wellness model developed by Dr. Bill Hettlerxxxviii is strikingly consistent with the SAMHSA Consensus Statement on Recovery: Wellness is an active process of becoming aw are of and making choices toward a more successful existence. Wellness involves 'process' and 'awareness' - which means developing awareness that there is no end point and that we never arrive at a poi nt where there is no further possibility of improving; health and happiness are de finitely attainable. The key words in the previous sentence are process, aware, choices, and success Wellness is a way of life\u2014a lifestyle we design to achieve an optimal level of well-being. Industrial Age Medicine Self-Care off the MapTertiary Secondary PrimaryProfessional Care Adapted from Ferguson, T. 1995 Wellness involves choice \u2014which means that we have considered a variety of options and select those that seem to be in our be st interest\u2014a decision we make toward optimal health. Wellness is the positive acceptance of oneself. Wellness is the interaction of the body, mind, and spirit\u2014the appreciation th at everything we do, think, feel, and believe has an impact on our state of health. Success is determined by each individual to be their personal collection of accomplishments for their life. Successful recovery, as well as the lifestyle changes necessary to address morbidity and mortality, necessitates empowering indi viduals with decision making skills acquired through practice. Choice of lifestyle changes among persons with SMI will be an important component\u2014lifestyle changes require individual changes\u2014and hope drives lifestyle and the assertive pursuit of health. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 31 Recovery must incorporate a substantial focus on Wellness. Addressing the epidemic of chronic medical illness and premature death is essential to realizing the promise of recovery. Poor phys ical health puts additional barriers on the path to rec overy, stealing time, energy, and personal resources that could go towards r ecovery. Even more tragically, premature death Information Age Health Care Tertiary Secondary Professional Care Primary Professional Care Self-Help Networks Family / Friends Individual Self-Care Wedge size based on available time for care Adapted from Ferguson, T. 1995 Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 32 robs the recovering individual of the fruits of a long, hard effort\u2014a meaningful life in the community. Most persons with SMI don't reach recovery until their mid-40's. Now that people with SMI are dying 25 years sooner than the gene ral population, they are left with many fewer years of life to enj oy their recovery. We must engage people with SMI in their heal th care in new ways, empowering them to take personal responsibility for making health choices to promote their indi vidual recovery and wellness efforts. As noted in the Recommendati ons, there are multiple strategies to pursue in addressing morbidity and mortality, most of them in partnership with other systems such as the general health care system, Medi caid or Public Health. But, for any of these strategies to be successful, our principal partnership mu st be with the people we serve. V . What Should Be Done? - Recommendations and Solutions A. Introduction These proposed recommendations and solutions are or ganized at four levels of action: national; state; provider agencies and clinicians; and, persons served, families and their community. We have identified several major actions necessary to address the issues desc ribed in this report. 1. Prioritization of the public health problem of morbidity and mortality and designation of the population with SMI as a priority health disparities population. 2. Tracking and monitoring of morbidity and mo rtality in populations served by our public mental health systems (surveillance). 3. Implementation of established standards of care for prevention, screening, assessment, and treatment. 4. Improved access and integration with physical health care services. B. National Level The federal government and other national groups have resources that can support efforts to improve care to people with SMI served in our public mental health care systems. We recommend three major areas of focus: NATIONAL LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Designate the population with SMI as a health disparities population. 2. Adopt ongoing surveillance methods. 3. Support education and advocacy. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 33 1. Designate the Population with SM I as a Health Disparities Population a. Federal designation of people with SMI as a distinct at-risk health disparities population is a key first step, followed by development and adaptation of materials and methods for prevention in this population as well as incl usion in morbidity and mortality surveillance demographics. HRSA has sponsored the Health Disp arities Collaboratives in partne rship with IHI, based on this vision: Reduce disparities in health outcomes for poor, minority, and other underserved people. Using the methodology of IHI's Breakthrough Series Model, The Model for Improvement and the Care Model (see the NAS MHPD Report summarized in Appendix D for more on this model), health care providers are making a positive difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. To date, these and other federal initiatives focused on Health Disparities have not identified peopl e with SMI as an included target population. The research that is presented in this report documents the considerable health disparity experienced by the population with SMI and should be the basis for such a designation. Some of the populations served by the public mental health system are uninsured, or move in and out of eligibility for Medicai d. Inclusion of the popul ation with SMI as a designated health disparity population may assist somewhat in their access to health care services for the uninsured; however, the lack of health care coverage represents an enormous barrier to addressing the mental health and medical care needs of the uninsured population with SMI. SAMHSA and CMS in conjunction with NASMHP D and the National Association of State Medicaid Directors (NASMD) should work togeth er to assure that th at funding and billing mechanisms are in place to su pport the recommendations for preventive care, integration of primary care and mental health services, and effective access to prim ary care and mental health services for persons with SMI. 2. Adopt Ongoing Su rveillance Methods a. Establish a committee at the federal level to recommend changes to national surveillance activities that will incorporate information about health status in the population with SMI. Existing national morbidity and mortality surveillance activities need to include mental health measures. In addition, this group should develop stan dard definitions for tracking of deaths and key data elements of morbidity in the SMI population across states. At present, there is little in national health su rveillance activity that addresses the surveillance needs of the mental health system, but there ar e opportunities to work at adding key information componentsxxxix: National Comorbidity Survey \u0083 Definitive survey on epidemiology of mental disorders, conducted 1990-2 and 2001-3 \u0083 Relatively limited measures of medical comorbidity or medical service use \u0083 Recommendations: Add more complete measures of medical comorbidity Add fuller measures of health behaviors (e.g. diet, exercise, BMI, smoking) Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 34 Add more robust measures of health serv ice use (e.g. preventive services; primary care and specialty services) National Health Interview Survey \u0083 Largest annual survey of the health in the US \u0083 Mental health questions in all years include self-reported mental health diagnoses and some brief Depression screens; 1989 was the only survey year that specifically subsampled persons with SMI \u0083 Recommendations: New supplement for persons with SMI Include mental health scr eening questions regularly Analyze data with mental illness as both a dependent and an independent variable National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey \u0083 Surveys office visits to physicians \u0083 Psychiatrist sample very small \u0083 Recommendations: NAMCS-like survey for CMHCs (HRSA has done both a NAMCS and NHIS for CHCs) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey \u0083 Best survey on the epidemiology of illness in the US; Physical examination, laboratory tests allow for definitive diagnosis \u0083 Several NHANES surveys have included brief Depression measures, but there is no way of identifying individuals with other SMI \u0083 Recommendations: NHANES to assess health status for a random sample of persons with SMI in the community Include questions such as the K-6 or PHQ 9 in all surveys, permitting analysis of co- occurrence of mental illne ss and medical comorbidity Behavioral Risk Factor Surv eillance System (BRFSS) \u0083 Identifies risk factors such as sm oking, diet in a very large sample \u0083 Both the BRFSS and NHIS will be adding the K6, a symptom measure, not for the SMI population, but for persons with self reported frequent mental distress \u0083 Maine has utilized BRFSS as a survei llance tool for the SMI population \u0083 Because the K-6 is only a nonspecific symptom measure, it may not capture the population with severe mental illness in the pub lic sector who are at greatest risk and of highest policy relevance CMHS Client-Patient Sample Survey \u0083 Done every 5 - 7 years \u0083 Contains basic data on SMI and physical health problems \u0083 Recommendations: Information on physical health problems and services needs to be enhanced Uniform Reporting System/National Outcome Measurement System \u0083 Prior developmental work was done on mortality (Lutterman et al., 2003) \u0083 Recommendations: An indicator needs to be added on use physical health screening and services Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 35 Medicaid, Medicare and Private Insurance Data \u0083 CMHS has a large scale contract with RTI to analyze encounter data \u0083 Contract needs to be supplemented to i nvestigate patterns of physical health care \u0083 Recommendations: System lacks an indicator of SMI b. Engage at the national and state levels, per the IOM report, in developing the National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) to assure that EHR and PHR templates include the data elements needed to manage and coordinate general health care and mental health care. In the future, Electronic Health Records (EHR s) and Personal Health Records (PHRs) will provide a data set that can be mined for surveillance data, likely replacin g the surveys and other reporting systems that we now use. Engage at the national and stat e levels in development of the National Health Information Infrastructure ( NHII) to assure that EHR and PHR templates include the data elements needed to manage and c oordinate general health care and mental health care. These systems need careful design to ensu re that critical health status and service information for the purposes of surveillance a nd performance measurement can be extracted. Regional Health Information Orga nizations (RHIOs) are now being formed to develop electronic networks containing data elements essentia l to care coordination and accessible by diverse participating health care organizatio ns in a defined geographic region. Chapter 6 of the IOM report, Ensuring the National Health Inform ation Infrastructure Benefits Persons with Mental and Substance-Use Conditions , outlines the actions n eeded to ensure that the developing National Health Information Infras tructure (NHII) serves consumers of health care for mental and/or substance use conditions as well as it does those with general health care needs and notes that our information technology sy stems lag behind those of general health care, as does our coding of services provided. Clearl y, if we intend that mental health systems integrate services more directly with general health care, especially if we include the provision of general health care in mental health provider si tes, these issues must be addressed. 3. Support Education and Advocacy a. Share information widely about physical hea lth risks in persons with SMI to encourage awareness and advocacy. Educate the health care community. Encourage persons served and family members to advocate for wellne ss approaches as part of recovery. b. Build on the development of SAMHSA evidence-bas ed practices by creating a toolkit that is focused on health status and healthy lifestyles. c. Promote adoption of recommendations in the NASMHPD Technical Reports on Polypharmacy and Smoking to impl ement policies and programs addres sing these risk factors. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 36 C. State Level The state level is where partnerships among the SMHA, Public Health, Medicaid and the health care delivery system must be crea ted, in order to address the hea lth care needs of the populations with SMI. We recommend si x major areas of focus: STATE LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Prioritize the public health problem of morbidity and mortalit y and designate the population with SMI as a priority health disparities population. 2. Improve access to physical health care. 3. Promote coordinated and integrated mental health and physical health care for persons with SMI. 4. Support education and advocacy. 5. Address funding. 6. Develop a quality improvement (Q I) process that supports in creased access to physical health care and ensures appropriate preven tion, screening and treatment services. 1. Prioritize the Public Health Probl em of Morbidity And Mortality and Designate the Population with SMI as a Priority Health Disparities Population. a. Collect surveillance data on morbidity and mortality in the population with SMI. SMHAs must work with Medicaid and Public Hea lth agencies to build state level surveillance data bases to provide surveillanc e data on both morbidity and mo rtality in the population with SMI. Our public mental health system must track morbidity a nd mortality in public mental health populations. Each SMHA should know who has died while an active client and why. Currently there are a range of policies regard ing reportable deaths; the SMHAs do not have comparable data. The Sixteen State Mortality Study provi ded valuable new data, but also demonstrated the variability of data collection within the st ates. Two state-level surveillance methods have demonstrated use of data from other systems to match data from the MHSA system: For morbidity, match to the Medicaid encounter data to obtain information on the diagnoses and treatments being provided by the health care system for the population served by the MHSA. The data in the Main e study is an example. For mortality, match to the State Department of Health death records to obtain information on numbers and causes of death in the populatio n served by the MHSA. The data from Ohio is an example, although only matched to inpatients. As noted in the National level recommendations, it is proposed that the standard for surveillance should be set at the national level, to assure comparability of data. Implementation must be carried out at the State level. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 37 b. Apply a public health approach and population based interventions. It is currently popular to talk about using a Pu blic Health approach in mental health. What exactly does this mean? \"Public He alth includes the ac tivities that society undertakes to assure the conditions in which people can be healthy. These include organized community efforts to prevent, identify and counter thre ats to the health of the public.\"xl While the role of Public Health as a safety net health care provider varies considerably across the states, the Three Core Functions and Ten Essential Services of Pub lic Health (identified by the IOM in 1988 and subsequently refined by the Public Health Functions Steering Committee) xli is a template used by Public Health systems nationally: Assessment 1. Monitor health status of the community 2. Diagnose and investigate health problems and hazards 3. Inform and educate people about health issues Policy Development 4. Mobilize partnerships to solve community problems 5. Support policies and plans to achieve health goals Assurance 6. Enforce laws and regulations to achieve health goals 7. Link people to needed personal health services 8. Ensure a skilled public health workforce 9. Evaluate effectiveness, accessibilit y, and quality of health services 10. Research and apply innovative solutions The focal activity under the Assessment function is surveillance, \"systema tic monitoring of the health status of a population.\"xlii Another Public Health concept is population based intervention with differential levels of prevention, using the tools of health promotion, health education and linking people to appropriate treatment. Primary Prevention consists of strategies that seek to prevent the occurrence of disease or injury, generally through reducing exposure or ri sk factor levels. Thes e strategies can reduce or eliminate causative risk factors (risk reduction). Secondary Prevention consists of strategies that seek to identify and control disease processes in their early stages before signs and sy mptoms develop (screening and treatment). Tertiary Prevention consists of strategies that prevent disability by restoring individuals to their optimal level of functioning after a disease or injury is establis hed and damage is done. xliii We need Public Health as a partner in implementing standard surveillance methodologies for morbidity and mortality in people with SMI and in utilizing Public Health's primary, secondary and tertiary prevention and treatment strategies with the population we serve. A growing body of literature has reported on the epid emics of obesity and diabetes in the general population, and the Public Health system has developed stra tegies to address these issues, collaborating with public and private insurers and the health care delivery system to intervene with primary, secondary and tertiary prevention initiatives related to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which are intertwined issu es. These approaches and materials need to be customized for use in the public mental health system (for example, the ADA is currently revising its educational materials for use with the population served by the public mental health system). Populations with SMI are at hi gher risk than the general p opulation. Some ethnic populations with SMI are at even higher risk of morbidity and mortality from diabetes and other medical conditions, and this should be a consideration as we plan strate gies as a public mental health system. Health Disparities refer to differences in populati ons' health status that are avoidable and can be changed. These differences can result from environmental, social and/or economic conditions, as well as public policy. These and other fact ors adversely affect population health.xliv It could be argued that many of the causes of morbidity and mortality are related to the vulnerability of the population with SMI. Efforts to addr ess these conditions should include: Safe housing Adequate income Skills-based prevention programs to reduce vulnerability to victimization Addressing substance use \u0083 Impairment \u0083 Environment associated with illegal drug use Case management services Research conducted in the VA system assessed trea tment and quality of life for U.S. veterans with chronic and persistent mental illness and found that increased exposure to case management resulted in an improved quality of life across several domain s, including both objective and subjective dimensions for health, general, leisur e, and social, and the subjective dimension only for housing. xlv As an example of what a SMHA might do in partnership with other systems, Maine DHHS has directed senior clinicians to participate in workgroups on behavioral health/health integration with Medicaid, Public Health, provider and consumer gr oups, Federally Qualified Health Centers and several other public and private groups. The bulk of the work of this collaboration has been directed at early screening and treatment for Depression in general medi cal settings, and in the implementation of the chronic care model for Depression, as well as for diabetes and heart disease. Examples of collaborative projects have included a HRSA funded Public Health project on inte grating behavioral health for women of child bearing age, examination of BRFSS data for the interaction between poor me ntal health and health risks, a Medicaid project involving implementation of the chronic care model a nd Depression care for members with complex Medical Expenses for MaineCare service Behavioral Services Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 38 conditions and inclusion of Depression as a priority condition to be addre ssed in the Maine State Health Plan. The SMHA is also on the steering committee for a multiyear integration effort funded by the Maine Health Access Foundation, Maine's largest health care foundation. In working with these partners the SMHA has acquired a knowledge of quality programming for chronic health conditions that can be leveraged to implement a system of eff ective and accessible health care for persons with serious mental illness. Next steps for Maine's SMHA include analysis of the utilization, quality and cost of care for diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other health c onditions for persons with serious mental illness, with the expectation that the results of this integrated data analysis will provide direction for future policy and program changes. The results of these analytic efforts are currently being shared with mental health providers and persons serveds in order to engage them at the outset in planning for colla borative projects that address health issues within mental health programs. Maine: Coronary Artery Disease Care .001 64.2% 49.4% Outpatient .001 Bypass/Stents Valve/Pacemaker 1.5 Therapy Events ns 48.7% 44.2% Cardiac Diagnostics ns Stat Sig Non-SMI SMI 2. Improve Access to Physical Health Care a. Require, regulate, and lead the public behavior al health care system to ensure prevention, screening, and treatment of ge neral health care issues. Implement standards of care for prevention, screen ing and treatment utiliz ing practice guidelines. Since damage from diabetes begins before the di agnosis, there should be substantial investment in primary prevention activi ties as well as screening. There is much that is applicable from the qualit y improvement work in the health care delivery system, as led by IHI. For example, a curren t initiative is the 100,000 Lives Campaign. The campaign aimed to enlist thousands of hospita ls across the country in a commitment to implement changes in care that have been prove n to prevent avoidable deaths in hospitals, estimated by the IOM at 98,000 per year. Six changes (Deploy Rapid Response Teams, Deliv er Reliable, Evidence-Based Care for Acute Myocardial Infarction, Prevent A dverse Drug Events, Prevent Cent ral Line Infections, Prevent Surgical Site Infections, Prevent Ventilator-A ssociated Pneumonia), each supported by specific improvement tools and expertise, have been implemented volunt arily by hospitals that have joined the Campaign, with results routinely tracked and measured.xlvi The public mental health system could employ the IHI model in crafting an initiative to prevent avoidable early death and chronic medical illness in people with SMI. b. Build adequate capacity to se rve the physical health care needs of the SMI population. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 39 Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 40 This is challenging for a number of reasons: people with Medicaid or no insurance have difficulties finding primary care an d specialty physicians who will see them; research suggests that people with SMI face additi onal barriers, including discrimina tion, in receiving appropriate health care; rural communities may not have any h ealth care providers; and, safety net health care clinics (Federally Qualified Health Center s/Community Health Centers and Public Health clinics in states where Public Health also prov ides safety net health care) are stretched to capacity. These are issues that will need to be addressed state by state, in partnership with the health care delivery system, especially the safety net providers. 3. Promote Coordinated and Integrated Mental Health and Physical Health Care for Persons with SMI a. Utilize the system transformation recommendations from the New Freedom Commission, Institute of Medicine and SAMHSA to achieve a more person-centered mental health system. Specifically, implement the following selected recommendations, as identified in the IOM report, and modified to address the morbidity and mortality issues. Create high-level mechanisms to improve collaboration and coordination across agencies Promote integration of general hea lthcare and mental health records Revise laws and other policies to support communication between providers In a systematic review of the literature, Druss and von Esenwein found that a range of models may help improve quality and outcomes of care in persons with mental and substance use disorders.xlvii An emerging practice is to bring health car e services into the public mental health system. Some examples include: Cherokee Health System in east Tennessee has primary care physicians on the teams serving people with SMI. The Cherokee model was feat ured as one of several examples in the publication issued by the Bazelon Center.xlviii Research conducted in the VA system used a ra ndomized trial to evaluate an integrated model of primary medical care for a cohort of patients with serious mental disorders. Veterans who received care in the integrated clinic received on-site primary care and case management that emphasized preventive medical care, patient education and close collaboration with mental health providers to improve access to and continuity of care. Analyses compared health process (use of medical services, quality of care, and satisfaction and outcomes (health and mental health status a nd costs) between the groups in the year after randomization. On-site, integrated primary care was associated with improved quality and outcomes of medical care. xlix Bartels reported on a pilot study using a community mental hea lth nurse who is trained in psychiatric and medical care management. The nurse care manager role was to monitor, facilitate, and coordinate primary medical care in education and illness management, simultaneously addressing psychiatric and medi cal needs through rehab ilitation, health care management, and skills training. This model, focused on older adults, li nks interventions to enhance independent functioning, health ou tcomes and quality of life, including rehabilitation/skills training and medical case management.l A similar model has been employed in the Vermont site participating in the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) program, Depression in Primary Care: Li nking Clinical and System Strategies. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 41 NIMH is currently funding a large randomized trial of a nurse care manager intervention designed to improve primary medical care fo r individuals served by a community mental health center. This randomized, controlled tria l is located in an inner-city community mental health center in Atlanta, Georgia. Subjects assigned to medical case management will be provided a manualized, stepped- care intervention that incl udes patient education and activation, communication and advocacy with medical providers and help in overcoming system-level barriers to primary care. The study is testing the impact of the intervention on quality of primary care, health outcomes, and costs. The Washtenaw Community Health Organizati on (WCHO) in Michigan, a collaboration between the University of Michig an, the county mental health center, and local private health clinics, used the NCCBH Four Quadrant Mode l to organize its integrated services. The services provided to people with SMI include nurse practitioners from the School of Nursing who operate side by side with ps ychiatrists and social workers at two mental health clinics. Persons served with urgent health needs and those without primary care providers can receive health care services at the time of their mental he alth appointment. Additionally, researchers from the University of Michigan and the WCHO have designed a health risk appraisal instrument that assists mental hea lth staff in identifying specific health risk behaviors and potential health conditions. This electr onic tool flags the data and notifies the person completing the form of needed health follow-up based on the answers in the tool. li In Massachusetts, the Northeast Health System (NHS), a large community-based health care delivery system (which includes a full continuum of acute inpatient, outpatient and long-term care services) and Health & Education Services (HES), a large behavioral health care network that is part of NHS, initiated a performance improvement projects which evolved into a controlled field study and then into a partially funded program. They chose to embed primary care for adults with SMI within the me ntal health setting, crea ting one-stop shopping in a familiar environment. Patients were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received r outine primary health care from a nurse practitioner in the mental heal th setting. Those in the cont rol group received treatment as usual with regard to their pr imary care. One goal was to reduce ER visits by 33%; ER visits were actually 42% lower in the experimental group compared with the control group. The most dramatic differences were found in th e health care screens for hypertension and diabetes. For both indicators, the experiment al group experienced a 44% rate of access compared with 0% in the control group. lii b. Implement the recommendations found in the 11th NASMHPD Technical Paper: Integrating Behavioral Health and Primary Care Services. As the mental health system initiates preventi ve measures, monitoring and screening, it must address the barriers of access to treatment and ongoing medical care for people with SMI and other complex conditions. NASMHPD issued a Technical Report on this topic in 2005. See Appendix D for the Executive Summary, which in cludes all of the recommendations. Work with persons served and family groups to advocate fo r improved access and quality of physical health care services to the population with SMI. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 42 4. Support Education and Advocacy a. Develop and implement toolkits and guidelines to help prov iders, self-help/peer support groups and families understand how to facilitate healthy choices while promoting personal responsibility. b. Establish training capacity. A key component of this plan will be training and technical assistance for the mental health work force on the importance of the issues. c. Involve academic and association partne rs in planning and conducting training. d. Address stigma / discrimination. 5. Address Funding a. Assure financing methods for service improvements. Include reimbursement for coordination activities, case management, trans portation and other supports to ensure access to physical health care services. b. As a health care purchaser, Medicaid should: Provide coverage for health education and prevention services (primary prevention) that will reduce or slow the impact of disease for people with SMI. Establish rates adequate to assure access to primary care by persons with SMI. Cover smoking cessation and weight reduction treatments. Use community case management to improve engagement with and access to preventive and primary care. There are two aspects of Medicai d financial impact: the opportunity to provide health education and prevention services (primary prevention) that will reduce or slow the impact of disease for people with SMI, and the cost of providing appropria te health ca re services (secondary and tertiary prevention) to people with SMI. 6. Develop a Quality Improvement (Q I) Process that Supports Increased Access to Physical Health Care an d Ensures Appropriate Prevention, Screening and Treatment Services. a. Establish a system goal for quality health ca re with the same priority as employment, housing or keeping people out of the criminal justice system. b. Join with the Medicaid and Public Health agencies at the state level to develop a quality improvement (QI) plan to support appropriate screening, treatment and access to health care for people being served by the public mental health system, whether Medicaid or uninsured. Common causes of increased mortality and chro nic medical illness in the SMI population should be targeted for QI action planning and programmatic interventions. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 43 Assure integrated data analysis of utilization, cost a nd quality outcomes for both health care and mental health, including analysis of degree to which improvements in one system of care leads to changes in the other system of care. c. Assure that all initiati ves to address morbidity and mortality have concrete goals, timeframes and specific steps. Gather perfor mance measurement data and use to manage overall system performance. Integration projects, such as the state level work underway in Maine or projects initiated by individual organizations, need to plan from the beginning to gather and use data to learn from their work, determine if they are meeting thei r goals, and demonstrate to themselves and to policy makers the significance of the efforts. Some questions posed in the Morbidity and Mortality Work Group that would benef it from regular data collection are: How widespread is screening? How many cases are detected? How many cases are prevented? In how many case are outcomes improved? How much does it cost? Who has paid? Performance measurement must be a part of these new programs as they are designed and implemented. We are fortunate in not having to start anew to de velop performance measures for this work on integrated care and co-occurring conditions. The Center for Quality Assessment & Improvement in Mental Health has presented three sets of quality measures for use: Quality measures for patients with co-occurri ng medical and psychiatri c conditions treated in primary care settings Quality measures for patients with co-occurri ng medical and psychiatri c conditions treated in the mental health specialty setting Quality measures for patients with co-occurri ng substance use and psychiatric conditions treated in the mental health specialty setting Each set includes structure, pro cess, and outcome measures. (The full set of measures can be found in Appendix I.) d. Use regulatory, policy and other programming opportunities to promote personal responsibility for making healthy choices by changing the locus of control from external (program rules, regulations, staff) to the indi viduals we serve (self-control and management). e. Continue to promote adoption of recommenda tions in the NASMHPD Technical Reports on Polypharmacy and Smoking to im plement policies and programs addr essing these risk factors. D. Provider Agencies / Clinicians The direct service delivery system is where we must focus improvement activities. We recommend five major areas of focus: PROVIDER AGENCY / CLINICIAN LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Adopt as policy that mental health and ph ysical healthcare should be integrated. 2. Help individuals to understand the hope ful message of recovery, enabling their engagement as equal partners in care and treatment. 3. Support wellness and empowerment in persons served, to improve mental and physical well-being. 4. Ensure the provision of qual ity, evidence-based physical and mental health care by provider agencies and clinicians. 5. Implement care coordination models. 1. Adopt as Policy that Mental Health and Physical Healthcare Should Be Integrated. The methods to achieve integration will vary fro m provider to provider, but the commitment of leadership to achieving integration will be cri tical to addressing the issues of morbidity and mortality in the population with SMI. See the discussion on models for integration, under the recommendation to States to Promote Coordinated and Integrated Mental Health and Physical Health Care for Persons with SMI . Depending on the model adopted, assure that the operational details, staffing, and financing are aligned to achieve th e goal of integrated care. 2. Help Individuals to Understand the Hopeful Messag e of Recovery, Enabling their Engagement as Equal Partners in Care and Treatment. Person-centered care is one of the six Quality Chasm aims. The pathway to recovery and health will be different for each individual. This requires that we develop strategies at many levels throughout the public mental health system to incorporate the full range of primary, secondary and tertiary inte rventions needed to reduce morbidity and mortality. These multiple strategies to address morbidity and mortality will best be accomplished through partnership with other systems, but for any of these strategies to be successful, our principle partnership must be with the people we serve . Agree On A Treatment Plan \"Adherence\" is the goal because it implies sticking to a collaboratively developed plan, as opposed to the more directive term \"compliance.\" Six specific actions can increase the likelihood of adherence: Keep the regimen simple Write out treatment details Give specifics about the expected benefits of treatment and the timetable Prepare the patient for side effects and optional courses of action Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 44 To create change, recovery and wellness, individuals must have hope for a different tomorrow that is more aligned with their goals and dreams than exists today. Unless we can help the indivi duals that we serve find hope for a better tomorrow, then change, recovery and wellness will never be realized. Discuss obstacles to moving forward with the regimen, Get patient feedback. John Allen Jr. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 45 3. Support Wellness and Empowerment of Persons Served, to Improve Mental and Physical Well-Being a. Support personal empowerment and individual re sponsibility, enabling individuals to make healthy choices for reco very to promote their individual re covery efforts; this means engaging people with SMI in their health care in new ways. In engaging people with SMI in their health care, we should avoid the trap of mandating changes in lifestyle, inst ead focusing on true co llaboration through engagement . The Bayer Institute and Health-Partners, based on data fr om studies, found that when clinicians use a relationship-centered in terviewing style, patients become more responsible and active participants in their health care and more adhe rent to their treatment plan (See Appendix G). Engagement : skills that support developm ent of rapport with patients Empathy : skills that help clinicians reflect concern for the patient's condition Education : skills needed for discovering and devel oping the patient's u nderstanding of his condition Enlistment : skills that help in motivat ing and changing behavior Two important components of partnering for recove ry and health are the development of natural supports and assuring cultural competence in treatment planning and implementation. Successful services engage and empower people with plans that are appropriate to their needs, maximize the benefits derived from use of cu lturally appropriate strategies and supports and thus reduce under- utilization of services that puts the people at -risk of placement in more restrictive settings, including incarceration. Focusing on person-centered goals that are culturally relevant empowers individuals to engage in services and maintain that enga gement, extending the time they can live in a community setting Culturally competent services are sensitive to th e person's cultural identity, available in the person's primary language and use the natural supports provided by th e person's culture and community Goal setting and planning processes are cultu rally sensitive and build on an individual's context. Plans incorporate culturally relevant strategies, including alternative therapies and the use of families and extended families to provide natural supports for persons served. Service plans reflect and respect the spiritual ity, healing traditions and healers of each individual. The use of these culturally relevant strategi es also builds commitment to treatment and indivi dual service plans 4. Ensure the Provision of Quality, Evidence-Based Physical and Mental Health Care by Provider Agencies and Clinicians a. Utilize the system transformation recommendations from the New Freedom Commission, Institute of Medicine and SAMHSA to achieve a more person-centered mental health system. Specifically, implement the following selected recommendations, as identified in the IOM report, and modified to address the morbidity and mortality issues. Direct care providers should: Diet, Nutrition and Eating Right Support individual decision making and treatment preferences (regarding physi cal health as well as mental health, giving information to make healthy choices, such as weight implications of psychotropic drugs, education about the effects of smoking, obesity and lack of exercise) Use illness self-management practices (expand opportunities for individuals to practice and develop decision making skills in rega rd to physical as well as mental health) Barriers Not responsible for menu / meal planning / preparation Lack of knowledge and skills on cooking Time to prepare Cost Diet and Nutrition Interventions Communal meals at clubhouses and residential settings, where persons served design and prepare meals Other skill building methods Have effective linkages with community resources (including access to health care and engage families and other collatera l service providers in understanding how to support individuals in maintaining their healthy choices) Screen for co-morbid conditions (obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure) Routinely assess treatment outcomes (physical as well as mental health) Routinely share clinical information with other providers (primary and specia lty health care providers as well as mental health providers) Physical Activity Barriers Lack of interest Lack of role models Inability to overcome sedation effects of medications Lack of financing to cover participation Lack of support John Allen Jr. Physical Activity Interventions Create MOUs with Parks and Recreation agencies Point-of-decision prompts Family-based social support Social support interventions Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 46 Practice evidence-based care coordination (coordinate care of the whole person). (See Appendix F for the full summary of IOM recommendations for all stakeholder groups.) Individually-adapted health behavior change programs Creation of or enhanced access to places for physical activity Adapted from Task Force on Community Preventive Services, National Library of Medicine b. Implement standards of care for prevention, screening and treatment in the context of better access to health care. First-line therapies for all lipid and nonlipid risk factors associated with the metabolic syndrome are weight reduction and increased physical activity, which will effectively reduce all of these risk factors...Beyond the underlying risk factors, therapies directed against the lipid and nonlipid risk factors of the metabolic syndrome will reduce CHD risk. These include treatment of hypertension, use of aspirin in patients with C HD...and treatment of elev ated triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol... liii Management of the metabolic s yndrome in the general population has a two-fold objective: Reduce underlying causes (i.e., obes ity and physical inactivity) Treat associated nonlipid and lipid risk factors Using the monitoring tools recommended here, assu re consistent diabetes screening for all individuals actively being served by the public mental health system. Assure priority for those receiving second generation antip sychotic medications and/or high risk ethnic populations. The mental health system should adopt the U.S. Public Health Service guidelines for prevention and intervention in regard to modifiable risk factors\u2014assuring at least the same standard of care as that available to the general population. Use guidelines for prevention and intervention to assure there is consistent monitoring of individuals receiving psychotropic medicati ons as a part of medication evaluation and follow up servic es in outpatient mental health settings as well as inpatient settings. Diagnosis of Diabetes, Who Should be Screened? All adults 45 y, and, if normal, at 3-year intervals Younger age or more frequently for those at higher risk: --Obese: 20% above ideal body weight --First-degree relative with diabetes --High-risk ethnic group --Delivered baby >9 lb, or history of gestational diabetes Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 47 Whenever possible, avoid use of medications that are more strongly associated with conditions such as obesity, diabetes and hyperlipidemia Hypertensive: BP 140/90 mm Hg Dyslipidemia: HDL 35 mg/dL and/or triglycerides 250 mg/dL Reduce polypharmacy Prescribers should be accountable for screening to assure adequate treatment of medical risk factors such as metabolic syndrome and its consequences to the same extent that they are for Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms and Tardive Dyskinesia Previous IFG or IGT ADA. Diabetes Care. 2004;27 (suppl 1):S11-S14 Adopt consistent use of a metabolic screen ing and monitoring tool (see Appendix H) Numerous studies document that phy sician prescribing practices fr equently deviate from clinical guidelines, with potentially signi ficant implications for quality of care. At the same time, spending on prescriptions has soared. New York State has developed a he alth information tool designed to support decision making by clinicia ns and improve the quality of medication prescribing practices in their public mental health system. Th e Web-based clinical decision support system uses state administrative databases to provide information at the point of care. Use of this tool in the state hospitals has resu lted in a 60% decrease in the number of persons prescribed three or more antipsychotics during 2005.liv For additional information on the topic, the NASMHPD Medical Directors Technical Report on Polypharmacy is available on the website.lv What are the basic standards of diabetes care? lvi A1C every 3-6 months: Target <7% (or 6.5%) Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) Regular weight and blood pressure monitoring Lipid profile yearly Urinary microalbumin screen yearly Dilated eye examination yearly Foot examination yearly Vascular prophylaxis Smoking cessation Regular medical follow-up Treating Type 2 Diabetes in people with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorders: lvii Underlying pathophysiology is probably the same as in people without psychi atric illness Obesity worsens insulin resistance Significant impact of hyperglycemia and macrovascular risk Lifestyle components impact severity Uncomplicated Monitoring Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 48 Changing lifestyle impact is usually more difficult than in general population Fasting Plasma Glucose Lipids Pharmacologic treatments are important Weight/ Body Mass Index Signs and symptoms of diabetes Since damage from diabetes begins before the diagnosis there should be substantial investment in primary prevention activities as well as screening. Insulin resistance, in which the normal actions of insulin are impaired, is closely linked to developing metabolic syndrome which includes hypert ension, high cholesterol, increased blood clotting and eventually insulin dependent diabetes. Blood pressure Indications and Methods for Intensifying Monitoring \u00cf Glucose Consult/consider referral SGA (UK exception) \u00cf Weight/ Body Mass Index SGA For the general population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion observed: Weight management plan \u00cf Glucose monitoring \u00cf Lipids SGA Effective interventions that address personal health practices are likely to lead to substantial reductions in the incidence and severity of the leading causes of diseases and disability in the U.S. Consult + Family History Intensify monitoring Primary prevention as it relates to such risk factors as smoking, physical inactivit y, poor nutrition, alcohol and other drug abuse, and inadequate attention to safety precautions holds greater promise for improving overall health than many secondary preventive measures such as routine screening for early disease. + Medical history (CV disease, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet) Intensify monitoring Therefore, clinician counseling that leads to im proved personal health practices may be more valuable to patients than conventional clinic al activities, such as diagnostic testing. c. Improve comprehensive health care evaluations. Current approaches to \"comprehensive evaluation\" lack: important clinical details; important clinical assessment, diagnostic and treatment prompts and reminders; and standardized approaches. They are often multidisciplinary, but not interdisciplinary and therefore often redundant. The conceptual standards for tr uly comprehensive evaluations include: Has to be timely. Has to have uniform initiation and follow-up criteria regardless of time or setting. Has to cover all the important clinical areas: functional and behavioral declines, medical, psychiatric and iatrogenic conditions, and ps ychosocial and environmental stressors. Within each clinical area, has to rule out important clinical details and conditions. Has to structure and guide the clinical team through the assessment, formulation, diagnostic, and treatment stages of the evaluation so that no clinical details identified in any stage are forgotten. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 49 Has to be interdisciplinary and adaptable to all types of settings and clinical teams. Allows flexibility in narrative-based assessments at any level: network, facility, unit or service. Has to be user friendly to all types of health care disciplines. Has to be efficient and streamlined from start to finish (report generation). Has to be seamless from one point of care to the next with all the important historical clinical information from the most recent comprehens ive evaluation being forwarded automatically. Network-connected and secure with only PCs and a Server (e ither site-based or hosted). All inputted or accessed clinical data is automati cally linked to the specific assessor or reader for total compliance with medical-legal and HIPAA notification regulations. All inputted clinical data is se tup to be reviewed and then e ither edited or approved via the clinical supervisor before it becomes medical record. Does not require any other form of electronic health record (HER) to completely function. Can exchange clinical information with other types of EHR to ensure the most accurate and up to date information being used duri ng the comprehensive evaluation process. lviii d. Assure that all initiatives to address morbidity and mo rtality have concrete goals, timeframes and specific steps. Gather perfor mance measurement data and use to manage overall system performance. 5. Implement Care Coordination Models a. Assure that there is a specific practitioner in the MH system who is identified as the responsible party for each person's medical health care needs being addressed and who assures coordination all services . Assure health status assessment a nd planning are a part of treatm ent planning and goal setting for every person with SMI, throughout the system. E. Persons Served / Families / Communities The persons we serve, their families and commun ities are necessary partners in this change process. We recommend three major areas of focus: PERSONS SERVED / FAMILY / COMMUNITY RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Encourage the persons we serve, families an d communities to develop a consumer-driven vision of integrated care. 2. Encourage advocacy, education and successful par tnerships to achieve integrated physical and behavioral health care. 3. Pursue individualized person centered ca re that is recovery and wellness focused. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 50 1. Encourage the Persons We Serve, Families and Commun ities to Develop a Vision of Integrated Care. a. Share information so that the mental health community and others become more aware of the co-morbid physical health risks and integrated care approaches. In the public mental health system the increased risks of excess mortality for persons with SMI are not often directly addressed. Although Recovery documen ts such as the SAMSHA National Consensus Statement on Recovery include wellne ss, holistic and healthcare treatment, the findings and recommendations in this report on mo rbidity and mortality regarding 25 years of potential life lost beg for a more directed approac h. Care should be indi vidual and family driven and we encourage the people we serve and their families to address the risks and integrated care approaches described in this report w ith a vision of integrated care. 2. Encourage Advocacy, Education and Successful Partnerships to Achieve Integrated Physical an d Behavioral Health Care. a. Encourage integrated physical and behavioral health care as a high priority similar to employment, housing and staying out of the criminal justice system. Grassroots advocacy will be necessary for succe ssful national, state and community campaigns to achieve quality and overcome the barriers to fragmented a nd separated mental health and physical health care systems. The priority for integrated physical and behavioral health care should be articulated as strongly as other prior ities such as employment, housing and staying out of the criminal justice system. Integrated care may help to re duce the stigma associated with a separated mental health care system. A clear an d well articulated vision, education and advocacy approach can guide major change. 3. Pursue Individualized Person Ce ntered Care that is Recovery and Wellness Focused. a. Support individualized partnerships, between the person served and the care provider, for integrated behavioral an d physical health care. Individualized and Person-centered care is one of the 10 Fundamental Components of Recovery in the SAMSHA National Consensus Statement on R ecovery. Person Centered Care is one of the six Quality Chasm aims. It is defined as \"care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, a nd values and ensuring that patie nt values guide all clinical decisions.\" The core values include: Respect for patients' values, preferences, and expressed needs Coordination and integration of care Information and communication Education Physical comfort Emotional support Involvement of family and friends Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 51 It is the person who makes the important choices th at affect his or her health and well being, and indeed it is the person who is in control and experiences the cons equences of his or her choices. Implementation of the person centered care model for persons with diabetes is described in Better Diabetes Care http://www.betterdiabetescare.ni h.gov/WHATpatientcenteredcare.htm . People with diabetes who are partners in their care are experiencing improved diabetes outcomes. People with SMI who partner with cl inical teams and focus on wellness and recovery and integrated physical and behavioral healthcare are likely to e xperience recovery with longer lives and improved general health. Individuals are encouraged to: Take an active role in care and trea tment in partnership with providers Create and take advantage of p eer and family support networks Surround themselves with positiv e individuals who support change efforts. This may include helping family and friends receive education so that they may be more supportive of recovery and healthy lifestyle changes Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 52 Endnotes i Singer, P.W., Miller, L.H.

New Freedom Commission: Excerp ts Related to Morbidity and Mortality Goal 1: Americans Understand that Mental Health Is Essential to Overall Health. Goal 1.2 Address mental health with th e same urgency as physical health. Understanding that mental health is essential to overall health is fundamental for establishing a health system that treats mental illnesses with the same urgency as it treats physical illnesses. Mental disorders frequently co-exi st with other medical disorders Depression increases the risk of dying from heart disease by as much as three-fold People with both diabetes and Depression have a gr eater likelihood of ex periencing a greater number of diabetes complications Examine the impact of mental health and mental illnesses on physical illnesses and health New studies should focus on innovative and effec tive ways to enhance the balance between mental and physical health Better coordination is needed between Mental Health Care and Primary Health Care Improving services for individuals with mental illnesses requires paying close attention to how mental health care and ge neral medical care interact While mental health and physical health are clearly connected, a chasm exists between the mental health care and general health care systems Goal 2: Mental Health Care Is Consumer and Family Driven Giving consumers the ability to participate fully in their communities will require a few essentials: Access to health care Goal 4: Screening, Assessment, an d Referral Are Common Practice Specialty mental health providers often have difficulty providing adequate medical care to consumers with co-existing mental and physical illnesses Individuals with serious mental illnesses, ... have high leve ls of non-psychiatric medical illnesses and excess medical mortality, this is also a troubling situation Goal 5: Excellent Mental Health Care Is Delivered and Research Is Accelerated All DSM-IV diagnostic crit eria have an exclusion for \"can be attributed to a general medical condition\" Excellent mental health dia gnosis is not possible without screening for physical illness The Commission recommends that Medicare, Medica id, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other Federal and State-s ponsored health insurance programs and private insurers identify and consider payment for core comp onents of evidence-based collaborative care, including: \u0083 Case management, \u0083 Disease management, \u0083 Supervision of case managers, and \u0083 Consultations to primary care providers by qualif ied mental health specialists that do not involve face-to-face cont act with clients. Goal 6: Goal 6.2 Develop and implement integrated elec tronic health record and personal health information systems. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 62 C. Substance Abuse and Mental Heal th Services Administration's (SAMHSA) National Consensus Statement on Recovery The 10 Fundamental Components of Recovery Self-Direction: Consumers lead, control, exercise choice over, and determine their own path of recovery by optimizing autonomy, independence, and control of resources to achieve a self-determined life. By definition, the reco very process must be self-directed by the individual, who defines his or her own lif e goals and designs a unique path towards those goals. Individualized and Person-Centered: There are multiple pathways to recovery based on an individual's unique strengths and resiliencies as well as his or her need s, preferences, experi ences (including past trauma), and cultural background in all of it s diverse representati ons. Individuals also identify recovery as being an ongoing journey and an end result as well as an overall paradigm for achieving wellness and optimal mental health. Empowerment: Consumers have the authority to choose from a range of opt ions and to participate in all decisions\u2014including the allocation of resources\u2014that will affect their lives, and are educated and supported in so doing. They have the ability to join with other consumers to collectively and effectively speak for themselves about their needs, wants, desires, and aspirations. Through em powerment, an individual gains control of his or her own destiny and influences the or ganizational and societal structures in his or her life. Holistic: Recovery encompasses an individual's w hole life, including mind, body, spirit, and community. Recovery embraces all aspects of life, including housing, employment, education, mental health and healthcare treatment and services, complementary and naturalistic services (such as recreational services, libraries, museums, etc.), addictions treatment, spirituality, creativity, social networks, community participation, and family supports as determined by the person. Families, providers, organizations, systems, communities, and so ciety play crucial roles in creating and maintaining meaningful opportunities for consumer access to these supports. Non-Linear: Recovery is not a step-by step process but one based on continual growth, occasional setbacks, and learning from experience. Rec overy begins with an initial stage of awareness in which a person recognizes th at positive change is possible. This awareness enables the consumer to move on to fully engage in the work of recovery. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 63 Strengths-Based: Recovery focuses on valuing and building on the multiple capacities, resiliencies, talents, coping abilities, and inherent worth of indi viduals. By building on these strengths, consumers leave stymied life ro les behind and engage in new life roles (e.g., partner, caregiver, fr iend, student, employee). The process of recovery moves forward through interaction w ith others in supportive, trust-based relationships. Peer Support: Mutual support\u2014including the sharing of experiential knowle dge and skills and social learning\u2014plays an invaluable role in recovery. Consumers encourage and engage other consumers in recovery and provide each other with a sense of belonging, supportive relationships, va lued roles, and community. Respect: Community, systems, and societal accepta nce and appreciation of consumers \u2014 including protecting their rights and eliminating discrimination and stigma\u2014are crucial in achieving recover y. Self-acceptance and regaining belief in one's self are particularly vital. Respect ensures the incl usion and full participation of consumers in all aspects of their lives. Responsibility: Consumers have a personal responsibility for their own self-care and journeys of recovery. Taking steps toward s their goals may require great courage. Consumers must strive to understand and give meaning to their experiences and identify coping strategies and healing processes to promote their own wellness. Hope: Recovery provides the essent ial and motivating message of a better future\u2014 that people can and do overcome the barriers and obstacles that confront them. Hope is internalized; but can be fostered by peer s, families, friends, providers, and others. Hope is the catalyst of the recovery process. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 64 D. Integrating Behavioral Health and Primary Ca re Services: Opportunities and Challenges for State Mental Health Authorities Executive Summary The National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) Medical Directors Council developed this eleventh tec hnical paper through a series of pre-meeting conference calls, review of materials and a work group summit of me dical directors and commissioners as well as research ers and other technical experts. The work group reviewed current literature, co nsulted with leading re searchers and provider organizations that are successfully implementing integration models for \"safety net\" populations, and shared examples of efforts underway at state and local levels. Th ere is ongoing research regarding the medical cost offsets that may accrue through provision of Behavioral Health (mental health and substance abuse) as well as Be havioral Medicine servi ces to the primary care population, including early screening for and delivery of Substance Abuse (SA) services in Primary Care (PC)\u2014thus, the report generally refere nces Behavioral Health (BH) services rather than solely Mental Health (MH) services. The discussion considered both population-base d and person-centered a pproaches to care. Recognizing that the emphasis and level of activ ity will vary from state to state, the report focuses separately on the need for overall system coordination, the needs of persons with serious mental illness, and needs of populations served in primary care. The report integrates two conceptual models th at assist in thinking about population-based and systemic responses. The first, The Four Quadrant Clinical Integration Model , is a population- based planning tool developed under the auspices of the National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare (NCCBH) . Each quadrant considers the Behavioral Health (SA and MH) and physical health risk and complexity of the population subset and sugg ests the major system elements that would be utilized to meet the needs of the individua ls within that subset of the population. The quadrants can be briefly described as: I. The population with low to moderate risk/compl exity for both behavioral and physical health issues. II. The population with high behavior al health risk/complexity a nd low to moderate physical health risk/complexity. III. The population with low to moderate behavior al health risk/complexity and high physical health risk/complexity. IV. The population with high risk and complexity in regard to both behavioral and physical health. Additionally, the report references The Care Model , which summarizes the basic elements for improving care in health systems at the commun ity, organization, practice and patient levels. The Care Model was developed by the Improving Chronic Illness Care Program to speed the Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 65 transformation of health care, from a system that is essentially reactive \u2014 responding mainly when a person is sick \u2014 to one that is proactive and focuse d on keeping a person as healthy as possible. The Council commissioned this report with attention to: 1. The new role of Community Health Centers in providing behavioral health services and the need for collaborative planning due to this new role; 2. The needs of the people served by stat e mental health authorities; and, 3. The evidence for integrating behavioral health services into primary care. Each of these are briefly discussed below, al ong with selected recommendations from the full technical report, which is organized into se gments on Overarching Focus: Overall System Coordination (Quadrants I, II, III and IV); Population Focus: Se rious Mental Illness/Substance Abuse (Quadrants II and IV); and Population Focus: Primary Care (Quadrants I and III). Each segment includes an overview and discussion of related research as well as detailed action recommendations. Footnotes can be found at the end of the full report. The New Role of Community Health Centers and The Need for Collaborative Planning The Health Resources and Services Administrati on (HRSA) Primary Care Integration Initiative is currently being implemented across the count ry in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), more broadly referred to as Community Health Centers (CHCs). Existing sites may apply for expansion grant fundi ng to add BH services. Additionally, all newly funded CHC sites must provide dental, mental health and substance abuse services. Grant applications must specify planned staffing, and if services are to be provided by contract, a copy of the contract. CHCs are making decisions abou t hiring their own BH st aff or contracting for BH services as they prepare their grant applications. As \"safety net\" providers, CHCs serve a broa der scope of patients th an just the Medicaid population. Many states focus their public mental health systems on the SMI Medicaid population, with minimal leve ls of support for non-SMI or uninsured populations\u2014 consequently, there isn't a good match of target populations between the two systems. The recent financing and development of beha vioral health services in CHCs was intended to address this gap. Attachment B provides more ex tensive background information on CHCs. Currently, there is no role for the State Mental H ealth Authority (SMHA) or the local system in the planning, distribution or coor dination of these additional CHC services. The implications for system-wide duplication and competition for the scarce resources of BH staff and funding, as well as the opportunity to improve consumer access to behavioral health and healthcare services, suggests that coordination is a priority at the national, state and local levels. The American Association of Community Psyc hiatrists has recommended that behavioral healthcare providers at the local level incorpor ate a systematic program for coordinating or integrating with primary care provider organi zations in their commun ities. Such a program would include, at a minimum: Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 66 Effective means of bi-directi onal communications with Primary Care Providers (PCPs); Determination of what information is most essential to share; and, Adoption of appropriate confiden tiality and consent protocols. The Overarching Focus: System Coordination (Quadrants I, II, III, and IV) segment of the report speaks to this set of issues and is grounded in the following principle: Increased integration of behavioral health and healthcare s ervices is a priority at the national, state, local and person levels. Good public policy will work to sustain, support and require integration of services between the two \"safety net\" systems of CHCs and SMHA providers with integration ranging from coordination of care to full integr ation of medical and behavioral services. Communication is the key to coordinating care for all populations. Future policy should acknowledge the importance of BH/PC integration and support the expectation of communication and coordination at the federal, st ate, local and person level. The communication and coordination gap exists at all levels, but will require federal leadership to change the current \"silo\" environment and addre ss cross-cutting issues. The New Freedom Commission recommends the development of a comprehensive state plan across all mental health activities. The guidelines for the comprehensive state plan and waiver submissions should include a requirement to address primary care integration issues: For persons with SMI, how will health issues be identified and addressed by providers of mental health services? For persons served in primary care, how is co ordination achieved at both the system level and the person level, es pecially in regard to HRSA funded sites? SMHA Directors, along with the Directors of Substance Abuse, Medicaid, and the Office of Primary Care/State Health Officer , should be convened in to a State Integration Team that meets regularly to achieve the following (see the full report for a complete listing of detailed recommendations): Adopt and disseminate a model HIPAA-compliant re lease of information form to be used at entry into mental health, substance abuse or healthcare services funded by the state. Review the state Primary Care Strategic Plan prepared for HRSA regarding current and future distribution of CHCs. Review new CHC site and BH e xpansion applications to HRSA. Develop coordination of financing mechanisms and a shared interest in managing the pools of funding towards better outcomes. Assure that the state Medicaid Plan appropriately reflects all st rategies developed. Recommendations for fede ral entities include: Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 67 SAMHSA should amend its matrix to add primar y care integration to th e areas of top focus for the organization. SAMHSA and HRSA should work together on a site planning tool that intersects with other planning efforts and would be used in the Prim ary Care Association state strategic plans. This would include considera tion of SMHA providers as new FQHC site applicants and provision of technical assistance to them in areas where development of an applicant organization is needed. HRSA's Bureau of Health Professions and Bureau of Primary Health Care need to spell out a coordinated agenda in regard to workfor ce issues. HRSA and SAMHSA, along with the Department of Labor (DOL) should develop a master agenda in regard to meeting BH workforce needs, including the focused skills needed in PC settings. SAMHSA, HRSA and CMS should collaborate in policy and financing approaches to establish shared goals for BH /PC Integration and develop fi nancing methods that support implementation of the Care M odel in BH and PC settings. The National Associations (NASMHPD, NASADAD, NASMD, NACHC, and NCCBH) should develop a model Memorandum of Understanding for communication and coordination at the state and local level. The Needs of the People Served by State Mental Health Authorities Through the evolution of public mental health serv ices, people principally served by state mental hospitals were (and are) provided with health, dental and vision serv ices as well as mental health services. In the community, however , persons with serious mental illness (SMI) frequently have difficulty accessing health, dental and vision serv ices and often rely on emergency rooms (ERs) for their care, which burdens the ER system, resu lts in discontinuous care for the individuals, and may contribute to polypharmacy issues. Many of these individuals also have co-occurring SA disorders. When persons with SMI are able to access healthcare, their medical conditions are often missed; also, their healthcare concerns may not be taken seriously or treated appropriately 1 Research has demonstrated that persons with SMI have high levels of medical co-morbidity. More recently, research has described a relationship between some second generation antipsychotic medications and increased risk for diabetes, obesity and high cholesterol.2 In some states, as Medicaid or SMHA program eligibility has been re stricted, individuals formerly served by the SMHA have moved into CHCs to receive ongoing management of their psychotropic medications, as well as brief counse ling services in some sites. CHCs recognize their responsibilities in serv ing these individuals, but are concerned about being able to appropriately serve the needs of this population. The Population Focus: Serious Mental Illnes s/Substance Abuse (Quadrants II and IV) segment of the report speaks to this set of issues and is grounded in the following principle: 1 Druss, Rohrbaugh, Levinson, Rosenheck, Integrated medical care for patients with serious psychiatric illness ; Archives of General Psychiatry, 58:9; September 2001; pp 861-868 2 Consensus Development Conference on Anti psychotic Drugs and Obesity and Diabetes ; American Diabetes Association, American Psychi atric Association, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, North American Association for the Study of Obesity, Diabetes Care; 27:2, February 2004 Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 68 Physical healthcare is a core co mponent of basic services to persons with serious mental illness. Ensuring access to preventive healthcare and ongoing integration and management of medical care is a primary responsibility and mission of mental health authorities. Recommendations for SMHAs include: Develop a partnership between the SMHA and the State Medica id Agency (SMA) regarding opportunities to better manage re sources and assure the best clinical outcomes for the populations in Quadrants II and IV. Develop a population-based plan for the healthca re needs of persons with SMI. This should include a set of preventive assessment standa rds and guidelines for healthcare monitoring. Assign the same SMHA priority to a stable primary care home as to stable housing and medication adherence. Sponsor training for PCPs in treating persons with SMI for medical conditions, including recognition and appropriate treatment of presenting healthcare concerns. Support the creation of parallel service integr ation models for persons with developmental disabilities and pilot/re search these models. There will always be a need for specialty BH services. The SAMHSA specialty BH Evidence- freque office-based, but community-based; to assure fidelity, the EBP should be delivered by an individual with specific training, skills and knowledge. Recommendations for delivery system improvements include: Adopt the Care Model for organizing and tracking BH services. Demons trate the ability of the SMHA providers to deliver outcomes comparable to those being delivered by CHCs for healthcare concerns. Assure that assessment of healthcare status is an ongoing component of BH services and that there is a high level of communicati on between BH providers and PCPs. Recognize that, for the population in Quadrant IV , the BH/PCP/specialist team is the true \"medical home\" that needs to be developed, based on person-centere d and individualized planning and specifically identified respons ibilities for each member of the team. Clarify the role of local mental health authoritie s in provision of a crisis response system that is responsive to all components of the system, including the Quadrant IV population. Support the use of BH case managers to accompany consumers to primary care visits, with the consent of the cons umer, to assist in medical advocac y and incorporation of self-care recommendations into ongoing wellness planning. Consider opportunities for SMHA provide r and CHC co-location or merger. The Evidence for Integrating Behavior al Health Services into Primary Care Many integration initiatives and research repor ts have focused on depression because of the broad scope of the problem (more than 19 mill ion Americans each year are diagnosed and treated for some type of depression) and th e degree to which it is under-recognized and under- treated in primary care se ttings (30-40% not identified and a bout 10% only on Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 69 benzodiazepines3). The cost of depressi on in healthcare and the workforce has been well documented\u2014among the five conditions (mood disord ers, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and asthma) that account for 49% of total healthcare costs and 42% of illness-related lost wages, mood disorders rank third in healthcare costs, fi rst in work loss costs and second in total costs.4 As discussed in detail in the full report, there is a robust body of research about the incidence of depression in the population seekin g healthcare services and the interventi ons that result in improved healthcare outcomes. The Population Focus: Primary Care (Quadrants I and III) segment of the report speaks to this set of issues and is grounde d in the following principle: Behavioral health care is a core component of essential services to persons seeking primary healthcare. Ensuring access to preventive, ongoing, and appropri ate behavioral health service is a primary responsibility and mission of general healthcare providers. The Council recognizes that a focus on Quadrants I and III will be dependent on the context and system development in each state. While the re commendations in the other two focus segments (System Coordination, Serious Ment al Illness) are intended fo r all SMHAs, this segment in intended for use by SMHAs that are additionally planning for the population served in primary care. Recommendations for SMHAs include: Use the State Team and State Plan recommende d in System Coordina tion as the venue for creating a state level framework to provi de guidance for local partnerships. Develop approaches in which some financin g comes from the SMHA and some from the healthcare system. Develop a response to HRSA PIN 2004-05 (see Attachment B) that explores the funding options from both budget streams, assuming suffi cient evidence of cost effectiveness is established. Work with the Medicaid agency to implement and utilize appropriate CPT codes for provision of services (e.g., adoption of the 96150-96155 CPT codes [see Attachment B] or use of E&M codes as appropriate) and describe the clinical professional status and skill sets required for billing. Assure that the models adopted for reimbursement are consistent with the research base (e.g., algorithms, registry tracking, coll aborative, and stepped care). Recommendations for SMHA providers and CHCs wo rking together to meet the needs of the \"safety net\" populations include: Clarify the mission and roles between the organizations and develop specific transfer of care protocols. Explore opportunities to \"rent\" or place SMHA provider staff in CHCs (see Attachment C). 3 Ford, D. M.D.,M.P.H., Decision Support/Depression .

The Council is aware that considerable work is necessary to heal the long-standing \"mind-body split\". We hope that this report and its recomm endations provide support and direction for those working on the healing process. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 71 E. The Quality Chasm's Ten Rule s to Guide the Redesign of Health Care 1. Care based on continuous healing relationships . Patients should receive care whenever they need it and in many forms, not ju st face-to-face visits. This rule implies that the health care system should be responsive at all times (24 hours a day, every day) and that access to care should be provided over the Internet, by telephone, and by other means in addition to face-to- face visits. 2. Customization based on patient needs and values . The system of care should be designed to meet the most common types of needs, but have the capability to respond to individual patient choices and preferences. 3. The patient as the source of control . Patients should be given the necessary information and the opportunity to exerci se the degree of control they choo se over health care decisions that affect them. The health system should be ab le to accommodate differences in patient preferences and encourage shared decision making. 4. Shared knowledge and the free flow of information . Patients should have unfettered access to their own medical information an d to clinical knowledge. Clin icians and patients should communicate effectively and share information. 5. Evidence-based decision making . Patients should receive care based on the best available scientific knowledge. Care should not vary illogically from clinician to clinician or from place to place. 6. Safety as a system property . Patients should be safe from injury caused by the care system. Reducing risk and ensuring safety require greater attention to systems that help prevent and mitigate errors. 7. The need for transparency . The health care system should make information available to patients and their families that allows them to make informed decisions when selecting a health plan, hospital, or clinical practice, or choosing among alternat ive treatments. This should include information describing the syst em's performance on safety, evidence-based practice, and patient satisfaction. 8. Anticipation of needs . The health system should anticipate patient needs, rather than simply reacting to events. 9. Continuous decrease in waste . The health system should not wa ste resources or patient time. 10. Cooperation among clinicians . Clinicians and institutions should actively collaborate and communicate to ensure an appropriate exchange of information and coordination of care.

Institute of Medicine, Re commendations for Stakeholders Improving the quality of health care for mental and substance-use conditions: Direct care supporters should: Support consumer decision-making and treatment preferences Use illness self-management practices Have effective linkages with community resources When coercion unavoidable, make the process transparent Screen for co-morbid conditions Routinely assess treatment outcomes Routinely share clinical information with other providers Practice evidence-based care coordination Be involved in designing the National H ealth Information Infrastructure (NHII) Provider organizations such as clinics, hosp itals, and local mental he alth centers, should: Have policies to enable and support all actions required of clinicians Involve patients / families in design, administration and delivery of services If serving a high-risk population (e.g. child welfare, criminal and juvenile justice) screen all entrants for M/SU problems Involve leadership and staff in developing the National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) Health plans and purchasers should: Pay for peer support and illness self-management programs that meet standards for consumers with chronic M/SU illnesses Use and provide consumers with comparative info on the quality of M/SU services to select providers Remove payment, service exclusion, benefit lim its and other coverage barriers to accessing effective screening, treatment and coordination Support development of a quality measur ement and reporting infrastructure Require all contracting organizations to appropriately share patient information Provide incentives for the use of electronic health records and other information technology methods Use tools to reduce adverse risk sele ction of M/SU treatment consumers Use measures of quality and coordination of care in purchasing and oversight State and local policy-makers should: Make coercion policies transparent, use inform ation on the comparative quality of providers and evidence-based treatment, and offer consumers choice Revise laws and other policies that ob struct communication between providers Create high-level mechanisms to improve collaboration and coordination across agencies Use purchasing practices that provide incentives for the use of electronic health records and other IT Enact parity for coverage of M/SU treatment Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 73 Reorient state procurement processes toward quality and reduce the emphasis on grant-based financing mechanisms Agencies of the Federal gover nment (DHHS and SMHSA) should: Identify evidence-based practices Develop procedure codes for administrative data sets Use evidence-based approaches to dissemination and promote uptake of evidence-based practices Assure use of general health care opini on leaders (e.g. CDC, AHRQ) in dissemination Fulfill essential quality measurement and reporting functions Provide leadership in qual ity improvement activities Improve coordination among federal agencies Revise laws, rules, other policies that obstr uct sharing of information across providers Fund demonstrations to transition to evidence-based care coordination Ensure the emerging NHII a ddresses M/SU health care Authorize and fund an ongoing Council on the Mental and S ubstance-Use Health Care Workforce similar to the Council on Gr aduate Medical Education (Congress) Support M/SU faculty leaders in health profession schools Provide leadership, development support and f unding for R&D on QI in M/SU health care Accrediting organizations for M/SU provide rs should adopt and apply standards requiring: Patient-centered decision-making throughout care Involvement of consumers in design, admi nistration, and delivery of services Effective formal linkages with community resources Use of evidence-based approaches to coordina ting mental, substance-us e and general health care Institutions of higher educa tion and those involved in ongoing education and training the existing workforce should: Increase interdisciplinary teaching and learning to facilitate core competencies across disciplines Facilitate the work of the C ouncil on the Mental and Substan ce-Use Health Care Workforce Funders of research should support : Development and refinement of screening, diag nostic, and monitoring instruments to assess response to treatment A set of M/SU \"vital signs\": a brief set of indicators - for patient screening, early identification of problems and illnesses, and for repeated use to monitor symptoms and functional status Research approaches that address treatment e ffectiveness and quality improvement in usual settings of care Research designs, in addition to randomized controlled trials that involve partnerships between researchers and stakeholders, and create a \"critical mass\" of interdisciplinary research partnerships involvi ng the usual settings of care Daniels, Allen. Adams, Neal. From Study to Action: A Strategic Plan for Transformation of Mental Health Care. February 2006 Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 74 G. Relationship Centered Interviewing Engagement Clinicians may believe that there is not enough time to let a patient tell his or her story, but research has shown that most patients will continue to speak without interruption for only two to three minutes. To \"engage\" a patient, a clinician must establish ra pport by joining the patient during the opening minutes of the encounter. The first minutes form strong initial impressions. Communicate warmth by the introduction; be curious about the patient as a pe rson rather than a medical problem. Listen to the language of the patient and adapt to that language. Invite the patient to tell the story of the illness. Find out all the complaints and the patient's goals for the visit and agree on an agenda. Empathy Empathy begins when the clinician expresses unders tanding of the feelings, values, and experiences of the patient. Fortunately, empathy is not necessar ily intrinsic to personality: Empathetic responses can be learned. It is important to create a warm setting. Consider using nonverbal language. Do not write and listen at the same time. When listening, look at the patient. Don't permit physical barriers -- typically the chart or desk -- to come between you and the patient. Invite the patient to tell you what he is feeling or thinking. Be curious about the experience of the patient as a person. Say, \"That must be scary,\" or \"How do you feel about that?\" Education Preventive medicine and health promotion ar e critical to delivery of high quality care. Education is not simply giving information, but requires understanding the patient's cognitive, emotional, and value perspectives. The clinician must discover what the patient knows and how the patient is thinking and f eeling about whatever knowledge he or she possesses. Clinicians should assess the patient's understandi ng by asking questions and imagining their questions: What has happened to me? Why has it ha ppened to me? What is going to happen to me? Supplement oral patient education with wr itten notes and patient information handouts. Enlistment Enlistment occurs when patients become partners in their own health care. Empowering and motivating them increases the likelihood that they will adhere to treatment and thus the likelihood of greater patient satisfaction. This is good for the h ealth plan too, because office visits are actually reduced, quality and efficiency of care are improved, and ultimately the patient's loyalty to the plan and doctor is increased. There are two important steps in enlistment: agreeing on diagnosis, and agreeing on a treatment plan. Because most patients make a self-diagnosis, it is extremely helpful to elicit and acknowledge it early in the interview. Discuss any discrepancies betw een your conclusions and those of the patient .

Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 82 J. Seven Steps To Building Th e Comprehensive Healthcare Evaluation Standard By Steven Eisenstein MD Step 1: Defining the Decline For Targeting Functional and Behavioral Concerns Especially Those of High-Risk Are the targeted declines divided into functional and behavioral components? Have potentially dangerous declines (functiona l and/or behavioral) been identified and described as being high-risk warranting a timely comprehensive ev aluation and routine immediate follow-ups until stablilized? Is each behavioral and/or functional target ed decline well defined using observable and measurable descriptors? Does each behaviorally targeted decline have an approximate frequency of occurrence from which to base improvement or worsening during the treatment phase? Have precipitating circumstances involving patte rns of people, place/situation, and time related to each targeted decline been ruled out and if pertinent, been identified? Does each targeted decline have an identified optimal baseline? Does each targeted decline have a date of onset? Are routine potentially high-risk functional and/ or behavioral concerns, such as Falls, Fall Risk, and Elopement Risk, automatically ruled-out every time there is a significant decline in function and/or behavior? Step 2: Search The S.I.G.N.S. For comprehensive identification of all potential clinical healthcare concerns defined as the SIGNS assessment Sickness Concerns Has there been a documented comprehensive medi cal rule out of all the chronic and acute temporary medical problems currently active? Is there a complete list of all the patient's chronic medical problems? ICD-9 Codes included? Dates of Onset? Date Last Active if recurrent? Is there a list of chronic medical problems that routinely present with typical behavioral/functional decline? Is there a comprehensive rule out of important ROS and common physical findings? Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 83 Is there a structured rule out pr ocess for acute delirium findings? Is there a structured rule out process for a ll types of EPS findings, with each EPS syndrome being specifically defi ned and easily understood? Have the appropriate laboratory and diagnostic studies been ordered to comprehensively rule out medical causes of decline and any importa nt normal and abnormal results identified? Is there a list of standing non-medication medical orders for monitoring and treating significant medical conditions and/or iatrogenic concerns? Are the positive reported symptoms, laboratory, diagnostic, and physical findings identified during the medical work up appropriately matche d to acute medical conditions, and if not, are they properly identified as unmatched- an indicator for further medical work-up? Do the significant acute medical conditions have an approx imate date of acute onset? Does every significant medical/surgical/traumatic condition identified, have the appropriate status of acute, active, or inactiv e at the time of acute decline? Does every significant medical condition have an ongoing historical and ch ronological list of medications and other treatments? Does each me dication used for a specific medical condition have its own dosage history as well? Iatrogenic Concerns Is there a list of previous Allergies and/or Side Effects that is easily accessible and easy to update? If an Allergy is noted, is the medication appropriately named as an allergy and its allergic reaction specifically described? If any other adverse drug reactio n is noted, is/are the medicati ons appropriately named, their daily dosages noted and their side effects specifically described? Are cumulative side effect s distinguished from single medication side effects and appropriately described? Are common potential multiple medication side effects adequately ruled out including orthostasis/hypotension, over-sedatio n and anticholinergic toxicity? Is there a complete list of medical medica tions, psychotropic medications, and over the counter substances? Are all medications/OTCs associated to known specific medical or psyc hiatric conditions and if not, properly id entified as such? Are all medication changes over the last 2 months ruled out and identified as such? Are all medication refusals ove r the last seven days noted? Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 84 Are all of the patient's medications assessed for drug-drug interactio ns, drug-disease, drug- food and drug-lab concerns? Are all of the patient's medications with associated serum level monitoring assessed for their blood serum levels since the date of onset of the acu te decline and if not, id entified as a need to do so? Are the reported symptoms, physical findings, a nd associated medical conditions determined under medical rule-out, automatically evaluated and ruled out as poten tial medication adverse effects? Are common interactive substances such as to bacco, caffeine, alcohol, and grapefruit juice ruled out, and if present check ed for any potential drug-drug in teractions with the patient's medications and for any association to the patient's clinical symptoms and findings? Is there a specific list of illegal and potentially -abused substances to be ruled out, and if taken, are they adequately assessed for route, frequency, and amount used? Global Functional Concerns: Is there an optimal baseline functioning leve l established for important IADLs and ADLs? In addition to targeted functiona l declines identified in Step 1, are all other less emergent but significant functional declines id entified and objectively measured for monitoring and potential treatment purposes? Nuance Stressors: For comprehensive rule out and identification of environmental and treatment stressors Is there a comprehensive psychosocial assessment that travels with the patient from point of care to point of care that only n eeds to be updated and not redone so that important psychosocial and environmental strengths and st ressors can be easily identified? Is there an important list of negative life experiences that can prompt the assessor for significant stressors? Is there an important list of factors that eff ect physical comfort, that are often overlooked if not prompted, such as for concerns related to posture, sleeping, lighti ng, temperature, proper clothes fitting, assistive devices, etc.? Is there a way for all treatment team member s to identify the current status of routine preventative and treatment interventions to de termine if they are negatively or positively effecting behavioral and functional declin es during the time of acute decline? Symptoms of Cognition, Mood, and Psychosis Is there a comprehensive listing of serial ment al status exams so that differences between them would trigger clinical diagnostic discussions? Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 85 Has delirium been ruled out at least twice by separate clinicians? Is there a complete list of easily understood descriptors for each psychiatric symptom group, to help those with less traini ng with psychiatric concerns, st ill do an adequate psychiatric assessment? Is there a list of prior psychiatric diagnoses w ith their associated sy mptoms and any related prior hospitalizations or positive/negative treatment responses? Step 3: Connecting the SIGNS to the Decline Formulation Step Is there an organized presentation of all th e targeted functional a nd behavioral declines including their dates of onset, juxtaposed to a ll the other acute clinical concerns identified during the comprehensive assessment process including thei r dates of onset, to facilitate an accurate and comprehensive determination of al l contributory factors and aide in diagnostic formulation? Step 4: Psychiatric Diagnoses in 3-D Was there an easily accessible DSM-IV TR manual available du ring the psychiatric diagnosis process? Is there a fool-proof structure to the psychi atric diagnosis process to ensure medical and substance-related psychiatric diso rders first and foremost (dimension 1) and only if determined to be non-existent, can the assessor go on and dete rmine a 'strictly' psychiatric disorder either previously diagnosed (dimension 2) or entirely new (dimension 3)? Is there a detailed listing of psychiatric symptoms already linked with potentially associated acute substances/medications and medical conditions, done during the comprehensive assessment, to help with the proper diagnosis of medical or substanc e-related psychiatric disorders (dimension 1)? Step 5: The Triple Care Plan Comprehensive care planning and treatment st ructure and processing for all identified clinical concerns i.e. Targeted Functional Declines, Targeted Behavioral Declines, and identified acute SIGNS concerns Is there a comprehensive list of the patient' s strengths, weaknesses, likes and dislikes, etc. available to help with the care planning process? Are important person, place, situation or time triggers of targeted behavioral declines highlighted for specific intervention? Is there a structured set up for comprehensive care planning that includes goals, objectives, all staff interventions, specific staff interventions , educational interventions, care plan orders, medication orders, lab/dx orders, etc. Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness 86 Is there a list of potential intervention temp lates for specific behavioral, psychiatric, functional, and medical conditions for treatment members to peruse for inclusion into the care plan? Is there a way for all treatment team members including patient and their authorized legal representatives to have access to the care pl an to review or to make intervention recommendations? Is there a way to formally monitor important high-risk targeted beha vioral or functional declines in a simple and valid manner? Was there a comprehensive review meeting dur ing the initial comprehensive evaluation and during required follow-ups to ensure proper updati ng of all the care plans until stabilization of all the high-risk conditions involved? Step 6: Level of Care Is there a structured process to look at all the identified healthcare concerns and prioritize them in order to determine the best and most a ppropriate level of care for the current clinical presentation? Step 7: Psychotr opic Management Are there safety processes built-in to the co mprehensive evaluation process that helps to ensure safe, appropriate use of psychotropic medications when warranted? For example, have all the medical, iatrogenic, and enviro nmental factors been adequately addressed before considering standing psychotropic changes? Ar e all, some or none of the acute psychiatric symptoms linked to targeted behavioral concerns , and if more that one type of psychiatric symptom group is linked, which one or ones are the most cont ributory to the behavioral concern? Is there a psychotropic medication history read ily available that can give the reason for starting, changes and rationale in dosa ging, and the stopping of each medication? Are evidenced-based psychotropic algorithms and guidelines available to the prescriber of psychotropics at the time of medicat ion selection and decision making? Overall Considerations Do you have quick and easy access to important, historical comprehensive clinical information both within and outside your facility that is pertinent to the acut e clinical presentation of the patient? Does your facility have a high-risk decline pr otocol in place to comprehensively address high- risk functional and/or behavi oral concerns until stabilized?
