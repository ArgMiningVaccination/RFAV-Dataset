Meditation can help you heal emotionally from the past through a process of \"emotional detoxing\". Emotions from past relationships, fearful events, etc. that you have stored away can be released with a daily meditation practice. In order to understand how you can emotionally detox with meditation, let's first look at the body and emotions from an energetic perspective. Everything in the universe is energy. Remember the formula E=mc2? Well this applies to the physical body as well as to the emotional and thought bodies. Some emotional and thoughts energies vibrate at higher frequencies then others. Thoughts or emotions that make you feel good such as happiness, joy, peace or gratitude vibrate at a higher frequency then thoughts that make you feel bad such as guilt, lack of self-worth, lack of confidence, or fear. Now let's look at the mind-body connection. Thoughts (conscious and subconscious) affect your emotions and your body. Whether these thoughts affect your emotions and/or body in a positive or non-positive way will depend on the frequency of the emotions. Higher frequency thoughts (thoughts that make you feel good) will produce a positive effect and the opposite is true of lower frequency thoughts. To put it in another way, thoughts that make you feel bad cause a release of stress hormones in your body. A consistent and frequent release of stress hormones, i.e. chronic stress, has detrimental impacts on your emotional health. Before we move on, do realize that most of the thoughts you are forming throughout the day are subconscious thoughts. Let's consider your subconscious thoughts as the \"autopilot\" thought processes occurring in your life. For most, especially those undergoing chronic stress, this autopilot is either regurgitating negative thoughts of the past or worrying about something in the future on a consistent basis. If these thoughts and thoughts of similar nature/vibration continue and continue for long periods, this emotion will get \"locked away\" in certain regions of the body. [As an example, let's say you have repeated subconscious negative thoughts of guilt or lack of self-worth. These thoughts will trigger an emotion and over time this emotion gets \"stored\" in your stomach because this is where you tend to hold your emotions. This is a feedback mechanism you have created of constricting your stomach either consciously or unconsciously every time you feel something you do not like. As a result, you hold tension in this area and disallow these emotions to be released. Now because you have \"stored this emotion\" in your stomach for many many years, every time you think a negative thought you instantly feel it in your stomach. This is a result of a heavy, dense accumulation of emotions in that area. ] Thank goodness for meditation. Meditation can help you to reverse this cycle. When you start to meditate, several things happen which allow you to \"shake open\" and release this stored energy. - You start to relax. When you start relax this area, you allow the natural release of this lower vibratory energy. - You remain more focused. When you can focus on what you are doing, you bring yourself into the present moment. A mind that is in the present moment and focused on what it is doing, is not worrying about the future or thinking about the past. - You learn to become aware of your thoughts and to easily release them. - Your mind starts to quiet. The constant mental chatter (conscious and subconscious) starts to decrease because you are training your mind to focus and release thoughts that do not serve you. The above concepts seem simple, yet the results are profound. A consistent daily meditation practice will allow you to emotionally detox and raise your vibration to that of an emotionally healthy person. You can release the old emotional baggage you have been carrying around for years and start feeling better now. Sometimes, when you start to meditate, you can release emotional energies faster then you can handle it. This can happen especially for stored emotions that are more \"dense\" then others. When you start to release emotions faster than you can adjust, this is known as a healing crisis.
