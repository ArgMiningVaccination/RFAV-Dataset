Homeopathic remedies are heavily diluted to the point where it can be mathematically shown that there is not a single molecule of the 'active' ingredient left in the pill. This means that even if the ingredients used in homeopathic remedies could have a medical effect they are absent from the final treatmet. Homeopathic drugs are exactly the same as a sugar tablet with a drop of water on them. Many homeopaths claim that water has 'memory', however this has never been demonstrated scientifically. In fact if water did have a memory it would mean that the vast majority of our scientific knowledge it wrong. There are many factors that may make homeopathic remedies 'appear' to work. Firstly you are likley to try a homeopathic remedy when the condition you are trying to treat is at its worst. This means that the condition will get better simply because diseases get better over time. You attribute this improvement to the homeopathy, but it is really down to the condition improving itself. Secondly homeopathy may appear to work because of the placebo effect. This effect arises when a medicine-free treatment, such as a sugar pill, is given to someone and their condition improves because they believe they have been given a actual medical treatment. This phenomenon is well researched and documented and is the reason why all drug trials test the drug against a placebo, to see if the effect of the drug is above that of the placebo. There are many other complex factors that give homeopathy the illusion of working. But remember that when homeopathy is tested in a rigorous scientific trial, the same trials used to test all 'conventional' drugs, they show no efficacy beyond the placebo effect. You may wonder why people are so concerned about homeopathy, when it appears to be harmless. The problem arises when homeopathy is used to \"treat\" serious conditions for which conventional, effective drugs already exist. There was a case recently of a couple who were jailed when their daughter died from severe eczema. They were found guilty of child abuse because rather than use conventional, effective drugs they used ineffective homoeopathy, and their daughter died. There are many other cases of people dying from treatable illness because they failed to use conventional medicine. This is why the people who produce and sell homeopathic 'remedies', in full knowledge that they don't work, are very dangerous. If you are interested in learning more about the placebo effect and why homeopathy appears to work I would recommend you read \"Bad "}
