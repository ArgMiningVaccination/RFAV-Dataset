She has been such an amazing help to me and I fully trust her and her opinions. On top of that - she opened a beautiful new location that makes me feel so calm and refreshed after leaving! I also have taken Lakeside Medicine's cooking/healthy eating zoom class/seminar and it was amazing!! Dr Axtell went through a PowerPoint on tons of healthy eating tips and then showed us how to cook 3 or 4 recipes. Along with that she answered everyone's questions throughout the time and sent the materials via email for later reference. I can't thank Dr. Axtell and Lakeside Medicine enough!! - 3/2/2023 I had high hopes coming here, but it has been a disappointing and frustrating road working with Doctor Meister. She lacks empathy for her patients, is not supportive or caring. Lacks in listening and understanding of patient and family history which led to my issues worsening due to being put on supplements I shouldn't have been on with my history. She wasn't thorough. I brought my husband with on a few appointments and she was very dismissive of him when he would add things that I was forgetting. My chronic stomach pain and other problems did not get better, even worsened. Sad and frustrating for the thousands I dished out. I've never felt so dismissed by a Doctor. If you are going to go here, see Dr Aponte or try one of the other Doctors{My husband has seen Dr Aponte and she really helped him with food allergies and thyroid problems. He has gotten so much better working with her, I appreciate what Dr Aponte has done for him.} - 5/7/2020 I can't recommend Lakeside enough! Dr. Axtell is so amazing and I can't say enough how much I appreciate her wisdom and guidance. She doesn't do band-aid fixes for problems, instead, she really gets to the root of the problem. She knows her research and is very quick. I have never felt so validated by a doctor. She's easy to get in touch with on a regular basis, she has consistently met my needs, and I really appreciate how well she gets to know her patients. Natural medicine can be costly because it isn't insurance covered, but the time Dr. Axtell spends on her patients is absolutely worth it if you can make it work. She has a long waitlist for new patients, so book in advance. - 10/4/2019 Dr. Axtell and Dr. Aponte are amazing practitioners! While currently the state of WI does not allow for the use of medicinal insurance their rate is worth every penny. Expect to put in the effort because addressing chronic health issues takes a lifestyle change. They do their best to collaborate with other medicinal professionals and also offer laboratory testing through affiliated medical labs. If you aren't getting the care you deserve from your MD, come here. Their medical training is on par with them- they just choose to work with natural approaches. Check out the resource tab on their website for awesome and informative blogs! - 12/29/2014First to Review Very disappointing. It was promising at the beginning - she asked me to fill out a 16 page comprehensive health questionnaire, and insisted I do it at least 24 hrs before the appointment, so she could review it. I thought, finally, after years of crapshoot HMO docs, a doctor who actually takes her time to review my history! Her website advertised initial appointment of 60-90 min (wow), for $260. Pricey, but with the promise of attentive and knowledgeable care, I was wiling to bite this bullet. At the time of the first visit, about 10 min into it, it became clear that Dr. Axtell did not look at the papers I rushed to fax her. May be, she forgot that I am vegetarian working hard on becoming vegan, because she kept suggesting I eat more meat for protein. An optimist in me plowed on. The promised 60-90 min initial appointment was actually 40 min, at the end of which I was loaded with hundreds of dollars with supplements that had little to do with the issue I came to see her for. 4 weeks later, at the next appointment, Dr. Axtell informed me that I am ... drum roll... gluten sensitive, and all of my problems are due to it. She recommended hundreds more in supplements, and gluten-free life style. Forever. She assured me that if I am gluten free, my GI issues will all but vanish. She reminded me to eat more meat. And she insisted to see me in 6 weeks, and every 6 weeks from then on, until I get better. Conversely, this appointment was not the promised 30 - 40 min, but 20, for $100. $350 / hour is a psychiatrist's rate. I am a big believer in homeopathy and naturopathic medicine. However, when one claims to be a naturopath, all you are guaranteed to get is a huge bill. Celiac disease is a real and serious problem, but this doctor has one answer, gluten is the devil, for all questions. Sarah may be an ok practitioner for someone new to alternative medicine, who is starting to learn about healthy way of living and eating. But for someone like me, who studied and practiced homeopathy and leads a healthy way of life, she has nothing to offer. - 2/18/2015 Seeing Dr. Axtell has been a breath of fresh air. After seeing multiple Dermatologists and being prescribed one thing after another to cover up issues, Dr. Axtell has worked to get to the root of the problem and solve it from the inside out. After seeing her for almost two years now, the results are showing and I can actually see and feel a difference. It has been a pleasure working with her as she listens, is respectful of my health concerns and sincerely cares for my improvement. I highly recommend Dr. Axtell, she provides great care the way it is truly meant to be given.
