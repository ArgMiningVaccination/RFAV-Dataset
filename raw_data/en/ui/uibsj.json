Too many individuals believe that chiropractic treatment is only useful for back pain. In fact, chiropractic treatment can be used to treat a wide variety of physical issues, including migraines and headaches, chronic pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, pain from injury or muscle strain, and a variety of other conditions. WHERE DOES CHIROPRACTIC STEM FROM? Cheir (hand) and praktos (done) are two Greek words that were combined to form the word \"chiropractic\" or \"done by hand.\" Daniel David Palmer, the founder of [chiropractic medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic), selected that particular term as his favorite. During a chiropractic adjustment in 1895, D.D. Palmer treated Harvey Lillard, who was largely deaf at the time. Harvey Lillard later stated that his hearing had improved as a result of the adjustment. Two years later, D.D. Palmer established the world's first chiropractic school, and in the century that has followed, chiropractic professionals have used spinal adjustments to help people prevent and cope with back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, muscle strain, headaches and migraines, and a variety of other physical ailments. Dr. Palmer's work continues to have an impact on millions of people today. WHAT KIND OF EDUCATION MUST A CHIROPRACTOR GET? To become a chiropractor, students must complete at least four years of training at a chiropractic institution, which is usually preceded by an undergraduate degree in the fundamental sciences or many years of experience in a prior related health care profession. When learning the appropriate diagnosis and treatment techniques to help heal your body and restore it to optimal functionality, students of chiropractic care must spend a minimum of 4,200 hours with their teacher and a minimum of 1,000 hours in fully supervised clinical training with an instructor.
