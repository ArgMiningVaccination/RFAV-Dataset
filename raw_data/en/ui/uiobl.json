TEXT BIRGIT FENZEL I n India, those who fall ill can choose between Western biomedicine and a vast array of indigenous healing methods. They can ease their pain with Ayurvedic oils, nasal douches or enemas, or try their luck with con- ventional homeopathic granules or naturopathic plant salves. They can also realign their body's unbalanced en- ergies with the help of a therapy pre- scribed by a Siddha doctor, involving vomiting, purging or hot compresses. Patients can also consult a Unani spe- cialist working according to the Greek four humor principles to restore the cor- rect balance of blood, phlegm, and black Photo: MPI for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity - Gabriele Alex and yellow bile. In particularly acute cas- es, specialists even offer services that stray into the realms of metaphysics. According to Gabriele Alex's obser- vations, whether a patient with a bro- ken leg consults a surgeon or relies on the exorcism skills of a spiritual heal- er very much depends on the pre- sumed cause of the illness, the dis- tance from the patient's home to the health services available and, above all, his or her socioeconomic status. \"It's basically the same as it is for us - we try to cure certain ailments using home remedies and visit the doctor only for more serious illnesses.\" > In India, people who fall ill can choose from a vast array of therapies, trusting the skills of a qualified doctor or a healer.FOCUS _India 1 | 11 MaxPlanckResearch 35Photo: MPI for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity - Gabriele AlexAnthropologist Vibha Joshi has carried out research into the flexibility with which many Indians combine elements from different religions with modern and traditional medicine to treat ill- nesses, based on her study of the Anga- mi in Northeast India. According to lo- cal custom, they mix Christian, animis- tic and other religious elements when treating illness. Unlike Gabriele Alex, who, as a member of Steven Vertovec's team, is concerned mainly with socio- cultural diversity, Joshi belongs to Pe- ter van de Veer's department, which fo- cuses on aspects of religious diversity. STUDYING CAUSES THROUGH DREAMS AND TRANCES In her recently completed book Christi- anity and Healing: the Angami Naga of Northeast India, Joshi describes the rela- tionship between Christian belief and healing among the Angami Naga in Na- galand, more than 85 percent of whom are converts to Baptism, Catholicism or other Christian denominations. \"In some cases going back three genera- tions,\" says the Max Planck researcher. Although Christianity is a long-es- tablished religion in this region, it has not totally superseded the indigenous spiritual world of the Angami. Even to- day, they still have mediums and sha- mans who are reputedly able to make contact with the ancient guardian spir- The methods practiced by spiritual healers stray into the realms of metaphysics.

And this is still the case, as she discovered dur- ing her field research in Nagaland. \"In some primary health clinics, I saw bi- ble verses hanging over the entrance or in the treatment rooms.\" In addi- tion, the Christian churches in the re- gion still foster the culture of prayer and healing, and belief in miracle cures is widespread. As an example of these Christian establishments whose treatment methods follow in the foot- steps of the Lord, she names the Reviv- al Church of Nagaland, whose special- ties include healing through the laying on of hands, and which runs healing camps specifically for this purpose. The healing offered by other church- es concentrates more on the power of prayer. \"These are mainly groups of women and people who are believed to A selection of drugs is available at a primary health care center, which includes a consulting room and a pharmacy. \u00bbThe Christian churches in the federal province of Nagaland still foster the culture of prayer and healing, and belief in miracle cures is widespread. The family received a second diagnosis from another preacher, who attributed the girl's fits of rage to a sin committed by her great-grandfather. A third theo- ry, finally, explained her condition as the result of the patient's refusal to ac- cept a divine gift when she was a child. The Angami believe that shamans and spiritual healers are called by dreams and visions to use their powers to help people. Refusing such a call puts both body and soul in jeopardy. BIBLE QUOTATIONS HELP THE TREATMENT At the time of the researcher's visit, the girl was still not cured despite all the therapies that had been tried. The an- thropologist, however, was not interest- ed in the success or failure of the differ- ent treatment methods. To her, this patient history was a clear example of the undogmatic flexibility of the Anga- mi's attitude to the broad spectrum of secular and spiritual medicine and treatment traditions. It is by no means exceptional for priests to be consulted on health problems. Joshi believes that this close link between Christian belief and healing has to do with the history of the mission in Nagaland. The first Christian missionaries who arrived in the region at the end of the 19th century tried to spread their message among Angami society through education and medical assist- ance. \"At that time, it was common for treatment to be linked to bible quota- tions, in order to bring the compas- sionate side of the Christian God clos-its. Some predict the future, while oth- ers enter dream or trance states to iden- tify the causes of illnesses and how to cure them. In a case study in her book, Joshi describes the matter-of-fact way in which people mix the different heal- ing services offered by biomedicine or folk medicine, Christianity and the traditional spiritual world. The study concerns the illness of a young wom- an from a Baptist family whose afflic- tion priests declared to be caused by possession. After a febrile illness and initial asthma attacks, aggressive be- havioral changes suddenly appeared in the patient, directed at everything and everyone. On a visit, the researcher was told about all the different efforts to find the correct diagnosis and ther- apy. First the family had turned to lo- cal healers, at the same time calling in the head of a nearby prayer center who also practiced as a folk healer. He diag- nosed an evil spirit as the cause of her blackouts. The family also sought ad- vice from biomedicine and took the girl to the local hospital for blood tests, but the doctors there failed to come up with an explanation for the patient's condition. A doctor from As- sam finally did manage to treat the young woman's asthma. The family then sought Christian assistance in the form of a pastor who tried to drive out the evil spirit with prayers. Still the fits of rage persisted, and other priests consulted concluded that a really large evil spirit must have lodged in the girl's body for so long that it was extremely difficult to separate it.

Her observations confirm the link that still exists between Christianity and medi- cine. \"Now the church's role is to recon- cile the various warring factions of the Naga nationalists and thereby heal the Naga community.\" Joshi's colleague, ethnologist Gabri- ele Alex, also came across images with Christian overtones while conducting research in the folk-medicine-based healer shops of the Vagri in Tamil Nadu. The Vagri are one of the three population groups chosen by Alex for her study on healing systems and tradi- tions in Tamil Nadu. \"I was particular- ly interested in how low-status castes perceive medical therapies and what methods they use to treat illnesses,\" she said as she talked about her project. In fact, the inhabitants of India's most southerly federal province have access to a wide choice of healthcare systems. For one, there is traditional folk medicine with its extremely com- prehensive and varied arsenal of remedies and prescriptions against illnesses of all kinds. \"These include grandma's household remedies based on healing herb teas, root mixtures and soups, and professional healers who run their own practices or even clinics and treat broken bones, animal bites and skin diseases,\" says Gabriele Alex, enumerating some of the specialties of the nattu maruntu tradition. The common factor in all these treatments is that they stem from knowledge of medicinal recipes and healing plants from the local natural environment, handed down from one generation to the next. The tradition clearly includes an ideological element. \"This type of medicine is strongly asso- ciated with India's romantic past and an image of nature and naturalness that is at odds with the modern world,\" says Alex. For another, the people living in rural areas also now have access to ba- sic biomedical services. Like every- where else in India, the range of public healthcare services in Tamil Nadu has been visibly improved by the introduc- tion of basic healthcare establishments. HEALTH IS LINKED TO PROGRESS \"Besides this, the Indian government has also integrated traditional medical traditions and knowledge systems into governmental health policy,\" says the ethnologist. As a result, Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, homeopathy and natural healing have been standardized and incorporated into government training, research and healthcare pro- vision. According to Gabriele Alex, \"There are also more private doctors than there used to be 20 years ago. When I began my initial research in 1998 in Madukottai, only one doctor was based there - and he wasn't a real doctor, just a quack who had worked as an assistant to a biomedical doctor for many years before eventually setting up on his own.\" Eleven years later, the village boast- ed three private doctors, a government health center where a doctor, a nurse and a laboratory assistant were available on weekday mornings, and a primary health subcenter with a pharmacist, birthing room and consulting room. These improvements in biomedical services, available even in rural areas, have come about on the back of the In- dian government's development pro- grams. \"Health is a major theme in this discourse, and is directly linked to eco- nomic growth and progress,\" says the re- searcher. As part of her study, she want- ed to find out whether improved access to public biomedical clinics is actually displacing traditional healing systems. The fact that no or only very low costs are charged for the government service would seem to support this. \"But despite government interest in the topic of healthcare provision, hard- ly any studies have been conducted on this,\" says Alex. \"It is still assumed that providing a good service means that people will use it.\" In addition to the Vagri, she also chose for her study the Mutturaja and the Paraiyar, who repre- sent the traditional lower castes, both of which live from agriculture. The Va- gri, in contrast, who do not practice as peripatetic healers or run healer shops but sometimes offer treatment from their homes, are traveling salesmen like their forefathers, selling cosmetics at the roadside. Others live from hunting and setting traps for small animals. \"Vagri healers are known for their special folk medicine and miracle cures against aging, impotence and infertil- ity,\" says Alex. Their medical reper- toire includes oils for external applica- tion, as well as powders and pastes, for which the healing plants used are Photos: dpa Picture-Alliance (top), MPI for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity - Gabriele Alex \u00bbThese improvements in the biomedical services available even in rural areas have come about on the back of the Indian government's development programs.FOCUS _India > 38 MaxPlanckResearch 1 | 11 above: Modern medical services play an increasingly important role in India - as here in a clinic, where mothers wait with their children for vaccinations. below: Explanations are a key element in the modern Indian health system, as these posters directed at young mothers show. 1 | 11 MaxPlanckResearch 39which animals are sacrificed and that project a certain wildness and danger, such as Kaliamman and Karuppa, as well as Muni, who is both a deity and a spirit,\" Alex explains. These beings are apparently responsible both for causing illnesses and for healing them. The rit- ual specialists of the Paraiyar thus also play a healing role. WOMEN PREFER GIVING BIRTH IN THE HOSPITAL So, when they fall ill, how do these people choose from the many treat- ments on offer, ranging from folk heal- ing traditions to biomedical institu- tions? This was one of the core questions in Gabriele Alex's study. To find the answers, she worked in the field using qualitative and quantitative methods for collecting ethnological data. She recorded the medical histo-mostly standard folk medicine reme- dies. On her visits to healer shops, she also saw how these folk medicine prac- titioners stir and pulverize very special ingredients in pots and pans. \"But they also use animal fats, snakes and meat as ingredients in medicine, and this differentiates them from the oth- er folk medicine healers.\" Other Vagri specialties include fortune telling and protective medicine, for which unusu- al items are sometimes used. \"For in- stance, they buy amulets containing fox horn,\" explains the scientist, de- scribing another of the healer's art. \"This small horn suppos- edly comes from the skull of the fox and transfers the animal's potency and strength to its wearer.\" Among the Hindu Paraiyar in Madu- kottai, too, the cami (lords) are respon- sible for ritual healing. \"The members of this caste worship mainly deities to Photos: MPI for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity - Gabriele Alex (2) top: The population may make only limited use of public health institutions, but Indian women prefer to give birth in a government hospital. bottom: Hidden but popular: Many patients put their faith in natural remedies, such as those offered by Siddha pharmacies. 40 MaxPlanckResearch 1 | 11 the discrimination experienced by the members of low-status groups in pub- lic hospitals.\" The researcher finds it particularly interesting that, when asked for sug- gestions on how to improve the healthcare system, most of the partic- ipants in her study cited optimization of nutrition as the most important measure, and especially improved pro- tein intake. \"All the government pro- grams are aimed at expanding the healthcare system - yet the people in the countryside see malnutrition as their biggest health problem.\" tients seeking a cure combine the var- ious treatment methods or alternate biomedical methods with home reme- dies or traditional healing arts. MALNUTRITION IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM A key factor in the choice of therapy direction is the assumed root cause of the patient's ailment. \"People there have a clearly differentiated concept of the causes of illness,\" says Alex, \"they distinguish between natural and su- pernatural causes.\" Biomedical doctors are competent to deal with the former, spiritual specialists with the latter. As the scientist also discovered, the castes differ in their preferences for certain healthcare institutions. Paraiyar and Mutturaja clearly prefer government doctors and clinics or go to pharmacies and medical shops, which Gabriele Alex attributes to the socioeconomic status of these castes. \"These people are day laborers and simply cannot afford hospital visits, because that would mean losing a day's work,\" she says. \"Medical advice from pharmacies is normally free of charge and vaccinations cost just five to ten rupees.\" On analyzing her questionnaires, Alex also discovered an interesting paradox: of all people, the Vagri, whose response to public healthcare institutions was the most positive in the questionnaires, use them the least of the three groups. \"They feel private hospitals provide better and more ef- fective treatment. This has to do with ries of her interviewees in one-on-one conversations, in order to identify ex- amples of, and changes in, health be- havior. The scientist also used stand- ard questionnaires to record the types of illnesses and their assumed causes, and the choice of healers and doctors, relating them to factors such as age, gender, education level, caste and place of residence. This methodology produced illuminating data on the medical options actually available to members of these castes and how they perceive and use these options. Ana- lyzing the data she had collected gave Alex insight into the main causes of ill- ness in this region. \"The most com- mon ailments reported are fevers, colds and flu infections, as well as dis- eases of the digestive tract,\" she summed up. Illnesses associated with modern civilization, in contrast, play almost no role. The researcher was also the first person to document the fact that at least some sections of the population confound the assumptions of health policymakers. \"Public health clinics are visited to a limited extent only,\" she says. \"State hospitals are preferred only for births, because there, Cesar- ean sections are not performed unnec- essarily - instead, babies are brought into the world slowly.\" On the other hand, most survey re- spondents said that they preferred vis- iting private hospitals for fever. \"Be- cause antibiotics are often prescribed there and the drugs are considered to be more effective,\" the researcher ex- plained. She also discovered that pa-FOCUS _India GLOSSARY Siddha Scholastic medicine tradition devel- oped in southern Asia.
