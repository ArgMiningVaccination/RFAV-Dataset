Through this needs assessment, collaborative community partners have identified numerous health issues impacting individuals and families in the Henry County region. Several themes are prevalent in this health needs assessment - the demographic composition of the Henry County region, the predictors for and prevalence of diseases, leading causes of mortality, accessibility to health services and healthy behaviors. Results from this study can be used for strategic decision- making purposes as they directly relate to the health needs of the community. The study was designed to assess issues and trends impacting the communities served by the collaborative, as weons of targeted stakeholder groups. This study includes a detailed analysis of secondary data to assess information regarding the health status of the community. In order to perform these analyses, information was collected from numerous secondary sources, including publicly available source s as well as private sources of data. Additionally, primary data were collected for the general population and the at- risk or economically disadvantaged population. Areas of investigation included perceptions of the community health issues, unhealthy behav iors, issues with quality of life, healthy behaviors and access to medical care, dental care, prescription medication and mental -health counseling. Additionally, social determinants of health were analyzed to provide insights into why certain segments of the population responded differently. Ultimately, the identification and prioritization of the most important health -related issues in the Henry County region were identified. The collaborative team considered health needs based on: (1) magnitude of the is sue (i.e., what percentage of the population was impacted by the issue); (2) severity of the issue in terms of its relationship with morbidities and mortalities; (3) potential impact through collaboration. Using a modified version of the Hanlon Method, tw o significant health needs were identified and determined to have equal priority: Healthy Behaviors - defined as active living and healthy eating, and their impact on obesity Behavioral Health - including mental health and substance abuse CHNA 2022 | Henry County 4 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 I. INTRODUCTION Background The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), enacted March 23, 2010, added new requirements for tax -exempt charitable hospital organizations to conduct community health needs assessments and to adopt implementation strategies to meet the community health needs identified through the assessments. This community health needs assessment (CHNA) takes into account input from specific individuals who represent the broad interests of the community served by OSF Saint Luke Medical Center including those with special knowledge of or expertise in public health. For this study, a community health -needs assessment is defined as a systematic process involving the community, to identify and analyze community health needs and assets in order to prioritize these needs, create a plan, and act upon unmet community health needs. Results from this assessment will be made widely available to the public. This CHNA Report was approved by the OSF HealthCare System's Board of Directo rs on July 25, 2022. The structure of the CHNA is based on standards used by the Internal Revenue Service to develop Form 990, Schedule H -Hospitals, designated solely for tax -exempt charitable hospital organizations. The fundamental areas of the community health needs assessment are illustrated below ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1 Collaborative Team and Community Engagement In order to engage the entire community in the CHNA process, a collaborative team of health -professional experts and key community advocates was created. Members of the collaborative team were carefully selected to ensure representation of the broad interests of the community. Specifically, team members included representatives from OSF Saint Luke Medical Center, members of the Henry County Health Department, and administrators from key community partner organizations. Engagement occurred throughout the en tire process, resulting in shared ownership of the assessment. The entire collaborative CHNA 2022 | Henry County 5 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 team met in the first and second quarter of 2022. Additionally, numerous meetings were held between the facilitators and specific individuals during the process. Spec ifically, members of the Collaborative Team consisted of individuals with special knowledge of and expertise in the healthcare of the community. Note that the collaborative team provided input for all sections of the CHNA. Individuals, affiliations, titles and expertise can be found in APPENDIX 1 . MEMBERS OF COLLABORATIVE TEAM . Definition of the Community In order to determine the geographic boundaries for OSF Saint Luke Medical Center, analyses were completed to identify what percentage of inpatient and outpatient activity was represented by Henry County. Data show that Henry County alone represents 76% of all patients for the hospital. In addition to defining the community by geographic boundaries, this study targets the at- risk population as an area of potential opportunity to improve the health of the community. Note that the at- risk population was defined as those individuals who were eligible to receive Medicaid based on the state of Illinois guidelines using household size and income level. Purpose of the Co mmunity Health- Needs Assessment In the initial meeting, the collaborative team identified the purpose of this study. Specifically, this study has been designed to provide necessary information to health -care organizations, including hospitals, clinics and health departments, in order to create strategic plans in program design, access and delivery. Results of this study will act as a platform that allows health -care organizations to orchestrate limited resources to improve management of high -priority chal lenges. By working together, hospitals, clinics, agencies and health departments will use this CHNA to improve the quality of healthcare in Henry County. When feasible, data are assessed longitudinally to identify trends and patterns by comparing with res ults from the 2019 CHNA and benchmarked with State of Illinois averages. Community Feedback from Previous Assessments The 2019 CHNA and implementation plan were made widely available to the community to allow for feedback. Specifically, the hospital posted both a full version and a summary version of the 2019 CHNA on its website. In order to encourage written feedback, the hospital specifically included a section labeled Share Your Feedback and provided instructions regarding how individuals from the community could provide comments to the CHNA. While no written feedback was received by individuals from the community via the available mechanism for the CHNA or implementation plan, verbal feedback was provided by key stakeholders from community -service organizations and incorporated as part of the collaborative process. 2019 CHNA Health Needs and Implementation Plans The 2019 CHNA for Henry County identified two significant health needs. These included: Healthy Behaviors, defined as healthy eating and active l iving, and their impact on obesity; and Behavioral Health, including mental health and substance abuse. Specific actions were taken to address these needs. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 6 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Detailed discussions of goals and strategies to improve these health needs can be seen in APPENDIX 2. ACTIVITIES RELATED TO 201 9 CHNA PRIORITIZED NEEDS . Note that numerous challenges associated with the COVID -19 pandemic had significant impact on the activities discussed in appendix 2. Social Determinants of Health This CHNA incorporates important factors associated with Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). SDOH are important environmental factors, such as where people are born, live, work and play , that affect people's well- being, physical and mental health, and quality of life. According to research conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Healthy People 2030 has identified five SDOH that should be included in assessing comm unity health (Figure 2 ). Figure 2 Healthy People 2030, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Retriev ed January 15, 2022, from https://hea lth.gov/healthypeople/objectives -and-data/social -determinants Assessment of included in th e CHNA, as social determinants help contribute to health inequities and disparities. Simply creating interventions without incorporating SDOH will have limited impact on improving community health for people living in underserved or at- risk areas. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 7 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 II. MET HODS To complete the comprehensive community health -needs assessment, multiple sources were examined. Secondary statistical data were used to assess the community profile, morbidity rates and causes of mortality. Additionally, a study was completed to exam ine perceptions of the community health -related issues, healthy behaviors, behavioral health, food security, social determinants of health and access to healthcare. Secondary Data Collection Existing secondary statistical data were first used to develop an overall assessment of health -related issues in the community. Within each section of the report, there are definitions, importance of categories, data and interpretations. At the end of each chapter, there is a section on key takeaways. Based on several retreats, a separate OSF Collaborative Team used COMPdata Informatics (affiliated with Illinois Health and Hospital Association (IHA) ) to identify six primary categories of diseases, including: age related, cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer, diabetes and infections. In order to define each disease category, modified definitions developed by Sg2 were used. Sg2 specializes in consulting for health -care organizations. Their team of experts includes MDs, PhDs, RNs and health -care leaders with extensive stra tegic, operational, clinical, academic, technological and financial experience. Primary Data Collection In addition to existing secondary data sources, primary survey data were also collected. This section describes the research methods used to collect, code, verify and analyze primary survey data. Specifically, the research design used for this study: survey design, data collection and data integrity. Survey Instrument Design Initially, all publicly available health -needs assessments in the U.S . were assessed to identify common themes and approaches to collecting community health -needs data. By leveraging best practices from these surveys, a new survey in 2021 was designed for use with both the general population and the at- risk community. To ensure that all critical areas were being addressed, the entire collaborative team was involved in survey design/approval through several fact- finding sessions. Additionally, several focus groups were used to collect the qualitative information necessary to design survey items. Specifically, for the community health -needs assessment, eight specific sets of items were included: Ratings of health issues in the community - to assess the importance of various community health concerns. Survey items included as sessments of topics such as cancer, diabetes and obesity. Ratings of unhealthy behaviors in the community - to assess the importance of various unhealthy behaviors. Survey items included assessments of topics such as violence, drug abuse and smoking. Ratings of issues concerning well -being - to assess the importance of various issues relating to well -being in the community. Survey items included assessments of topics such as access to healthcare, safer neighborhoods and effective public transportation. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 8 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Accessibility to healthcare - to assess the degree to which residents could access healthcare when needed. Survey items included assessments of topics such as access to medical, dental and mental -healthcare, as well as access to prescription medication. Healthy behaviors - to assess the degree to which residents exhibited healthy behaviors. The survey items included assessments of topics such as exercise, healthy eating habits and cancer screenings. Behavioral health - to assess community issues related to areas such as anxiety and depression. Food security - to assess access to healthy food alternatives. Social determinants of health - to assess the impact that social determinants may have on the above -mentioned areas. Finally, demographic information was collected to assess background information necessary to segment markets in terms of the eight categories discussed above. A copy of the final survey is included in APPENDIX 3. SURVEY . Sample Size In order to identify the potential population, the percentage of the Henry County population that was living in poverty was first identified. Specifically, the population of the county was multiplied by its respective po verty rate to identify the minimum sample size to study the at- risk population. The poverty rate for Henry County was 9.6%. The population used for the calculation was 49,284, yielding a total of 4,731 residents living in poverty in the Henry County area. A normal approximation to the hypergeometric distribution was assumed given the targeted sample size. n = (Nz2pq)/(E2 (N -1) + z2 pq) where: n = the required sample size N = the population size z = the value that specified the confidence interval (use 95 % CI) pq = population proportions (set at .05) E =desired accuracy of sample proportions (set at +/ - .05) For the total Henry County area, the minimum sample size for aggregated analyses (combination of at- risk and general populations) was 382. The data co llection effort for this CHNA yielded a total 523 usable responses. After cleaning the data for \"bot\" survey respondents, the sample was reduced to 429 respondents. This exceeded the threshold of the desired 95% confidence interval. To provide a represent ative profile when assessing the aggregated population for the Henry County region, the general population was combined with a portion of the at- risk population. To represent the at-risk population as a percentage of the aggregate population, a random -numb er generator was used to CHNA 2022 | Henry County 9 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 select at- risk cases to include in the general sample. Additionally, efforts were made to ensure that the demography of the sample was aligned with population demographics according to U.S. Census data. This provided a total usable sample of 409 respondents for analyzing the aggregate population. Sample characteristics can be seen in APPENDIX 4. CHARACTERISTICS OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS . Data Collection Survey data were collected in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2021. To collect data in this study, two techniques were used. First, an online version of the survey was created. Second, a paper version of the survey was distributed. In order to be sensitive to the needs of respondents, surveys stressed assurance of complete anonymity. Note that versions of both the online survey and paper survey were translated into Spanish. To specifically target the at- risk population, surveys were distributed at homeless shelters, food pantries and soup kitchens. Since the at- risk population was specifically targeted as part of the data collection effort, this became a stratified sample, as other groups were not specifically targeted based on their socio- economic status. Note that use of electronic surveys to collect community -level data may create a potential for bias from convenience sampling error. To recognize for potential bias in the community sample, a second control sample of data was collected. Specific ally, the control sample consisted of random patients surveyed at the hospital, assuming that patients receiving care represent an unbiased representation of the community. All questions on the patient version of the survey pertaining to access to healthcare were removed, as these questions were not relevant to current patients. Data from the community sample and the control sample were compared using t- tests and tetrachoric correlations when appropriate. Results show that the community sample did not exhib it any significance patterns of bias. If specific relationships exhibited a potential for bias between the community sample and the control sample, they are identified in the social -determinants sections of the analyses within each chapter. Data Integrity Comprehensive analyses were performed to verify the integrity of the data for this research. Without proper validation of the raw data, any interpretation of results could be inaccurate and misleading if used for decision -making. Therefore, several tests were performed to ensure that the data were valid. These tests were performed before any analyses were undertaken. Data were checked for coding accuracy, using descriptive frequency statistics to verify that all data items were correct. This was follow ed by analyses of means and standard deviations and comparison of primary data statistics to existing secondary data. Analytic Techniques To ensure statistical validity, several different analytic techniques were used. Specifically, frequencies and desc riptive statistics were used for identifying patterns in residents' ratings of various health concerns. Additionally, appropriate statistical techniques were used for identification of existing relationships between perceptions, behaviors and demographic data. Specifically, Pearson correlations, CHNA 2022 | Henry County 10 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 X2 tests and tetrachoric correlations were used when appropriate, given characteristics of the specific data being analyzed.

Population data provide an overview of population growth trends and build a foundation for additional analysis of data. Population Growth Data from the last census indicate the population of Henry County has slightly decreased ( <1.0%) between 2016 and 2020 ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3 Source: US Census CHNA 2022 | Henry County 12 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 1.2 Age, Gender and Race Distribution Importance of the measure: Population data broken down by age, gender, and race groups provide a foundation to analyze the issues and trends that impact demographic factors including economic growth and the distribution of healthcare services. Understanding the cultural diversity of communities is essential when considering health -care infrastructur e and service delivery systems. Age As illustrated in Figure 4 , the percentage of individuals in Henry County four age group s has de clined over the five- year period 2015 and 201 9. Most notably, those in the 50 -64 age group declined nearly 6.5%. The only age group that increased was residents aged 65+ years , increasing nearly 11% over the same five- year period . Figure 4 Source: US Census Gender The gender distribution of Henry County residents has remained relatively consistent between 2016 and 2019 ( Figure 5 ). CHNA 2022 | Henry County 13 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 5 Source: US Census Race With regard to race and ethnic background, Henry County is largely homogenous, yet in recent years, the county is becoming more diverse. Data from 2019 suggest that White ethnicity comprises 90.5% of the population in Henry County. However, the non -White population of Henry County has been increasing (from 9.1% in 2016 to 9.5% in 2019), with Black ethnicity comprising 1.9% of the population and multi- racial ethnicity comprising 1.3% of the population ( Figure 6 ). Figure 6 Source: US Census CHNA 2022 | Henry County 14 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 1.3 Household/Family Importance of the measure: Families are an important component of a robust society in Henry County, as they dramatically impact the health and development of children and provide support and well -being for older adults. As indicated in the graph below, the number of family househo lds in Henry County increased slightly from 2016 to 2019 ( Figure 7 ). Figure 7 Source: US Census Family Composition In Henry County, data from 2019 suggest the percentage of two -parent families in Henry County is 55%. One -person households represent 32% of the county population, single- female households represent 8%, and single- male households represent 5% (Figure 8 ). CHNA 2022 | Henry County 15 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 8 Source: US Census Early Sexual Activity Leading to Births from Teenage Mothers Henry County has experienced a fluctuation in teenage birth count. The teen birth count steadily declined since 2017 but experienced an increase in 2017 followed by a decrease in 2018 and 2019. Over the five-year period 2015- 2019, overall teen birth count has trended downward (Figure 9 ). Figure 9 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health 43 2139 2724Teen Births Henry County 2015 -2019 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 CHNA 2022 | Henry County 16 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 1.4 Economic Information Importance of the measure: Median income divides households into two segments with one- half of households earning more than the median income and the other half earning less. Because median income is not significantly impacted by unusually high or low -income values, it is considered a more reliable indicator than average income. To live in poverty means to lack sufficient income to meet one's basic needs. Accordingly, poverty is associated with numerous chronic social, health, education and employment conditions. Economic Climate Economic climate is a measure of a community's financial resources and resiliency. Key risk influencers include income, cost of living and opportunity. For Henry County, 28% of the population is at elevated risk for economic climate. This is lower than the State of Illinois average of 35% (SocialScape\u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). Median Income Level For 2019, the median household income in Henry County ($59,933) was lower than the State of Illinois ($65,886) (Figure 10 ). Figure 10 Source: US Census Unemployment For the years 2016 thru 2019, the Henry County unemployment rate remained higher than the State of Illinois unemployment rate. However, in 2020 the rate significantly increased but was lower than State of Illinois (Figure 11 ). Some of the increase in unemployment in 2020 may be attributed to the COVID -19 pandemic . CHNA 2022 | Henry County 17 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 11 Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics Individuals in Poverty In Henry C ounty, the percentage of individuals living in poverty between 2016 and 2019 decreased by 2.7%. Poverty has a significant impact on the development of children and youth. In 2019 the poverty rate for families living in Henry County ( 9.6%) was lower than the State of Illinois family poverty rate (11.4%) (Figure 12) . Figure 12 Source: US Census 12.3% 9.6%11.4%Poverty Rate Henry County 2016 -2019 2016 2019 State of Illinois CHNA 2022 | Henry County 18 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 1.5 Education Importance of the measure: According to the National Center for Educational Statistics1, \"The better educated a perso n is, the more likely that person is to report being in 'excellent' or 'very good' health, regardless of income.\" Research suggests that the higher the level of educational attainment and the more successful one is in school, the better one's health will b e and the greater likelihood of one selecting healthy lifestyle choices. Accordingly, years of education is strongly related to an individual's propensity to earn a higher salary, gain better employment, and foster multifaceted success in life. High School Graduation Rates Students who entered 9th grade in 2017 in Henry County school districts, except Kewanee CUSD 299, reported high school graduation rates that were comparable to or higher than the State average of 86%. Kewanee CUSD 299 reported lower than State averages at 68% (Figure 13) . Figure 13 Source: Illinois Report Card 1.6 Internet Accessibility Survey respondents were asked if they had Internet access. Of respondents, 88% indicated they had Internet in their homes. For those who did not have Internet in their home, cost was the most frequently cited reason ( Figure 14) . Note that these data are displayed in frequencies rather than percentages given the low number of responses. 1 NCES 2005 85%100%94%90%96% 68%90% 88% 86%4-Year High School Graduation Rates (Students who entered 9th grade in 2017) Henry County Alwood CUSD 225 State of Illinois CHNA 2022 | Henry County 19 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 14 Source: CHNA Survey Digital Landscape Digital landscape is a community's access to digital tools and the digital literacy to use them. Key risk influencers include affordability, accessibility and digital literacy. For Henry County, 10% of the population is at elevated risk for digital landscape. This is higher th an the State of Illinois average of 9% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). Social Determinants Related to Internet Access Several factors show significant relationships with an individual's Internet access. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Access to Internet tends to be rated higher for younger people, White people, those with higher education and those with higher income. LatinX people were more likely to rate they did not have access to the Internet.

Therefore, accessibility to healthcare must address both the associated financial costs and the supply and demand of medical services. Choice of Medical Care Survey respondents were asked to select the type of health -care facility used when sick. Six different alternatives were presented, including clinic or doctor's office, emergency department, urgent- care facility, health department, no medical treatment and other. The most common response for source of medical c are was clinic/doctor's office, chosen by 79% of survey respondents. This was followed by urgent care (8%), not seeking medical attention (7%), the emergency department at a hospital (4%) and the health department (2%) (Figure 15 ). CHNA 2022 | Henry County 22 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 15 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Clinic/doctor's office increased from 70% in 2019 to 79% in 2022. Much of this can be attributed to the decrease in use of urgent care facilities ( 20% in 2019 to 8% in 2022). Social Determinants Related to Choice of Medical Care Several factors show significant relationships with an individual's choice of medical care. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Clinic/Doctor's Office tends to be used more often by older people, White people and those with higher education and income. Urgent Care tends to be used more by women. Emergency Department tends to be used more often by Black people and those with lower income. Emergency departments tend to be used less by White people as a primary source of healthcare. Do Not Seek Medical Care tends to be chosen more by people with an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Health Department did not have any significant correlates. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 23 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Insurance Coverage According to survey data, 47% of the residents are covered by commercial/employer insurance, followed by Medicare (32%), and Medicaid (20%). Only 1% of respondents indicated they did not have any health insurance ( Figure 16) . Figure 16 Source: CHNA Survey Data from the survey show that for those individuals who do not have insurance, the most prevalent reason was cost ( Figure 17) . Note that these data are displayed in frequencies rather than percentages given the low number of responses. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 24 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 17 Source: CHNA Survey Social Determinants Related to Type of Insurance Several characteristics show significant relationships with an individual's type of insurance. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Medicare tends to be used more frequently b y older people, men and White people. Medicaid tends to be used more frequently by younger people, Black people and those with lower education and income. Medicaid tends to be used less frequently by White people. Private Insurance is used more often by wo men, younger people, White people and those with higher education and income. Private insurance is used less by Black people and people with an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. No Insurance tends to be reported more often by people with an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Access to Care In the CHNA survey, respondents were asked, \"Was there a time when you needed care but were not able to get it?\" Access to four types of care were assessed: medical care, prescription medication, dental care and counseling. Survey results show that 10% of the population did not have access to medical care when needed; 12% of the population did not have access to prescription medication when needed; 19% of the population did not have access to dental care when needed; and 20% of the population did not have access to counseling when needed (Figure 18). CHNA 2022 | Henry County 25 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 18 Source: CHNA Survey Social Determinants Related to Access to Care Several characteristics show a significant relationship with an individual's ability to access care when needed. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Access to medical care tends to be higher for White people. Access to prescription medication tends to be higher for White people, those with higher income and those with a stable housing environment. Access to dental care tends to be higher for older people, White people and those with higher education and those with higher income. Access to counseling tends to be rated higher for men and older people. Reasons for No Access - Medical Care Survey respondents who reported they were not able to get medical care when needed were asked a follow -up question. Based on frequencies, the leading causes of the inability to gain access to medical care were too long to wait for an appointment (15), the inability to afford the copay (10) and no way to get to the doctor (7) (Figure 19 ). CHNA 2022 | Henry County 26 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 19 Source: CHNA Survey Reasons for No Access - Prescription Medication Survey respondents who reported they were not able to get prescription medication when needed were asked a follow -up question. Based on frequencies, the leading cause of the inability to gain access to prescription medicine was the inability to afford copayments or deductibles (20) (Figure 20 ). Figure 20 Source: CHNA Survey CHNA 2022 | Henry County 27 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Reasons for No Access - Dental Care Survey respondents who reported they were not able to get dental care when needed were asked a follow -up question. Based on frequencies, the leading causes of inability to gain access to dental care were the inability to afford copayments or deductibles (23) and no insurance (22) (Figure 21 ). Figure 21 Source: CHNA Survey Reasons for No Access - Counseling Survey respondents who reported they were not able to get counseling when needed were asked a follow -up question. Based on frequencies, the leading causes of the inability to gain access to counseling were could not find (23) and wait was too long (17) (Figure 22 ). CHNA 2022 | Henry County 28 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 22 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Access to Medical Care - results show a significant decrease (7%) in those who were not able to get medical care. Access to Prescription Medications - results were the same. Access to Dental Care - results show a slight increase (1%) in those who were not able to get dental care when needed. Access to Counseling - results show a significant increase (12%) in those who were not able to get counseling when needed. Transportation Network Transportation network is a measure of the adequacy of the transportation network to facilitate access to care . Key risk influencers include access and proximity to resources. While survey data indicate transportation was not a leading cause of inaccessibility for Henry County, 30% of the population is at elevated risk for transportation network . This is higher than the State of Illinois average of 6% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). CHNA 2022 | Henry County 29 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 2.2 Wellness Importance of the measure: The overall health of a community is impacted by preventative measures including immunizations and vaccinations. Preventative health -care measures, including getting a flu shot, engaging in a healthy lifestyle and undertaking screenings for diseases are essential to combating morbidity and mortality while reducing health -care costs. Frequency of Flu Shots Figure 23 shows that the percentage of people who have had a flu shot is 36.5% for Henry County in 2015- 2019. Henry County had a higher vaccination percentage at 34.5% than the State average ( Figure 23). Figure 23 Source: CHNA Survey COVID -19 Vaccinations Figure 24 shows the percentage of people who have been fully vaccinated from the COVID -19 virus as of February 27, 2022. Although, Henry County remains above half with 5 5.6%, they remain under the rate for the State of Illinois at 6 3.6% and counting. Note the percentage of p eople vaccinated is updated in real time. Additionally, given the recency of the COVID -19 virus, no historical comparisons are made at this time. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 30 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 24 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health (02 -27-22) Personal Physician The CHNA survey asked respondents if they had a personal physician. Having a personal physician suggests that individuals are more likely to get wellness check -ups and less likely to use an emergency department as a primary healthcare service. According to survey data, 96% of residents have a personal physician ( Figure 25). Figure 25 Source: CHNA Survey Henry County State of Illinois55.6%63.6%Percent of Population Fully Vaccinated COVID -19 CHNA 2022 | Henry County 31 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Comparison to 2019 CH NA Having a personal physician has increased. Specifically, 93% of residents reported having a personal physician in 2019 and 96% report the same in 2022. Social Determinants Related to Having a Personal Physician The following characteristics show significant relationships with having a personal physician. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Having a personal physician tends to be more likely for White people, those with higher income and those with higher education. Cancer Screening Early detection of cancer may greatly improve the probability of successful treatment. In the case of colorectal cancer, early detection of precancerous polyps can prevent cancer. Specifically, four types of cancer screening wer e measured: breast, cervical, prostate and colorectal. Results from the CHNA survey show that 73% of women had a breast screening and 63% have had a cervical screening in the past five years. For men, 53% had a prostate screening in the past five years. Fo r women and men over the age of 50, 62% had a colorectal screening in the last five years (Figure 26) . Figure 26 Source: CHNA Survey CHNA 2022 | Henry County 32 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Comparison to 2019 CHNA Cancer screening increased from 2019 to 2022. Specifically, in 2019, 63% of women had a breast screening in the past five years compared to 73% in 2022. For men, in 2019 44% reported they had a prostate screening in the past five years compared to 53% in 2022. For women and men over the age of 50, 59% had a colorectal screening in the last five years in 2019, compared to 62% in 2022. Note this was the first year that cervical screening was measured, so there is no comparison to 2019. Social Determinants Related to Cancer Screenings Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with cancer screening. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Breast screening tends to be more likely for older women, White women, those with a higher level of education and higher income. Those in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment are less likely to have a breast screening. Cervical screening tends to be more likely for older women, those with a higher lev el of education and higher income. Those in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment are less likely to have a cervical screening. Prostate screening tends to be more likely for older men, those with a higher level of education and higher income. Colorectal screening tends to be more likely for older people, White people, those with a higher level of education and higher income. Physical Exercise A healthy lifestyle, comprised of regular physical activity, has been shown to increase physical, mental, and emotional well -being. Specifically, 29% of respondents indicated that they do not exercise at all, while the majority (56%) of residents exercise 1 -5 times per week (Figure 27 ). CHNA 2022 | Henry County 33 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 27 Source: CHNA Survey To find out why some residents do not exercise at all, a follow up question was asked. Similar to the 2019 CHNA, the most common reasons for not exercising are not having enou gh energy (30%), a dislike of exercise (21%) and not enough time (16%) (Figure 28) . Figure 28 Source: CHNA Survey CHNA 2022 | Henry County 34 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Comparison to 2019 CHNA There has been decline in exercise. Specifically, there is an increase in those who do not exercise. In 2019, 23% of residents indicated they did not exercise at all and 29% indicated they did not exercise in 2022. Social Determin ants Related to Exercise Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with frequency of exercise. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Frequency of exercise tends to be more likely for those with a higher level o f education and higher income. Healthy Eating A healthy lifestyle, comprised of a proper diet, has been shown to increase physical, mental and emotional well -being. Consequently, nutrition and diet are critical to preventative care. Almost two -thirds (62%) of residents report no consumption or low consumption (1 -2 servings per day) of fruits and vegetables per day. Note that the percentage of residents who consume five or more servings per day is only 6% (Figure 29 ). Figure 29 Source: CHNA Survey Those individuals who indicated they do not eat any fruits or vegetables were asked a follow up question. Reasons most frequently given for failing to eat more fruits and vegetables are not liking fruits and CHNA 2022 | Henry County 35 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 vegetables (11) and a lack of importance (11) (Figure 30) . Note that these data are displayed in frequencies rather than percentages given the low number of responses. Figure 30 Source: C HNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA There has been a decline in healthy eating. In 2019, 58% of respondents indicated they had two or fewer servings of fruits and vegetables per day compared to only 62% in 2022. Social Determinants Related to Healthy Eati ng Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with healthy eating. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Consumption of fruits and vegetables tends to be more likely for those with a higher level of education an d those with higher income. Those in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment are less likely to consume fruits and vegetables. Restricted Diet Respondents were also asked if they followed a restricted diet if recently diagnosed with a morbidity. Of respondents, 46% usually or always follow a restricted diet ( Figure 31) . 11 11 3 2 1 00Reasons Don't You Eat Fruits and Vegetables Henry County 2022 I don't like Not important Cannot afford Cannot prepare Transportation No refrigerator/stove Don't know where to buy CHNA 2022 | Henry County 36 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 31 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA There has been an increase in those who follow a restricted diet if recently diagnosed with a morbidity. In 2019, 40% of respondents indicated they usually or always followed a restricted diet compared to 46% in 2022. Health Literacy Health literacy is a measure of factors in the community that impact healthcare access, navigation and adherence. Key risk influencers include culture, demographics and education. For Henry County, 13% of the population is at elevated risk for health literacy . This is lower than the State of Illinois average of 34% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022) . 2.3 Understanding Food Insecurity Importance of the measure: It is essential that everyone has access to food and drink necessary for l iving healthy lives. Food insecurity exists when people don't have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs for a healthy life. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 37 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 32 Source: CHNA Survey Prevalenc e of Hunger Respondents were asked, \"How many days a week do you or your family members go hungry?\" The vast majority of respondents indicated they do not go hungry, however, 3% indicated they go hungry 1 -2 days per week. Social Determinants Related to Prevalence of Hunger Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with hunger. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Prevalence of Hunger tends to be more likely for those with less education, less income and tho se in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Primary Source of Food Respondents were asked to identify their primary source of food. It can be seen that the majority (91%) identified a grocery store ( Figure 33). 97% 3%0%How Often Go Hungry Henry County 2022 None 1 to 2 days per week 3 to 5 days per week CHNA 2022 | Henry County 38 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 33 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results from the 2022 CHNA show a slight improvement regarding primary source of food compared to the 2019 CHNA, where 89% of respondents indicated grocery stores in 2019 compared 91% in 2022. Food Landscape Food landscape is a measure of a community's access to sufficient, affordable and nutritious food. Key risk influencers include accessibility, affordabili ty and literacy. For Henry County, 29% of the population is at elevated risk for food landscape . This is higher than the State of Illinois average of 25% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022) . 2.4 Physical Environment Importance of the measure: According to the County Health Rankings, Air Pollution - Particulate Matter (APPM) is the average daily density of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) in a county. Fine particulate matter is defined as particles of air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. These particles can be directly emitted from sources such as forest fires, or they can form when gases are emitted from power plants, manufacturing facilities and automobiles. The relations hip between elevated air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter and ozone, and compromised health has been well documented. Negative consequences of ambient air pollution include decreased lung function, chronic bronchitis, asthma and other advers e pulmonary effects. The APPM for Henry County (11.3) is slightly lower than the State average of 11.5 (Figure 34). CHNA 2022 | Henry County 39 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 34 Source: C ounty Health Rankings 2021 2.5 Health Status Importance of the measure: Self-perceptions of health can provide important insights to help manage population health. Not only do self -perceptions provide benchmarks regarding health status, but they can also provide insights into how accurately people perceive their own health. Mental Health The survey asked respondents to indicate specific issues, such as depression and stress/anxiety. Of respondents, 49% indicated they did not feel depressed in the last 30 days (Figure 35) and 60% indicated they did not feel anxious or stressed (Figure 36 Figure 36) . CHNA 2022 | Henry County 40 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 35 Source: CHNA Survey Figure 36 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 201 9 CHNA Results from the 2022 CHNA show a decline in mental health. In 2019, 59% of respondents indicated they did not feel depressed in the last 30 days and 68% indicated they did not feel anxious or stressed. In 2022, 49% of respondents indicated they di d not feel depressed in the last 30 days and 6 0% indicated they did not feel anxious or stressed. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 41 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Respondents were also asked if they spoke with anyone about their mental health in the past year. Of respondents, 30% indicated that they spoke to someone ( Figure 37) , the most common response was a doctor/nurse (47%) (Figure 38 ). Figure 37 38 Source: CHNA Survey CHNA 2022 | Henry County 42 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Social Determinants Related to Behavioral Health Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with behavioral health. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Depression tends to be rated higher for women, younger people and those with less income. Depression tends to be rated lower for White people. Stress and anxiety tends to be rated higher for younger people and those with less income. Stress and anxiety tends to be rated lower for White people. Self -Perceptions of Overall Health In regard to self -assessment of overall physical health, 15% of respondents reported having poor overall physical health (Figure 39) . Figure 39 Source: CHNA Survey In regard to self -assessment of overall mental heal th, 10% of respondents stated they have poor overall mental health (Figure 40) . CHNA 2022 | Henry County 43 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 40 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA With regard to physical health, more pe ople see themselves in poor health in 2022 (15%) than 2019 (10%). With regard to mental health, more people see themselves in poor health in 2022 (10%) than 2019 (5%). Social Determinants Related to Self -Perceptions of Health Multiple characteristics sho w significant relationships with self -perceptions of health. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Perceptions of physical health tend to be higher for White people, those with higher education and income. Perceptions of ph ysical health tend to be rated lower for LatinX people. Perceptions of mental health tend to be higher for older people, White people and those with higher education and income. Women were less likely to report good mental health. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 44 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 2.6 Key Takeaways from Chapter 2 WHILE THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN ACCESS TO MENTAL -HEALTH COUNSELING. THIS IS AT A TIME WHEN THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN BOTH DEPRESSION AND STRESS/ANXIETY. INCREASED UTILIZATION OF DOCTORS' OFFICES/CLINICS. COVID- 19 VACCINES ARE LOWER THAN STATE AVERAGES. PROSTATE SCREENING IS RELATIVELY LOW COMPARED TO BREAST, CERVICAL AND COLORECTAL SCREENING. THERE HAS BEEN A DECREASE IN BOTH EXERCISE AND HEALTHY EATING IN THE PAST THREE YEA RS.

In this way, health -care organizations can target affected populations more effectively. Research suggests tobacco use facilitates a wide variety of adverse medical conditions. CHNA survey data show 87% of respondents do not smoke and only 5% state they smoke more than 12 times per day (Figure 41) . Only 2% of respondents vape on a daily basis (Figure 42) . Figure 41 Source: CHNA Survey CHNA 2022 | Henry County 46 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 42 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results between 2019 and 2022 show a slight improvement for smoking, where 84% of people did not smoke in 2019 and 87% do not smoke/vape in 2022. Social Determinants Related to Smoking or Vaping Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with smoking or vaping. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Smoking tends to be rated higher by those with less education and a lower income. Smoking tends to be rated lower by White people. Vaping tends to be rated higher by younger people. 3.2 Drug and Alcohol Abuse Importance of the measure: Alcohol and drugs impair decision -making, often leading to adverse consequences and outcomes. Research sug gests that alcohol is a gateway drug for youth, leading to increased usage of controlled substances in adult years. Accordingly, the substance abuse values and behaviors of high school students is a leading indicator of adult substance abuse in later year s. Youth Substance Abuse Data from the 2020 Illinois Youth Survey measures illegal substance use (alcohol, tobacco and other drugs - including inhalants) among adolescents. Henry County data reported for 2020, State of Illinois CHNA 2022 | Henry County 47 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 data reported for 2018. Fro m the chart below Henry County came in below State of Illinois averages for alcohol, cigarettes , marijuana and illicit drugs . Henry County reported higher than State averages for inhalants among 8th graders (Figure 43) . Among 10th graders, the most recent data available Henry County and State of Illinois is 2018. These data show State levels remaining equal to or higher in all categories except cigarettes and illicit d rugs (Figure 44). Note data is unavailable for 12th graders.

The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Alcohol consumption tends to be rated higher for Black people, LatinX people, those with less income and education. Alcohol consumption tends to be rated lower for White people. Misuse of prescription medication including opioids tends to be rated higher by men. Mar ijuana use had no significant correlations. Illegal substance use tends to be rated lower for White people. 3.3 Overweight and Obesity Importance of the measure: Individuals who are overweight and obese place greater stress on their internal organs, thus increasing the propensity to utilize health services. Research strongly suggests that obesity is a significant problem facing youth and adults nationally, in Illinois, and within Henry County. The US Surgeon General has characterized obesity as \"the fastest- growing, most threatening disease in America today.\" According to the Obesity Prevention Initiative from the Illinois General Assembly, 20% of Illinois childre n are obese. The financial burden of overweight and obese individuals is staggering, as the estimated annual medical costs attributed to obesity in Illinois for 1998 -2000 exceeded $3.4 billion, ranking Illinois 6th in the nation for obesity -attributed medical costs. With children, research has linked obesity to numerous chronic diseases including Type II diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure and asthma. Adverse physical health side effects of obesity include orthopedic problems due to weakened joints and lower bone density. Detrimental mental health side effects include low self -esteem, poor body image, symptoms of depression and suicide ideation. Obesity CHNA 2022 | Henry County 51 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 impacts educational performance as well; studies suggest school absenteeism of obese children is six times higher than that of non- obese children. With adults, obesity has far -reaching consequences. Testimony to the Illinois General Assembly indicated that obesity -related illnesses contribute to worker absenteeism, slow workflow, and high worker compensation rates. A Duke University study on the effects of obesity in the workforce noted 13 times more missed workdays by obese employees than non- obese employees. Nationwide, lack of physical activity and poor nutrition contribute to an estimated 300,000 preventable deaths per year. In Henry County, the number of people diagnosed with obesity and being overweight has increased over the years from 2010- 2014 to 2015- 2019. Note specifically that the percentage of obese and overweight people has increased from 65.4% to 67.5%. Overweight and obesity rates in Illinois have increased over the years from 2010 -2014 to 2015- 2019. Note specifically that the percentage of obese and overweight people has increased from 63.7% to 65.7% (Figure 49) . Note that data have not been updated by the Illinois Department of Public Health. Additionally , note in the 20 22 CHNA survey, respondents indicated that being overweight was their most prevalently diagnosed health condition. Figure 49 Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 3.4 Predictors of Heart Disease Residents in Henry County report a higher than State average prevalence of high cholesterol. The percentage of residents who report they have high cholesterol in Henry County (43.2%) compared to the State of Illinois average of 31.5%. Note that data have not been updated past 2019 by the Illinois Department of Public Health (Figure 50) . CHNA 2022 | Henry County 52 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 50 Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Most (63.1%) residents of Henry County report having their cholesterol checked recently, whereas 23% report never having their cholesterol checked (Figure 51) . Note that data have not been updated by the Illinois Department of Public Health. Figure 51 Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System With regard to high blood pr essure, Henry County has a higher percentage of residents with high blood pressure than residents in the State of Illinois as a whole. The percentage of Henry County residents reporting they have high blood pressure from 2015 - 2019 increased to 38.5% (Figure 52 ). Note that data have not been updated past 2019 by the Illinois Department of Public Health.

Respiratory 4.5 Cancer 4.6 Diabetes 4.7 Infectious Disease 4.8 Injuries 4.9 Mortality 4.10 Key Takeaways from Chapter 4 CHAPTER 4 : MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY Given the lack of recent disease/morbidity data from existing secondary data sources, much of the data used in this chapter was manually gathered from Henry County hospitals using COMPdata Informatics . Note that hospital -level data only show hospital admissions and do not reflect outpatient treatments and procedures. 4.1 Self -Identified Health Conditions Survey respondents were asked to self -identify any health conditions. Note that being overweight (29%) was significantly higher th an any other health conditions. This percentage is significantly lower than secondary sources. Specifically, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data indicate that roughly two -thirds of the population is overweight or obese. Most other self -identified morbidities reflected existing sources of secondary data accurately (e.g., cancer 4%, diabetes 11%) (Figure 53) . CHNA 2022 | Henry County 55 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 53 Sourc e: CHNA Survey 4.2 Healthy Babies Importance of the measure: Regular prenatal care is a vital aspect in producing healthy babies and children. Screening and treatment for medical conditions as well as identification and interventions for behavioral risk factors associated with poor birth outcomes are important asp ects of healthy babies. Research suggests that women who receive adequate prenatal care are more likely to have better birth outcomes, such as full term and normal weight babies. Low Birth Weight Rates Low birth weight rate is defined as the percentage of infants born below 2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds. Very low birth weight rate is defined as the percentage of infants born below 1,500 grams or 3.3 pounds. In contrast, the average newborn weighs about 7 pounds. The percentage of babies born with low birth weight in Henry County has remained constant with a slight increase in 2019 (8.0%) (Figure 54 ). CHNA 2022 | Henry County 56 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 54 Source: County Hea lth Ranking 2020 4.3 Cardiovascular Disease Importance of the measure: Cardiovascular disease is defined as all diseases of the heart and blood vessels, including ischemic (also known as coronary) heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, hypertensive disease and atherosclerosis. Coronary Atherosclerosis Coronary Atherosclerosis, sometimes -called hardening of the arteries, can slowly narrow and harden the arteries throughout the body. When atherosclerosis affects the arteries of the heart, it is called coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death for Americans. Most of these deaths are from heart attacks caused by sudden blood clots in the heart's arteries. The number of cases of coronary atheroscler osis complication at Henry County area hospitals has been low, with 2 cases in 2019 and 1 case reported in 2020. Note that hospital -level data only show hospital admissions and do not reflect out- patient treatments and procedures. Cardiac Arrest Cases of dysrhythmia and cardiac arrest at Henry County area hospitals decreased by 12 from 2018 to 2020 ( Figure 55 ).

Figure 57 Source: COMPdata Informatics 2021 Arterial Embolism There were no treated cases of arterial embolism at Henry County area hospitals from 2018 - 2020. Note that hospital -level data only show hospital admissions. Strokes The number of treated cases of stroke at Henry County area hospitals decreased between 2018 (16) and 2019 (14) . The number of cases then increased in 2020 to 16 cases (Figure 58 ). Note that hospital -level data only show hospital admissions and do not reflect outpatient treatments and procedures. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 59 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 58 Source: COMPdata Informatics 2021 4.4 Respiratory Importance of the measure: Disease of the respiratory system includes acute upper respiratory infections such as influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, emphysema and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). These conditions are ch aracterized by breathlessness, wheezing, chronic coughing, frequent respiratory infections and chest tightness. Many respiratory conditions can be successfully controlled with medical supervision and treatment. However, children and adults who do not hav e access to adequate medical care are likely to experience repeated serious episodes, trips to the emergency room and absences from school and work. Hospitalization rates illustrate the worst episodes of respiratory diseases and are a proxy measure for inadequate treatment. Asthma The percentage of residents who have asthma in Henry County has decreased between 2010 - 2014 and 2015 - 2019. According to the Illinois BRFSS, asthma rates in Henry County (9.3%) are greater than the State of Illinois (8.2%) (Figure 59) . Note that data has not been updated past 2019 by the Illinois Department of Public Health. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 60 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 59 Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Treated cases of COPD at Henry County area hospitals fluctuated between 2018 and 2020, with a significant decline in 2020 (Figure 60). Note the significant decrease between 2019 and 2020 could be because of the COVID -19 pandemic. Note that hospital -level data only show hospital admissions and do not reflect out- patient treatments and procedures. Figure 60 Sour ce: COMPdata Informatics 2021 CHNA 2022 | Henry County 61 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 4.5 Cancer Importance of the measure: Cancer is caused by the abnormal growth of cells in the body and many causes of cancer have been identified. Generally, each type of cancer has its own symptoms, outlook for cure, and methods for treatment. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in Henry County. For the top three prevalent cancers in Henry County, comparisons are illustrated in the graph that follows ( Figure 61 ). Specifically, prostate cancer and breast cancer are lower than the State, while lung and bronchus cancer rates are higher than the State of Illinois. Note that 2018 is the most recent year of data. Figure 61 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health - Cancer in Illinois 4.6 Diabetes Importance of the measure: Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, adult blindness and amputations and is a leading contributor to strokes and heart attacks. It is estimated that 90 -95% of individuals with diabetes have Type II diabetes (previously known as adult- onset d iabetes). Only 5 -10% of individuals with diabetes have Type I diabetes (previously known as juvenile diabetes). Inpatient cases of Type II diabetes from Henry County increased between 2018 (11 cases) and 2020 (23 cases) ( Figure 62). Note that hospital -level data only show hospital admissions and do not reflect out- patient treatments and procedures.

Note that hospital -level data only show hospital admissions and do not reflect out -patient treatments and procedures. Figure 63 Source: COMPdata Informatics 2021 Data from the Illinois BRFSS indicate that 9.4% of Henry County residents have diabetes (Figure 64) . Trends are concerning, as the prevalence of diabetes is increasing dramatically in the State of Illinois. Note that data have not been updated past 2019 by the Illinois Department of Public Health. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 63 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 64 Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 4.7 Infectious Diseases Importance of the measure: Infectious diseases, including sexually transmitted infections and hepatitis, are related to high -risk sexual behavior, drug and alcohol abuse, limited access to healthcare, and poverty. It would be highly cost -effective for both individuals and society if more programs focused on preventio n rather than treatment of infectious diseases. Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Cases The data for the number of infections of chlamydia in Henry County from 2018 -2019 indicate a slight decrease. The incidences of chlamydia across the State of Illinois has increas ed significantly. Rates of chlamydia in Henry County are lower than State averages (Figure 65 ). CHNA 2022 | Henry County 64 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 65 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health The data for the number of infections of gonorrhea in Henry County and the State of Illinois indicate a significant increase ( Figure 66) . This is concerning on both a local and State level ; however, cases in Henry County are significantly lower than the State averagae. Note 2019 is the most recent data. Figure 66 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health Vaccine Preventable Diseases A vaccine- preventable disease is an infectious disease for which an effective preventive vaccine exists. If a person acquires a vaccine- preventable disease and dies , the death is considered a vaccine- preventable death. According to the Illinois Public Health Department, the most common and serious vaccine- CHNA 2022 | Henry County 65 Collaboration for sustaining equity 2022 preventable diseases are: Varicella (German measles), Diphtheria, Hepatitis B and Hemophilic Influenza Type B (HIB) Infections. These diseases used to strike thousands of children each year. Today there are relatively few cases, but outbreaks still occur each year because some babies are not immunized. Henry County has shown no significant outbreaks compared to State statistics, but there are limited data available ( Table 1 and Table 2 ). Note data has not been updated beyond years displayed in table. Also note that COVID -19 vaccine rates are presented in Chapter 2 of this CHNA.

These injuries are often indicative of serious mental health problems requiring the treatment of other trauma- inducing issues. Unintentional injuries can occur, in part, from violent crimes. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 66 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Suicid e The number of suicides in Henry County indicate higher incidence than State of Illinois averages, as there were approximately 15.6 per 100,000 people in Henry County from 2016- 2018 (Figure 67). Figur e 67 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health Violent Crimes Violent crimes are defined as offenses that involve face- to-face confrontation between the victim and the perpetrator, including homicide, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Violent crime is represented as an annual rate per 100,000 people ( Figure 68) . The numb er of violent crimes decreased in 2017 and remained at the same rate in 2018 before slightly increasing in 2019 and remaining at the same rate in 2020 (130) . Over the period 2016- 2020, the overall rate decreased.

The top three leading causes of death in the State of Illinois and Henry County are similar as a percentage of total deaths in 2020. Diseases of the heart are the cause of 26.2% of deaths, cancer is the cause of 18.1% of deaths, and COVID -19 is the cause of 9.1% of deaths in Henry County (Table 3 ). Table 3 Top 5 Leading Causes of Death for all Races by County and State , 2020 Rank Henry County State of Illinois 1 Diseases of Heart (26.2%) Diseases of Heart (20.7%) 2 Malignant Neoplasm (5.4%) 5 Accidents (4.1%) Accidents (5.1%) Source: Illinois Department of Public Health CHNA 2022 | Henry County 68 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 4.10 Key Takeaways from Chapter 4 LUNG CANCER RATES IN HENRY COUNTY ARE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN STATE AVERAGES. SUICIDE RATES IN HENRY COUNTY ARE HIGHER THAN STATE AVERAGES. GONORRHEA HAS SHOWN A SIGNIFICANT INC REASE IN HENRY COUNTY; HOWEVER, IT IS STILL MUCH LOWER THAN STATE AVERAGES PER 100,000. HEART DISEASE AND CANCER ARE THE LEADING CAUSES OF MORTALITY IN HENRY COUNTY. COVID- 19 IS NOW THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH CHNA 2022 | Henry County 69 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 CHAPTER 5 OUTLINE 5.1 Perceptions of Health Issues 5.2 Perceptions of Unhealthy Behavior 5.3 Perceptions of Issues with Well Being 5.4 Summary of Community Health Issues 5.5 Community Resources 5.6 Significant Needs Identified and Prioritized CHAPTER 5 : PRIORITIZATION OF HEALTH -RELATED ISSUES In this chapter, the most critical health -related needs in the community are identified. To accomplish this, community perceptions of health issues, unhealthy behaviors and issues related to well -being were first co nsidered. Key takeaways from each chapter were then used to identify important health -related issues in the community. Next, a comprehensive inventory of community resources was completed; and finally, the most significant health needs in the community are prioritized. Specific criteria used to identify these issues included: (1) magnitude in the community; (2) severity in the community; (3) potential for impact to the community. 5.1 Perceptions of Health Issues The CHNA survey asked respondents to rate th e three most important health issues in the community. Respondents had a choice of 11 different options. The health issue that rated highest was mental health (19%), followed by aging issues (18%) (Figure 69) . These two factors were significantly higher than other categories based on t- tests between sample means. Note that perceptions of the community were accurate in some cases. For example, m ental health issues are significantly increasing. Also, there is a steady rise in the 65 -and-over age population. The survey respondents accurately identified these as important health issues. However, some perceptions were inaccurate. For example, while heart disease is a leading cause of mortality, it is ranked relatively low. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 70 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 69 Source: CHNA Survey 5.2 Perceptions of Unhealthy Behaviors Respondents were asked to select the three most important unhealthy behaviors in the community out of a total of 10 choices. The highest rated unhealthy behavior is drug abuse(illegal) (Figure 70 ). Figure 70 Source: CHNA Survey CHNA 2022 | Henry County 71 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 5.3 Perceptions of Issues Impacting Well Being Respondents were asked to select the three most important issues impacting well -being in the community out of a total of 11 choices. The issue impacting well -being that rated highest was access to healthcare (19%). It was followed by healthy food choices (15%) and less hatred (12%) ( Figure 71 ). These three factors were significantly higher than other categories based on t- tests between sample means. Figure 71 Source: CHNA Survey 5.4 Summary of Community Health Issues Based on findings from the previous analyses, a chapter -by-chapter summary of key takeaways is used to provide a foundation for identification of the most important health -related issues in the community. Considerations for identifying key takeaways include magnitude in the community, strategic importance to the community, existing community resources and potential for impact and trends and future forecasts. Demographics (Chapter 1) - Three factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the demographic analyses: Population decreased Population over age 65 increased Single female head -of-house -household represents 8% of the population Prevention Behaviors (Chapter 2) - Five factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the chapter on prevention behaviors: CHNA 2022 | Henry County 72 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Decreased access to mental -health counseling Low C OVID -19 vaccine rate Prostate screening is relatively low Exercise and healthy eating behaviors Depression and stress/anxiety Symptoms and Predictors (Chapter 3) - Four factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the chapter o n symptoms and predictors: Inhalants among 8th graders and cigarette usage among 10th graders Overweight and obesity Risk factors for heart disease Opioid use Morbidity and Mortality (Chapter 4) - Four factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the chapter on morbidity/mortality behaviors: Lung cancer Suicide Gonorrhea Heart disease and c ancer are the leading causes of mortality, followed by COVID -19 Potential Healt h-Related Needs Considered for Prioritization Before the prioritization of significant community health -related needs was performed, results were aggregated into 8 potential categories. Based on similarities and duplication, the 8 potential areas considered are: Aging issues Healthy behaviors - nutrition & exercise Behavioral health, including depression, anxiety/stress, suicide Overweight/Obesity Substance use, particularly misuse of prescription medication Access - mental -health counseling Cancer - lung COVID -19 related issues (vaccine rates and causes of mortality) CHNA 2022 | Henry County 73 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 5.5 Community Resources After summarizing potential categories for prioritization in the Community Health Needs Assessment, a comprehensive analysis of existing community resources was perfo rmed to identify the efficacy to which these 8 health -related areas were being addressed. A resource matrix can be seen in APPENDIX 5. RESOURCE MATRIX relating to the 8 health -related issues. There are numerous forms of resources in the community. They are categorized as recreational facilities, county health departments, community agencies and area hospitals/clinics. A detailed list of community resources and descrip tions appears in APPENDIX 6. DESCRIPTION OF COMMUNITY RESOURCES . 5.6 Significant Needs Identified and Prioritized In order to prioritize the previously identified dimensions, the collaborative team considered health needs based on: (1) magnitude of the issues (e.g., what percentage of the population was impacted by the issue); (2) severity of the issues in terms of th eir relationship with morbidities and mortalities; (3) potential impact through collaboration. Using a modified version of the Hanlon Method (as seen in APPENDIX 7: P RIORITIZATION METHODOLOGY ), the collaborative team identified two significant health needs and considered them equal priorities: Healthy Behaviors - defined as active living and healthy eating, and their impact on obesity Behavioral Health - including mental health and substance abuse HEALTHY BEHAVIORS - ACTIVE LIVING, HEALTHY EATING AND SUBSEQUENT OBESITY ACTIVE LIVING. A healthy lifestyle, comprised of regular physical activity and balanced diet, has been shown to increase physical, mental and emotional well -being. Note that 29% of respondents indicated that they do not exercise at all, while the majority (5 6%) of resid ents exercise 1 -5 times per week. The most common reasons for not exercising are not having enough energy ( 30%) or a dislike of exercise (21%). HEALTHY EATING. Almost two- thirds (62%) of residents report no consumption or low consumption (1 - 2 servings pe r day) of fruits and vegetables per day. Note that the percentage of residents who consume five or more servings per day is only 6%. The most prevalent reasons for failing to eat more fruits and vegetables were the lack of desire and lack of importance. OBESITY. In Henry County, over two -thirds (67.5%) of residents were diagnosed with obesity and being overweight. In the 2022 CHNA survey, respondents indicated that being overweight was the third most important health issue and was rated as the most prev alently diagnosed health condition. Research strongly suggests that obesity is a significant problem facing youth and adults nationally, in Illinois, and within Henry County. The U.S. Surgeon General has characterized obesity as \"the fastest- growing, most threatening disease in America today.\" According to the Obesity Prevention Initiative from the Illinois General Assembly, 20% of Illinois children are obese. With children, research has linked obesity to numerous chronic diseases including Type II diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure and asthma. CHNA 2022 | Henry County 74 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Adverse physical health side effects of obesity include orthopedic problems due to weakened joints and lower bone density. Detrimental mental health side effects include low self -esteem, poor body image, symptoms of depression and suicide ideation. Obesity impacts educational performance as well; studies suggest school absenteeism of obese children is six times higher than that of non- obese children. With adults, obesity has far -reaching consequences. Tes timony to the Illinois General Assembly indicated that obesity -related illnesses contribute to worker absenteeism, slow workflow, and high worker compensation rates. A Duke University study on the effects of obesity in the workforce noted 13 times more m issed workdays by obese employees than non- obese employees. Nationwide, lack of physical activity and poor nutrition contribute to an estimated 300,000 preventable deaths per year. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH - MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE MENTAL HEALTH. The CHNA survey asked respondents to indicate prevalence of specific issues, namely depression and stress/anxiety. Of respondents, 51% indicated they felt depressed in the last 30 days and 40% indicated they felt anxious or stressed. Depression tends to be rated higher by women, younger people, and those with less income. Stress and anxiety tend to be rated higher for younger people and those with less income. Respondents were also asked if th ey spoke with anyone about their mental health in the past year . Of respondents 30% indicated that they spoke to someone, the most common response was to a doctor/nurse ( 47%). In regard to self -assessment of overall mental health, 1 0% of respondents stated they have poor overall mental health. In the 2022 CHNA survey, respondents indicated that mental health was the most important health issue. SUBSTANCE ABUSE. Of survey respondents, 2 3% indicated they consume at least one alcoholic drink each day. Alcohol consumption tends to be rated higher by Black people, those with low er income and those with low er education. Of survey respondents, 6 % indicated they improperly use prescription medication each day to feel better and 4 % indicated the use marijuana each d ay. Note that misuse of prescription medication (oftentimes opioid use) tends to be rated higher by men . Marijuana use had no significant correlations. Finally, of survey respondents 1% indicated they use illegal drugs on a daily basis. In the 2022 CHNA s urvey, respondents rated drug abuse (illegal) as the most prevalent unhealthy behavior (2 0%) in Henry County, followed by alcohol use (1 5%).
