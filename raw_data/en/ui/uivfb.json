The practice of meditation forms an integral part of many traditions. It is the most effective way to approach divinity, rather than ritual and belief. Each person's reason to meditate is different, for example stressful lifestyle, emotional imbalance etc. They approach meditation with a wide spectrum of aims but are often surprised to experience a profound sense of spiritual well-being, a state of inner joy. So why meditate? The answer is complex, the goal changes as we prac- tice meditation. As we meditate, we get a better understanding about ourselves, which will help us to respond to the external world in a better way. What is meditation: \"Effortless focus upon a profound/divine/ infinite object\" is med- itation. Meditation is not the goal; it is the vehicle or tool to spiritual transfor- mation. As seen on the graph which depicts your mind, Focused+Effortless= Meditation Focused +Effort= Concentration Unfocused + Effortless = Daydreaming Unfocused + Effort = Frustration Why a profound object? We all know how to meditate, we do it every day unknowingly. For exam- ple, effortlessly studying a subject you like, you meditate upon that, when you are in love with someone, you meditate upon that person, when you play video games, you are again effortlessly focus- ing upon that. What matters is the object of meditation. Object of Meditation: A profound object gives a profound consciousness while a mun- dane object gives us a mundane consciousness. For instance, if you are effortlessly studying a subject you like, then the object of meditation is your studies which is a profound object, or when you play video games, the object of meditation is the game which is a mundane object. At Hatha Vidya, as students of NISHTHA program, we meditate on objects we understand and relate to. They can be: External- - Mango, leaf, mountains, moon, and sun. Internal- - Heart, breathing, navel and bridge of nose among others. We have practiced external and internal types by performing Object Meditation and Deha Dharana. Deha Dharna: Meaning: Deha means derived from the Sanskrit word 'Dhar' which means to hold some- thing in a resting position. In this prac- tice, we focus our mind on different parts of the body. Posture for Meditation: Before meditation we do \"eye closure\", which is where we look at a far point and very slowly bring our gaze to ourselves. Once we observe the flicker- ing and heaviness of our eyelids, we let our eyes close. Eye closure is important to internalize the mind. The golden rule for meditation is \"Sama Kaya Shiro Grivam\" which means your head, neck and spine are in one line. Swastikasana, Siddhasana, Padmasana, Sukhasana and Ardha Padmasana are recommended. When your spine is erect, it creates a closed circuit for your body and allows energy to move into your body. At present times, we are distract- ed very easily, and our attention span is less due to which our efficiency is reduced. Meditation is the best way to restore it and bring out the hidden capa- bilities in us. "}
