She even complained that she was experiencing increased emotional liability and would cry very easily. Since a year her menses had become irregular and the flow would be sometimes heavy and sometimes light but now since last 4 months she has not got the monthly cycles atall. Since last 4 months she had disturbed sleep as she would wake up sweating and then would feel very tired. She visited her gynecologist and was told that she had menopausal symptoms and was prescribed an anti-anxiety medicine to help her balance her emotional symptoms and sleep problems. She took the medicine for around 10days and felt a little better but as the dose would wear-off she would again start feeling the same. Then she visited a homoeopathic doctor who took her detailed case history and she was prescribed homoeopathic medicines. Within a period of 1 week she started feeling much better as the frequency and intensity of the night sweats and hot flushes had reduced. She started to feel more energetic and her emotional irritability was also much better. Menopause Menopause is a natural biological process with an end of fertility and the cessation or end of menses. This happens because there is a decrease in the secretion of hormones, oestrogen and progesterone by the ovaries. However, early menopause is noted in Indian women at child bearing age i.e. 24-34 years. Menopause can be distressing when it is accompanied by irregular periods or heavy bleeding, hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings, anxiety, anger, irritability and sleep disturbances. Other symptoms the patient could experience include headaches, dryness of the vagina, Urinary Tract Infections, Low Libido, Poor concentration or memory, bloating or less control over urination. Homoeopathy in Menopause Homeopathy is a truly holistic medicine. If a woman consults a [homeopath with menopausal](https://www.drbatras.com/menopause) problems - say hot flushes only - the homeopath will still look at the person as a whole, and not just prescribe a remedy for the hot flushes. This is called a constitutional remedy. If we prescribe in this way, the overall imbalance will be treated, the woman's hot flushes will go and her overall health will be improved. Sometimes, we come across women who have no other problems in their life, who just present with some specific menopausal symptoms; in these cases, prescribing on those symptoms alone will solve the problem. HRT (hormone replacement therapy) have known side-effects like bloating, breast tenderness or swelling, leg cramps, headaches and vaginal bleeding. Homeopathy is free from any side-effects. It is preferable to be treated by an experienced homeopath. Homoeopathy is a mind-body medicine. Homoeopathy treats not only the physical complaints, but also targets the mind and gently restores mind-body equilibrium- thus it treats the patient as a whole. Follow these tips to keep yourself healthy and strong during menopause. 1. De-stress Yourself It is important to keep your stress levels in check to prevent a hormonal imbalance.

You may want to consider taking a walk with a friend, joining a gym, going for a run, yoga or meditation. 3. Eat a Well Balanced Diet Eating a balanced, low-fat diet is your best defense against hormonal disturbances. Make sure you include an adequate amount of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables in every meal. It's also important to incorporate mono-saturated oils, such as olive oil and sesame oil, into your diet. Essential fatty acids also play a crucial role in maintaining hair health.
