We can now store biological material for a great length of time in biobanks: where biological samples (bodily fluid or tissue) and associated data are collected, annotated, transferred, stored and redistrib- uted for future research in order to improve our under- standing of health and disease. The process which enables the preservation of structurally intact livingcells and tissues is called \"cryopreservation.\" More specically, during cryopreservation, biological mate- rials cryogenic temperatures, commonly to -196 \u00b0C/-321 \u00b0F the temperature of liquid nitrogen. At these low temperatures, biological activity slows considerably, eectively halting the biochemical reac- tions that lead to cell death and DNA degradation and allowing for near indenite storage of the samples. Recent scientic advances in cryopreservation haveenabled the prospect of establishing \"living biobanks\" that store viable, functional tissue or replicable cell types for years to decades. This could have a signicant impact across basic biological research, medicine and the biopharma industry; however, the eects of such applications are underexplored. For example, banking and long-term storage of stem cells or stem-like cells in dierent stem cell platforms represent a fundamental resource, preserving the original features of stem cells for patient-specic clinical applications. 1 The International Society for Biological and Environ- mental Repositories ( ISBER ) recently held a roundtable discussion at the 2018 annual meeting on this concept, building on a National Science Foundation (NSF, U.S.)- funded technology road mapping process, the recent \"Organ Banking Summits\" held at Harvard and Stanford Universities, and roundtable discussions were held atthe White House and on Capitol Hill during the last sev- eral years. Further demonstrating the application and promise of these technologies, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) recently launched a new project entitled \"The Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI)\" which is a collaborative international consortium that is gener- ating novel, next-generation, tumour-derived culture models (living and clinical data. The \"Apollo Program\" of living biobanks The above meetings focused on developing a mini-\"Apollo Program\" in cryopreservation to lengthen the shelf-life of living tissues and whole organs. Early proofs of concept for such research advances includethe banking of whole sheep ovaries (resulting in live births), human digits, human cartilage, and a rabbit kidney at deep cryogenic temperatures and storage of organs such as rat hearts and rat livers at high subzero temperatures. The U.S. government is currently fund- ing dozens of labs to develop cryopreservation meth- ods for living tissues. This concept has received signicant support from diverse stakeholder organisa-tions such as (i) the International Society for Cryobiol- ogy, which has co-organised several meetings andsessions on the concept, and the (ii) American Society of Transplantation, which launched a new branch of itsorganisation focused on this concept. A number of organisations were signatories to a consensus article in Nature Biotechnology outlining the vast potential of these advances to change the landscape of medicine and biomedical research. 2 Researchers agree that many biobank tissues represent \"low hanging fruit\" in this eort, as the technical hurdles are much lower for collections of cells or simple tissues than for larger vascularized tissues or whole organs. There are a great number of tissues (or cells) and/orA group of seasoned experts from the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories explain the notion of employing \"living biobanks\" to advance the field of biomedical researchHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 7biologics that could soon be stored in \"living biobanks\". These can include solid tumour biopsies, organ and brain slices, resected brain tissue, cadaveric donor skin, cadaveric bone marrow, reproductive organs and tissues, pancreatic islets, a variety of neonatal tissues,and blood vessels. 3 \"The U.S. government is currently funding dozens of labs to develop cryopreservation methods for living tissues.

Techniques currently developed within the con- text of living biobanks and cryopreservation of living tissue can be applied in preclinical testing, designing disease models, biomarker discovery, toxicity (safety) evaluation of pharmaceutical agents, greatly improvedtissue quality for immunohistochemistry (IHC) leading, for example, to precision medicine approaches in thediagnoses and treatments of cancer types. 4 This same concept is already being applied to cell lines such as tumour and primary epithelial cells, for example, patient-derived xenograft models, organoids, conditionally reprogrammed cells, induced pluripotent cells, and other cancer precision medicine applications,these represent an unexhausted resource of living biobanks. However, these concepts are applied in verymany dierent ways by the academic and private sec- tors, representing an actively growing eld that has yet to reach clinical consensus or maturity. ISBER is launch- ing a special interest group to explore these and other applications. This group will unite stakeholders in these diverse areas, who will aim to provide (hopefullyuniversal) recommendations to guide the development of new biobanking technologies and ultimately the establishment of the rst living biobanks.Even without further advances in cryopreservationtechnology, the existing technological opportunities today can greatly expand the number and applicationsof living biobanks. However, key challenges need to be overcome in order to capitalise on these opportunities, including a clearer articulation of both the scientic and clinical impact, as well as of the prioritisation of funding and regulatory actions required to allow this emerging eld to reach its full potential.

Lewis Organ Preservation Alliance, Berkeley, California, U.S. International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories (ISBER) research drives the ability to treat mental illness Since the war on cancer was declared 50 years ago, billions of dollars have rightfully poured into cancer research. Comparatively, mental illness which aects the lives of one in four people, receivesa mere fraction of that amount of money for research. It is impossible to overstate the economic, social andpersonal toll mental illness takes on individuals and society. Mental illness is a real, treatable, medical condition that aects the brain. We know that livingwith a mental illness is not a choice, or something that's in someone's control - just like having any other medical condition. The time has come to declare war on mental illness and place a priority on funding innovative neurobio- logical research for better prevention, diagnosis, earlyintervention, and treatment. The eld of psychiatryand neuroscience has seen tremendous scientic advances, but we need to expand basic, translational and clinical research to better understand the workingsof the brain and why things go wrong and test new medical and psycho-social approaches. We also need to raise awareness, eliminate stigma, and remove barriers to treatment. A growing global problem While we are making progress, the evidence is over- whelming that mental illness is a signicant public health crisis. Suicide is now the 10th leading cause of death among American adults and the second leading cause of death for young people ages 10 to 24. Suicide rates have risen for every age group, except older adults. And a recent study in the British Medical Journal found that incidents of self-harm among girls aged 13 to 16 increased by 68% over a four-year period. We also continue to see an increase in psychiatric illnesses among veterans, and the rising death toll from alcohol and opiate abuse has decimated families and entire communities. Millions of people with seri- ous mental illnesses go untreated, and U.S. prisons and jails have tragically become de-facto psychiatric hospitals. Globally, psychiatric illness has become one of the major conditions aecting the health of the world pop- ulation. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that by 2030, depression will be the leading cause of disease burden. Supporting science research for recovery, BBRF funds the most innovative ideas in psychiatry and neuro- science to better understand the causes and develop new ways to eectively treat brain and behaviour disorders. These disorders include depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism, ADHD, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. BBRF grants support a broad range of the best ideas in brain research and our grantees have taken substantial steps forward on the path to developing new treatments and nding cures for mental illness. The Brain & Behavior Research Foundation (BBRF) sup- ports cutting-edge research that oers the greatest potential for breakthrough discoveries. These discover- ies are changing what it means to live with mental ill- ness. BBRF grants are focused on four priority areas: basic research to understand what happens in the brain to cause mental illness; new technologies to advance orcreate new ways of studying and understanding the brain; diagnostic tools and early intervention to recog- nise early signs of mental illness and treat as early aspossible; and next-generation therapies to reduceJeffrey Borenstein, of the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation (BBRF) argues that research drives the ability to treat mental illness and details why funding innovative neurobiological research is a priorityNEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES 9symptoms and ultimately cure and prevent brain and behaviour disorders. BBRF grants enable outstanding young scientists to begin a career in research as they look to answer important questions or help identify new potentially game-changing targets for treatments. In fact, a RAND Europe analysis of the global mental health research funding landscape found that we are the top non-governmental funder cited in published articles and virtually every scientic journal in psychia- try, neuroscience, molecular biology, and genetics includes articles on the research achievements of BBRFgrantees. Most importantly, BBRF grants have a proven multiplier eect and have led to additional funding from the government, university and industry sources. In fact, the $394 million in grants BBRF has awarded since 1987, has resulted in more than $3.9 billion in additional funding for scientists. Advances from BBRF grantees continue to dene the leading edge of all research in the mental health eld. Examples include the use of Clozaril for the treatment of schizophrenia, transcranial magnetic stimulation for depression and other conditions, deep brain stimula- tion for treatment-resistant depression, the ongoingdevelopment of rapid-acting anti-depressants, mag- netic stimulation therapy that can be used to treat depression without causing the memory loss that can happen with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and opto-genetics which helps scientists around the world to better understand the brain. Increase funding for mental illness now Now, more than ever, it is important to reduce stigma, prejudice and stereotypes about mental illness and encourage people who have a psychiatric condition not to suer in silence, but to seek help. By educating the public about the scientic and biological basis of psychiatric disorders, and the amazing progress we are making in brain and behaviour research, we hope tochange the culture. With so much that needs to be done, how do we make people pay attention to this issue? How do we increase funding for research and make mental health a top priority so that help is available to all who need it? \"Globally, psychiatric illness has become one of the major conditions affecting the health of the world population. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that by 2030, depression will be the leading cause of disease burden.\" Only through a combination of public and private fund- ing for high-risk, high-reward research will we generate signicant scientic discoveries that change the lives of people with mental illness and their families and impact our larger society. Our scientic understanding of how the brain works and what happens when illness occurs is helping to change people's attitudes about mental illness.Research has led to tremendous improvements in how we treat psychiatric conditions and the availability of better treatment has also changed people's attitudes. Research oers hope for further advances in treatmentand ultimately cures and methods of prevention and isthe key to helping people with a mental illness live full, productive, and happy lives.

The exquisitely precise laminar arrangement of neu- rons, axon collaterals and dendritic migratesuccessively from ventric- ular zones to coalesce into specific cor- tical layers. Abnormalities in neurons and defects in cortical inhibition have long been implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia, autism spectrum disor- ders (ASD), anxiety and depression. Brain development, however, like a gem that is cut with many facets that sparkle, is not limited to neuronalchanges but is also supported by con- comitant development of its vascula- ture. Correct functioning of the cerebral cortex necessitates the con- certed assembly of both vascular and neuronal networks. Here, I will discuss the progressive change in thoughtwith respect to brain blood vessels and its direct contribution to mental health illness from the earliest devel- opmental time points. Until a decade ago, blood vessels in the embryonic forebrain were believed to be a homogenous popula- tion of vessels, responding passively to the metabolic demands of growing neuronal populations. Our workdepicted the diversity in embryonic forebrain periven- tricular, based on anatomy, origin,growth patterns and developmental mechanisms 1. The tapering vessels joining the periventricular and pial vessels may represent the earliest arterial-venous communication. The periventricular vascular network develops in advance of and is inde- pendent of neuronal development by embryonic day 11 to act as a substrate and provide critical guidance cues to instruct key events that follow in the embryonic telencephalon, for instance, neurogenesis (birth of new neurons), radial migration of projection neuron precursors and tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons2,3. Interestingly, the periventricular vascu- lar network not only acts as a physical substrate for neuronal migration but also holds the key to several novel developmental mechanisms and path-ways. Gene expressions for biological processes and canonical maps contain- ing genes controlling neurogenesis,neuronal migration, chemotaxis, and axon guidance were enriched in periventricular endothelial cells, when compared to pial endothelial cells, signifying new and unknown roles 3. Pial endothelial cells, on the other hand, showed enrichment in inflammation and pathological process categories. When genes expressed in periventric- ular endothelial cells were classified according to disease categories, an enrichment was observed in psychi- atric disease categories3. Our studies, therefore, implicate a new cellular substrate - periventricular endothelialcells as being contributory to a wide swath of neuropsychiatric diseases with schizophrenia, epilepsy, bipolar, mood, depressive disorders and autism topping the list, shedding light on a new problem. Certainly, the problem is very signifi- cant because it means that we have focused on psychiatric illnesses from a neuronal perspective extensively when intrinsic defects within bloodvessels may be the actual trigger. These results also highlighted the great need to validate and under- stand the functional significance of novel genes expressed in periventric- ular endothelial cells/blood vessels and its disease symptoms. 10PROFILE Anju Vasudevan from McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School looks at the progressive change in thought around brain blood vessels and their direct contribution to mental health illnessThe vascular origin of mental health disorders So, we went on to investigate why genes traditionally believed to be con- fined to GABAergic interneurons were enriched in periventricular endothelial cells - among them were Gad1 and Gad2 - these encode GAD render endothelial GABAAreceptors dysfunc- tional or turn off GABA release from endothelial cells4. This led to the discovery of the novel vascular GABA signaling pathway operating via fore- brain endothelial cells that has an intricate and powerful control of prenatal brain development events - angiogenesis, neurogenesis and neuronal migration. Changes in this pathway left lasting signatures on cortical circuitry and blood flow in thepostnatal brain with consequences for behaviour 4. Dysfunction of endo - thelial GABAAreceptors was sufficient to cause behavioural abnormalities similar to psychiatric disease that was characterised by one or more of these core symptoms - impaired social recognition, reduced social interactions, communication deficits, increased anxiety or depression. On the other hand, complete loss of endothelial GABA release resulted in significant abnormalities in develop- mental milestones and led to a model reminiscent of childhood epilepsy or autism spectrum disorder. Alterations in postnatal behaviour were charac- terised by periods of quiescence, interrupted by tremors and a reduc-tion in voluntary movement and the mice failed to survive beyond two months of age. For the very first time, our studies describe how intrinsic defects within telencephalic vascula- ture/endothelial cells from the neuronal signaling pathways with far-reaching conse-quences for brain development and behaviour 4. It also highlights how vari- ations in vascular GABA levels can cause diversity in psychiatric symptoms4. We expect our work to bridge a gap between vascular biology and psychi- atry. Abnormal vascular pathologies and disturbances of cerebral blood flow have repeatedly been observed in patients with schizophrenia, autism, anxiety and depression using old and new technologies. However, these disturbances were usually linked to inflammation or changes in neural plasticity. Our project uncovers a direct cause of change in blood flow in psychiatric disorders that originatefrom intrinsic defects in blood vesselsfrom the earliest developmental points. There is a great need to better understand the spatiotemporal regu- lation of endothelial cell gene expres- sion and function in brain vascular networks at both developmental and adult stages in normal and disease conditions. The neuro-vascular com- munication initiated in the prenatal period is likely to acquire greater complexity after birth. Blood flow may provide spatial and temporal information, modulating excitation and inhibition in cortical circuits, thereby affecting representation. Therefore, if there is an intrinsic defect within brain endothelial cells, it has to be identified and corrected for the restoration of brain health. We hope to apply this new scientific knowledge not only to gain a deeper fundamental understanding of novel origins of psychiatric disease but also to generate new and effective treatments. In ongoing projects, we are tapping into the potential of embryonic periventricular endothelial cells/angiogenesis, in multiple ways to prevent the origin of diverse psychi- atric symptoms by rescuing vascular defects in the prenatal brain or bydeveloping vascular therapies for repair and regeneration in the postna- tal and adult brain. We envision a future where the 'healing touch' of angiogenesis therapy will bring relief to patients suffering from mental health disorders. Determination of brain blood vessel health should, therefore, become a part of our routine health visits and check-ups. References 1.

By passing the Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act (P.L. 115-406), Con- gress has authorised $100 million over ve years(FY20-FY24) to build and enhance the U.S.'s public health response to the Alzheimer's crisis. Public health initiatives work at the community level to protect and improve the health and safety of the entire population. This means safe water to drink, vaccines to prevent deadly diseases, interventions to reduce smoking, and emergency preparedness tools to savelives. Thanks to Congress, working together in bipartisan fashion, we can now also add to that list a nationwide public-health infrastructure that is expanding to pro- mote prevention and improve quality of life for those living with Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's poses a signicant threat to our nation, killing more people than breast and prostate cancer combined. Alzheimer's is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States, devastating more than 5 million Americans currently living with the disease, as well as their more than 16 million unpaid caregivers. The Alzheimer's Association estimates that these unpaid caregivers provided 18.4 billion hours of care valued at over $232 billion in 2017. Equally as staggering is the nancial burden Alzheimer's places on American soci- ety, with the direct costs of caring for those with the disease totalling $277 billion in 2018 alone. Unlesssomething is done, the Association projects those costscould rise as high as $1.1 trillion by 2050. But now, thanks to the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, millions across America have reasonto be hopeful. By creating a modern public-health infrastructure, the new law will help: improve early detection and diagnosis; reduce both health disparities and risks associated with avoidable hospitalisations and cognitive decline; enhance support to meet needs of caregivers; and support care planning and management. To help develop this infrastructure, the BOLD Infra- structure for Alzheimer's Act authorises $100 million over ve years to accomplish three critical initiatives: 1. Establish Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Public Health Centers of Excellence across the country. These Centers of Excellence will increase the education of public health ocials, health care professionals, and the public on Alzheimer's, brain health, and health disparities. The Centers will also provide technical assistance to public health depart- ments across the country in implementing eective Alzheimer's interventions and expand innovative public-private partnerships that focus on addressing the cognitive impairment and health disparities. 2. Award funding to State, local and tribal public health departments to implement Alzheimer's public health interventions focused on priorities like increasing early detection and diagnosis, reducing the risk of cognitive decline and preventing avoidable hospitalisa- tions. This funding will also help public health depart-ments implement strategic actions like those identied in the Healthy Brain Initiative's Public Health Road Map. Rachel Conant, Senior Director, Federal Affairs, Alzheimer's Association explains how bold action by the U.S. Congress delivers victory to the millions of people living with Alzheimer'sNEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES 133. Increase the analysis and timely public reporting of data on Alzheimer's, cognitive decline, caregiving, and health disparities. This data is critical to identifyingopportunities for public health interventions, helping stakeholders track progress in the public health response, and enabling state and federal policymakers to make informed decisions when developing plans and policies. \"Thanks to Congress, working together in bipartisan fashion, we can now also add to that list a nationwide public-health infrastructure that is expanding to promote prevention and improve quality of life for those living with Alzheimer's.\" While the CDC is preparing for the Act's implementation, determinations on awards for the Centers of Excel- lence and public health departments cannot happen until the Centers receive the FY20 funds appropriated by Congress. That timing will depend on the appropriations process in Congress this year, but it is likely CDC funding will be awarded and allocated in 2020. In the meantime, theAlzheimer's Association - working through its advocacyarm, the Alzheimer's Impact Movement - is continuing to work with allies in Congress and across the country to ensure these initiatives are implemented as quickly as possible. The sooner we can apply the public-health approach necessary for reducing risk, detecting early symptoms, and supporting caregivers, the sooner we can reverse Alzheimer's devastating trajectory.

However, predictive biomarker based treatment selection remains an elusive goal in the management of many women with this disease. Our group hasdeveloped a modeling tool to predict the likelihood of response to neo - adjuvant chemotherapy using patient specific tumor vasculature biomarkers. Here, we describe a novel integrated study based on a mathematical model utilizing tumor vasculature character- istics paired with patient data analysis to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in women with high risk hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative early stage breast cancer. We have pioneered a semi-automated analysis method that allows forincreased measurement accuracy and rapid throughput in rendering modelpredictions, with hundreds imagesanalyzed for each patient (Figure 1).

We correlated predicted outcome based on our model with actual clinical outcome, including rate of complete pathologic response (pCR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We found that core biopsy samples of primarybreast tumors can be used with acceptable accuracy to determine histological parameters representative of the whole tissue region. We further correlated response to neoadjuvantchemotherapy with the pretreatmenttumor vasculature biomarkers and model parameters. Analysis of histol- ogy parameters, specifically radius of drug source divided by diffusion pen- etration distance ( L/r b), a normaliza- tion penetration and blood volume fraction (BVF), provides a sep- aration of patients obtaining a patho- logic complete response (pCR) andthose that do not, with 80% accuracy (P = 0.0269) (Figure 2).

NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES 16Supporting vital Alzheimer's disease research in the U.S and beyond National Institute on Aging (NIA) is one of the 27 Institutes and Centers of the National Insti- tutes of Health (NIH) in the United States (U.S.). Their work concerns the leading, \"a broad scientic eort to understand the nature of ageing and to extend the healthy, active years of life\". (1)As a primary Federal agency, the National Institute on Aging supports and conducts Alzheimer's disease research. When it comes to research on ageing and the health and well-being of older people, the Institute aims to understand the nature of ageing and the process, aswell as the diseases and conditions associated with growing older, so that the healthy, active years of life can be extended. The Institute's mission can be summed up as follows: Supporting and conducting biological, clinical, genetic, behavioural, social, and economic research on ageing. Fostering the development of research and clinician scientists in the eld of ageing. Providing resources for research. Disseminating information on ageing and advances in research to healthcare professionals, the public, and the scientic community. In addition, we know that NIA pursues their mission by funding extramural research at medical centres and universities throughout the U.S. and further aeld; maintaining an active communication and outreach programme; and conducting research at NIA laboratories in Bethesda and, Baltimore, Maryland. (2) Alzheimer's disease research Looking at one aspect of the Institute's work, it's worthnoting that Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that gradually slowly destroys both memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks, and as such is irreversible. It is the most common cause of dementia in older adults and while it is more common as people grow older, it's not a normal aspect of ageing according to the Institute. (3) In recent research news, we nd out that researchers have been able to map how Alzheimer's pathology spreads across brain networks. Recent advances in genetic biomarker research and neuroimaging and genetic biomarker research have enabled scientists to identify two proteins, tau and beta-amyloid, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer's accumulating in the brain over a period of time. It was also discovered that the patterns of tau and beta-amyloid accumulation were related to specic genetic proles, which helps us to much better understand Alzheimer's disease risk and possible new avenues for monitoring and diagnosis and monitoring of the disease, in this tting example of NIA-supported research. (4) In other topical research news, we learn that takingpart in the arts could improve the health, well-being, and independence of older adults. Some specic example identied here include singing group pro- grammes, theatre training, and visual arts for older adults. Lisa Onken, PhD, of NIA's Division of Behavioraland Social Research, shares her thoughts on this most interesting piece of research in her own words. \"Researchers are highly interested in examining if and how participating in arts activities may be linked to improving cognitive function and memory and improving self-esteem and well-being. Scientists arealso interested in studying how music can be used to reduce behavioural symptoms of dementia, such asThe work of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) is placed into focus here, with examples of how they are supporting vital Alzheimer's disease research in the U.S and further afieldNEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES 17stress, aggression, agitation, and apathy, as well as promoting social interaction, which has multiple psychosocial benets.\" Picking up on the point about singing programmes identied earlier in this article, it's interesting to notethat in the view of Julene K. Johnson, PhD, of the Uni- versity of California, San Francisco School of Nursing: \"There's a pressing need to develop novel, sustainable, and cost-eective approaches to improve the lives of older adults. Singing in a community choir may be a unique approach to promote the health of diverse older adults by helping them remain active and engaged. It may even reduce health disparities.\" Those who took part in the community choir showed positive results within six months, in particular, it increased interest in life and reduced feelings of loneliness. \"The study showed increased interest in life because singing in the choir provided a regular, struc- tured activity for participants,\" notes Dr Johnson. \"Access to regular activities in diverse, low-income communities is vital for older adults to remain active and engaged in their community.\" Looking ahead, we know that NIA is addressing the need for more rigorous research that can demonstrate the ecacy and cost advantage of interventions when it comes to the arts. (5)In closing, I hope that the examples here demonstrate NIA's endeavour to lead on scientic eorts, for example, around Alzheimer's disease research, to understand the nature of ageing and to further the healthy, active years of life for older adults.

Few people predicted a cure for the rare, progres- sive neurodegenerative illness Huntington's dis-ease (HD). It is one of a range of pathologies caused by multiple repeating three base sequences.Specically, HD is an autosomal dominant disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the rst exon ofthe huntingtin gene (HTT) on chromosome 4. HTT is vitalto the viability of neurons. In HD, mutant HTT (mHTT) aggregates in neurons leading to the expression of long glutamine tracts, a cellular proteinopathy, which ulti-mately causes cell death predominantly in the striatum and cortex of the brain. 1 Suerers undergo progressive neurocognitive and psychiatric sequelae, including behavioural and mood changes, movement decits, choreiform movementsand ultimately death. 2 Age of disease onset is inversely proportional to thelength of the CAG repeat meaning that people with a higher burden of CAG repeats are diagnosed under the age of 20, dened as juvenile Huntington's disease. Juvenile HD is invariably more severe, and usually fatal within 20 years of diagnosis. Juvenile HD often presents with parkinsonian type rigidity, dystonia and bradyki- nesia, seizures and declining educational attainment. 3 The prevalence of HD is approximately 10 per 100,000, meaning that in the UK there are approximately 6,200 patients living with HD. Of these roughly 5% have juve- nile HD, which translates as approximately 300 patients under the age of 20 years. The diagnosis of HD is made on clinical grounds using the Unied Huntington Disease Rating Scale and subsequent genetic testing.4 Previous eorts to treat HD focussed on the pathophys- iological pathway with the aim of developing therapiesto ameliorate symptoms. Sadly, these have met withlimited success. 5The current focus of research is on a disease modication approach, with the prospect of halting the decline and a potential cure. Given that the underlying pathology is ascribed to a gene fault, researchers have seized on the possibility of either reducing the volume of mHTT circulating in the cerebrospinal fluid or even preventing the production of mHTT at source. \"The prevalence of HD is approximately 10 per 100,000, meaning that in the UK there are approximately 6,200 patients living with HD. Of these roughly 5% have juvenile HD, which translates as approximately 300 patients under the age of 20 years.\" The rst of these approaches has reached the phase 3 stage of a clinical trial with a medication called RG6042,which is an investigative antisense oligonucleotide treat-ment. RG6042 is a complementary molecule to HTT mRNA, which binds to the mRNA and signals protein destruction. Patients in this planned randomised con- trolled trial will have regular intrathecal administration of the RG6042 medication for two years. Results from previous trial phases of 46 adults with early-stage Huntington's demonstrated a reduction of mHTT in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by up to 60%. This dierence corresponds to an estimated 55% to 85% reduction of mHTT in the brain cortex and 20% to 50% in the caudate (a deep region) of the brain. 6Reducing mHTT should translate into a commensurate reduction in disease impact in HD. The second option entails a technique called gene silencing. Gene silencing of mHTT involves epigenetic modication of the expression of the mHTT gene. ThisDr Gerry Morrow shares his thoughts on the rare, progressive neurodegenerative illness, Huntington's disease (HD)19leads to inactivation of the mechanism of toxic proteins, which cause the death of neurons. This therapy thenprevents the manufacture of abnormal HTT protein. A gene-silencing treatment called AMT-130 is at an early stage of development. AMT-130 is an articial microRNA, which targets HTT mRNA. Early resultsdemonstrate eectiveness in animal models of the widespread localisation of AMT-130 in the brain andspinal cord, following a single injection. Phase 1 and 2 studies of this therapy are about to commence shortly. These interventions of destroying abnormal genetic material and gene silencing, oer the prospect of a perspective shift towards the prospect of cure and that there may be hope on the horizon for patients andfamilies of people with HD.

It calls for hands-on research experience and active mentorship. Sackler students receive rigorous training to become independent scientists. We also instil in them a strong sense of social and ethical responsibility through interactions with our diverse researchcommunity. PhD programme Students matriculating at NYU Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences begin their training in an Open Program. While some studentsenter graduate school with a speciality in mind, in the Open Program students are encouraged to explore multiple fields. First-years wait toselect a training discipline until they have taken several courses, completed two or three laboratory rotations, and selected a faculty mentor for their PhD thesis work. They have a full year to make final decisions. We recently expanded the scope of our program to include new training tracks in Biomaterials Science, Bio- statistics, and Epidemiology, in addi- tion to all of the existing traditional disciplines in biomedical sciences. Aswe recruit students interested in the new tracks, we are faced with balanc- ing the unique background of each student with the spirit of the Open Program. How can the curriculum of anOpen Program satisfy students with varying interests and backgrounds? To address this challenge all incoming students are required to take the course Introduction to Research, which starts immediately after Orientation with an immersive lab experience called Research Adventure. The Intro- duction to Research course is intended to not only help incoming students begin graduate school with the samebasic knowledge, but also to providethem with a sense of community. The Research Adventure is an inten- sive, week-long, hands-on research experience, where students working in a team carry out a structured project in a faculty's lab on a topic different from their previous research. This exposes them to new possibilities that perhaps they may not have considered. We continue to evaluate best practices to keep the spirit of the Open Program alive while accom- modating the different interests and backgrounds of our matriculating students. Career In higher education, there is an increas- ingtrend for PhD students to pursue alternative careers (non-academicpositions). For this reason, we strive to prepare them for any career. Weemphasise how PhD training teaches students to be critical thinkers, prob- lem solvers, productive team members,collaborators, independent workers, and effective leaders. These are qual- ities useful to any career path. NYU's centre for career development offers services such as resume and cover letter preparation as well as networking and interviewing practice sessions. Students participate in many job and internship fairs. We also invite alumni back to give career talks and meet with students to discuss their experiences. Our students also take advantage of a variety of workshops and courses offered by the postdoctoral affairs office. To improve their career train- ing, they actively engage in career planning while assessing their per- sonal values and translating them to individual goals. They are introduced to all the diverse career opportunities outside of academic research. For those interested in teaching, students learn how to design and implement courses both at the college and post-graduate level. Communication is another skill critical to any career. We host workshops and seminars to help our students with their commu-nication skills, both written and oral, to a variety of audiences. Inspiring the next generation The future of our society depends on training the next generation of highly capable scientific workforce. For thisThe NYU Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences aims to train the next generation of scientists to make breakthroughs and advances in society at large, explains Naoko TaneseProviding a path to advanced degrees in biomedical fields 20PROFILEreason, we place a great deal of effort in mentoring young people interested in pursuing careers in science. We are increasingly wary of losing students' interests in STEM - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. We are also concerned that not enough young people from diverse back- grounds are entering the STEM field. The current makeup of scientists in biomedical fields does not reflect thecomposition of the US population. Numerous studies have reported the benefits of a diverse research commu- nity in advancing scientific endeavours. We are committed to making thishappen by reaching out to students from diverse racial, ethnic, and socioe-conomic backgrounds. One mechanism that has been in place at the Sackler Institute is our Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP). Established in 1990, the SURP has been one of the cornerstones of minority recruitment for MD, PhD, and MD/PhD programs. The purpose of SURP is to give students who have the interest in biomedical sciences an opportunity to conduct research at a major medical centre. Over 700 students have participated in this program and >95% of the participants subsequently entered graduate or professional degree programs. We make an effort to provide a supportive community where students from allbackgrounds feel at home. This is critical to our mission to promote diversity and inclusion at the Sackler Institute. In many ways, STEM training needs to start earlier than college. We have been reaching out to students innearby high schools to introduce them to scientific research. It's never too early to show them what it's like to be a grown-up scientist. We have visited local schools to give presentations and met one-on-one with young students. We have invited them to research laboratories to observe scientists at work, and in some cases perform experiments as student interns. Ambitious and determined students commit to commuting long distances for these hard-to-find opportunities to satisfy their curiosity and challenge themselves to unfamiliar but exciting tasks. Some students never give up looking for a chance to enter research labs. This makes it worthwhile to mentor and see them thrive in a new environment. Scientific discoveries are made by following one's passion. We are here to inspire young people to find their passion in the biomedical sciences.

Until that time, research on communication sciences had been supported by the NIH through the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (now the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ). Individuals with hearing loss, researchers, clinicians, and professional societies worked together to advocate Congress to authorise a new institute at NIH. For just over 30 years, the NIDCD has brought national attention to disorders involving hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and language. NIDCD contributesto advances in biomedical and behavioural research that improve the lives of the millions of people with these disorders. Hearing and balance Hearing loss and balance dysfunction can occur at any age and can aect communication, safety, and quality of life. The NIDCD's robust program of basic and clinical research on hearing and balance includes genetics, genomics, and proteomics. This research focuses, in part, on the identication of genes involved in hearing loss, which can lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment, and to new therapies. The NIDCD also supports innovative clinical and trans- lational research to lay the foundation for making hearing health care more accessible and aordable. Even though nearly 30 million adults in the UnitedStates could benet from using hearing aids, only one in four has used them. Current research includes iden- tifying barriers to hearing health care and assessing novel service delivery and screening models. Researchers are also applying cochlear implant tech- nology to develop other neural prostheses. These devices will, for example, provide a sense of hearing for people whose auditory nerve is removed or dam- aged; normalise balance by electrically stimulating the vestibular nerve, and; help patients with severe speech and physical impairments express themselves usingspeech synthesized from brain-computer interfaces. 2018 also coincided with the 10th anniversary ofNIDCD's It's a Noisy Planet, Protect Their Hearing.\u00ae health education campaign , aimed at increasing awareness of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and how to prevent it. NIHL can happen to people at any age, so the campaign teaches kids and their parents and educators three key messages - turn down thevolume, move away from the noise, and wear hearing protectors, such as earplugs and earmus. Balance disorders can be quite disabling, impairing mobility and often leading to falls. NIDCD-supportedscientists are examining how the brain interprets information from the ear's vestibular organ. NIDCD clinical researchers are also developing rehabilitationprocedures and prosthetic devices to improve the quality of life for individuals with balance disorders. Taste and smell - the chemical senses NIDCD-supported research helps us understand how our senses of taste and smell relate to our health and well-being and allow us to interact with our environ-The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders charts the work of their organisation over the last 30 years that concerns research around the communication sciences, including deafnessHEARING RESEARCH 23ment. NIDCD-funded scientists study many aspects of taste and smell, from how we rst detect odours andtastes through sensory cells in the nose and taste buds in the tongue and mouth to how the brain regions involved in the central processing of incoming taste and smell information function. Scientists are also working to better understand how taste and smell sensory cells are regenerated or replaced across the lifespan by underlying stem cells. These studies may someday help scientists develop ways to restore theloss of taste and smell due to chemotherapy, ageing, injury, or disease. The NIDCD encourages clinical research to improve the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of taste and smell disorders in all age groups. More clinical and epidemiological studies will help us better understand how factors such as nutrition, early dietary experiences, individual genetic variation, ageing, infection, and disease aect chemosensory sensitivities and taste and smell disorders. Voice, speech, and language NIDCD research is leading to improved identication and treatment of voice, speech, and language disorders such as spasmodic dysphonia, stuttering, and specic language impairment (SLI). In addition, scientists continue to identify genes responsible for persistent stuttering, which may be inherited from family members. Other ongoing research is focused on ways to improvecommunication in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including the 25 to 30% of children with ASD who remain functionally non-verbal beyond age ve. NIDCD-supported research also addresses voice, speech, and language impairments linked to injury, stroke, and neurodegenerative disorders. These com- munication problems - such as aphasia, dysarthria,and apraxia - often lead to increased isolation andpoor quality of life. Future directions As we head toward new frontiers in scientic discovery and precision medicine, the NIDCD is well-positioned to support innovative studies to produce more sensi- tive, eective, and individually tailored interventions. NIDCD-supported researchers are dedicated toexpanding our understanding of the normal processes of hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and language and improving rehabilitation strategies for children and adults who face the challenges of communication disorders. About the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) NIDCD supports and conducts research and researchtraining on the normal and disordered processes of hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and lan- guage and provides health information, based uponscientic discovery, to the public. About the National Institutes of Health (NIH) NIH, the U.S.'s medical research agency, includes 27 institutes and centres and is a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH is theprimary federal agency conducting and supporting basic, clinical, and translational medical research, andis investigating the causes, treatments, and cures for both common and rare diseases. National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders news@nidcd.nih.govwww.nidcd.nih.gov/ www.twitter.com/NIDCD @NIDCD Geraldine Dietz Fox, a patient advocate, testifies in support of the NIDCD in the institute's early years. Ms Fox was instrumental in the establishment of the instituteImage: \u00a9 Geraldine Dietz Fox, personal communicationEver since Rita Levi-Montalcini, Stanley Cohen, and Viktor Ham- burger discovered the first neu- rotrophin over a half-century ago,1,2 scientists have continuously worked on characterising this class of pro- teins, its receptors, and its signalling pathways. What has been revealed is that the complexity of neurotrophin actions are immense; not only do neu- rotrophins determine the fate of brain cells, known as neurons, they also reg- ulate proliferation, survival, differenti- ation, migration and neuronal death3. Neurotrophins behave differently depending on their location in the nervous system, developmental time period, and species of animal,4acting on a multitude of key biological path- ways and functions.5 Three primary neurotrophins and their corresponding receptors are known today. They are nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptor, tyrosine receptor kinase A (TrkA), 6-12However, due to the lack of available pharmacological tools, as well as discovery order, the literature on the actions of NT-3/TrkC signalling is less when compared to the other neurotrophins. The literature that does exist, however, tells a complex story regarding the function of NT-3/TrkC signalling.Research shows that TrkC induces cell death without NT-3 activation,4,13 implicating alternate signalling path- way that involves TrkC but not NT-3. Complicating matters more is the fact that TrkC also has multiple isoforms with each behaving differently.14 Despite these obstacles, recent research strongly suggests that NT- 3/TrkC pathway deserves to be stud- ied not only because of its biological, but also clinical significance,15,16espe- cially in terms of neurological diseases and the advent of pluripotent stem cells.17-20In this research profile, we briefly describe areas of established research in the brain, as well as high- lighting mechanisms of NT-3/TrkC signalling in the auditory system - an area of interest for our laboratory. The hippocampus In the hippocampus, where neuronal plasticity is heavily dependent on neu-rogenesis and differentiation to inte- grate into neural networks,21the NT- 3/TrkC signalling pathway plays an active role in maintaining network architecture. Learning and memory are reliant on this; animals that lack NT-3/TrkC signalling have deficits in memory tasks.22It was recently dis- covered that NT-3/TrkC also facilitates synaptogenesis by interacting with a molecule known as PTP .23-27This was a novel discovery because the classi- cal model argues that Trk receptors interact only with neurotrophins. Atthe cellular level, the story becomes more complex. Injecting NT-3 into hip- pocampus neurons permits signals to travel backwards from the axon to the cell body. 28This phenomenon, called retrograde axonal transport, indicates a continued targeted effect in the cell body of neurons, a site where multiple survival-promoting effects are initi- ated. Not only does the NT-3/TrkCMomoko Takahashi, a Doctoral Student at Northwestern University, explains the complex research of neurotrophin signalling in the nervous system in this reportComplexity of neurotrophin signalling in the nervous system 24PROFILE pathway promote axonal transport, but it also regulates the location of the axon initial segment, altering neu- ronal excitability and action potential dynamics.29 The cerebellum and Purkinje cells In the cerebellum, the unique and large dendritic architecture of Purk- inje cells shed an interesting light onto NT-3/TrkC signalling. With the genetic deletion of TrkC, elaborate dendritic arborisation of Purkinje cells is mini- mal; however, the fact that dendritic structure is not entirely eliminated suggests that NT-3/TrkC signalling plays another role in dendritic main- tenance. Removal of endogenous NT- 3 alleviated the reduction of dendritic arborisation, indicating that the NT- 3/TrkC pathway controls the neigh- bouring neuron's dendrite structure in order to maintain a particular density of dendritic architecture within this specific brain region.30-32 The auditory system Several lines of research suggest that the auditory system is dependent on neurotrophin signalling for its proper function and the field of auditory neural science can yield a wealth of knowledge if delved further. Still, the study of NT-3/TrkC signalling in the auditory system can also be a com- plex endeavour, in part due to the topological gradients of TrkB and TrkC that coexist in same brain regions. For example, the chicken auditory system shows an interesting developmental pattern that is reliant on both Trk receptors.8However, a global genetic deletion of either protein can be fatalto the animal, and therefore, methodslike the one reviewed in our previous research profile - e.g., focal gene manipulation via in ovoelectropora- tion - must be used to further eluci- date its functions (please see Open Access Government, January 2019 issue, pages 130-33 ). In terms of auditory functions, NT- 3/TrkC does several crucial things. It plays a role in regulating action poten- tial properties of auditory neurons in the peripheral pathway;33our labora- tory has discovered that this happens in the central system as well. Here, neurotrophin signalling regulatesaction potential kinetics by maintain- ing a balance between different types of potassium channels. 34We suggest that this function is critical in estab- lishing normal tonotopic gradients, a biological process required for the neural encoding of different sound frequencies. Similarly, NT-3/TrkC sig- nalling modifies potassium conduc- tance of inner hair cells in guinea pigs, depressing responses and permitting repetitive action potential firing.35It also increases calcium currents in the chicken inner ear, promoting moreefficient synaptic transmission 36and in mice, it is involved in main- tenance and neuronal migration of the auditory nerve.6 With respect to hearing, correct levels of NT-3/TrkC signalling is required to maintain inner ear health. For exam- ple, NT-3 induces synapse regenera- tion in the inner ear and can repair synapses after acoustic trauma in mice.15Similarly, overexpressing NT-3 protects inner ear synapses by pro- moting its repair after noise-induced synaptopathy in guinea pigs.37Con-versely, excessive levels of NT-3 in the inner ear can also disrupt the synapticnetwork of the same species and therefore, negatively affect hearing properties. 38This suggests that the inner ear requires just the right amount of NT-3 in order for TrkC sig- nalling to be effective in maintaining normal hearing health. What does this all mean? Few things can be assumed from studies in both normal and abnormal NT-3/TrkC sig- nalling. One conclusion is that due to its ubiquitous presence, a careful study of NT-3/TrkC temporal and spa-tial expression is necessary before embarking on clinical applications. Nevertheless, research studies in the brain and auditory system suggest that targeting the NT-3/TrkC pathway shows promise as a non-invasive and effective method to treat neurologicaland auditory ailments.

To mark this important anniversary, we spoke to Dr Carolyn M. Hutter, PhD, Director, Division of Genome Sciences at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to learn more about their excellent work, including their role in applying genome technologies to the study of human health and disease. Genomics is a wide-ranging area and this interview covers some fascinating aspects of this,including understanding variation in the human genome and improving human health through genomics research. By way of background, the NHGRI grew out of the international HGP project. Since the formation of NHGRI in 1997, the Institute has expanded in terms of what they do. Carolyn tells us that NHGRI is guided by a series of strategic plans, the most recent of which was published in 2011 and focuses on thinking about research from the bench to the bedside. She explains this point further, describing the ambitions of the Institute in her own words.In this interview, Dr Carolyn M. Hutter, PhD, Director, Division of Genome Sciences at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) outlines the important role of research when it comes to applying genome technologies to studying diseaseBIOLOGY 29\"We continually study everything from the structure of genomes all the way through to the application ofgenomics in clinical settings. At the moment, we are starting new strategic planning for our Genome 2020 vision. We kicked this o in February 2018 and areplanning to have nished in October 2020 which marks the 30th anniversary of the start of the HGP. \"The Institute is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), one of the 27 Institutes and Centers within NIH, and our remit is centred around how we use genomics to understand human health. NHGRI doesn't fund all genomics but we consider ourselves to be at the fore- front of the eld. We recognise that other parts of theNIH are increasingly funding genomics and we collab- orate with these groups and a number of international partners.\"The Human Genome Project (HGP): From basic to clinical science With the human genome sequence complete since April 2003, Carolyn then details the various ways in which scientists around the world have benetted from this in the years since. This goes from basic through to clinical science in terms of how we think about things when it comes to genomics. She says thatsome argue that the HGP has not yet been completed because we do not yet have full sequencing for very complex areas of the genome. Carolyn then develops this thought further. \"The completion of the HGP really provided this initial backbone for that a much more specic sequencing and understanding of the structure on which of the human genome can be built on. It allows a blueprint upon which all of these other activities can happen. One of these is driving the technology and the innovation needed to sequence genomes, including the complex regions, faster, cheaper and more accurately. Thoseare the three things that we are always looking for in this area. \"You can also think about what it really means to understand the genome, including 3D or 4D structure of genomes. Another example is projects like The ENCODE Project: ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements,which are addressing the fact that we have not fully understood what all the genes are doing, or what all the non-coding parts of the genome doing? How do we catalogue them, start to elucidate their function, and put together pieces of that whole picture?\" Understanding variation in the human genome Carolyn says that you can then layer on top of that additional questions, such as can we understand the variation in the genome? Or what does the variation of the genome tell us about population genetics and pop- ulation structure or about the relationship between the variation in the genome and disease? She then provides more detail to us about this compelling point in her own words. \"As we start to understand the variation of the genome in relation to disease, we need to move from justsaying that a part of the genome is associated with the disease to understanding the causal relationships andBIOLOGY 30the mechanisms. How do we go from understanding this part of the genome is associated with the diseaseto translate that into ways that can benet public health and clinical medicine?\" Improving human health through genomics research The interview then turns to look at on interesting examples of NHGRI's work to improve the health of all humans through advances in genomics research. Carolyn stresses that their focus as an Institute is on the technologies, methods and resources to move the eld of genomics forward. Although NHGRI does not have a disease focus, they do participate in exemplary disease-focused projects. As an example, they part- nered with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), another branch of the NIH in the U.S., on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Carolyn noted the impact of that project on our understanding of cancer, before moving the conversation to detail more of NHGRI's research work and the priorities for the future in this vein. \"We have a number of Genomic Medicine programmes, such as the Clinical Sequencing Evidence-GeneratingResearch (CSER) program that maps the impact of sequencing in clinical settings. Importantly, we are also building the basic understanding of the relationship between a genome and disease which is fundamentally needed to have an impact in clinical settings. \"Questions about the future priorities for genomics research and its applications to human health and disease are a key part of our Strategic Planning eorts, as mentioned above. We are really excited to have this opportunity to reach out into the community, throughworkshops and social media, for example, to get feed- back. We have internally organised ourselves around key areas that cover basic genomics and technology, genomics of disease, genomic medicine and health, genomics and data science, and genomics in relation to education and societal issues. In all of these areas, we look forward to getting input over the next year and a half on what people see as important questions at the forefront of genomics, and to see what ideas and key areas move to the top. \"One of these key areas we have already identied is the question of how you go from variation to function to disease, and how to study this at scale in order to gain biological insight into the nature of inherited disease, insight into functional mechanisms, and ultimately to provide a rational foundation for clinical applications. We are also seeing a real need to further identify what types of genomics are ready to go into medicine and how do we eectively implement them to get there? We are also addressing how to bring together recent advances in computational biologyand big data in an integrative way that allows for innovation in genomics. Important work in all of these areas is already happening, but we need to take these to the next level and draw on the exciting scientic ndings that will come out of doing that type of eort well.\" Accelerating scientic and medical breakthroughs to improve human health In closing, Carolyn shares her thoughts on how toaccelerate scientic and medical breakthroughs that improve human health. She noted that as a funder, NHGRI spends a lot of time thinking about their need for a really well-balanced portfolio. As such, NHGRI needs to make sure that activity is happening at the right level in all these aforementioned areas. \"Certainly, you don't want to go too far with investments in one specic area, because you never know where you are going to have the most important break- throughs. This is especially true for a transdisciplinary area like genomics. In addition, we are constantly balancing the need to support fundamental resources and approaches, versus really high-risk approacheswhere it is less clear that they are going to pay o, but when they do a giant leap is made. Another area we consider is how best to balance large-scale collaborative research and consortia, versus investigator-initiated projects. \"It's important that we have balance in terms of what we are funding and what we are doing in order to enable the scientic advances and breakthroughs.\" Dr Carolyn M.

Males of this species are amazing parents involved in all aspects of care of the young except nursing. Males even help to \"midwife\" their partner's labour and help her cut the umbilical cord at birth. Extended families form around the original pair, as prairie vole fathers and then older offspring remain in the natal nest, scrupulously avoiding incest. Males and females are about the same size and they jointly defend theirfamily and resources. Taken together biologists have called this set of behavioural and physical traits \"monogamy.\" The monogamy paradox Because prairie vole pairs were shar- ing a nest and raising babies together, we initially assumed that they also were sexually monogamous. But when we tried to test this assumption, voles of both sexes did not cooperate - often mating with strangers. As DNA fingerprints became available, manyprairie voles again failed the genetic tests for sexual monogamy. Similarfindings emerged in other apparently monogamous mammals including humans, and most species of birds. Some individuals were sexually monogamous, but when viewed at the level of a species, sexual monogamy was rare or non-existent. Given the opportunity, both male and female prairie voles were willing tohave sex outside of the pair bond. However, once mating was complete, strangers or nonfamily members were often attacked. Like a reality TV show gone wrong, we discovered that male prairie voles were raising, as their own, babies fathered by other males. We slowly began to accept the notion that social attachments are real and have causes and consequences similar to what humans call \"love.\" \"I hope we don't lose sight of one thing. It was all started by a mouse,\" (Walt Disney) The term monogamy is derived fromthe Greek for a single wedding or ritual, and does not speak to sexual choices. Considered across the lifespan, many humans have more than one sexual partner. None of this is shocking. But we now understand that the traits of social monogamy are a kind of syn- drome with shared neurobiological underpinnings. Our terminology had to be adjusted to admit that what we were observing was more accurately termed \"social monogamy.\" Hormonal ties that bind Prairie vole families are bound together by invisible social bonds. As we searched for a mechanism for social monogamy, we found in both male and female voles that pair bonds were cemented by powerful molecules synthesized in the brain. These hormones were released by socialexperiences, including sexual interac- tions and even the presence of a baby. In turn these brain-derived chemicals regulate social engagement, pair bond formation and parental behaviour. In addition, following mating, aggression toward strangers increased, and behaviours that looked suspiciously like \"jealousy\" emerged. However, as might be expected protective aggres- sion toward intruders is based on a somewhat different cocktail of hor- mones than those needed to create loving relationships between pairs or directed toward a baby. Two molecules, oxytocin and vaso- pressin, made primarily in the brain are at the epicentre of social monogamy. However, it has taken decades and the help of prairie voles to untangle these relationships. These deceptively simple molecules are capable of bind- ing to each other's receptors, creatingvarious emotional states that support many behavioural permutations. In addition, oxytocin and vasopressin and their receptors are exquisitely sensitive to experience. In fact, prairie voles are teaching us that the genes regulating receptors for oxytocin and vasopressin can be switched off or on across the life cycle. Life's most important experiences - sexual experiences, birth, the presence or absence of sensitive parenting, exposure to hormones in early life, extreme stress and traumas - are all \"epigenetic\" events regulated bySue Carter, Director of The Kinsey Institute, discusses the fascinating nature of prairie voles and explains how they can teach us about the biology of \"love\"The biology of \"love\": Lessons from prairie voles 32PROFILEmolecular changes with long lasting effects on the genome. This is one of several mechanisms through which the consequences of love protect us across our lifespans, and through which the absence of love leaves usvulnerable. Love heals and allows us to be human Studies of prairie voles, and compar- isons to nonmonogamous mammals forced us re-imagine concepts like monogamy and love. Selective attach- ments, and well as parenting, are supported by a comparatively simple brain and ancient neural and endocrine pathways. Human cognition, a complex nervous system or even gonadal hormones are not essential to allow pair bonds to form or infant nurture to emerge. However, in voles - as in humans - these are influenced bysocial context including fear, safety, and the emotional history of the individual. Social behaviours, such as pair bonding and parenting, are hormonally- supported and interact with emotions that facilitate good health, a sense of safety and eventually health and survival. Furthermore, nature is con- servative and the same hormones are used over and over again across the life cycle and in different species of mammals, where they support variations in social behaviour and aggression across species and individ- uals, as well as sex differences inbehaviour. Brain regions involved in pair bondformation and parenting also are shared with other forms of rewarding experiences, and with the neural pathways involved in drug addiction. The absence or loss of love createsvulnerability to substance abuse, depression and other forms of mental and physical illness. Knowledge ofthese relationships helps to explain why love is rewarding, but also can be addictive, and why the loss of a partner or loved one may be experienced as physical pain or illness. The biology of \"love\" is intertwined with the biology of reproduction and basic survival in a dangerous world. This is true of both voles and humans. Love and its consequences operate largely below the level of human consciousness. However, prairie voles have taught us that love is constructed from biological mechanisms that are shared with other mammals. Using insights from prairie voles, we are discovering that the same moleculesthat support love facilitated human evolution, now allow us to survive and thrive, help create culture, and may even help to explain how and why \"love is good medicine.\" Suggested reading Oxytocin pathways and the evolution of human behavior. 2014 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24050183 The oxytocin-vasopressin pathway in the context of love and fear. 2017 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Carter+love+and+fear The monogamy paradox: What do love and sex have to do with it? 2018 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2018.00202/full Early nurture epigenetically tunes the oxytocin 2019http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/html5/reader/produc- tion/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=14e30abb-c333-43f5-b63d- 31e069aee049&pnum=182 https://biology.indiana.edu/about/faculty/carter-sue.html Sue Carter DirectorThe Kinsey Institute Rudy Professor of Biology Indiana University Bloomington, IN 47405cscarter@indiana.edu 33PROFILE BIOLOGY 34Progressing science in the U.S. - Enabling discoveries for understanding life The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency created back in 1950 by U.S. Congress, \"to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defence\". We know that NSF is crucial because they support basic research and the people that do this to create knowledge thatchanges the future. (1)The number of research areas supported by the NSF is staggering and includes Biological Sciences (BIO), Education and Human Resources (HER), Geosciences (GEO), Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS) and Social, Behavioral and Eco-nomic Sciences (SBBE). Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) Looking at just one of these areas, let's take a look now at the mission of the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) and some examples of the excellent work theysupport. In short, their work essentially enables discov- eries for understanding life itself, indeed, BIO-supported research furthers the frontiers of knowledge when it comes to biology, as well as increasing the understanding of complex systems and supplying a theoretical basisfor original research in numerous other disciplines of science. Within the remit of BIO, research studies encompass biological molecules, communities, cells, organs, organisms, populations, tissues and ecosystems up to and incorporating the global biosphere. The website of BIO provides us with an excellent overview of the major challenges of reaching a coherent understanding of life itself. \"This challenge will require that knowledge about the structure and dynamics of individual biological units,networks, sub-systems and systems be compiled and connected from the molecular to the global level and across scales of time and space. Integral to all activities across the directorate is a commitment to integrateresearch and education, broaden participation, and promote international partnerships.\" (2) In terms of the leadership, we nd out that in February this year, the NSF selects D. Joanne Tornow to serve as Head of the Directorate for BIO. Her wealth of expe- rience at NSF includes a focus on accountability, as well as supporting cross-disciplinary, convergent research that plays on the strengths of scientists and engineers to solve problems. \"Dr Tornow is an experienced manager who brings a wealth of knowledge to BIO and the NSF leadership team\", says NSF Director France C\u00f3rdova. \"Joanne has spent the past year leading BIO in an acting capacity and has already demonstrated that this critical compo- nent of NSF is in good hands. I look forward to seeing BIO's progress under her leadership.\" We know that exciting discoveries from NSF-funding include unearthing a new branch on the tree of life with archaea, the revolutionary CRISPR genome editing tool, as well as advancing other scientic areas, and enhancing other elds and making new ones. \"I fell in love with biology in the ninth grade and have been a biologist ever since. I have a long history with the BIO directorate, a place that was my rst home at NSF and one of my favourite places to work,\" Tornow comments. \"I am honoured to lead BIO at a particularly exciting time of discovery across the spectrum of the biological sciences.\" (3)The work of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to advance science is charted here, with a focus on the work of their Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) in enabling discoveries for understanding lifeBIOLOGY 35There are a number of interesting examples of how this support for the biological sciences is being given in terms of projects funded. One is led by University at Bualo physicist Andrea Markelz who reports the development of a method for rapidly measuring proteins' unique vibrations. (4)By way of background, we know that proteins vibrate with microscopic motions that help them perform essential tasks like photosynthesis and from cell repair, which is true for the cells of every living organism - humans, bees, birds, roses and even bacteria. \"Within the remit of BIO, research studies encompass biological molecules, communities, cells, organs, organisms, populations, tissues and ecosystems up to and incorporating the global biosphere. The website of BIO provides us with an excellent overview of the major challenges of reaching a coherent understanding of life itself.\" New possibilities in biological research could occur, such as studying the microscopic motions of proteins in a more ecient way. The new technique could enable scientists to quickly assess whether pharmaceuticalsdesigned to inhibit a protein's vibrations are working. \"Proteins are elegant and robust nanomachines that nature has developed\", explains Markelz, PhD, at the UB College of Arts and Sciences. \"We know nature uses molecular motions to optimise these machines. By learning the underlying principles of this optimisation,we can develop new biotechnology for medicine, energy harvesting and even electronics.\" (5) There are so many other interesting examples of research funded this year, including a study which reveals the way in which a group of deep-sea microbes gives clues to the evolution of life on Earth, according to a paper in the ISME Journal. (6)Another example comes from Rice University and concerns protein sig- nalling in the rapidly dierentiating cells of embryos, which are believed to be more complex than previously thought.(7) In closing, it's amazing to think that the scope of this article only covers a fraction of the NSF's wonderfulwork. If we think about the wider picture, we know that in scal year (FY) 2019, the NSF's budget totals $8.1 bil- lion. Add to this, the fact this funding reaches all 50 states of the U.S. to almost 2,000 universities, collegesand other respectable institutions. Every year, over 50,000 competitive proposals for funding are received by the NSF. 12,000 new funding awards are made annually. Fundamental research and education across all elds of science and engineering, including the bio- logical sciences is set to continue into the future.

Tissue water content (TWC) varies from from 50%- 80% depending on age, location on the body, physiologic state, and so on. Many diseases can perturb this fraction and medical research today has dedi- cated profound time and resources developing diagnostic systems, tools, and algorithms to detect and charac- terise these abnormal changes in TWC. A system familiar to many is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses precisely tuned magnetic fields and RF pulses to form volumetrically resolved maps of body water content. Brain tumour imaging, blood perfusion anal- ysis, and spinal joint assessment are among the countless possibilities with MRI generated TWC maps. However, magnetic fields are difficult to charac- terize at boundaries between tissue and air, therefore, quantitative assess- ment of surface tissue water content is extremely difficult. One important, water-rich, surface tissue system not currently accessible with MRI is the cornea. The cornea is the outer most layer of the human eye (Figure 1) and principally composed of collagen and water in mass fractions of ~ 21% and 79% respectively. The tough but optically transparent tissue pro- tects the delicate structure of the eye from the outside environment and is responsible for the majority of thefocusing power of the human optical system. The bottom layer of the cornea (endothelium) sits adjacent to a water volume called the aqueous humour (Figure 1). The role of the endothelium is to actively pump water from the cornea and back into the aqueous humour to maintain 79% water and, therefore, ensure optical clarity. Pertur- bations from the 79% water lead to significant vision degradation. A common disease that attacks theendothelium's pumping efficiency isFuchs endothelial corneal dystrophywhich affects ~40% of the world's population over 40 years of age. A reduction in pumping efficiency leads corneal hyperhydration and then corneal edema due to uncontrolled dif- fusion of water from the aqueous humor to the stroma (Figure 1). Edema is readily apparent from increased corneal thickness and significant optical opacity. This gives the cornea a \"milky\" or glazed over appearance. Corneal edema and, therefore, disease detection via visual assessment ofopacity is straightforward but it is diffi- cult to treat the disease at this point in 36PROFILE Figure 1: The patient-to-patient geometric variation of the cornea (thickness and radius of curvature) is fractions of a wavelength in the THz frequency range. The average thickness varies by 0.3 mm which is fractions of a wavelength at THz and millimetre wave/. The radius of curvature (RoC) range is even smaller at 0.2 mm.Early detection of corneal disease with THz and millimetre wave frequency based thin film measurement techniques THz and millimetre wave frequency techniques, combined with thin film measurement methods, provide early detection of corneal edema associated with disease in the view of Zachary Taylor, Assistant Professor at Aalto Universitythe progression. The definitive treat- ment for Fuchs dystrophy is called lamellar transplant, where part or all of the diseased cornea is resected and donor or artificial cornea are grafted on. Graft rejection following transplant is not uncommon (1%-12% depending on surgical technique) and failure is typically preceded by the presence of edema in the graft. Detection of graft rejection via visual assessment of corneal edema is too late in the rejec- tion progression to save the graft. Early and accurate detection and quantifica- tion of corneal edema, before percep- tible changes in optical clarity, are not currently feasible. Development of sensitive and specific corneal edema measurement systems will considerably improve patient outcomes. Despite efforts in research the clinical gold standard for water content is still pachymetry or a centre of the cornea thickness (CCT) measurement. This method recognises that an edematous cornea must expand (thicken) to make room for excess water and thus a his- tory of steadily thickening cornea indi- cates compromised corneal health. However, the vast majority of patients do not have detailed CCT histories. Fur-ther, sincepachymetry is an indirect measure of water it cannot, in a single time point, ascertain or even inferwater content. Studies performed on patients with corneal disease suggest that small, initial increases in CTWC do not produce statistically significant increases in CCT. Some high-resolution microscopy studies have identified changes in cellular morphology in Descemet's membrane (Figure 1) but these are exploratory and the clinical utility is unclear. What is needed is a direct measurement of CTWC that can be decoupled from variations in tissue geometry/morphology. THz and mil- limetre wave techniques may providethe key. The inspiration for THz and millimetre wave probing of CTWC r content arose from ellipsometry; a measurement technique used to characterise thin films of materials. Ellipsometry illumi- nates the target with a laser that (1) has a wavelength on the order of the film thickness, and (2) the speed oflight of that wavelength in the film is a very strong function of the film material and any imperfections in the film material. The illumination will bounce around inside the film and create a standing wave. Small changes in illumination parameters, such as wavelength, or angle of incidence create large, detectable changes inthe standing wave. It is straightfor- ward to numerically extract the thick-ness of the film and/or the material properties of the film simultaneously with a very high degree of accuracy. The cornea is a perfect representation of a thin film (Figure 2) at THz and mili- imeter wave frequency length scales. It sits on top of a known material with known properties (water) and its physical thickness can be accurately measured via a number of optical techniques. Three key features render cornea a great match to THz and mil- limetre wave imaging. First, the thick- ness range, 0.4 mm-0.7 mm (Figure 1), falls right in the middle of our free space THz wavelength range: 0.1 mm- 3 mm. Second, the standard deviation in radius of curvature (RoC) is fractions of a wavelength in the band of interest which enable THz and millimeter wave systems to always assume the cornea is a sphere thus allowing for straightforward optical design. Finally, the propagation speed of THz and millimetre wave radiation through physiologic material is an extremely strong function of water content and a weak function of the non-aqueous components (e.g. colla- gen). Therefore, quantitative mapping of corneal water content , and evenwater content gradients, can be through resolving the standing waves created by illuminating with an 37 Figure 2: The lack of physiologic variation w.r.t. to THz frequency wavelengths and proximity to a deep (w.r.t ) body of water allows one to treat that cornea as thin film sitting on top of an infinitely thick, lossy substrate. Analysis of lossy standing waves at multiple frequencies enables extraction of water content gradients in the thickness dimension.38PROFILE ensemble of frequencies at in the THz and millimetre wave bands (Figure 2). Our programme was established by an R01 grant (R01EY021590) from the National Eye Institute (NEI) for endothelial disease and graft rejection detection. We were the first to intro- duce the concept of lossy etalon anal- ysis to THz millimetre wave imaging of cornea and the first to use it to decou-ple CCT changes from CTWC perturba- tions in vivo. We are currently able to resolve ~1% water by volume changes in corneal phantoms and are close to demonstrating this capability in in vivoanimal models. A current snapshot overview of the programme is shown in Figure 3. We are building multi-transceiver systems at complementary frequency bands to enhance water gradient extraction (Figure 3(a)) and have performedextensive optical simulations to opti- mise signal acquisition from curved surfaces (Figure 3(b)). Numerous human imaging systems prototypes have been built (Figure 3(c)) and are currently being tested tested on volunteers. We have also completed surgical trials in rabbit models (Figure 3(d)) and observed corneal edema formation (Figure 3(e)) after removal of Descemet's membrane (Figure 1). Corneal tissue water content (CTWC) quantification offers a unique oppor- tunity for THz and millimetre wave techniques in medicine. The relative lack or physiologic variation in corneal morphology on THz length scales and the extremely strong dependence of THz properties on water content enable successful application of thin film metrology. Successful clinical translation of this technology willrequire a multidisciplinary approachcombining the fields of RF remote sensing, antenna design, radar engi- neering, optical techniques. In recog- nition of these challenges and the broad range of expertise required, we has moved the entire corneal tissue water content imaging programme to Aalto University in Finland.

A bit over a century ago, nations viewed the poles primarily as areas for heroic exploration with designs for geographical conquest. While some nations cer- tainly put a higher priority on science in that context than others, the vast white unknowns were thought of as \"places to claim\".Even as recently as a generation ago, attention was not widely focused on the polar regions as scientically signicant; the research may have been interesting to those in the know, but \"marginal\" compared to advances in other elds and seemingly isolated from other parts of the globe. I have lived through and continue to experience a sea change in those attitudes - both in my previous profes- sional life as a working polar scientist, and more recently as the director of NSF's Oce of Polar Pro- A new and exciting age in polar scienceENVIRONMENT Kelly K. Falkner, Director of the Office of Polar Programs (OPP), National Science Foundation, shares her thoughts on a new and exciting age in the field of polar scienceENVIRONMENT 41grams (OPP). It is clear today that changes in the polar regions aect the rest of the globe, and the need to understand and try to predict and even remediate those changes has become a national and international priority. Moreover, polar regions provide unrivalled platforms from which to conduct many types of truly ground-breaking research. At the same time, the face of polar science both literally and guratively is changing. Women now contribute signicantly to research that previously was male-dom-inated - and even literally o-limits to them - less than 50 years ago. Technology, meanwhile, continues to open observa- tional and experimental horizons. Let me give a bit of the context to support these asser- tions and then touch briefly on some developments underway at NSF that will help polar science evolve tomake the U.S. an even more inclusive leader in global innovation. NSF's involvement in polar science began just a few years after the agency's creation, to help plan and sup- port the U.S. science program for the 1957-58 Interna- tional Geophysical Year (IGY). Today, NSF, through OPP, manages the U.S. Antarctic Program on behalf of the Nation. OPP's Arctic Sciences Section supports research throughout the Arctic from Greenland to Alaska, on land, ice, sea and above. At both ends of the globe, we maintain vital partnerships with the private sector and federal partners including research agencies and the Department of Defense to accomplish eld-based research. This also entails extensive international engagement. By nearly every measure, U.S. polar scientists are among the most productive in the world. For example, the U.S. has always and still solidly leads in number and quality of peer-reviewed scientic publications. To be in this position, we owe a debt to the pioneersof the U.S. polar science presence. Keep in mind the context that the ability to withstand the rigours of polar winters while carrying out research is a relatively recent phenomenon. The rst overwintering team at the South Pole consisting of 18 men under the joint leadership of civilian Paul Siple and Lt John Tuck wasdeployed only in the late 1950s. Given how logistically challenging it remains to work at the poles even to this day, it would be easiest to continue to do the things we already know how to do. To remain at the forefront, however, we must continue to strivebeyond our comfort zones. We must continue to evolve new technologies and capabilities that allow us to tackle Launching a radiosonde at Summit Station Image: \u00a9 August Allen, Polar Field ServicesENVIRONMENT 42questions at a much larger scope and scale than ever before. And very importantly, we must continue to engage and support our Nation's most creative andmotivated scientists. Today, polar science remains a vital - and growing - part of the NSF research portfolio. Some current examples of exciting NSF-supported science include: Two papers published in Science Magazine in July 2018 described the detection of extremely high energy neutrinos by the IceCube detector at South Pole Station that led to the identication of blazar as the source. We nally achieved at least a rst answer to the 106-year old mystery of the origin of cosmic rays! State-of-the-art autonomous robots deployed by the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling program, have generated rst-ever, year-round coverage of physical and chemical prop- erties of the Southern Ocean, revealing that the system is far more dynamic than previously assumed. Stay tuned to learn what that means for our global climate system.A partnership of 17 nations, the MOSAiC Observatory, a ship frozen into the ice, will drift with the Arctic sea- ice pack for a full annual cycle, starting in September 2019, to observe atmospheric and oceanic processes that aect the sea-ice as it evolves from new rst-year ice to multi-year ice and, eventually, decays. A $25-million joint U.S. and U.K. expedition to the Thwaites Glacier will prod and poke the system from myriad approaches over the next ve years in order to understand why it is speeding up and what we can expect in the future. Since the portion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet held back by the glacier rests below sea level, it is thought to be particularly vulnerable to accelerated melt with the potential to raise sea level by 3-m or more. NSF is taking an All-Hands-On-Deck approach to accel- erating the pace of Arctic science to address the widescale and rapid changes occurring there, through an initiative we call \"Navigating the New Arctic\". Or NNA. This is currently among NSF's top ten priority strategic investment areas several of which areexpected to complement NNA. We are looking forward R/V Sikuliaq to study changing climate in Arctic Image: \u00a9 Kim KennyENVIRONMENT 43to the results of a solicitation for proposals backed by $30 million in new funds that closed on 4th March 2019, and targets science at the intersection of thesocial, natural and built environments. Meanwhile, the quality and pace of polar science in the Arctic and the Antarctic continue to rely as heavily on critical infrastructure as it did in the IGY. We must beever forward-looking. As one case in point, NSF haslaunched new state-of-the-art polar capable research vessel, Sikuliaq, run by the University of Alaska, primarily to explore the Arctic. At the other end of the globe, at Antarctica's McMurdo Station, NSF's Antarctic logistics hub, expanded asneeds arose since it was established during the IGY into a hodge-podge of 104 structures spread out over a 1.5 square-mile campus. A 2012 Blue Ribbon Panel rightfully pointed out result- ing ineciencies in McMurdo's operations. In February, the National Science Board, NSF's governing body, gave the agency the nod to begin the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) project, which over 10years will consolidate the station footprint to enhancesafety and flexibly streamline science support for thenext 35-50 years. Last but not least, this coming Antarctic season marks the 50th anniversary of the rst women to set foot at the South Pole. Not until 1978-79 did a female overwinter there. I am happy to report that women now participate in polar science, science support and leadership through- out the world. But the polar research community remains a long way from being as diverse as the soci- ety that supports us. Research clearly tells us that diverse groups make more robust decisions. And one never knows from whom the next brightest scientic advance may emerge. Which brings me to my take- home message: For the U.S. polar science community to meet the needs of the coming century and beyond, we must: Nurture a more diverse research and research-sup- port community; Keep peering over the horizon for infrastructure & logistics needs; Drive innovation in technology, including technolo- gies and approaches to manage and prot fromextracting the \"big picture from big data; Build productive partnerships wherever we do better and more together. Kelly K. Falkner Office DirectorOffice of Polar Programs (OPP) NSF Landis, NSFBy way of an introduction, the Arctic is the most rapidly chang- ing environment on Earth and is already experiencing transformations in its marine and terrestrial environ- ments and social-environmental systems. Effective responses to such changes require a thorough under- standing of drivers and impacts, based on sustained observations that guide model development and improve predictive capacity. The International Arctic Research Center (IARC) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks was founded to address the key challenges of Arctic observing science, particularly at scales that require international col- laboration. One key to IARC's success is rigorous engagement with stake-holders making decisions in and abouta rapidly changing Arctic, requiring expertise and resources in science communication and the co-production of knowledge. IARC research Marine science The Nansen and Amundsen Basins Observational System (NABOS) was conceived at IARC in 2002 to track remarkable changes in the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean. Since then, ten comprehensive multidisciplinarycruises have delivered critical infor-mation for documenting and under-standing oceanic, atmospheric, and sea-ice change. Moorings anchored to the ocean floor beneath sea ice for several years have provided long-term continuous records, augmented by summer oceanographic surveys to provide spatial context. Graduate students, high-school teachers, and summer schools are key elements of broad outreach during NABOS cruises. From its beginning tothe most recent cruise in 2018, this programme has been a multinational endeavour, with scientists from many different countries working hand-in- hand to measure, analyse, and deliver complex data and information. NABOS has provided critical informa- tion about unprecedented Arctic Ocean changes, likely representing a funda- mental shift to a new, less stable, more dynamic marine environment. By the mid-2010s, the halocline in the eastern Arctic Ocean (an oceanographic feature separating surface from deeper waters) had lost its ability to serve as a lid pre- venting Atlantic Water heat at depth from reaching up to the sea ice bottom. Progressively deeper winter mixing has brought up more heat - diminishing the ice cover. Continued observations and analysis will establish whether this might be the onset of major winter sea-ice loss altering northern hemisphereweather patterns. Terrestrial research A massive green band spanning the high northern latitudes, the boreal forest stores immense amounts of soil carbon. Decomposition is slowly releasing this carbon to the atmo- sphere and exacerbating climate change, wildfires can accelerate this process. Interior Alaska wildfires are burning bigger and hotter than in the past, and more frequent 'mega-fire' seasons challenge the region's fire managers. With over 80% of Alaska's population residing in or near the forest and wild- lands, fire managers need science andtechnology to operate safely and effi- ciently. IARC meets these needs bydeveloping locally relevant, accurate models and forecasts of Alaska's changing fire regimes and impacts. In a large, observation-limited state, this means using a sophisticated modelling approach known as dynam- ical downscaling. A coarse-resolution global climate model is linked to a regional model incorporating local climate information, providing \"down- scaled\" model output with much finer resolution. Managers welcome this new tool as part of their ongoing science-based effort to protect life and property in Alaska's unique landscape. IARC isWhen it comes to observations to action, The International Arctic Research Center informs understanding and responses to rapid Arctic change, as we discover here 44PROFILE Observations to action: Informing understanding and responses to rapid Arctic changealso exploring new ways to use fire weather predictions to assess the level of risk for upcoming fire seasons, supporting fire-response logistics and budget planning. The role of government in responding to rapid Arctic change The current capacity for local, state, and national governments to respond to a warmer, less predictable Arctic is weak. Observations and models may chart marine and terrestrial trajecto- ries over the next half-century, but governments in the U.S. operate on far shorter time horizons. Furthermore, federalism splits responsibilities for environmental management, resulting in only incremental change for most government policies and services. IARC supports the use of more obser- vations by the government, acrossmore scales, in the development of programmes and the enforcement of rules. IARC has the ability to translate and communicate complex changes across Arctic environments, so govern- ment officials and agency employees charged with fulfilling the mandates of government can connect today's data with future desirable outcomes. There must be an incentive for under- standing: why should any politician care about something that falls out- side of their constituents' interests? Because humans are social-environ- mentally interdependent, even if our governments of states and localitiessplit us up, Arctic warming affectsNorth America and the world as a whole. These challenges call for models and maps that are time appropriate for government cycles; transmittal of datademonstrating effects of Arctic change on lower latitudes; and linking local and Indigenous knowledge to promote a broader and deeper understanding of change. Future outlook for the Arctic Across all facets and functions at IARC and the global North, there is increas- ing recognition that solutions to Arctic problems require multi-sector, multi-stakeholder/actor approaches. IARC helps chart pathways, by building collaborative networks across the Arctic and non-Arctic nations, and bysupporting efforts, such as the Arctic Observing Summit. Disruption from climate change in the North chal- lenges our current institutional sys- tems and governments. Observations of Arctic change both calls for andsupport key decisions in this decade to forestall future problems. 907 474 6016 uaf-iarc@alaska.edu www.iarc.uaf.edu 45PROFILE Fig. 1: The International Arctic Research Center has research and collaborations around the circumpolar north to help the world understand transformative changes in the Arctic1979 - August sea ice extentThe International Arctic Research Center in Fairbanks, AlaskaMillion-plus acre fire seasons have doubled in frequency since before 1990 2018 - August sea ice extent Boreal forest Major IARC research/collaboration locationNear 100% ice cover during summer NABOS researchNo during NABOS observations in the same locationSilver-impregnated zeolite (AgIZ) has been used for removing radioiodine from contaminated groundwater and nuclear waste streams and the worldwide inventory of such secondary waste is rapidly increasing. To contain long-lived radioactive iodine (16 Mio year half-life of 129I) from nuclear waste,various methods have been employed, with various success. One of the ways 129I can be immobi- lized is through the formation of insol- uble silver iodide solid, AgI, which is only possible in the presence of oxygen (Fig. 1). The silver technology is commonly deployed by coating silverIn this report Professor Peter H. Santschi, Texas A&M University at Galveston, highlights the challenges when containing iodine in a solid phase for radioactive waste disposalContaining radioiodine in a solid phase for radioactive waste disposal 46PROFILE Fig. 1. Pourbaix diagram of iodine speciation showing general regions for grouts with and without slag, indicating that redox potential of 'Young Reduced Cement' containing grout, falls within the zone that predicts reduction of Ag.on zeolites, AgZ, and then putting it contact with the aqueous or gaseous 129I waste stream. The objective of a recent study [Kaplan et al., 2019] was to quantify the effectiveness of two grout waste formulations for disposing of the used AgIZ (Table 1). The grout formulations were with and without slag, an ingredient used to reduce porosity and to create a strong chem-ically reducing environment to immo- bilize redox reactive contaminants). A second objective was to determine the iodine speciation leached from AgIZ encapsulated in grout. Iodine commonly exists concurrently as three species in the same environment:iodide (I-), iodate (IO 3-), and organo- iodine (org-I). To predict the toxicity and the rate at which 129I travels, it is important to know the iodine specia- tion in the system. A 60-day kinetic batch experiment demonstrated that AgIZ encapsulated in slag-free grout was extremely effective at immobilizing iodine and silver, a potential non- radioactive carcinogen. However, AgIZ encapsulated in slag- containing grout, the most common type of grout used for low-level radioactive waste disposal, was entirely ineffective at immobilizing iodine. While the slag-free grout with AgIZ released only 3.3 \u00b5g/L total iodine intothe contact solution, the slag-contain- ing grout released 19,269 \u00b5g/L totaliodine. Based on thermodynamic calculations, the strongly reducing conditions of the slag-containing system (Eh was -392 mV) promoted the reductive dissolution of the AgI solid, forming a dissolved form of silver, Ag0 (aq), and releasing iodide into the aqueous phase. The slag-freegrout system was maintained under more oxidizing conditions (Eh was 439 mV) and a minimal amount of iodine was released from the grout. In both grout systems, the aqueous iodine, originally added to the AgZ as iodide, was composed primarily of iodide and org-I, and essentially no iodate was detected. More organo-I was detected in the slag-free than the slag-containing grout system, because the high redox potential of the former system was more conducive to the formation of oxidized I species, suchas I 2and HIO, which may be interme- diates in the covalent bonding of iodine with organic carbon in grout. Spectroscopic analysis (X-ray Absorp- tion Near Edge Structure analysis) ofthe two AgIZ-grout samples indicated that the iodine existed exclusively as silver iodide. Together, these results show that sub- surface grout disposal of AgIZ waste should be done under oxidizing con- ditions and that radioiodide released from AgIZ can undergo speciation transformations (leading to organo- formation) that have important impli- cations on subsequent mobility and estimated risk.

Ingredients and proportions used to make the grout samplesFreshwater resource problems are ubiquitous across the globe despite decades of focused watershed management efforts targeting drinking water treatment, water use efficiency and point-sourcepollution reductions. Severe chal- lenges remain with respect to more diffuse and less easily treated prob- lems that begin with land use and water use decisions by humans living, working, developing and farming watersheds increasingly altered by anthropogenic climate change. To address today's freshwater resource problems, we must understand the role of humans in freshwater systems, including their culturally influenced decision-making processes. Integrative analysis of natural and social systemshas been an international sustainabil- ity science goal for many years. However, full integration in regard to the role of culture is often still missing from the complex water sustainability equation. Achieving more sustainable watershed management depends in large part on the ability to better understand the social learning processes that drive adaptive environmental decision- making, as well as the causal chains linking culturally influenced environ- mental values to environmental behaviours. Integrative mechanistic models are needed that account explicitly for human-landscape inter-actions and incorporate detailed, well-developed, coupled models of hydrosystem, aquatic ecosystem, and human system responses to changing climate (Figure 1). Our research approach interactivelycouples mechanistic models of three systems - the hydrosystem, the human system, and the aquatic ecosystem - controlling water supply and water quality in the Central Great Plains of North America, a region with long- standing water quality and quantity concerns. In this arid, highly erodible and agriculturally intensive region, historical natural climate fluctuations have been extreme, and the coupling between the dynamic climate and human systems is close, as witnessed during the Dust Bowl environmental disaster of the 1930s. This classic example of the intersection among climatic variables, human land use, and unexpected societal impacts illus- trates the economic, demographic, and cultural consequences for a region and nation when unsustainable land use collides with unanticipated climatic change. We demonstrate our integrative modelling framework in the study of a coupled human and natural system in a surface water-dependent agricul- tural watershed with a highly climate- sensitive surface water flow regime influenced by human-induced land-use and climate change. The hydrosystemserves as the foundation of our model, which focuses on integrating climate, ecosystem and human decision scenarios as boundary conditions for a watershed response model. This enables us to predict future surface water regimes that inform an aquatic ecological model. Since cultural influences can drive people to either adopt or reject sustainability policies, our human- systems model empirically includes culture. Humans use culture to learn and inform their decision-making processes, but human culture is often seen as too difficult to incorporate into environmental system models. At its most fundamental, culture iscomprised of shared values, beliefs, and norms through which humans visualise, interpret, or assign meaning to actions, concepts, and their envi- ronments. Despite this complexity, developing mechanisms to empirically model the cultural influences that drive region- or community-specific responses to management efforts is critically important. We model policy decision-making processes grounded in culture withinUnderstanding freshwater resource problems 48PROFILE WATER SUPPLY WATER QUALITYCLIMATE CHANGEHuman Systems Aquatic EcosystemsHydro- systems Figure 1Experts from Stroud Water Research Center and Kansas State University highlight the importance of addressing today's freshwater resource problems and how to achieve sustainable watershed managementa framework of coupled human and natural systems, quantifying cultural influence using the Values-Beliefs- Norms (VBN) framework informed by an extensive survey of the localpopulation. Within an agent-based model, agents vote to adopt or rejectenvironmental policies. Heterogeneity among agents is derived from demographics, VBN factors, and the environment. Each human agent is populated by attributes extracted from an extensive survey of the local population. Attributes include demographic characteristics (gender, education, income, age, and occupation), valuescharacteristics (altruistic toward humans, altruistic toward biodiversity, traditional, self, and openness to change), environmental worldviews, political ideology, and environmental knowledge. The agents' decision-making processes are informed by cultural, hydrological, and aquatic biodiversity models. The fully integrated model (Figure 2) isthen used to evaluate whole-system response to climate variation scenarios derived from historical data and downscaled climate projections. This integrative model represents a func- tional coupling of natural and human systems, allowing for biophysicalfeedbacks to directly affect agents' decision-making processes and enabling us to evaluate the sustainability out- comes delivered by different policy scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that policy support is grounded in cultural values,and cultural differences explain preferences for conservation policies designed to conserve and protect water resources and aquatic ecosys- tems. The array of values invoked to make decisions about policies, and the social-psychological pathwayslinking values to policy support can vary across policies and types of agents (e.g. farmers and non-farmers). In contrast, some human system factors, such as financial obligation, are the strongest and most consistent explanation of support for conserva- tion policies among members of both groups. These dynamic linkages between cultural and environmental factors reveal new pathways for actions that support sustainability. Our results indicate resistance to environmental policy, suggesting that the local cultural framework may result in rejection of sustainability policies and prevention of needed support even under potentially extreme climate conditions. However, our model also showed that the best opportunities for policy acceptance immediately follow extreme events. This underlines the need for influencing culture and pro-environ- mental behaviour via interventions and monitoring to benefit from the increased acceptance of environmental policies during and immediately following severe environmental condi- tions. This work provides the founda- tion necessary for future research to explore rich questions about coupled system dynamics and sustainability policy.Funding Acknowledgement: This work was supported in part by the National Science Founda- tion, Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems Program, Award #1313815.References Caldas, M et al. 2018.

Nobody knows when, but it must have been at least 3.5 billion years ago, maybe 3.8 billion or even 4.3 billion years ago, relatively soon after Earth accreted in the disk of gas, dust and planetesimals that circled the early sun. If there is much uncertainty about the timing of the origin of life, how life actually started is even more uncer- tain. A sine qua non condition for life as we know it is that, somewhere on the early Earth, blobs of organic molecules must have come together to form a \"system\" that could copyitself and multiply. No easy task, requiring large, complex molecules made of carbon, hydrogen andoxygen with some nitrogen and sul- phur thrown into the mix. Using the chemical symbols of these elements we may call them CHONS. The challenge is to understand how Nature could have produced the large, complex CHONS, without which the first self-replicating systems could never have formed out of the chaos of the pre-biotic Earth. Those CHONS must have contained hydroxy, car- boxy, amino and sulphur functional groups. They must have been able to build vesicles with cell membranes. The vesicles must have had cell mem- branes pitted with cross-membrane functional groups that allowed pro- tons and ions to flow in and out in such a way as to generate concentra-tion gradients and transmembrane potentials - a form of energy. Unfortunately, the science community has not yet figured out how Nature might have produced the large CHONS that were surely necessary to form such protocells and to give life a shot at getting started. Smaller organic molecules? No problem. Amino acids are easy to make, for instance by elec- tric discharges simulating lightning strikes on the early Earth. The realchallenge is how Nature was able to build much larger multifunctional CHONS. For decades, the search was on to demonstrate how such CHONS could be assembled under plausible early- Earth conditions, in the atmosphere, in freshwater or the oceans, with help from ultraviolet light or high energy x-rays and gamma rays, at high and low temperatures, at high and lowpressures. Despite all efforts the goal remained elusive. The science com- munity started to look elsewhere. One idea that became widely accepted is that the young Earth had been intensely bombarded by the most primitive meteorites, carbona- ceous chondrites, which may have accreted in the interstellar dust clouds, from which the entire solarsystem formed. We can see these dust clouds in the night sky forming dark bands in the luminous plane of our Milky Way galaxy. The nano-sized mineral grains in the dust clouds bear the spectroscopicsignature of delicate hydrocarbons and, indeed, carbonaceous chon- drites that have fallen to Earth in recent decades were found to be amazingly rich in CHONS, including some that form vesicles when extracted with water and others thatProfessor Friedemann Freund, SETI Institute, explores a fascinating new discovery in the search for the origin of life, hereA new turn in the search for the origin of life 50PROFILE contain carboxy, amino, and sulphur functional groups. Such CHONS would have come handy on the early Earth and they could have provided a pathtowards life. So, there it is - the idea that life on Earth owes its existence to organics delivered from space more than 4 billion years ago. A grand idea, quoted in the scientific literature and widely popularised. However, when we drill down to its roots, we see that this idea came out the disappointment in the science community that, using the most advanced methods of investigation, some of the best minds in chemistry,physics, geoscience and astrobiologyhave not been able - despite decades of intense work - to figure out how Nature could have produced theselarge, complex and multifunctional CHONS, without which life as we know it could not have started. As so often in the history of the human mind, in times of uncertainty, the imagination may turn to the even greater unknowns. This seems tohave happened in the face of widespread frustration over the inability to make real progress in the area of origin of life. In this case, the imagination turned to space. Maybe out there, in the vast expanse of space, chemical reactions are pos- sible that have no equivalent on Earth. Maybe, when stars reach the end of their life cycle and die in cataclysmic explosions, the mineral grains con- densing in the hot stellar outflows are uniquely able to produce those complex CHONS. Maybe the organics associated with the dust clouds in the interstellar medium are such CHONS. Maybe they became incorporated into the carbonaceous chondrites, those pitch-black, organics-rich clumps of very fine-grained matrix, probably formed in these humongous dust clouds in the galactic plane. Maybe the early Earth did indeed capture many ofthese carbonaceous chondrites and was seeded with the CHONS, from which life would eventually arise. Posing the question in this way exposes a flaw in the basic approach taken by so many bright chemists, physicists, geoscientists and astrobiol- ogists, whose goal is to unravel the mystery of the origin of life. For decades their focus has been onchemical reactions that take place in the gas, liquid and fluid phases, including supercritical conditions, at gas-fluid, gas-solid and fluid-solid interfaces, even inside clay minerals. The condensation of mineral grains in the near-vacuum of space, in the out- flow of dying stars, is a distinctly dif- ferent process. It is the transition from the vapour phase directly to the solid state in the presence of hydrogen,carbon monoxide, water, nitrogen and sulphur. During the process, the gaseous components become incor- porated into the solid matrix. The smaller the grains, the more of the gaseous components go in. Onceinside, the C, H, O, N and S interact with each other, forming chemical bonds - a step towards CHONS. Here is where past research to unravel the mystery of the origin of life went astray. Brilliant and dedicated as they were, the scientists involved in this field never considered the possibility that the reactive gases dissolved in the magmas in the depth of Earth - water, carbon monoxide and dioxide, even nitrogen and sulphur - would become incorporated into every mineral grain that crystallizes out of terrestrial magmas. Not in high concentrationsbut at non-zero levels, nonetheless. During cooling, the C, H, O, N and S inside the solid matrix interact with each other and form chemical bonds- a step towards CHONS. Therefore, there is no need to look tospace and to carbonaceous chon- drites to deliver CHONS to the Earth, precious organics from which life might have arisen. There is no need to worry that any such delivery could have happened only during the period of heavy bombardment of the young Earth more than 4 billion years ago. Quite to the contrary, there is the distinct alternative that rocks in the Earth's crust were producing CHONS inside the matrix of their minerals, releasing them as they weathered at the Earth's surface.

It is perhaps no surprise then that options for relieving these symptoms are a prominent topic in on-line forums for pregnant women. A notable trend in these on-line dis- cussions is increasing advocation for the use of marijuana, also known as cannabis, to relieve pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. The mounting interest is driven in part by increasing legalisation and social acceptance ofmarijuana and approved medical use of cannabis-based products to treat nausea and pain associated withcancer, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease and some forms of epilepsy. Additionally, marijuana is often promoted as a natural remedy with minimal side effects and, therefore, many women perceive it as a healthier alternative to the standard medica- tions used to treat pregnancy-induced nausea. Indeed, 70% of women recently surveyed in the United States believe that there is \"slight or no risk of harm\"in cannabis use during pregnancy. The truth is that there are more questions than answers about the safety of marijuana use during pregnancy. While humans have used marijuana (Cannabis sativa) for recreational, religious, and medicinal purposes foractive molecules, such as terpenes and flavonoids. These compounds interact with the endocannabinoid system to cause the biological effectsassociated with cannabis. For example, the binding of 9-THC to CB1R causes the \"high\" associated with smoking or ingesting marijuana. CB1R is widely expressed in the devel- oping brain, and data from experi- mental animal models indicate thatDennis R. Carty, Ph.D. and Pamela J. Lein, Ph.D., University of California, highlight the rising trend of marijuana use during pregnancy and the implications surrounding it Marijuana use during pregnancy: The cannabis conundrum 52PROFILE several millennia, basic research regarding the ther- apeutic efficacy and toxicity of the active constituents in cannabis, such as tetrahy- drocannabinol (9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), is remarkably limited. The basis of marijuana's biological effects was not determined until the 1990s when neuroscientists discovered twoc a n n a b i n o i d receptors, CB1R and CB2R, in the m a m m a l i a n brain. Subsequently, researchers found that these receptors respond to molecules naturally synthesized in the body from fatty acids, which are called endoge- nous cannabinoids, or endocannabinoids. The endocannabi- noid system functions to regulate numerous physio logical processes, including body temperature, hunger, processing of sensory information, and cognition. Cannabis is a complex mixture of pharmacologically active compounds that includes more than 100 cannabi- noids in addition to 9-THC and CBD, as well as other pharmacologicallyendocannabinoid signalling plays a significant role in the normal develop- ment of the brain. Either overstimulat- ing or blocking CB1R activity during brain development causes \"miswiring\" of brain circuits. This altered brain circuitry manifests as behavioural deficits in the young animal that persist into adulthood. CB1R is expressed in the developing human brain by the first weeks of the second trimester. 9-THC, CBD and other cannabinoids in marijuana cross the placenta and are transferred into breast milk. Because cannabi- noids have a relatively long half-life inthe human body, the fetus or breast- feeding infant may be exposed to active cannabinoids for up to 5 days after maternal use of cannabis. Such observations raise the possibility that marijuana use during pregnancy potentially alters fetal or infant brain development by interfering with the endocannabinoid signalling system in the developing brain. This possibility is supported by data emerging from several large epidemiological studies of cannabis use during pregnancy inNorth America and Europe. These studies report an association between maternal cannabis use and increased impulsivity, attention deficit, hyperactivity, delinquent behaviours, and impaired memory in children, and higher rates of depression, drug abuse, memory deficits, and psychosis in adolescents and adults. A key question is whether there is a safe level of maternal marijuana use. Answering this question requires knowing how much marijuana is consumed by women during pregnancy. However, quantifying marijuana intake is challenging because the potency of cannabis, as well as the ratio of thedifferent active cannabinoids it contains, is extremely variable. With regard to the latter, it is also unknown as to which constituent(s) in marijuana impact the developing brain. This is a critically important question in light of widespread on-line discussions suggesting that CBD is safer than 9-THC. Compared to the significant amount of research on the toxicity of 9-THC, which is linked to the dys- phoric and other adverse effects of marijuana abuse, there has been comparatively little research on the potential toxicity of CBD. Recent studies in zebrafish, which have an active endocannabinoid system, suggest that CBD causes abnormal development and lethality at concen- trations significantly lower than 9- THC. While it has yet to be determined whether CBD interferes with brain development in mammals, including humans, these findings suggest the urgent need for research to character- ize the developmental neurotoxicity potential of the individual active constituents in marijuana. The developmental neurotoxicity of marijuana is also influenced by the production and method of consump-tion of cannabis products. For exam-ple, smoking a cannabis cigarette produces combustion byproducts, including polycyclic aromatic hydro- carbons (PAHs), which are neurotoxic to the developing brain. Vaporizing dried cannabis significantly reduces the production of combustion byprod- ucts, but can introduce neurotoxic metal contaminants into the inhaled product and increase the amount ofactive cannabinoid consumed. Concentrates such as oils, tinctures,and edibles avoid the issues associ-ated with smoking or vaping cannabis.However, these methods of consump- tion do not mitigate the problem of wide variability in the purity of cannabis products. For example, cultivation practices can introduce contaminants such as microbial impurities, mycotoxins, metals, and pesticides into the final product. Maternal consumption of cannabis products containing these contaminants can result in their trans- fer to the fetal brain, which is of potential concern since many of these contaminants are known to interfere with brain development. As cannabis use becomes increasingly acceptable and widespread, increas-ing numbers of women are likely to use cannabis during pregnancy. While the impact of maternal cannabis use on the unborn child remains an open question, the data that are currently available warrant caution, and under-score the urgent need for additional research to inform ongoing discus- sions regarding the cannabis conun- drum in pregnancy.

The organisation was established in 1972 to consolidate the USDA's animal and plant health bureaus. Since then, the scope of agricultural issues the agency oversees has grown exponentially and today covers areas such as wildlife damage and disease manage- ment, regulation of genetically engineered crops andanimal welfare, and protection of public health and safety, as well as natural resources that are vulnerable to invasive pests and pathogens. Guarding against invasive species and diseases is a 24-hours a day, seven days a week job for the agency.The potential consequences of, for example, the Mediterranean fruit fly or Asian long-horned beetle, going unchecked could be billions of dollars of produc- tion and marketing losses annually. Similarly, if a disease such as foot-and-mouth or highly pathogenic avian influenza were to become established in the U.S., producers could face devastating lossesdue to the imposition of trade restrictions by foreign partners. APHIS has aggressive emergency protocols in place to tackle pests and disease and it works with partners and aected states to quickly manage and eradicate outbreaks as soon as they are detected.To promote the health of U.S. agriculture in the international arena, APHIS also develops and promotes science-based standards with trading partners to ensure America's agricultural exports, which are worth more than $50 billion a year, are protected from unjus-tied restrictions. Under the Plant Pest and Disease Management and Disaster Prevention Programme, the APHIS distributes funding to individual states to expand or enhance pest surveys, identication, inspection, mitigation and risk analysis, as well as public education and outreach. Since 2009, the USDA has provided around $293.5 million and supported more than 2,340 projects underthe Plant Protection Act. \"To promote the health of U.S. agriculture in the international arena, APHIS also develops and promotes science-based standards with trading partners to ensure America's agricultural exports, which are worth more than $50 billion a year, are protected from unjustified restrictions.\" Collectively, these projects allow the USDA and its partners to quickly detect and respond to invasive pests and diseases while maintaining the infrastructure necessary to ensure that disease-free, certied planting materials are available to speciality crop producers. In the 2019 nancial year, the USDA is providing $66 million to 407 projects in 49 states, as well as Guam, Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands.The work of the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in the United States covers a wide range of agricultural issues, including protecting the U.S. from harmful invasive plant pests and diseases, as this article uncoversAGRICULTURE 55The largest single allocation will see $16 million go to California to support projects covering a range of plant health and pest mitigation activities. This includes $5 million to survey for harmful exotic fruit fly populations in the state, along with $3.5 million to support the activities of detector dog teams in searching for harmful, exotic plant pests in packagesat mail and express parcel delivery facilities. Another $2.2 million will support the National CleanPlant Network (NCPN) foundation plant stocks for citrus, grapes, fruit trees, sweet potato and roses. APHIS provides funding through the network to univer- sity and government facilities that develop, maintain and provide clean foundation stock for selected speciality crops. The programme is designed to help protect the environment and ensure the global competitiveness of speciality crop producers. In 2019, APHIS will allocate $6 million to support NCPN projects nationally. Elsewhere, $1.7 million has been allocated to California's Emergency Plant Health Response Teams for respondingto, delimiting the infestation area, and managing outbreaks of exotic plant pests. \"California is a critical partner in protecting U.S. agri- culture\", says USDA Under Secretary Greg Ibach. \"With this funding, California will be able to better pro- tect its own resources and, in doing so, contribute to USDA's mission of keeping our nation's agriculture economy healthy and strong.\" Open Access Government editorial@openaccessgovernment.org www.openaccessgovernment.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGov over 80% of the world's estimated 500 million small farms and provide over 80%of the food consumed in a large part of the developing world, contributing significantly to povertyreduction and food security.\" 1As a public agricultural scientist, this is of interest. Food security extendsbeyond the major food and feed grain crops (rice, wheat, corn, soybean, sorghum), many of which I study. If a substantial portion of humanity depends on food produced by smallholders, what risks do climate changes pose for these community food networks? The sustainable intensification of smallholder food systems is the focal work of a colleague, Dr Vara Prasad. 2 His network of international collabora- tors is devoted to understanding the function of community food networks, and opportunities for sustainableintensification to enhance food secu- rity. Vulnerability to climate change is an integral aspect of this work. To gain insight into food networks, I discovered the Polder project, active in the Coastal Zone of Bangladesh. The 1.2 million hectares Coastal Zone is home to 8 million Bangladesh in the delta of the Ganges river. 3The region, typically within 10 m above sea level, is subject to tidal flooding, saltwaterintrusion, and seasonal drought. Food insecurity diminishes the developmentof half the children in the region. Water management is critical for crop growth and food security in the Coastal Zone, utilizing dikes and gates established in the 1960s and 1970s to manage large water catchments, known as 'Polders.' Another colleague, Dr Krishna Jagadish, directs the Polder project for the K-State Sustainable Intensification Innovation Lab. Krishna's project has established a team of young scientists (nutritionists, water management, agronomy, social sciences, economics, climate-crop modelling) and sociolo-gists who are learning about food networks in one of the nearly 130 plus polders in the Coastal Zone ofBangladesh. Learning hubs form a key component of the adaptive research pursued by these teams. Some of their findings: Adoption of climate-resilient high-yielding rice varieties can boost grain yields by up to 50%. Incorporating fish production into the flooding phase of paddy rice supports householdnutrition. Successive cropping of hybrid cornand nutritious pulse crops can double annual food productivity. Corn grain can support emerging poultry produc-tion enterprises, while stalks provide fodder for livestock.

International Rice Research Institute.In the second half of the 20th Century, the green revolution increased agricultural production to feed a globally growing population. It was made possible because of the adoption of new practices, transfer of technology and planting of high-yield- ing crop varieties. On the other hand, this revolution changed the agricul- tural landscape and came at an environmental cost because of theincreased demand for water and a greater need for agrochemical inputs. Fifty years later, we stand at a cross- road of the green revolution because while we are projected to reach a global population of nine billion people by 2050, we cannot afford to ignore the environmental challengesthat lie ahead of us. Public awareness of environmental risks has expanded consumer demand for organic or sustainably grown food products which, in turn, shifted the standard conventional farming prac- tices to more integrated systems. The use of synthetic chemicals is still a cor- nerstone of those agricultural practices in order to maximise crop productivity and limit losses caused by diseases. While these practices will not disap- pear for obvious reasons, research has optimised chemical formulations, delivery and efficiency and as a conse- quence, reduced the chemical inputs in cropping systems and runoffs in the environment. In addition, it facilitated the adoption of natural biological prod- ucts that contain living microorgan-isms. Agricultural biological products have now become an integrated part of pest and disease management prac- tices and nutritional programmes in developed markets, where bioprod- ucts are used in combination with synthetic crop chemistries. The assemblage of microbial organ- isms associated with humans or plants is known as the microbiome and can be viewed as an extension of the host genome. There are over a billion bacterial cells that inhabit a gramme of soil or gut. The equilibrium established between those living entities (or home- ostasis) is critical for host health and that imbalance between the two entities (or dysbiosis) may lead to astate of stress. The microbiome has been a major focal point of scientific and clinical research and has fuelled the expanding market for plants and human probiotics. The agricultural biologicals market is projected to growat a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 13.8% to reach $14.65 billion by 2023 from $6.75 billion in 2017. In comparison, the U.S. markets for pro - bioticsis estimated at $49.4 billion in 2018 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7% in the next five years. The strategy for a probiotic is to introduce \"beneficial\" microbe(s) that could pro- vide advantageous traits to the host and improve environmental fitness. Yet the inability to predict or manipu- late the behaviour of the introduced microbe and to deliver a consistent response to the treatments haveimpacted scientific credibility. The advent of \"Omics\" technologies provide the tools for a broader under- standing of the microbial ecosystems and their dynamic interaction with thehost. It enabled the screening of large microbial populations and identified individual or groups of taxa with functional capabilities. The rhizosphere (the soil environment that surrounds the roots) is a microbe- rich environment that includes fungi, oomycetes, archaea, viruses and bac- teria. Evidence shows that plants have developed a mechanism for recruiting specific microbes to cope with envi- ronmental stress. In this capacity, the host-selected microbes have provided a protective role against invasion by opportunistic pathogens, or drought conditions. Capitalising on those endemic functional microbes would increase the success rate for commer- cial biopesticides that currently rely on the exogenous application of non- native strains to a crop system. There is broad scientific support for biologi- cal controls against plant pathogens. However, those have been established in controlled conditions in in vitro or in planta assays, but under field condi- tions, very few biological control agents can perform at a competitive level. This limitation combined with the challenge of formulating a product that guarantees a long shelf life of microbial activity has hindered market access of the microbial technologies. Yet there have been a handful of com-Philippe Rolshausen, Cooperative Extension Specialist based at University of California, Riverside, explains how the plant microbiome can be harnessed for commercial applicationsHarnessing the plant microbiome for commercial applications 58PROFILEmercial successes for agriculture with fungal- (e.g., Trichoderma) and bacte- (e.g., Bacillus, Streptomyces, or Pseudomonas) bioproducts. The plant rhizosphere also conveys key nutritional functions similar to those of the human gut. Scientists made the analogy that \"plants weartheir gut on the outside\" because roots are exposed to the fluctuation of the environmental conditions, as opposed to the gut that is internal and, thereby, more environmentally sheltered. The energy production strategy between plants and mam- mals are, however, different. Plants can internally generate their owncarbon energy (or autotrophs) throughphotosynthesis, while mammals seek their energy from other external sources (or heterotrophs). The mam- malian gut has evolved to facilitate theuptake of simple sugars, lipids, vita- mins and ions. In contrast, nutrient acquisition by roots to support plant growth is almost exclusively limited to mineral ions and water from soil. The microbial profile of human guts andthe plant rhizosphere is qualitatively and quantitatively different because of the contrasting conditions under those two environments (oxygen level, pH, food availability). Despite the fact that those two microbiomes have evolved independently, they have in both cases, helped facilitate availability and assimilation of nutri- ents to their host. One obvious exam- ple is the symbiotic relationship between legumes (peas, beans) and rhizobia. Those bacteria help the plant fix atmospheric nitrogen (78% of the air) in exchange for a carbon supply. Another example is the symbiotic relationship between the plant and mycorrhizal fungi, whereby the myc- orrhizae receive carbon from the plant in exchange for increased nutri- ent uptake (principally phosphorus and nitrogen). Both of those symbiotic microbes have been commercialised as biofertilizers and are being used successfully in agricultural production systems, mostly for annual croppingsystems. Our research has also shown that citrus trees are often found in association with mycorrhizae andthose fungi appear to support tree health under stress conditions. Our group is investigating if this symbiotic relationship can be established early on at the tree propagation phase in nurseries, rather than at a later stage in the field. In this way, this strategy would promote tree growth early on and sustain orchard longevity.

How- ever, the desire for uniformity, which can be seen in countries all over the world, has created a conflict between the cultural preference for visual uniformity and the practical need for species diversity. Most cities exhibit a low species diver- sity when it comes to urban trees. This may be caused by historical conven- tion combined with the assumption that only a few species would adhere to cultural and design norms. However,the over-planting of a limited number of species called monocultures, have brought about the decline of formerly common and numerous types of tree. When a few trees dominate, their dis- eases and insect pests can proliferate causing tree decline. Elms, chestnuts, and ash trees have been decimated by the proliferation of insects (emerald ash borer) and diseases (Dutch elm disease, Chestnut Blight). It is clear that design objectives must be balanced against the practical need for species diversity in street tree plantings. Current strategies Faced with the difficulty of balancing aesthetic and ecological concerns, current designers all too often short-change or even abandon one or the other objective-genetic diversity or visual uniformity. Where they may have once planted an entire neighbourhood with the same species, those favouring uniformity over practicality might now plant a single species for one or two blocks of a given street. Although this sort of compromise may feel like a bow to diversity, it isn't a true solution to the problem. Planting trees in somewhat smaller 'same species' blocks will not necessarily prevent the kinds of devas- tation associated with monocultures on a block by block basis, particularly if the species selected have already beenheavily planted in the community. For those favouring an ecologicallysensible approach, the alternative to monocultures is sometimes to plant wonderfully diverse selections of trees that share no common characteristics whatsoever. The results of such efforts can be aesthetically disappointing and in a number of cases have led to public outcry. Unfortunately, this type of plant selec- tion has served to fuel the idea that the only way to achieve uniformity indesign is through the exclusive use of one species. The case for visual uniformity So, what makes uniform plantings so appealing in the first place? What makes them so difficult to give up? Theadvantages to uniformity are primarilyaesthetic and have a long-standing tradition over many centuries interna- tionally. A street lined with rows of more or less identical trees brings to most observers a sense of order and tranquillity, even the domination of nature. In the most heterogeneous of neighbourhoods, a uniform row of trees can have a cohesive influence, tying together diverse elements and creating a sense of neighbourhood identity. Street trees can also soften the potentially jarring transitions from residential to commercial areas. Moreover, marching rows of identical trees have been used as a symbol of power by military commanders as they marched their armies down those uniformly designed streets. The case for species diversity Unfortunately, the appeal of same species plantings is ultimately out- weighed by its disadvantages. Even if aesthetics were the only consideration, the fact that unhealthy or dying trees are unattractive makes the need to diversify unavoidably. Another factor that makes monocul- tures impractical is the tremendous diversity inherent in the urban environ- ment. The challenges and stresses for trees can change dramatically within very small distances, often making it impossible for a single species to thrive uniformly throughout a given area. Variables, such as light, reflected tem-Dr Nina Bassuk, Professor at the Urban Horticulture Institute, School of Integrative Plant Science, explains creating urban tree biodiversity within a uniform street tree landscapeCreating urban tree biodiversity within a uniform street tree landscape 60PROFILEperature, drainage, soil compaction, limited rooting space, soil pH, availabil- ity of water, exposure to salt, and restrictions to crown development can vary tremendously even from one tree space to the next. A careful assess- ment of site conditions prior to plant selection rarely points to the selection of a single species. Even those who are aware of this fact often make the mistake of selecting one species that will purportedly survive under any and all difficult conditions. Such widely adaptable species dominate the afore- mentioned list of overplanted trees that have suffered decline, become unmanageable, or both. A solution To avoid similar problems in the future, it is clear that uniform plantings of alimited number of species must be avoided. But, is it possible to gain the practical advantages of diversity with- out giving up the aesthetic desire for uniformity? Fortunately, the answer is yes. Through the careful selection and grouping of plants, communities of trees can be created which, despite their genetic diversity can satisfy our desire for visual uniformity. By breaking down the visual charac- teristics that distinguish one species from another into basic categories, we have selected a set of five criteria for putting genetically diverse speciesinto aesthetically compatible groups. The first criteria concerns height to first branch. The distance from the ground to the first branches of the tree canopy creates the visual andphysical envelope that we view or walk under. By keeping this space equal between trees, the walking or viewing experience appears alike between trees. The second and third criteria are tree size and shape. Noth- ing will create a uniform appearance less than a large tree planted next to a small tree or a narrow tree planted next to a broad spreading tree. \"Unfortunately, the appeal of same species plantings is ultimately outweighed by its disadvantages. Even if aesthetics were the only consideration, the fact that unhealthy or dying trees are unattractive makes the need to diversify unavoidably.\" The other two criteria of less impor- tance are branching density and foliage texture. They are given sec- ondary consideration because they generally are not as obvious to the casual observer and can even become difficult to distinguish as the distance from the observer increases. By using these criteria, it is possible to have greater biodiversity in our cities while acknowledging the desire for visualuniformity.

Global awareness is also rising: the ITER Tokamak, a collaboration of 35 countries to build the rst industrial-scale fusion reactor - literally \"a star on earth\" - is among the most ambitious scientic endeavours of our time, with high stakes for our future. While hundreds of tokamaks have been built over the past six decades, none are like this. Still, observers tend to limit their observations of ITER's uniqueness to superlatives.

These comparisons can be mindboggling. But they do not fully portray ITER's \"rsts,\" nor do they hint at ITER's ongoing, real-time return on investment for its partners. Within this rst-of-a-kind machine is a mini- universe of rst-of-a-kind components, systems, and technologies.

Atthe outset, worldwide production capacity of niobium- tin stood at 15 tonnes per year. Nine suppliers in six of the seven ITER Members ramped up global output to nearly 150 tonnes per year - each working to precisely the same materials specications, testing protocols, and quality assurance standards. A global industry wasborn. For any superconductor application, such as medical scanning equipment, a call for tender couldnow be placed with equal condence in Carteret, New Jersey, Xi'an, China, or the Jastec facilities in Japan. Consider the rst-of-a-kind tools demanded by ITER's assembly process. Taekyung Heavy Industries of Korea has manufactured the twin titans in this ITER toolbox:two 22-metre-tall Sub-Sector Assembly Tools, each capable of delicately folding together a 440-tonne vacuum vessel sector, two 310-tonne toroidal eld magnets, and segments of the thermal shield into a composite whole, with precision measured in millime- tres. To verify the performance of ITER's magnet-pro- tecting \"pre-compression rings\" - more than a billion glass bres held together with epoxy resin - a futuristictesting device developed by Douce Hydro of France (pictured above) will exert a force of 36,000 tonnes with a positional accuracy of 0.1 millimetre. Each such tool - and there are dozens more - demandsinnovation. And there is more. Across every aspect of the project, in laboratories and fabrication centres onthree continents, t-for-purpose R&D isbeing used to develop specialised steelalloys, gyrotrons, pellet injectors, power electronics, cryogenic pumps, tritium breeding systems, and hundreds of other rst-of-a-kind innovations. When CEOs talk about the benet of participating in this project, they rarely focus on a contract's monetary value. They speak of being stretched, of the creativity and innovation ITER demands, of the newly developed industrial capac- ities that result, of new spin-o technolo- gies with implications and markets well beyond plasma physics or tokamak engi-neering - and of the increased competi- tiveness they acquire by being part of this unprecedented project. The multinational nature of the ITER project is in itself driving rst-of-a-kind solutions to logistics, shipping and storage, schedule management, 4D software anddata management, multi-sector cooperation, and other challenges of international project management. Given the array of complex cross-border threats facing modern society, from climate change to pandemics, several wise observers have commented that the les- sons learned in this area may prove to be among our most enduring and meaningful contributions: learning how to work together, in the most tangible terms, to solve a global problem. Ultimately, ITER will enable scientists to study a con-trolled \"burning\" or self-heating plasma, the gatewayto oering fusion as a clean, safe, virtually unlimited source of energy for thousands of future generations. But until that time, even now, the returns on investment are rolling in.

A review of the progress made in the development of the plasma gun needed by PJMIF is given in [2]. Under the ARPA-E ALPHA program launched in 2015 [3], a plasma gun called the ALPHA2gun was developed. The plasma gun development has experienced three development cycles. The first cycle was undertaken with a series of gas valves culminating in Revision 9 (Rev9) using the ALPHA2gun [4]. The second cycle of development introduced Revision 10 (Rev10) of the gas valve, which had substantially improved performance characteristics over the first 9 versions in terms of precision gas mass metering, the speed of opening and closing, reliabil- ity, and repeatability. The third cycle of the development of the plasma gun(HJ1) is near completion [5]. Final tuning of the gun is in progress. In 2016-2018, multiple-gun opera- tions to launch and merge up to seven jets to form a conical section of the plasma liner was performedusing the second-generation gun (Alpha2Gun) equipped with the Rev10 gas valve at the Los Alamos PLX- facility. High-speed framing end-onCCD images of the six Jets merging were acquired, samples of which are shown in Figure 1(a). The imagesshow clearly the formation of primary shocks when the jets first merge. The shocked region of the jet spreads lat- erally, and soon the shock processesthe entire jet. The shocked plasma flows proceed to merge and produce secondary shocks which process the plasma in a similar way as the primary shocks, thus resulting in a cascade of shocks. This phenomenology was expected theoretically. Computer simulations ofthe jet merging dynamics agree well with the experimental results as shown in Figure 1(b). Reasonable agreement between the computer simulations and the experimental results is obtained when 10% random mass variations and 1 \u00b5s random timing variations in the arrivals of the jets are introduced into the computer simulations. The shock cascade raises an impor- tant physics issue. The shocks heat up the plasma liner, increasing its inter- nal pressure, which resists the self- compression of the liner, thusreducing its efficacy in compressing the target plasma when it is used to implode a target plasma. A dimen- sionless quantity that may be used to gauge the severity of this effect is the Mach number, which is the ratio of the plasma liner flow speed to its internal sound speed. The heating of the plasma liner raises its internal sound speed, thus lowering the Machnumber of the flow. Y. C. Francis Thio and F. Douglas Witherspoon, HyperJet Fusion Corporation, provide an update on the progress on Plasma-Jet-Driven Magneto-Inertial FusionPlasma-Jet-Driven Magneto-Inertial Fusion - A progress report 64PROFILE Fig. 1.

Plasmas, 26, 032704 (2019) doi:10 (a)The heating of the liner by the shocks is mainly experienced by the ions in the liner, while the electrons remain cool. If the electrons can cool the ions at a sufficiently high rate, it is possible that the plasma liner may recover its high Mach number at some point after merging. By studying how the Mach number of the liner evolves in time, we can better assess the effect of the shock cascades caused by thejet merging on the imploding efficacyof the plasma liner. This is an impor- tant piece of physics we wish to extract from our multiple jet merging experiments. We found indeed that the rate of cool- ing of the ions by the electrons was sufficiently fast for the ions to recover its Mach number from a temporary depression during the traverse of theplasma liner towards the centre before it was expected to engage with the target in an actual liner-on-target implosion in a typical PJMIF scenario [7, 8]. Over the last 12 months, HyperJet Fusion has been engaged in the devel- opment of a third-generation plasma gun (HJ1), introducing the following new features [5]: 65PROFILE 34 \u00b5s, 42 \u00b5s after launching of the jets.

The footprint and volume of the capacitor module are significantly reduced from Alpha2gun to HJ1. (b)66PROFILE The footprint and volume of the capacitor module driving the gun is considerably reduced going from Alpha2gun to HJ1 as shown in Figure 2. This is necessary in order to field all 36 guns on the PLX tank. The space between the transmission plates in the manifold is completely filled with a solid insulator, thus, providing robust and reliable electrical insula- tion without any voids, preventing any spurious arcing breakdowns in the transmission manifold. The tighter configuration also results in lowering the internal inductance of the trans- mission manifold. We expect that, as a result of the lower parasitic induc- tance, HJ1 should have higher electric- to-kinetic efficiency. The gun makes use of a gas valve to dispense working gas into the gun. The gas valve is opened by an electro- magnetic propulsion subsystem consisting of a drive coil and an aluminium flyer plate (a coilgun). To open the gas valve, a large pulse of electrical current is passed through the drive coil, which induces a large eddy current in the flyer plate. The drive current in the coil and the induced eddy current in the flyer plate repels each other giving rise to the propulsive force that opens the valve. The self-inductance in the drive coil in HJ1 is about 20 times smaller than in Alpha2gun, leading to a 10-fold increase in the electric-to-kinetic efficiency. Consequently, the capacitorbank of about 1 kilo-joule per gas valve that was required to drive the gas valves in Alpha2gun is reduced to only 100 joules, which can be suppliedby a capacitor module that can be packed with each individual gun. The drive coil in HJ1 is a single-plane, axisymmetric coil that can be wound and placed in the gas valve body witha high degree of geometry precision with respect to the flyer plate (Figure 3). The initial gap between the top of the drive coil and the flyer plate is tightly controlled, leading to very little variations in the mutual inductance between the drive coil and the flyer plate from valve to valve. The mutual inductance is the electrical parameter that determines the repulsive force between the drive coil and the flyer plate. Small adjustments to the circuit parameters for the individual coil of each gun will be sufficient to compen- sate for any electrical and mechanical variations from valve to valve. A dedicated gas-valve test stand to fine tune, calibrate and qualify each gas valve for all the 36 guns have been developed. Improvement in gun-to- gun repeatability of the gas valve is expected. To prepare the initial neutral gas slab to accept the main current pulse, the Fig. 3. The new HJ1 gas valve and pre-ionizing technique: (a) the gas valve drive coil is planar, axisymmetric, precision wound and highly reproducible. (b) The (a) (b)gas slab needs to be pre-ionized. In HJ1, we introduce for the first time a new pre-ionization technique for plasma guns based on a self-switching glow-like discharge (Figure 3(c)) [5]. Eliminating the switch simplifies con- siderably the logistics of implementing the 36-gun plasma liner experiment. Furthermore, the new pre-ionization system is two-fold more efficient energy-wise than that used in Alpha2gun, allowing a smaller capaci- tor to drive the pre-ionization, smallenough for the capacitor to be packed as part of the gun. However, the tech- nique appears to have the tendency to trigger the main current discharge prematurely. We are in the process oftroubleshooting the problem. A new closing switch for the main dis- charge has been developed that uses a much more efficient triggering mechanism based on the field-distor- tion configuration. The field-distortiontrigger uses only 15 J of energy per gun compared with 250 J of energy per gun in the Alpha2gun. This also eases the logistics burden of fielding the 36-gun plasma liner experiment [5]. Production of the 36 guns is underway. References 1. Y. C. F. Thio and F. D.

Those values and principles emphasise delivering value to your customers, responding to change, and collaboration. Agile frameworks and practices are particularly helpful if you work in complex or uncertain environments where you know you have a problem to solve, butyou're not exactly sure what that problem is and you certainly don't know what the solution is. Agile frameworks encourage short feedback cycles in the form of frequent deliveries followed by feedback and adjustment. These short feedback cycles help you to validate assumptions, discover the true problem, and identify a proper solution. When you work on digital services, you interact with people outside your organisation, such as customers,constituents, or suppliers. Those interactions happen on your organisation's website, mobile app, or through software that allows people outside your organisation to self-serve and engage directly with one or more of your processes. The minute you interact with people outside your organisation, you inherently enter an uncertain and complex domain. You have no control over whether they use your new digital services, so you have to look at those digital services as you would a product. You have to gure out what will encourage use of the services. You have to gure out how those services can add meaningful value to your customers, constituents and suppliers. You need to learn what customers, constituents, or suppliers nd valuable. You need to learn how to apply the values and principles expressed in the Agile Mani- festo to provide them with that value. You can do this most eectively by delivering a small piece of your solution and getting feedback. You need to operate in an Agile fashion. Digital services add value in the private and public sectors Many organisations view digital transformation as a way to bring eciency and cost savings to their organ- isation and its processes. After all, why employ sta to interact with your customers when you can set things up to allow them to self-serve? This is a short-sighted view that may do harm to those organisations in the long run. Anyone who has fallen into an endless phone tree loop or been lost in a poorly designed online request form can attest to the damage a poorly designed digital service can do to an organi- sation's reputation in the eyes of its customers. If you want to adopt digital services your primary focus should be on providing value to your customers. How can you make getting services from your organisation simpler? How can you make your customers want to do business with you? Design those services right, and they will often add an additional way to interact with your organisation rather than replace an existing means. Design those services right, and you will add value for your customer and generate benets for your organisation at the same time. The same applies to organisations in the public sector. Replace customers with constituents, and the above still holds true, but perhaps even more so. When youKent J. McDonald, Content Curator at Agile Alliance lifts the lid on Agile software development and the delivery of digital servicesICT 69create a digital service that is easy for citizens to use and allows them to accomplish what they set out to do, your services are more likely to accomplish the out- comes they were established to provide, and your citizens will have more condence in your organisation. Becoming an Agile organisation requires change In order to deliver digital services that truly add value to your constituents, you have to approach delivering those services in an iterative, incremental fashion. You have to be willing to form hypotheses about your constituents and their needs and prove or disprove those ideas with safe-to-fail experiments. That type of approach will not happen if the only part of the organisation that changes are the people responsible for developing software. Your entire organisation needs to think how to work in a way that delivers value to your constituents, responds to change, and encourages collaboration. This means that bureaucracy, self-serving actions, and empire building cannot have a place in your organisation. You have to ask on a regular basis: \"How might we structure and operate our organisation in a way thatallows us to create and respond to change and deal with uncertainty?\" You need to follow up on the answers you come up with. The change is not easy. The change is not quick. But ifyou're serious about it, the benets for your con- stituents and your organisation are well worth it. Kent J. McDonald Content Curator Agile Alliancekent.mcdonald@agilealliance.orgwww.agilealliance.org www.twitter.com/AgileAlliance The world was introduced to the first commercial mobile phone in 1983 with the launch of the Motorola DynaTAC 800x, which stood at a height of 13 inches, weighed 1.75 pounds and took 10 hours to recharge. In the early days of the mobile phone industry, it was incredibly simple for attackers toclone a phone's identity and run up all sorts of charges on your account. Over the last few decades, mobile has experienced quite a metamorphosis from the \"brick\" of the 1980s to the compact, feature-packed smartphone of today. Now, mobile is king - people across the globe use their mobile devices not only to communicate but also to read the news, get directions, stream music, check bank accounts,store assets and so much more. As we increasingly rely on our mobile devices, new avenues of attack continue to emerge. So much of our sensitive personal information and digital assets - such as corporate data and bank account and credit card numbers - are accessible via our mobile devices. They have become treasure troves for attackers. Blockchain and mobile device security There is great promise for creating mobile device security by combining secure enclaves - also known as 'rootsof trust' - with blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that protects a digital transaction through complex mathe- matical algorithms. Because of the strength of this math, the transaction can only be created by those who hold a valid private key. Private keys were developed as ameans of protecting our digital trans- actions. A private key is a piece of cryptographic code that allows a user to prove who he or she is - in other words, it's a digital signature that says the user is, in fact, the one who is executing a digital transaction. Private keys are used to secure a variety of transactions on mobile, including messaging, cryptocurrency and more. Here's the downside: if an attacker steals your private key, theycan impersonate you, and then access and abuse your data and digital assets. The prevalence of mobile devices has made them some of the largest repositories for private keys. The biggest challenge in decentralised cybersecurity is that we cannot prove the transaction was intended. If an attacker steals your private key and transfers $5,000 to a third person, there is no way to prove that the attacker - and not you - performed the transaction. Rivetz ensures an intended transaction by establishingthat it occurs from a known device, in a known condition, with an authorised user, under the required conditions. Rivetz performs \"device attestation\" to ensure a user's devices are in a \"known\" condition by executing regular health checks to ensure the device integrity. Each device's integrityis recorded on the blockchain so future health checks can be compared with the baseline, establishing thatthose devices are in a condition the user intended. As the rise of the internet brought digital fraud and attacks on identity, innovative industry leaders banded together to fight that fraud and formed organisations such as theTrusted Computing Group (TCG). TCG developed specifications that have become standard for securing devices,as well as the data and identity onthose devices, such as personal computers and laptops. Trusted computing uses hardware to protect users. It ensures a device will consistently behave in the expected ways, protected by a secure enclaveor a 'root of trust' embedded within the device's hardware. A root of trust is isolated from the device's software operating system (OS), allowing it to execute code that cannot be seen by the OS. One such root of trust devel- oped by Global Platform is the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), whichSteven Sprague, Cofounder and CEO of Rivetz reveals a viable solution when it comes to decentralising security. He argues that there is great promise for creating mobile device security with blockchain technologyDecentralising security for mobile devices: Is blockchain the viable solution? 70PROFILEenables trusted computing technol- ogy for mobile devices. The TEE already is built into the hardware of more than 1 billion mobile devices. Today, most private keys are generated within software, which is much more susceptible to attack than hardware. The TEE is capable of protecting a user's private key within the device hardware, a method that is far more secure than performing these opera-tions in standard software. A single system of security may not be enough to protect against the variety of cyber-attacks possible today. It is more pressing than ever to provide multi-layered protection of digital assets across two or more security domains. That way, even if an attacker were to breach one point of security, the other(s) still would need to be com- promised, offering an extra layer of protection for important digital assets - whether that's your personal infor- mation or your hard-earned money. One of the most ubiquitous roots of trust is the subscriber identity module, or SIM card. The SIM is a protected hardware environment and was created to combat mobile fraud and to protect the device identity. With the pervasiveness of both the TEE andthe SIM, Rivetz saw an innovativeopportunity to use these isolated roots of trust to work together to protect mobile users. In conjunctionwith ElevenPaths, the cybersecurity unit of Telef\u00f3nica, the world's third- largest mobile carrier with more than 300 million subscribers, Rivetz uses both the TEE and SIM to protect our private keys - introducing the Dual Roots of Trust. The solution leverages the TEE along with the SIMs deployed by Telef\u00f3nica. With Dual Roots of Trust, Rivetz- enabled apps generate private keys in hardware, then cryptographically distribute those private keys between the TEE and the SIM. This deliversbuilt-in security from both the mobile carrier and the device manufacturers, to create decentralised key protection. By distributing a private key across these two roots of trust, attackers would have to breach both secure sys- tems in order to steal a single private key. As an added security feature, two different entities - or independent control planes - aid the user in con- trolling their private keys. Through a special application authorised to perform activities inside the TEE, the user remains in control of the secrets stored in the TEE. If your mobiledevice is lost or stolen, a simple interaction with your mobile carrier can disable the SIM, permanently ortemporarily until the device is found. So even if a thief has your device, you remain in control and your privatekeys are still safe.The Rivetz solution has an unlimited number of use cases, such as sensi- tive work apps, mobile wallets, social media accounts and mobile banking. One of the most unique applications of Dual Roots of Trust is the ability to provably control specific applications on a device. This feature is especially useful for enterprises. Let's say a company has its own proprietaryRivetz-enabled app that employees use for work on their personal devices. If an employee is terminated or leaves, the company has the ability to revoke access to that app on the former employee's personal device with Dual Roots of Trust. As our mobile devices have become more important to our everyday livesand contain so much of our personal and private data, we need better ways to protect ourselves. The solution lies in the roots of trust that already exist on millions of mobile platforms: the SIM and the TEE are two of the mostcommon secure enclaves. Dual Roots of Trust is the next step in ensuring our assets stay safe.

Minister McKenna believes that governments can assist people to thrive in a changing climate. \"Governments everywhere want to protecttheir citizens from climate risks. They want to build resilient communities, protect investments, reduce costs and ensure people thrive in a changing climate\", she says. In March this year, we were very fortunate to enjoy a conversation with Canada's Ambassador for Climate Change, Patricia Fuller, to nd out how the Government of Canada is working together with Canadian businesses to grow Canada's clean economy. In this interview, we discover how Canadians coming up with innovative methods to increase energy eciency and reduce emissions, saving people money and creating goodjobs. Looking ahead, we learn about the importance of investing in projects that will help Canada reduce emissions and take action on climate change. Supporting innovation and the development of clean technologies We know that there are a wide range of programmes in place to support innovation and the development ofclean technologies by the Government of Canada. Innovation is supported from early-stage R&D rightthrough to commercialisation and Patricia notes that in recent federal Budgets, support in this vein was expanded through the Business Development Bank ofCanada (BDC) and Export Development Canada (EDC). They have both created special teams focused on nancing clean technology companies, but there arealso many other forms of support being given, Patricia tells us.\"Another important institution that works within this area is Sustainable Development Technology Canada and they are supporting companies that are looking to develop and demonstrate clean technologies.\" Innovative ways to increase energy eciency and reduce emissions The conversation then moves to explain how Canadians coming up with innovative methods to increase energy eciency and reduce emissions will save people money and create good jobs. Patricia underlines that in Canada today, innovation is being evidenced in all sectors of the economy in light of that fact that both clean technology and clean growth encompass many areas. One example is the industrial sector, where there are innovations around saving companies energy costs through innovation in processes. Patricia then keenly gives additional examples in her own words. \"A whole area of innovation we are seeing a lot of is in the application of IT and the Internet of things (IoT) so that industry can become much more ecient in how they use resources. We are seeing the IT and data analytics space innovating very strongly. \"Also, in the area of electricity generation, we see the application of IT and articial intelligence (AI) to the management of electricity grids. There is the whole area of smart grid technology and grid modelling, that enables much more use of renewable energy because the electricity grid can become much more decentralised. \"In the area of energy eciency when it comes to build- ings and homes, we have a number of innovations in terms of how to get those projects o the ground. For example, we have seen rapid growth occurring in Toronto over the last 15-20 years in terms of high risePatricia Fuller, Canada's Ambassador for Climate Change, explains how Canada is taking action to reduce emissions and tackle climate change73buildings while energy demand remains constant, because of improved insulation and lighting, for exam- ple, which drives down the use of energy. \"Then, of course, there is the transportation sector where the move towards electrication is key and, we see greater use of electric vehicles and we are support- ing charging stations. Canadian companies are also developing electric buses and exporting those interna- tionally, so that is a very exciting area of innovation. \"It's also important to share innovation in the oil and gas sector where companies are investing to drive down the energy-intensity of oil and gas production, as well as developing carbon capture and use technologies. There is the example of a company, Carbon Cure, who puts CO2in concrete to make is stronger so that it will create value, and you can see other examples of uses for CO2and the potential of a market for that.\" Reducing emissions and tackling climate change As we look to the future, Patricia explains why it is important to invest in projects that will help Canada reduce emissions and to take action on climate change. Investment in these areas creates a \"win-win\" situation when it comes to Canada reducing their emissions, reaching targets under the Paris Agreement, and helping Canada to be competitive in the global transition towards a low carbon economy. \"We know that all countries are investing in these areas as well and we want to ensure that Canadian industry ispositioned to be competitive and to have a leadershiprole in areas where we have strength. We know that this supports long-term prosperity, as well as the creation of very good jobs today.\" Supporting developing countries From our earlier article by Minister of Environment and Climate Change in Canada, Catherine McKenna, we learn that Canada is assisting developing countries to access clean energy and climate solutions. In 2016, we learn that the Government of Canada committed to contributing $2.65 billion up to 2021 towards the achievement of this goal. Patricia oers her own thoughts on this aspect of policy as the interview draws to a close. \"We are very aware that developed countries need to support developing countries in making the transition and in adapting to the eects of climate change that are already potentially catastrophic for developmentgoals. So, we are investing in programmes that support developing countries to adapt to climate change.\" Patricia Fuller Canada's Ambassador for Climate Change Government | Dreamstime.comPromoting the transportation sectors move towards electrification is key. Nova Bus is a Canadian bus manufacturer, owned by Volvo BusesIn the Arctic, semi-permanent ice exists at the Earth's surface in various forms - the seasonal snow cover, as ground ice within permafrost regions, as freshwater ice on lakes and rivers, and as glaciers, ice caps and the continental ice sheet on Greenland. All these forms of ice are susceptible to melting in a warming climate and many of them are already decreasing in extent because the northern high latitudes are among the most rapidly warming regions on Earth. At present, excluding the Greenland ice sheet, there are estimated to be 64,296 ice caps and glaciers in the Arctic, with a total area of nearly 422,000 km2. The most heavily glaciated regions are the Canadian Arctic Islands (~146,000 km2), Alaska (86,725 km2), Greenland (excluding the Greenland ice sheet, 89,717 km2), and the Russian Arctic Islands of Novaya Zemlya, Severnaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land (51,592 km2). Glaciers cover a further ~ 48,000 km2 in the Norwegian Arctic (Svalbard and Jan Mayen Island), Iceland, and North- ern Scandinavia (Box, Sharp et al., 2017). For the whole Arctic, excluding Greenland, the total volume of glacier ice is estimated to be nearly 115,000 km3. This volume of ice would be enough to raise the global mean sea level by about 29 cm if all the glaciers melted completely. Over the period 2003-2009, Arctic ice caps and glaciers were losing mass at a rate of about -176 gigatons (Gt) every year, with the highest rates of total mass loss being estimated for the Canadian Arctic Islands (-60 Gt/yr),Alaska (-50 Gt/yr), and Greenland (excluding the ice sheet, -38 Gt/yr). A further -28 Gt/yr came from glaciers in the Russian Arctic Islands, Svalbard, Jan Mayen Island, Iceland and northern Scandinavia. For reference, one Gt is a billion metric tonnes. For the longer period 2003-2015, best estimates based on satellite gravitymeasurements from the GRACE satel- lites suggest regional mean rates of -66.8 Gt/yr for Arctic Canada, -42.5 Gt/yr for Alaska, -16.0 Gt/yr for the Russian Gt/yr for Iceland, and -7.6 Gt/yr for Svalbard (Box, Sharp et al., 2017, following Wouters et al., 2008). Together, these longer-term rates equate to a rate of sea level rise of ~ 3.92 mm/yr. To put these present- day rates of mass loss into some perspective, data derived from analy-sis of ice cores from the Canadian Arctic ice caps suggest that current rates of melting are the highest in the past 4,000 years, and that they were last exceeded about 9,000 years ago duringthe Holocene climatic optimum (Fisher et al., 2012). An increase in global mean sea level is probably the most widely recognisedProfessor Martin Sharp, University of Alberta, explores the processes, rates and impacts of the changing Arctic ice caps due to global warmingThe changing Arctic ice caps 74PROFILE Professor Martin Sharp, University of Alberta I am a glaciologist with specific interests in the glaciers of the Cana- dian high Arctic. My work focuses on the rates, processes and impacts of glacier change, glacier hydrology and hydrochemistry, microbial life in glacial environments, and the dynamics of polar glaciers. I am equally interested in communicat- ing about these phenomena, and how they are affected by global cli- mate change, to the broader public, and have been involved in writing several major scientific assess-ments of Arctic climate change and its impacts. I am also the Director of the Canadian Ice Core Archive at the University of Alberta. This is an ice core research facility that also houses the Canadian national ice core collection. consequence of melting of glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets, although thermal expansion of ocean waters due to ocean warming also contributes to this. Such sea level rise is a matter of concern because of the high con- centrations of human populations, property, and infrastructure at lowelevations close to the ocean, where they are potentially vulnerable to coastal inundation driven by rising sea levels. Large and rapid changes in the rates at which glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets melt can have substantial impacts on the aquatic ecosystems of downstream lakes, rivers, floodplains, and wetlands. These include changes in both mean and extreme water levels, the magnitude and timing of flood events, stream water tempera- tures, chemistry and sediment loading, and have the potential to impact the full range of organisms that inhabit these environments. Glacial meltwaters can transport large amounts of dissolved and particle- bound nutrients that play an impor- tant role in supporting productivity in downstream freshwater and marine environments. For instance, the termini of \"tidewater\" glaciers that terminate in the ocean are often important feeding grounds for seabirds and marine mammals. However, higher rates of melt, runoff and sediment transport from glaciers will typically result in more turbid water columns in downstream rivers, lakes, and nearshore marine environ- ments and this can reduce light pene- tration into the water column and limit photosynthetic activity, primary production, and water temperatures.There are therefore many reasons to be concerned about the conse- quences of accelerating rates of glacier and ice cap melt in the Arctic as these can be felt well beyond the present-day limits of the ice masses themselves. Other potential impacts include the release of legacy pollutants that have been deposited on glaciers, ice caps and the Greenland Ice Sheet over time and stored within the upper layers of the snow and firn (snow that is on its way to becoming glacier ice) in highelevation regions where snow typically accumulates year-on-year and is gradually transformed into glacier ice.As atmospheric warming progresses, however, surface melting spreads to higher and higher elevations and eventually mobilises the accumulated reservoir of pollutants and transfers it to downstream aquatic systems, where it may be assimilated into the food chain. As has been demonstrated in the Canadian Rockies, European Alps and Antarctica, this can result in the reappearance in living organisms of pollutants that have been banned and not actively used for decades.

Almost a year later, higher education contexts continue to face tensions and challenges in addressing those calls to action. There has beenmuch talk of how to address the callsand some policy changes, but it is clearthat there are a lot of tensions and challenges around the implementation of any changes. Lakehead University offers an example of how those tensions and challenges can beexpressed. The university's response to Recommendation 28 was to ensure that all law students were provided with opportunities to better under- stand Indigenous peoples and the law by weaving Indigenous content throughout the law curriculum. How- ever, in practice, there appear to be challenges with the implementation of significant changes. Angelique Eagle- Woman was hired by Lakehead Univer- sity as the first female Indigenous law school dean in 2016 but resigned citing systemic discrimination and racism in 2018. This unfortunate situationunderscores the difference between a surface response to the calls to action and meaningful action. \"The conundrum facing higher education is how to proceed to address the calls when institutions are having difficulty being able to recognise how the very structures of the institutions are getting in the way.\" Universities and colleges are strug- gling to address the calls to action and to understand what reconciliation means. Indigenous scholars MarieDawn Zinga, Associate Professor and Chair at the Department of Child and Youth Studies at Brock University explores reconciliation in a higher education context, by detailing the tensions and challenges in this area 76 PROFILE Reconciliation in a higher education context: Tensions and challengesBattiste, Jan Hare, Jackie Ottman and Dwayne Donald spoke eloquently at the 2018 Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences about reconcilia- tion within a higher education context. Each of them remained committed to the conviction expressed by the Com- mission that education will be pivotal in putting Canada on the road to rec- onciliation. Battiste spoke about the importance of decolonising and how everyone has been \"marinated in Eurocentrism\" and that the tenets of Eurocentrism that are characterised by superiority, hegemony and amonopoly over all other knowledge systems, stand in the way of reconcil-iation. Battiste speaks about cognitive imperialism and how every Canadian student has been a victim and benefi- ciary of the same education systemthat has exposed them in Eurocen-trism and cognitive imperialism. These act as some of the greatest barriers to reconciliation and the serve to blind people to the colonialism embedded throughout education at all levels. Dwayne Donald agrees that it is diffi- cult to accomplish much when the very institution that claims to want totake steps towards reconciliation getsin the way when tensions arise. He argues that part of the problem is the tendency within higher education con- texts to take shortcuts by attempting to make changes without examining the embedded colonialism. When change is implemented in those contexts, tensions quickly rise and the response to those tensions is to reassert \"colonial terrain\". Jackie Ottman also spoke to the hidden curriculum and unconscious codes that are triggered by attempts to meaningfully address the TRC. She stated that while the Royal Commis- sion on Aboriginal Peoples issued its report in October 1996 and offered over 400 recommendations, the TRC's 94 calls to action has engendered a more lasting response. However, she warns that the weight of addressing those calls to action within highereducation contexts could not be left to Indigenous students and scholars to do all the heavy lifting, but that non-indigenous students and scholars needed to walk alongside and sharethe weight and the work. Jan Hare agreed with her colleagues and calls for a continued commitment to reconciliation that is grounded in an understanding of everyone's roles and responsibilities. \"Universities and colleges are struggling to address the calls to action and to understand what reconciliation means.\" The conundrum facing higher educa- tion is how to proceed to address the calls when institutions are having diffi- culty being able to recognise how the very structures of the institutions are getting in the way. Most institutions are implementing policies and directives, but not doing the hard work of explor- ing what it will mean to actually imple- ment those policies and directives. The end result is window dressing withoutany meaningful change or a resur- gence of colonialism and a return to the status quo that hides behindclaims of cultural inclusion or returns to pathologising Indigenous students and scholars. Reconciliation requires an examina- tion and understanding of what has happened and how current structures, systems and attitudes/biases that are conscious or unconscious continue to uphold colonialism and Eurocentrism. University mission statements can include commitments to Indigenisa- tion but without a meaningful exami- nation of what that term means and an appreciation that decolonisation is the first step and that such commit-ments will fail to produce any signifi- cant change, other than putting a new face on a continued inability to engage in reconciliation.
