The hazardous part: it leaves no time for physical and mental recreation. This is considered a primary cause of anxiety. If not a long holiday, make sure to head to a luxury retreat on weekends, which is perfect to bring a little balance. These retreats encourage travellers to connect with local cultures\u2014through nature trails, surfing, art, and cooking classes\u2014as well as reconnect with themselves. Holidaying at a gentler pace is the new buzz word and new age hospitality projects are trying to weave together this philosophy in their programs. Some retreats even fuse yoga and Ayurveda practices with new age fitness methods of pilates and zumba in the outdoors. Ayurveda also gives importance to maintaining health in a healthy individual over just curing a disease. Make sure to maintain that balance by planning getaways closer to nature as frequently as possible It is a myth that a wellness holiday would cost the earth. Our country's sunny coastlines, breezy river sides and serene mountain tops encourage travellers to use the outdoor for rejuvenation. Ashrams nestled in Himalayas and Kerala offer humble stay options with wholesome yoga and wellness breaks, as per the ancient principles. International tourists too have been lured by the benefits of these programs. Mornings begin with yoga amidst misty spice plantations or valley views and the day ends with sunset yoga. In between, an individual can participate in a variety of programmes as per the principles of Ayurveda, which help in overall wellness of the mind and body. These sessions are designed to last about seven, 14 and 21 days long. Some prescribe diet and massages to get more benefit out of the stay. These therapies are particularly helpful for those with rheumatic ailments, arthritis, chronic cold and asthma. For those suffering from depression and stress, yoga sessions help build a better focus on the emotional state, which in turn aids in relieving stress, calming the mind. Moreover, obesity programmes are massively popular for those who've had a long and rather tiring battle with weight loss. These programs are designed specifically to not only help sculpt the body but also improve flexibility and achieve a strong body. VIEW FOOD AS MEDICINE Farm stays are garnering popularity with those health conscious souls. While the primary focus of a farm stay is to offer opportunities to learn how a farm functions, most use the opportunity to enjoy organic produce. Some farm stays focus on creating menus that are specifically targeted for diabetes and heart health. Further, you can enjoy farm activities like feeding animals or go vegetable and fruit picking. Culinary trails and cooking sessions are also a popular feature. Some stays are specifically dedicated to raw and vegan foods, allowing you to embrace food in its beautiful natural form and taking the focus off animal products and processed foods. More and more people are turning towards farmstays to get away from the daily grind and enjoy a sneak-peak into authentic ways of living and breathe clean air. With agritourism on the rise, you can find many farm stays across budgets around Gujarat, Maharashtra and Kerala. THERAPIES THAT SOOTHE AILMENTS Ayurveda has an impressive array of medical practices that garnered fame world over. In addition to yoga programs, daily massage therapies are designed by Ayurveda experts and followed by tailor-made programs based on thebody constitution. Wellness goals are then chalked out which help tackle ailments, aesthetic needs and other lifestyle disorders like insomnia, stress, and obesity. Therapies such as Elakizhi (massage with bolus of leaves), Podikizhi (Massage with different medicinal powders), Njavarakizhi (massage with bolus made of a special type of rice, Njavara, indigenous to Kerala) have proven its efficacy over the period of time. Here's looking at a couple of other therapies that you can try on your next vacation: Kativasti: Kativasthi is an Ayurvedic lumbo-sacral rejuvenation therapy that uses hot oil or herbal decoctions. For the therapy, a dough is used to make a ring, which is glued over the spine. Lukewarm medicated oil or herbal decoction is slowly poured into this ring. This is followed by a gentle massage over the area. While its primary function is to lubricate the joints, it also helps get rid of rigidity, spasm of muscles, improves blood circulation, nourishes and strengthens the bones, connective tissues, ligaments and nerves. In addition to all this, Kadivasthi is known to tackle intense back pain and spinal disorders too. Udwarthanam: Udwarthanam is special therapeutic deep tissue massage using herbal powders using upward strokes. The therapy uses a powder that's warmed by heating. The massage is done in the opposite direction to hair follicles by two therapists. The unique part: the procedure is performed in seven postures, which also aids stretching of muscles. This procedure is famed to aid weight loss, detoxification, purification and improving tone of the skin. Swedana: Swedana is a favourite amongst those suffering from chronic cold, allergies and sinusitis. It is a steam therapy, which helps inducing sweat with the help of a medicated herbal decoction. This helps dilate channels of the body to detach the toxins from the tissues. Ayurvedic fomentation is usually given after an oil massage. The therapy also helps ease digestion and arthritis issues. A STEP TOWARDS NIRVANA Meditation is perfect for those looking for head-clearing and soul-searching. If you are looking for a gadget free break in a silent zone, there are retreats dedicated to teaching the right technique. Retreats dedicated to the cause present you with the opportunity to not only learn but also deepen your meditation practice with the guidance and support of the professionals. From a three days program to a three-month long seasonal retreat, the technique aims to help you turn inwards through silence and contemplation practices. Meditation has been long associated with sitting in one corner but it has evolved to focus on various aspects. Take your pick from walking meditation, breath meditation and body scan meditation, with each program aiming at address more specific issues.
