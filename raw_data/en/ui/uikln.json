Did you know that, in our dreadful modern times, the weakening of our human I 'means the protective, self-regulating systems that help our immune system distinguish between self and not-self are being weakened from many directions: devitalized foods and soil, heavy metals toxicity, overuse of pharmaceuticals like antibiotics, chemicals, vaccinations, family emotional dysfunctions, and early over-intellectual education'? Robert Zieve, anthroposophical M.D., [writes this](http://www.anthromed.org/Article.aspx?artpk=328). In earlier times (at one point humans and Lyme disease bacteria actually even co-existed harmoniously, we were not adversaries), our immune systems fought against illnesses, but now it, too, together with our I, is weakened which leads to diseases such as chronic Lyme disease (in mainstream medicine a contested diagnosis, I think, by the way) 'because of an inner premature hardening of soul/spiritual life manifested as an inner tissue rigidity in our biochemistry and physiology, induced by combinations of the above contributing factors.' (He means the factors mentioned in my previous quote.) Treatments that are recommended include: nutrition, herbs, 'injectable bee venom', acupuncture, homeopathy, colour therapy, eurythmy... among other therapies (all equally pointless as far as the infection is concerned, on the physical level). Antibiotics can harm in these so-called chronic cases, although it is useful in acute cases, he concedes. And of course there are emotional and spiritual issues as well, not to be forgotten: '... the deeper emotional issues call to be addressed and healed, such as with family constellation work. Stress on more subtle emotional and spiritual levels, if too strong to bear, will go down to the next vibratory level and manifest in physical biochemical and physiological dysfunctions and lead to symptoms.' We must make friends with the bacteria again, and realize that 'that healing is not merely personal but also social and cultural.' I assume should we take precaution against the hazards Zieve mentions. Over-intellectual education might, after all, cause all kinds of harms. [Here's an event](http://www.anthroposophy.org/calendar/event-details/article/whats-happening-in-anthroposophic-medicine-694.html) I regret having to inform you that you have already missed: 'Dr. Basil Williams is board certified in Anthroposophic Medicine, Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease and Osteopathic Medicine. For the past four years he has given workshops at the Medical conferences in Dornach, Switzerland on topics ranging from Lyme disease in the Light of Anthroposophy to working with Elemental beings and healing substances. He is currently researching Autistic Spectrum Disorder.'
