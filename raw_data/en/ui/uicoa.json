The term Ayurveda consists of two Sanskrit words, \" Ayu\" - which means life or longevity and \"Veda\" which means deep knowledge or wisdom. So Ayurveda means \"to know about life\". Ayurveda originated in India more than 5000 years ago and is one of the oldest systems of medicine. Ayurveda basically focuses on both prevention and cure of the condition by balancing the three body doshas or systems which are the Vata dosha, the Kapha dosha and the Pitta dosha. By balancing all these three doshas or system, our body improves on both physical, mental and spiritual health which improves the overall quality of life. Here are 5 common health conditions that can be managed by Ayurveda: 1. Digestive disorders Thanks to our erratic lifestyle, most of us experience one or the other digestive issues such as indigestion, heartburn, flatulence, acid reflux or constipation. Ayurveda attributes these problems to the accumulation of toxic substances in the body, which is known as \"ama\". This happens due to untimely food habits, eating wrong foods or a weak digestive system. In Ayurveda, Pitta is essentially responsible for the gastrointestinal tract and keeps a check on the activity of acids and enzymes acting on the food to digest it. Any imbalances in pitta dosha lead to digestive problems. Dietary changes according to Ayurveda and some [herbal formulations for digestive disorders ](https://www.1mg.com/categories/ayurveda/top-brands/baidyanath-279?filter=true&uses=Stomach%20Care)may help you have a healthy gut. 2. Respiratory disorders As you all know, there has been a rise in respiratory problems since last few years because of increased air pollution, low immunity levels due to poor dietary habits, unhealthy lifestyle choices such as smoking and increased stress levels. Respiratory problems range from simple breathlessness, congestion, cold and cough to respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, asthma or emphysema. According to Ayurveda, most of the disorders of the respiratory system are due to an imbalance in the Kapha Dosha.

Ayurvedic medicine has been also known to build up the immunity levels in an individual. 3. Stress and anxiety Our nervous system is mainly governed by Vata Dosha. Anxiety, stress is the foremost indication of Vata imbalance in a person. Researchers have shown that herbs used in Ayurvedic medicine aim in restoring the balance of Vata dosha and create a positive effect on the overall mental functioning by soothing and calming the mind, body and soul. 4. Skin problems Ayurvedic combinations have been touted as the best form of natural treatments for healthy skin be it for external application or internal body cleansing. Ayurvedic medicine works on treating the type of doshas which cause skin problems. For example, Vata dosha person would have thin, dry, delicate and wrinkle-prone skin, while Pitta dosha person's skin would be more prone to skin rashes or breakouts, and people with imbalanced Kapha dosha have thick and oily skin, which is more prone to acne, blackheads and eczema. For healthy skin, it is important to create harmony in your imbalanced dosha.
