Ensure that hand hygiene is being performed before vaccine preparation, between patients, and any time hands become soiled. If gloves are worn, they should be changed, and hand hygiene should be performed between patients; 8. Ensure that vaccinators are following manufacturer instructions and federal vaccine administration guidance related to dose, site, and route. Resources can be found at these sites: a. Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases; and b. CDC Vaccine Administration Resource Library; 9. Ensure that each vaccination is being documented and that clients are receiving documentation fo r their personal records, including information about scheduling a second vaccination appointment, if needed; 10. Ensure that the client is given a re cord of the vaccines clients are observed after vaccination: a. Walk-through clinics: Patients should be observed in a waiting area for 15 minutes after vaccination for sy ncope (fainting) or other adverse events. b. Curbside or drive-through clinics: Drivers should be directed to a waiting area for 15 minutes and checked before they leave. This is critical at a drive-through immunization clinic because of the potential for injury when the vaccinated person is driving a car. E. Shutting Down the Clinic/Event Properly cleaning the vaccination Event space following the Event allows our community and facility partners to kn ow how much we value our partnership with them. Contractor must ensure that/to: 1. Any remaining viable vaccine is appropriately stored and handled to protect the cold chain; 2.

Under the PIA, certain information is protecte d from public release. If Applicant asserts that information provided in its Application is exempt from disclosure under the PIA, Applicant must: Mark the original Application, on the top of the front page, the words \"CONTAINS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\" in large, bold, capitalized letters (the size of, or equivalent to, 12-point Times New Roman font or larger); and (2) Identify, adjacent to each portion of the Application that Applicant claims is exempt from public disclosure, the claimed exemption from disclosure (NOTE: no redactions are to be made in the original Application); b.
