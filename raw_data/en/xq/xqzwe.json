The beauty industry has never seen such heights of success as now, and the pace at which it's growing is shocking. This trillion-dollar industry has evolved multiple times, and certain banners have turned their brands into monoliths in the market. So much so that people buy these conventional cosmetics without thinking twice, or questioning the [toxic ingredients](https://pravi.ca/en/12-ingredients-to-avoid-in-your-cosmetics/) used in their products and their impact on human health. Additionally, upwards of 500,000 animals are estimated to die each year due to cosmetic testing ( [source](https://www.hsi.org/issues/be-cruelty-free/)). Unbeknownst to many consumers of personal care products, many popular brands test on animals and then market products that are still harmful to humans. In this article, we compare and contrast natural cosmetics with traditional cosmetics. What is a natural cosmetic? Natural cosmetics have the same hygienic and beautifying function as conventional chemical industry cosmetics, but manufacturers do not use synthetic chemical ingredients. Instead, they use natural chemical ingredients. Natural cosmetics have recently taken a good share of the beauty industry for several reasons. As cosmetic products are basically intended to be put in contact with the skin or any other part of the human body, some users (especially those suffering from allergies to certain ingredients) wish to avoid using cosmetics that could be harmful to their health. That is why they choose [organic cosmetics](https://pravi.ca/en/categorie-produit/best-sellers/). In addition, the growing awareness of environmental issues is contributing to the growth of the natural cosmetics markets.

These products are often [vegan cosmetics](https://pravi.ca/en/categorie-produit/best-sellers/) since the manufacturers adhere to a [holistic philosophy](https://pravi.ca/en/beauty-routine/). If you want to buy organic cosmetics, make sure to find an [organic certification](https://www.quebecvrai.org/) that supports the claim of the product and be careful with greenwashing! Here are some examples of natural ingredients used in cosmetics: Aloe vera Aloe vera is probably the most famous plant when it comes to skincare products. This phenomenal plant naturally contains vitamins B1, B2, B6, C, choline, niacinamide, glycoprotein, enzymes, phenolic compounds, a variety of amino acids, phytochemicals, and salicylic acids. All these naturally occurring vitamins and minerals are the reason why aloe vera has incomparable healing properties. Acetic acid Acetic acid is also widely known as apple cider vinegar. It is famous for its acne-treating properties. It occurs naturally, and it has been used as a manufacturing product of multiple cosmetic products in the beauty industry. Avocado oil Avocado oil is obtained from the extraction of the fruit, and it is rich in vitamins and minerals. It contains vitamins A, B1, B2, B12, D, E, lipids, polyhydroxylated fatty alcohols, and beta carotene. These useful vitamins help with psoriasis treatments and the manufacture of sunblock and organic makeup products. Coconut oil Coconut oil is also one of the well-known natural ingredients in the beauty industry. It consists of triglycerides, phenols, tannins, flavonoids, steroids, alkaloids, and triterpenes. These all compounds cumulatively help treat eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis, cuts, etc. Coconut oil also helps for moisturizing and lubricating purposes. Certified vs. uncertified natural cosmetics Certified natural cosmetics are only as good as the integrity of the organization that provides their seal of approval. Given the popularity of the natural cosmetics industry and the fact that the term \"natural cosmetics\" isn't legally protected, there is a lot of false marketing in the beauty industry. You might have seen \"contains natural ingredients\" on the packaging, but what does that really mean? It's impossible to know to what degree it contains natural ingredients. For instance, some conventional cosmetic products might contain the minimum amount of biological substances to get some form of organic certification, while the rest of their ingredients are synthetic. This type of malpractice is rampant in the cosmetic industry and it lets all the big franchises pose as eco-friendly companies while it is far from being the case. Another misconception regarding natural cosmetics is that they shouldn't have any synthetic ingredients! Natural cosmetics often contain a small number of synthetic ingredients to improve their shelf life, to replace a natural ingredient found in animals, or the color of the cosmetic product. If it were not for preservatives, bacteria and other microorganisms would contaminate our products. Natural cosmetics often opt for mild preservative agents that are found in the food industry, such as benzoic acid. This acid can be found in nature but is it also synthetically manufactured in laboratories for the cosmetic industry. The accepted concentration of synthetic ingredients varies depending on the certification provider. "}
