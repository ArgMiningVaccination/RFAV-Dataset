However, certain sensitive services are covered when obtained from a qualified Medi-Cal Provider in California, even when the provider is outside your Home Region. For more information on covered Sensitive Care services, please go to the \"Sensitive Care\" section in Chapter 3 of this Member Handbook.

When you temporarily move away from home to be a student outside your Home Region, there are two options available to you. You may do either of the following: Notify your home county Medi-Cal eligibility office that you are temporarily moving to be a student and provide your address in the new county. The county will update the case records with your new address and county code in the State's database. Use this option if you want to get Routine Care, including preventive care, in your new county. You may have to change your Medi-Cal managed care plan. For questions and to prevent a delay in the new health plan enrollment, you should contact Health Care Options at 1-800-430-4263 (TTY 1-800-430-7077) for assistance with enrollment.

How to get care Getting health care services PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SO YOU WILL KNOW FROM WHOM OR WHAT GROUP OF PROVIDERS HEALTH CARE MAY BE OBTAINED. The coverage information in this Member Handbook applies when you get health care services in your Home Region. Your Home Region is the Kaiser Permanente Region where you live. Your Home Region is Northern California and is identified on the cover of this Member Handbook and on your Kaiser Permanente ID Card. If you visit the Southern California Region, you are covered for Emergency Care, Urgent Care, and some Sensitive Care Services. For more information on coverage for these services, go to those headings in this chapter. If you visit another Kaiser Permanente Region outside of California, you are covered only for Emergency Care or Urgent Care, unless we pre- approve the services for you. For more information on how to find Network Providers in your Home Region, go to our provider listings on kp.org/finddoctors or call our Member Service Contact Center at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711). You can begin to get health care services on your effective date of enrollment. Always carry your Kaiser Permanente ID card, Medi-Cal Benefits Identification Card (\"BIC\"), and any other health insurance cards you have with you. Never let anyone else use your BIC or Kaiser Permanente ID card. We provide services to our Members through our Network Providers. They work together to provide you with quality care.

This is called an Out-of-Network Referral. You do not need approval to go to an Out-of-Network Provider to get Sensitive Care, which is described under the heading \"Sensitive Care\" later in this chapter.

Each covered family member may choose their own personal doctor. Depending on the type of the provider, you may be able to choose one PCP for your entire family who are Members of Kaiser Permanente. If you are in both Medicare and Medi-Cal, or if you have comprehensive other health care insurance, you do not have to choose a PCP. You can also choose to get your primary health care at a Federally Qualified Health Center (\"FQHC\"), an Indian Health Care Provider (\"IHCP\"), or a Rural Health Clinic (\"RHC\") in our network. Depending on the type of provider, you may be able to choose one PCP for your entire family, as long as the PCP is available. Note: American Indians may choose an IHCP as their PCP, even if the IHCP is not in our provider network. If you do not choose a PCP within 30 days of assignment, we will assign you to a PCP. You can change to another available Kaiser Permanente doctor at any time, for any reason. You can change your doctor online anytime at kp.org or you can call our Member Service Contact Center at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711).

Visit online at kp.org Page 21 Choice of doctors and other providers You know your health care needs best, so it is best if you choose your PCP. It is best to stay with one PCP so they can get to know your health care needs. However, if you want to change to a new PCP, you can change anytime. You must choose a PCP who is in the Kaiser Permanente provider network and is taking new patients. To learn how to select or change your PCP, call our Member Service Contact Center at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711). We may change your PCP if the PCP is not taking new patients, has left our network, does not give care to patients your age, or if there are quality concerns with the PCP pending resolution. We may also ask Alameda Alliance for Health to reassign you to a different provider network if you cannot get along with or agree with your PCP, or if you miss or are late to appointments. If Alameda Alliance for Health reassigns you to a different provider network, they will tell you in writing. Some things to think about when picking a PCP: Does the PCP take care of children? Does the PCP work at a Plan Facility I like to use? Is the PCP's office close to my home, work or children's school? Does the doctor speak my language? Do the PCP's office hours fit my schedule? Initial Health Assessment (\"IHA\") We recommend that, as a new Member, you visit your new PCP within the first 120 days for an initial health assessment (\"IHA\"). The purpose of the IHA is to help your PCP learn your health care history and needs. Your PCP may ask you some questions about your health history or may ask you to complete a questionnaire. Your PCP will also tell you about health education counseling and classes that may help you. Take your BIC, your Alameda Alliance for Health ID Card, your Kaiser Permanente ID card, and your photo ID to your appointment. It is a good idea to take a list of your medications and questions with you to your visit. Be ready to talk with your PCP about your health care needs and concerns. Be sure to call your PCP's office if you are going to be late or cannot go to your appointment. 3 | How to get care Call KP Member Service Contact Center at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711).

Kaiser Permanente is your health care provider network through Alameda Alliance for Health. When you choose Kaiser Permanente, you are choosing to get your care through our medical care program. You must get most services from our Network Providers. You can go to an Out-of-Network Provider without a referral or pre-approval for Emergency Care or for family planning services. You can also go to an Out-of-Network Provider for out-of-area Urgent Care when you are in an area where we do not operate. You must have a referral or pre-approval for all other out-of-network services, or they will not be covered. Note: American Indians may choose an Indian Health Care Provider (\"IHCP\") as their PCP, even if the IHCP is not a Network Provider. If your PCP, hospital or other provider has a moral objection to providing you with a covered service, such as family planning or abortion, they can help you find another Network Provider who will give you the services you need. You can also call our Member Service Contact Center at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711) to ask for help finding another Network Provider. For more about moral objections, read the \"Moral objection\" section later in this chapter.

Appeals An appeal is different from a complaint. An appeal is a request for Kaiser Permanente or Alameda Alliance for Health to review and change a decision we made about your service(s). If we sent you a Notice of Action (\"NOA\") letter telling you that we are denying, delaying, changing or ending a service, and you do not agree with our decision, you can file an appeal. Your PCP or other provider can also file an appeal for you with your written permission. You must file an appeal within 60 calendar days from the date on the NOA you got from us. If we decided to reduce, suspend, or stop a service(s) you are getting now, you can continue getting that service(s) while you wait for your appeal to be decided. This is called Aid Paid Pending. To receive Aid Paid Pending, you must ask us for an appeal within 10 days from the date on the NOA or before the date we said your service(s) will stop, whichever is later. When you request an appeal under these circumstances, the service(s) will continue. We may require you to pay for the cost of services if the final decision denies or changes a service. 6 | Reporting and solving problems Call KP Member Service Contact Center at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711).

Complaints and Independent Medical Reviews (\"IMR\") with the Department of Managed Health Care An IMR is when an outside doctor who is not related to the health plan reviews your case.

We have to comply with DMHC's IMR and review decisions. Here is how to ask for an IMR. The California Department of Managed Health Care is responsible for regulating health care service plans. If you have a grievance against your health plan, you should first telephone your health plan at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711) and use your health plan's grievance process before contacting the department. Utilizing this grievance procedure does not prohibit any potential legal rights or remedies that may be available to you. If you need help with a grievance involving an emergency, a grievance that has not been satisfactorily resolved by your health plan, or a grievance that has remained unresolved for more than 30 days, you may call the department for assistance. You may also be eligible for an Independent Medical Review (\"IMR\"). If you are eligible for IMR, the IMR process will provide an impartial review of medical decisions made by a health plan related to the medical necessity of a proposed service or treatment, coverage decisions for treatments that are experimental or investigational in nature and payment disputes for emergency or urgent medical services.

State Hearings A State Hearing is a meeting with people from the California Department of Social Services (\"CDSS\"). A judge will help to resolve your problem or tell you that we made the correct decision. You have the right to ask for a State Hearing only if you have already filed an appeal with either Kaiser Permanente or Alameda Alliance for Health and you are still not happy with the decision, or if you did not get a decision on your appeal after 30 days. You must ask for a State Hearing within 120 calendar days from the date on our NAR letter. However, if we gave you Aid Paid Pending during your appeal, and you want it to continue until there is a decision on your State Hearing, you must ask for a State Hearing within 10 days of our Notice of Appeal Rights (\"NAR\") letter, or before the date we said your service(s) will stop, whichever is later.

Binding Arbitration Binding arbitration is a way to solve problems using a neutral third party. This third party hears both sides of the issue and makes a decision that both sides must accept. Both sides give up the right to a jury or court trial. Scope of Arbitration You must use binding arbitration if the claim is related to this Member Handbook or your membership with us, if all of the following requirements are met: The claim is for: Malpractice (a claim that medical services or items were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly, negligently, or incompetently rendered); or Delivery of services or items; or Premises liability The claim is brought by: You against us; or Us against you Governing law does not prevent the use of binding arbitration to resolve the claim The claim cannot be settled through Small Claims Court Keep in mind: You do not have to use binding arbitration for claims that can be settled through a State Hearing You cannot use binding arbitration if you have gotten a decision on the claim through a State Hearing 6 | Reporting and solving problems Call KP Member Service Contact Center at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711).

Visit online at kp.org Page 112 You can get a copy of the Fee Waiver Form from our Member Service Contact Center at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711). Number of Arbitrators Some cases are heard by one arbitrator that both sides agree on (a neutral arbitrator). In other cases, there may be more than one arbitrator. The number of arbitrators may affect whether we pay the cost of the neutral arbitrator. Cases that request up to $200,000 in damages go before one arbitrator. The arbitrator must stay neutral. Both sides can agree to have three arbitrators decide the case. The agreement for more than one arbitrator must be made after the Demand for Arbitration has been filed. When there are three arbitrators, one represents each side and the third is neutral. The arbitrator(s) cannot award more than $200,000. Cases that request more than $200,000 in damages go before three arbitrators. When there are three arbitrators, there is one for each side in the dispute and a third neutral arbitrator. Either side can waive their right to have an arbitrator represent them. Both sides in a dispute can agree to have the case heard by a single neutral arbitrator. The agreement for a single neutral arbitrator must be made after the Demand for Arbitration has been filed. Arbitrators' Fees and Expenses We will pay the fees of the neutral arbitrator in some cases. To find out when we will pay the fees, look in the Rules of Procedure. You can get a copy of the Rules of Procedure from our Member Service Contact Center at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711). In all other cases, this cost is shared equally by both parties. If the parties select party arbitrators, each party pays the fees of their party arbitrator. Costs Except as set forth above and as allowed by law, each party must pay their own costs of the binding arbitration, no matter the outcome, such as lawyers' fees, witness fees, and other costs. General Provisions You cannot ask for binding arbitration if the claim would not meet the statute of limitations for that claim in a civil action. Your claim will be dismissed if either of the following occurs: You have not acted on it with reasonable diligence in accord with the Rules of Procedure 6 | Reporting and solving problems Call KP Member Service Contact Center at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711).

OUR NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES, WHICH PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES AND YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PHI, IS AVAILABLE AND WILL BE FURNISHED TO YOU UPON REQUEST. To get a copy, call our Member Service Contact Center at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711). You can also find the notice at a Kaiser Permanente facility or by going online at kp.org . Notice about laws Many laws apply to this Member Handbook. These laws may affect your rights and responsibilities even if the laws are not included or explained in this Member Handbook. The main laws that apply to this Member Handbook are state and federal laws about the Medi-Cal program. Other federal and state laws may apply too. Notice about Medi-Cal as a payer of last resort, other health coverage, and tort recovery Sometimes someone else has to pay first for the services Kaiser Permanente provided or arranged for you. For example, if you are in a car accident or if you are injured at work, insurance or Workers Compensation has to pay first. The California Department of Health Care Services has the right and responsibility to collect for covered Medi-Cal services for which Medi-Cal is not the first payer. The Medi-Cal program complies with state and federal laws and regulations relating to the legal liability of third parties for health care services to beneficiaries. Kaiser Permanente will take all reasonable measures to ensure that the Medi-Cal program is the payer of last resort. Medi-Cal members may also have other health coverage (\"OHC\"), also referred to as private health insurance. As a condition of Medi-Cal eligibility, you must apply for and/or retain any available OHC when there is no cost to you. Federal and state laws require Medi-Cal members to report OHC and any changes to an existing OHC. If you do not report OHC promptly, you may have to repay DHCS for any benefits paid erroneously. Submit your OHC online at http://dhcs.ca.gov/OHC . You can also call Alameda Alliance for Health at 510-747-4567 (TTY 711 or 1-800-735-2929). Or call DHCS at 1-800-541-5555 (TTY 1-800-430-7077 or 711). Outside of California, call 1-7 | Rights and responsibilities Call KP Member Service Contact Center at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711).

If you do not report changes to your OHC promptly, and because of this, get Medi-Cal benefits that you are not eligible for, you may have to repay DHCS. For example, if you are injured in a car accident or at work, auto or workers' compensation insurance may have to pay first, or reimburse Medi-Cal. If you are injured, and another party is liable for your injury, you or your legal representative must notify DHCS within 30 days of filing a legal action or a claim. Submit your notification online: P ersonal Injury Program at http://dhcs.ca.gov/PI Workers Compensation Recovery Program at http://dhcs.ca.gov/WC To learn more, call 1-916-445-9891. If you are eligible for Medicare, you must let us know. The Medicare program may have to pay for certain services that you get from us. Medi-Cal always pays last. Notice about estate recovery The Medi-Cal program must seek repayment from estates of certain deceased members for Medi-Cal benefits received on or after their 55th birthday. Repayment includes fee-for- service and managed care premiums and capitation payments for nursing facility services, home and community-based services, and related hospital and prescription drug services received when the member was inpatient in a nursing facility or was receiving home and community-based services. Repayment cannot exceed the value of a member's probated estate. To learn more, go to the DHCS estate recovery website at http://dhcs.ca.gov/er or call (916) 650-0590. Notice of Action Kaiser Permanente will send you a Notice of Action (NOA) letter any time we deny, delay, terminate or modify a request for health care services. If you disagree with our decision, you can always file an appeal. Go to the Appeals section in Chapter 6 for important information on filing your Appeal. When we send you an NOA, it will inform you of all rights you have if you disagree with a decision we made. 7 | Rights and responsibilities Call KP Member Service Contact Center at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711).
