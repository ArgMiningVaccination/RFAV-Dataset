The ACIP [now recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7113a1.htm) that all adults aged 19-59 years and adults aged 60 and older with risk factors receive hepatitis B vaccines. Ensure these groups are up to date on hepatitis B vaccination: - Infants - Children aged <19 - Adults aged 19-59 - Adults aged 60 and older with risk factors for hepatitis B - Risk factors include sexual exposures, people at risk by percutaneous or mucosal exposure, and others. A complete list can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/hbvfaq.htm). Adults aged 60 and older without known risk factors may also be vaccinated. Why hepatitis B and why now? In 2019, the United States [saw a rise](https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2019surveillance/Introduction.htm) in acute hepatitis B cases. Opioid use, which remains a growing public health concern in Philadelphia, [has contributed](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2022/0800/graham-center-hepatitis-b-vaccination.html) to this increase in cases nationally. To counter the rising incidence of acute hepatitis B in the U.S., ACIP expanded its recommendations for hepatitis B vaccination in November 2021. However, a [national survey](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2022/0800/graham-center-hepatitis-b-vaccination.html#afp20220800p132-b6) conducted in February 2022 revealed that 55% of family physicians were unaware of the updated hepatitis B vaccine recommendations, and only 8% had fully implemented the new recommendations. In Philadelphia, we have seen a small rise in the numbers of adults receiving hepatitis B vaccination following the new recommendations. However, the urge to vaccinate Philadelphians remains high. Pennsylvania has the [fourth highest](https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2020surveillance/hepatitis-b/table-2.5.htm) number of newly reported chronic HBV cases in the nation and Philadelphia [accounts for most](https://nurseledcare.phmc.org/images/pdf/hepatitis/HBV_in_Philly__HBF_PDPH_Oct_10_2020.pdf) of these cases. [Syringe exchange programs](https://ppponline.org/node/152/syringe-services-program) help decrease risky injection among drug users in Philadelphia, yet [obstacles to safe injection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091743520300943) persist. Healthcare professionals can continue to decrease morbidity by promoting hepatitis B vaccination. A vaccine recommendation from patients' provider is the strongest predictor of whether patients get vaccinated. Strategies for increasing hepatitis B vaccination rates: - Do not assume that hepatitis B vaccination has been completed. [ACIP guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/special-situations.html)state that only written documentation should be accepted as evidence of previous vaccination. - Use Philadelphia's immunization information system (IIS) to verify whether patients have received hepatitis B vaccination. Providers can register with PhilaVax IIS by completing [this form.](https://forms.monday.com/forms/98f4653d2495f9a017b34bed9bd70efe?r=use1) - A PhilaVax login enables providers to use the 'Patient Search' module to quickly search for a patient and access prior vaccinations received in the city of Philadelphia or surrounding jurisdictions. PhilaVax also hosts a vaccine recommender tool which highlights patients' overdue vaccinations. - Use every opportunity to offer hepatitis B vaccine to unvaccinated patients, even sick visits. If you don't stock hepatitis B vaccine, refer patients to another local hospital, health center, [pharmacy](https://www.hepcap.org/community-tools/pharmacy-vaccine-maps/), or organization that can vaccinate. - Patients who are uninsured or underinsured can visit a local [Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)](http://phila.gov/media/20220412101002/FQHC_4-11-22.pdf), Vaccines for Children (VFC) provider, or Vaccines for Adults at Risk (VFAAR) provider to receive vaccine at no or low cost. - Patients who are uninsured or underinsured can visit a local [Document](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/adults/for-practice/standards/documentation.html)hepatitis B immunizations and maintain updated records. [Participate](https://forms.monday.com/forms/98f4653d2495f9a017b34bed9bd70efe?r=use1)in Philadelphia's immunization information system (IIS) to report immunizations given. - "}
