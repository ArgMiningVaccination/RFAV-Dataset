The medication has since been [approved by the FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-drug-treatment-chronic-weight-management-first-2014) for people without diabetes looking to manage weight. Clinical trials, cited in the [New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183), show that out of 2,000 participants who did weekly semaglutide injections, most lost at least 10% of their body weight, and more than half lost 15% of their body weight. Additionally, participants taking semaglutide experienced improvements in blood pressure, blood sugar, and overall heart disease risk. Ideal candidates include people with type 2 diabetes or at least one weight-related condition. Semaglutide Side Effects As with any medication, some potential side effects can be expected.
