According to Ayurveda , Medicine can be taught only from most authentic basic and applied science oriented three textbooks of Ayurveda namely Charaka Samhita, Ashtanga sangraha and Susruta Samhita Nature of clinical trials Clinical trials in Modern Medicine are based on evaluation of unknown compounds and is eternally unpredictable trial and error . Clinical trials in Ayurveda are recommended to be based on evaluation of logics of Science Based Medicine which end up in valid conclusions Lay audience perspective Laymen are yearning for information which they can understand . They seek information in simplest language that fit their level of knowledge and anxiety to abolish their misconceptions and fears . Modern Medicine currently adopts tactful ways with technical jargons to tame the common sense of laymen in accordance to its beliefs and observations based on incomplete and reductionist research in man. For example if they have nothing to do in autoimmune disease other than immune suppression, they tell public that immune suppression is the best scientific mode of treating autoimmune disease and avoiding it will cause death. Ayurveda has innate measures to stimulate cellular metabolism, neutralise toxins , rectify immune alteration etc but as laymen live in a shelter built by Modern Medicine and owing to the professional incompetence of Ayurveda community,, the value and merits of Ayurveda as it is- is mostly unknown to laymen Reversal of disease Reversal of disease is either absence of signs and symptoms or normal lab values in Modern Medicine. Reversal of disease is but only emergence of signs and symptoms of health in Ayurveda . Role of Science The objective of Science of Modern Medicine is performing empirical trial and error with unknown compounds and generating , collecting, classifying and analysing temporary benefit risks of the same. The objective of Science of Ayurveda is providing most important sources of channels of knowledge to understand and solve the underlying mechanisms different kinds of pathologies in human being Biostatistics is of central importance in practice of Modern Medicine Basic and Applied Science of Ayurveda is of central importance in practice of Ayurved a Difference in literature and mode of application The literature of western medicine comprises of algorithms for arriving at name of a disease based on signs and symptoms while treatment strategies are focused on mainly masking, blocking, suppressing or altering enzymes, ion channels or chemicals or hormones. The scientific literature of Ayurvedic Medicine rather focus on understanding the subtle most and intertangled cause mechanisms of aetiopathogenesis of entire morbid state and stage of patient, diagnostic and therapeutic planning, educating and involving patient and his care providers at home in his recovery process Mode of reversal of disease Mode of initiation of pathology of same disease might vary from subject to subject. Often sustained dehydration of tissues might result in heart attack or stroke. Often sustained indigestion or infection or inflammation in some part of the body might result in the same. For Modern Medicine exploring these are no way relevant and they focus solely on values of cholesterol or triglycerides and prescribe suppressants for BP or cholesterol and claim to prevent the disease. Ayurvedic science has knowledge based algorithms to deeply probe into the intertangled cause mechanisms and their predictable effects and hence recommends explore the patient in specific based on his own unique cause mechanisms to protect and save him. To conclude Modern Medicine is 100 percent Medicine based Science Ayurveda is 100 percent Science Based Medicine Modern Medicine lacks thevery fundamental knowledge of Science of man Ayurveda explains the fundamental knowledge of Science of man with tools and methodologies to explore any old or new pathology in human being , named or unnamed. The functions in man are primarily simple and secondarily complicated unlike a machine and hence Science of man has great role in Medicine for man "}
