In recent years there have been many policy changes related to TB testing, including a shift away from mass screening. Current recommendations focus on assigning risk, i.e., testing only those children found to have risk factors for tuberculosis. \"Targeted testing\" for tuberculosis places priority on these high risk groups by selecting those at the greatest risk for infection as well as those at risk for developing TB disease if infected (American Thoracic Society [ATS] & Centers for Disease Control & Prevention [CDC], 2000). This handbook is divided into three sections: TB Fundamentals with a particular focus on school-aged children. Applying TB Fundamentals in the School Setting which covers issues related to medication administration, treatment adherence and directly observed therapy (DOT) in the school setting. Appendices that include risk assessment guidelines, medication side effects and templates for record keeping.5PART ONE TB Fundamentals 6TRANSMISSION & PATHOGENESIS TB is an airborne infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). Minute particles called droplet nuclei are expelled into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or respiratory tract coughs, sneezes, laughs or sings. Transmission of M. tuberculosis can occur because these particles remain suspended inthe air and may be inhaled by other individuals. Although TB diseasecan progress directly from the initial infection, in most cases the host'simmune system contains this infection. The bacilli are walled off fromthe rest of the body and exist in an isolated form and may remainviable for years. This is referred to as TB infection and is sometimes alsocalled latent TB infection (LTBI). Persons with TB infection have no signs,symptoms or radiographic evidence of TB disease and are unable totransmit the bacteria. Since we know that TB infection is the precursor to TB disease, early diagnosis of children infected with M. tuberculosis is a critical step in preventing morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. However, appropriate treatment of TB infection in these children is equally important and should include development of a plan to ensure treatment completion. CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF TB INFECTION AND TB DISEASE It is important to understand both the differences between TB infection and TB disease and the differences in their presentation in adults and young children. As noted in the table below, individuals with TB infection are not sick and are not infectious. Latent TB Infection Pulmonary TB Disease Inactive tubercle bacilli in the body Active tubercle bacilli in the body Results of tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) are usually positiveResults of TST or IGRA are usually positive Findings on chest radiograph are generally normalFindings on chest radiograph are generally abnormal If sputum is collected, smear and culture results are negativeResults of sputum smear and culture positive Lack of symptoms Symptoms such as cough, fever and weight loss Not infectious Often infectious before treatment Adapted from the CDC, Self-Study Modules on Tuberculosis, 2008. 7Further, young children (birth to puberty) manifest TB disease differently than adults. Young children with TB: Are often asymptomatic Have fewer tubercle bacilli in their lungs Lack the force to produce airborne bacilli while coughing Are rarely infectious When symptoms do occur in young children, they may present as fever, cough and weight loss or failure to gain weight. Although TB disease is most commonly found in the lungs, it can affect other parts of the body as well (i.e., extrapulmonary TB) (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 2015). Because young children with TB disease may not have symptoms, in some instances they are discovered and diagnosed during a contact investigation around an infectious case of TB in an adult or adolescent. Contact investigation is a systematic process used to identify persons (contacts) who were exposed to someone with infectious TB disease, assess them for infection with M. tuberculosis and TB disease and provide appropriate treatment, if necessary. Contact investigations are conducted by the jurisdictional health authority, generally the state or local health department. TB disease in adolescents manifests similarly to disease in adults. Adolescents are more likely to present with pulmonary disease, and unlike young children, can be infectious. TESTING FOR TUBERCULOSIS School-based TB testing programs generally utilize tuberculin skin tests. It is important that school nurses are properly trained in the technique; they should also be familiar with other methods of testing for TB infection. In addition to the Mantoux tuberculin skin test that uses puri ed protein derivative (PPD), there are blood tests called interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) . It is important to note that neither test can be considered the \"gold standard\" and a lack of reaction to the TST or a negative IGRA does not exclude TB infection or disease. Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) Delayed hypersensitivity test Uses the Mantoux method - intradermal injection of puri ed protein derivative (PPD) Response (reaction) to antigen contained in the testing material is measured in millimeters of induration (See Appendix B)8Interferon-gamma Release Assay (IGRA) Blood test Whole blood is mixed with TB antigens and analyzed in a laboratory Results based on amount of interferon-gamma released by white blood cells (QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold In-Tube) or relative number of speci cally sensitized cells (T-Spot. \u00aeTB test) Results reported as positive, negative or indeterminate or borderline and may also include numerical values Approved products include QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold In-Tube and T-SPOT\u00ae.TB IGRAs have been approved for use in adults in all circumstances where a TST would be used. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) notes that published data indicate IGRAs perform consistently well in children 5 years of age or older. Both the AAP and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend IGRAs as the preferred test in children 5 years of age or older who have received the BCG vaccine, although TST is also acceptable in this age group. CDC and AAP also agree that the TST is the preferred test for children less than 5 years of age, though the AAP notes that some data also support use of IGRAs in children as young as 3 years of age and indicates that they may be used in children 3 years of age or older. TARGETED TESTING IN CHILDREN Targeted testing nds children who are at risk for TB infection and therefore at risk for progressing to TB disease. Since children and adolescents with TB infection represent the future reservoir for cases of TB disease, it is important that they are diagnosed early and treated. Children without risk factors should not be tested . See Appendix C for additional information on screening children. Appendix D contains a sample record of testing for TB infection that can be used in a school setting. It should be noted that there are some instances where routine testing is required for attendance in school, day care or camp. This is to be discouraged because the yield of true positive results is low, and, therefore, is an ineffective use of health care resources (AAP , 2015).9The following is a summary of the AAP testing recommendations found in the Red Book: 2015 Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases. Children for whom immediate TST or IGRA is indicated: Contacts of persons with con rmed or suspected contagious tuberculosis (contact investigation) Children with radiographic or clinical ndings suggesting tuberculosis disease Children immigrating from countries with endemic infection (e.g., Asia, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and countries of the former Soviet Union*), including international adoptees Children with travel histories to countries with endemic infection and substantial contact with people who live in these countries** *Countries in Eastern Europe also have a high prevalence of TB **If the child is well and has no history of TB exposure, the TST or IGRA should be delayed for up to 10 weeks after return Children who should have annual TST: Children with HIV infection (TST only) Children at increased risk for progression from infection to disease: Certain medical conditions can increase the possibility of progression to TB disease and children in these categories merit special consideration . Information regarding potential exposure to tuberculosis should be elicited from parents of these children. If histories or local epidemiological factors suggest a possibility of exposure, immediate and periodic TB testing should be considered. Without recent TB exposure, these children are not at increased risk of acquiring TB infection. Medical conditions that increase the possibility of progression from TB infection to TB disease include: Diabetes mellitus Chronic renal failure Malnutrition Congenital or acquired immunode ciencies Use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-antagonists or other immunosuppressive therapy10In addition, a TST or IGRA should be performed before initiation of immunosuppressive therapy including prolonged systemic steroid administration, organ transplantation, use of TNF-alpha antagonists or blockers or other immunosuppressive therapy in any child being placed on these treatments . SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Immunizations Measles is a live-virus vaccine that can temporarily suppress tuberculin reactivity. Therefore, the TST should be administered before the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, simultaneously with the MMR vaccine or at least 4-6 weeks after the vaccine. The effect of other live virus vaccines on tuberculin reactivity is not known, though the same spacing recommendations apply. Although the effects of live-virus vaccines on IGRAs have not been determined experimentally, CDC recommends a similar approach. BCG vaccine History of vaccination with the bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is not a contraindication for testing for tuberculosis, provided such testing is part of a targeted testing program. BCG is not part of the vaccine schedule in the United States, but is used extensively throughout the world, especially in countries where TB is endemic for the speci c purpose of protecting infants from the serious complications of TB disease. However, it does not provide lifelong immunity, and in fact, its effectiveness wanes over time. Therefore, if a child is at risk for tuberculosis, a test for tuberculosis should be performed regardless of BCG vaccine history. A child with a positive TST result should be evaluated for TB disease and treated accordingly. The TST may have cross-reactivity (i.e. false positive results) in persons with a history of BCG. This does not occur with IGRAs. Therefore, IGRAs are recommended in children 5 years of age and older, and perhaps as young as 3 years of age, who have a history of BCG vaccination.11EVALUATION OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH POSITIVE TST OR IGRA RESULTS Any child with a positive test result for M. tuberculosis infection that is done as part of a school TB testing program should be referred for further evaluation. This evaluation includes a detailed health history, physical assessment and chest radiograph. By focusing on the presence of symptoms, the risk of progression to TB disease, coexisting medical conditions and radiographic evidence, the health care provider is able to con rm or exclude TB disease. Any child suspected of having TB disease, with questionable test results, or with unclear risk factors should be referred to a specialist. Your school district may have an agreement with the local health department, TB control program or hospital where this assessment can be performed. If the ndings of the chest radiograph are normal and TB disease has been ruled out, in most instances, treatment for TB infection is recommended; these children should not be excluded from school. For children who have TB disease, attendance at school should be determined by the treating physician in conjunction with the jurisdictional health authority, which is the local health department in most instances. If a child with a positive TST or IGRA result has been sent for evaluation and is awaiting results of the chest radiograph, a symptom assessment should be performed. A sample TB symptom assessment can be found in Appendix E. If the child does not have symptoms, they may attend school while awaiting x-ray results. The diagnostic criteria for TB infection include the following: Positive test for TB infection Absence of symptoms or physical ndings suggestive of TB disease Chest radiograph with no evidence of TB disease (ATS & CDC, 2000; Pediatric Tuberculosis Collaborative Group, 2004).12TREATMENT OF TB INFECTION AND TB DISEASE TREATMENT OF TB INFECTION Rationale for treating TB infection in children includes the following: (Pediatric Tuberculosis Collaborative Group, 2004): Young children who are infected with TB are at greater risk of progression from TB infection to TB disease since their immune systems are less able to control infection Infection is likely to have been recent in young children. Recently infected persons are at a greater risk for developing TB disease Children have more years of life expectancy to potentially develop TB disease Medications used to treat TB infection are well tolerated by children and there is a low risk of toxicity Medications used in the treatment of TB infection include isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), and rifapentine (RPT). The table below outlines the different regimens, the medications used and the duration of treatment. Treatment Regimens for LTBI* (AAP , 2015 and CDC, 2011) Regimen Duration Isoniazid Daily for 9 months ** Isoniazid and Rifapentine Once weekly for 12 weeks provided by Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) *** Rifampin Daily for 4 months**** *Table refl ects regimens recommended by both CDC and the AAP . An additional regimen, 3 months of daily INH and RIF is recommended by the AAP as a possible alternative regimen, but is not currently included in CDC recommendations. ** Preferred for treatment of TB infection in most children.*** The INH and RPT regimen, often referred to as the 12-dose regimen, may be used for otherwise healthy patients age 12 years or above. Current CDC and AAP guidelines indicate that this regimen should not be used routinely for children age 2-11 years but may be considered when the likelihood of completing another regimen is low. However, published data from the CDC PREVENT-TB trial indicates that the 12-dose regimen is safe, well tolerated and an effective alternative to IN H in children aged 2-17. This regimen is not recommended for children younger than 2 years of age, those with HIV/AIDS receiving antiretroviral therapy, pregnant patients or patients expecting to become pregnant while on treatment and patients who have TB infection with presumed INH or RIF resistance. ****Recommended by the AAP for pediatric contacts to cases of INH-resistant tuberculosis and when INH cannot be used.13Of note, children who have been treated with 2 months of daily isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol as part of standard regimen for treatment of drug-susceptible TB disease (but are later found to have TB infection only) are considered to be treated for TB infection. TREATMENT OF TB DISEASE Medications used in the treatment of TB disease include isoniazid (INH), rifampin , 2015) Regimen Pan-sensitive TB (Organisms sensitive to all drugs)For the rst 2 months Isoniazid Rifampin next 4 months Isoniazid Rifampin Multi-drug resistant TB (Organisms resistant to INH and RIF) Treated with drugs to which organisms are sensitive Any drug resistance should be managed by an expert USE OF PYRIDOXINE The use of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation is recommended for certain individuals receiving INH including children on meat and milk-de cient diets, exclusively breast-fed infants, children with nutritional de ciencies, children with symptomatic HIV infection and pregnant adolescents. The recommended daily dose is up to 1 mg/kg/ (maximum 25 mg) (Pediatric Tuberculosis Collaborative Group, 2004). ADVERSE REACTIONS TO TB MEDICATIONS In general, children tolerate TB medications well and adverse reactions are rare . It is important though to monitor for such reactions and consult with the child's health care provider if they occur, as they are reversible when detected early (See Appendix F). Medications should be stopped immediately if the child develops signi cant nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain or jaundice which can be early signs of hepatotoxicity. Parents should also be advised to seek advice from their child's health care provider if these symptoms occur.14Signs and Symptoms of Adverse Reactions to TB Medications* Medication Adverse Reaction Signs & Symptoms Comments Isoniazid (INH)Hepatitis/ Hepatotoxicity Peripheral neuropathy HypersensitivityDark urine Yellow skin or eyes Nausea, vomiting Numbness or tingling of ngers or toes RashStop medications immediately if child develops signi cant nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal discomfort, or jaundice Pyridoxine supplementation may be indicated If mild, antihistimines may control symptoms, if moderate to severe, stop medications Rifampin (RIF)Orange discoloration of bodily fl uids (common) Hepatitis/ Hepatotoxicity HypersensitivityOrange color of tears and urine Dark urine Yellow skin or eyes Nausea, vomiting Abdominal discomfort Flu-like symptoms (fever, muscle aches, headache) Dizziness Flu-like symptoms (fever, muscle aches, headache) RashExpected side effect Stains contact lenses Stop medications immediately if child develops signi cant nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal discomfort, or jaundice Treat symptoms if mild, stop medication if moderate or severe Other: RIF decreases the effec- tiveness of oral contraceptives.

While DOT is the standard of care for patients with TB disease, it can also improve adherence in children with TB infection. DOT is a priority for very young children, adolescents, immunocompromised children and those with evidence of non-adherence. DOT is also the standard of care for those on intermittent regimens for TB infection or TB disease. This includes the 12-dose regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine. The school setting is ideal for DOT because the child attends school ve days a week during the academic year. A school nurse can observe and document medication ingestion and assess the child for possible medication side effects on a regular basis. When the school nurse is asked to provide DOT for a child with TB infection or TB disease, the referring agency (i.e.health department) may visit the school and provide forms for documentation/permission such as medication order form, parental consent form and DOT log. Refer to Appendix G and Appendix H for examples of these forms. The referring agency may also provide the medication on a monthly basis as well as guidance and support in areas of patient education, adherence, medication administration and monitoring for medication side effects. Some guidelines for providing DOT in the school setting include: Use a parent/guardian consent form to obtain permission for medication administration in school Choose the time and place of medication administration to ensure privacy and protection of the child's identity Establish a protocol for managing missed doses due to illness or vacation Consider intermittent regimens. It is generally administered 2 to 3 times per week and should be given at the same time each day. The interval between doses should be 48 hours. The 12-dose regimen for TB infection is administered once weekly., 17 Use a DOT log to document medication administration. The log should include the following information: - Child's name, date of birth, address and home phone number - Name and phone number of child's health care provider - Name of prescribed TB medications and dosing schedule - Name and signature of person dispensing the medication, the date and time The school nurse and the child's health care provider or health department along with parents or guardians are partners in the health and recovery of the child with TB. Therefore, maintaining a good relationship and clear, ongoing communication is important. Problems or concerns about medication administration or the child's health should be communicated directly to the health care provider who is supervising the child's treatment and the child's parents or guardians. All communication should be documented. 18KEYS TO SUCCESSFUL TRE ATMEN T This sec tion identi es some potential challenges and barriers to successf ul treatment as well as sugge sted ap proaches to address these challeng es. Scho ol Absences and Vacations School absences and vacations may prevent a child from rece iving medica tions. Therefore, it is importa nt to e stablish a plan for these absences prior to initiation of DOT. The school of ce can provide information about a child's absence. However , it may be m ore ef cient to have the chil d's parent o r guardian agree to contact the school nurse di rectly regarding an absence. If a child who is being treated fo r TB disease is absent from school, the child's health car e provider o r health d epartment should be contacted so alternate a rrangemen ts for medica tion administration can be made . It is also helpful to review the school calendar as the p lan for DOT is being de signed and to share it with the health care pro vider o r health depar tment. Medication for vacations or planned absences should not be sent hom e with the ch ild for delivery to the parent or guar dian. Missed Di rectly Observed Therap y Appointments If a child does not report to the school nurse for me dications: Ch eck to see if the child is absent a nd follow the absentee procedure that has been insti tuted If t he chil d is present, discreetly locate the child, without compromisin g con dentialit y Avoid problems by choosing a convenient time for DOT, such as before school or at lunchtime Dif culty Taking Medi cations All TB m edications can be safely admin istered at the same t ime. If the child co mplains of upset stomach or n ausea after tak ing the med ication, offering a small snack may relieve the discomfort. Unfortunate ly, some children h ave trouble swallowing pills. Most TB med ications, with the exception of rifampin, can be crushed and p laced in food, mak ing swallo wing easier an d more palatable (Sta rke & Smith, 200 4). Rifampin capsules can be opened an d the contents dissolved in a small amou nt (<5 ml) of warm water.19If crushed pills are to be added to food, consult the health care provider or a pharmacist and consider the following strategies: For children unable to swallow tablets, tablets can be crushed and mixed with food to mask the bitter taste. Parents can provide food the child likes. Examples include: - Applesauce - Pudding - Ice cream - Yogurt Mix medication with the smallest amount of food possible, to ensure the child consumes all medication Once the medication is ingested, offer a spoonful of food without medication Vary the choices of foods periodically, so that the child does not develop an aversion to a certain food If possible, schedule medication administration when the child is likely to be hungry and less likely to refuse Do not add crushed medication to a full glass of water or other liquids, as the drug will sink to the bottom Incentives Incentives can help if a child is hesitant about taking medications or does not understand the consequences of non-adherence, (ATS & CDC, 2000). While schools may not have access to incentives, many clinics and health departments have effective incentive programs and are willing to share ideas and resources. In addition, positive feedback which boosts a child's morale and small tangible rewards, such as stickers or certi cates, can also improve adherence.20REFERENCES American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Infectious Diseases.

Physical Address: 2055 Mowry Rd. Suite 250, THREE Appendices 24APPENDIX A FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Q. Why do some children take vitamin B6 with their INH while others do not? A. Although not prescribed routinely, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is used to prevent peripheral neuropathy due to INH in children with poor nutrition. The child's health care provider will determine this need. Most children have no need for B6 supplementation. However, some health care providers prescribe vitamin B6 for all patients who take INH regardless of nutritional status. Q. We had a case of TB in our school, and one of the teachers insisted that he must know how he was exposed. Isn't it a teacher's right to know? A. No. You are a health care professional, and the infectious person is a patient. Standard provider and patient con dentiality must be maintained at all times. Q. A child to whom I give medications is frequently absent. What is my responsibility in making sure this child gets medications? A. Alternative plans for DOT must be established at the start of treatment. Arrangements may be made with the local health department or whoever provides outreach for TB patients in your area. Q. Sometimes I am unable to locate a child for TST reading within the recommended 48-72 hour time frame. Do I have to repeat the test? A. TST reaction may be visible for up to 7 days after the test was administered. If there is no induration on the arm or the induration is not large enough to be interpreted as positive, the skin test must be repeated. If the induration is large enough to be interpreted as positive within 7 days of administration, this result can be used.25Q. Do all new students and school employees in my school district require a test for TB infection? A. TB skin testing regulations may vary by state. Consult your local health department and school board for more information. Q. What are the responsibilities of the school nurse when a student, teacher, or staff member has been diagnosed with tuberculosis? A. Contact investigations are managed by the health department, often in collaboration with school of cials. The results of the investigation will determine the potential extent of exposure and need for TB testing. School nurses often assist in gathering information, providing baseline data, risk assessment, and if testing is indicated, assisting with TST or IGRA testing.26APPENDIX B ADMINISTRATION, MEASUREMENT AND INTERPRETATION OF TST The Mantoux test is the recommended TST. It is administered by injecting 0.1 ml of 5 TU of puri ed protein derivative (PPD) solution intradermally into the volar surface of the forearm using a 27-gauge needle with a tuberculin syringe (CDC, 2003). TST administration and interpretation should be performed by a trained health care professional. ADMINISTRATION OF TST Store puri ed protein derivative (PPD) solution at 36-46\u00ba F and separate from other biologics, for example DTaP Avoid fl uctuations in temperature. Do not store on the refrigerator door Label the vial with date it was opened and discard unused portion within 30 days Explain purpose of the test to the child and how it will be performed Fill syringes immediately prior to administration Select injection site; avoid areas of skin with veins, rashes or excess hair Cleanse the area with alcohol swab and inject PPD solution just below the surface of the skin, forming a 6-10 mm wheal (a pale, raised area with distinct edges) Measure the wheal using a TST ruler. If no wheal forms or if it is less than 6 mm, the test should be repeated immediately at a site that is approximately 2 inches from the original site or on the opposite arm Clean the ruler with alcohol swab after use Dab the area with cotton at the injection site if minor bleeding occurs Do not cover the area with a bandage Record date, time and site of the intradermal injection Record the brand name of the PPD solution, the lot number, manufacturer and expiration date Instruct child and parent not to scratch the site or cover it with a bandage27 Inform parent and child of the importance of returning for a reading of the TST within 48-72 hours (2-3 days) Give written appointment to return for TST reading MEASUREMENT OF TST REACTIONS Locate the skin test site and verify with child/parent Inspect and palpate area with ngertips to distinguish areas of induration from erythema Measure area of induration perpendicular to the long axis of the arm Using a ballpoint pen, mark edges of induration Measure the distance between the two edges of induration using a TST ruler with millimeter calibration Measure only induration, not erythema DEFINITION OF POSITIVE TST RESULTS IN CHILDREN The interpretation of the TST is based on a person's risk of TB infection and of progression to TB disease if infected. *5 mm induration Child who is a close contact of a person with known or suspected TB Child with radiologic or clinical evidence of active TB disease Child receiving immunosuppressive therapy or with immunosuppressive conditions including HIV infection *10 mm induration Child younger than 4 years of age (AAP)* Child with medical conditions such as: Hodgkin's disease, lymphoma, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure or malnutrition Child born in region of the world with high prevalence of TB Child with a history of travel to high prevalence regions of the world Child who has frequent exposure to high-risk adults (HIV-infected, homeless, users of illicit drugs, residents of nursing homes, incarcerated or institutionalized) * CDC considers a 10 mm TST result positive in a child younger than 5 years of age. *15 mm induration Child * 4 years of age with no risk factors28DOCUMENTATION AND EDUCATION Record date TST was administered Record the results in millimeters of induration (00 mm if there is no induration) rather than as positive or negative Record date and time of reading Record name of person reading TST Explain the signi cance of a positive TST result and the next steps in evaluation Inform family of possibility that TB control personnel may test other household members in search of a source case Counsel family that there is no need for future TB skin testing if the child has a positive TST result Provide child/parent with appropriate educational materials Instruct child who had no induration when the TST was measured at 48-72 hours to return for evaluation if a reaction occurs up to 1 week after the visit - Measure any induration that develops and consider that to be the result29APPENDIX C SCREENING FOR THE RISK OF TB INFECTION The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) suggests that a risk assessment for TB be performed at the provider's rst encounter with the child, every six months until one year of age. After one year of age, risk assessment for tuberculosis should be performed at the time of routine care, annually if possible. Testing should be performed only if one or more risk factors are present (AAP , 2015). As noted earlier, children with HIV infection should be tested annually. Children with certain medical conditions that increase the possibility of progression to TB disease should be tested if the risk assessment suggests a possibility of exposure. School nurses should be provided with guidelines from their state department of health indicating who requires TB testing in the school setting. The following validated questions for determining risk of TB infection in children in the United States are recommended by the AAP . Has a family member or contact had a tuberculosis disease? Has a family member had a positive test for TB infection? Was your child born in a high-risk country (countries other than U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand or Western and North European countries)? Has child traveled and had contact with the resident population in a high-risk country (Africa, Asia, Latin America, countries of the former Soviet Union, or Eastern Europe) for more than a week? Providers should become familiar with the incidence of TB in the countries from which their patients and families are emigrating. The most current data available indicates that 66% of TB cases in the United States occurred among non-US-born persons. Sixty-two percent of those cases reported in 2014 occurred in people from seven countries; Mexico, Philippines, India, Vietnam, China, Guatemala and Haiti (CDC, 2015).
