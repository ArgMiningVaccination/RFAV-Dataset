I was quite stable for someone with ME/CFS but vitamin D has ruined that stability. The past month has been the worst for my health in years. I've been having more trouble than usual with thinking, and my tolerance for looking a computer monitor is down 60-90 minutes per day due to new sensitivities so it has taken a couple of weeks to (I think) figure out what is happening. Background * I last had my vitamin D tested over a decade ago. It was low but I didn't do much about it except take low dose D every so often. * I've been housebound for years and don't tolerate sunlight very well but do sit outside in summer. Winter here is eight months long and dark. Sitting outside means being bundled up except the face, so I don't get much natural light in winter. So I'm assuming my D is very low. * Vitamin D - I was taking high dose vitamin D more often starting around mid-October. Around 8-12,000 IU every few days. * Last dose - The last dose of 12,000 IU was on November 8. * K2 - I was taking it with 50mcg of K2 but only on the day I took the D (brainfog thinking). * Magnesium - I was taking it with at least 400mg per day of magnesium in small doses throughout the day. * I was also supplementing potassium. Roughly 700mg per day. I had a I did the Eply manouvre for BPPV in early November - it worked to fix the BPPV but now I have poor balance due to dizzyness and still have to move slowly. This is probably from the brain having to decompensate for the compensating it did for the otoliths (calcium stones) that caused the BPPV. I'm getting other dizziness now as well from vitamin D related problems: * Low blood sugar episodes - I've had problems with low blood sugar for years but it was managed. Now I've regressed due to the vitamin D. Blood sugar drops sooner. It seems to be slowly getting better now that I've included more calcium in my diet. * Low calcium, and sometimes after taking a calcium supplement Is this what happened? * I had a low calcium diet * Vitamin D, 8-12K IU every few days lead to calcium being used better which has lead to... - worse blood sugar control; - computer monitor induced strong anxiety (I'm limited to around 60-90 minutes per day now); - looser stool; - regular dizziness; - poor quality thinking; - OCD problem solving of what was happening, probably due to anxiety; - depression. * Bad move?: I only took 50mcg of K2 on the day I took the vitamin D. I should have been taking a higher dose, _and_ should have it taken every day. Questions * Does it look like my reasoning above might be correct? High D lead to low calcium and my ongoing symptoms? * What does calcium have to do with blood sugar control? * If I supplement with calcium carbonate my balance gets worse, I get fatigue, my heart beats more strongly, and it might be causing anxiety. Is this a sign that I need more magnesium? I'm experimenting with the dose. * Could the K2 be causing problems? Thanks for any help.

I had a [Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/11858-benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo-bppv)episode in October, shortly after starting high dose D. This might not be related but BPPV is caused by calcium stones becoming dislodged in the ear so maybe it has something to do with the vitamin D.
