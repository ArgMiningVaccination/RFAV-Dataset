Year on year, the cancer incidence rate continues to grow, with a projected increase of approximately 62% by 2040, resulting in over 27 million additional worldwide cancer cases per year. Traditionally, cancer has been treated using methods such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, some cancers don't respond well to traditional therapies, and others recur. Immuno-oncology could help provide a solution to these problems by harnessing the body's immune system to eradicate cancer and prevent its recurrence. Through combination therapy, and addressing the barriers to its use, immuno-oncology treatments could help tackle the rising number of worldwide cancer cases. About the conference series The conference is part of the Royal Society's Transforming our future conferences in the life sciences, supported by AstraZeneca. These meetings are unique, high-level events that address the scientific and technical challenges of the next decade. Each conference features cutting edge science from industry and academia and brings together leading experts from the scientific community, including regulatory, charity and funding bodies. "}
