The subcommittee met, pursuant to recess, at 10:30 a.m., in the as- sembly room, Old State Office Building, 217 West First Street, Los Angeles, Calif., Senator Harrison A. Williams, Jr. (chairman of the committee) presiding. Present: Senators Williams and Randolph of West Virginia. Also present: William E.

With this hear- ing, the Subcommittee on Health of the Elderly of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging continues its study of the costs and de- livery of health services to the elderly. With this hearing, the Subcommittee on Health of the Elderly of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging continues its study of the costs and delivery of health services to the elderly. Testimonv taken at two previous hearings has made several major points clear about the quality and availability of health care for older Americans. First, there can be no doubt that medicare is already having tremen- dous impact. On July 1, when medicare was 2 years old, President Johnson reported that 20 million Americans of age 65 and over-10 percent of the Nation's population-were covered by the program. More than $8 billion had been paid for expenses incurred in 10.6 million hospital stays and 45 million medical bills. Well over a million persons had received care after their stay in the hospital, in nursing homes or-when home health care is available-right in their owni bedrooms. Another million and a half persons had received hospital outpatient diagnostic services. Judged strictly in terms of statistics, the medicare program cer- tainly has produced results. But it is impossible to measure the amount of dignity and security it has provided to the elderly, as well as the assurance it has brought to younger families whose parents need no 611COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS longer live in dread of financial disaster because of extended hospitaltreatment or major medical costs. But even if medicare has already proved itself to be a blessing, itshould not be regarded as a cure-all for all that may be wrong with ourhealth care services today. Medicare, after all, merely provides the wherewithal to pay for cer-tain health care expenses. It may have some effect in improving thequality of such care, but it can t be held responsible for long-stanldillgdeficiencies or failures in the organization of health care. At its field hearing in New York City, for example, the subcommittee took testimony in a part of the Bronx where there is only one doctorfor every 10,000 people. Twenty or 30 years ago there were five timesas many doctors and only about half the number residents. We learned that much the same was true in some parts of St. Louis. too. And ofcourse it is the elderly-with a high rate of chronic illness-who livein large numbers in the central city neighborhoods. They suffer severelyfrom shortages of trained medical personnel. Much the same is true inmany rural areas; we're not dealing with just a city problem. How To ATTAIN HIGH QUALITY FOR ALL? XVe have to ask ourselves: How are we going to organize healthservices so that high-quality care is available to all? Another subject that received a considerable amount of attentionat the first two hearings was the medicaid, or the title 19 program,as it is so often called. Congress intended that this program s iouldhelp take away some of the welfare taint that overshadows the caregiven to low-income people. Congress declared that there was a largegroup in need of help, the so-called medically indigent who earn enough to take care of themselves, except when they are hit hard by high medical bills. Medicaid, of course, applies to all age groups, but it is important to many elderly people, especially when medicare benefits run out. The subcommittee has found considerable confusion and concern about some aspects of the medicaid program. Some elderly peoplebelieve that their hard-earned nest eggs are placed in danger whenthey sign up. Others regard it as a welfare program, with a welfare stigma. *Within recent weeks, Congress has-I am afraid-contributed to theuncertainty by proposing major cutbacks, even after many States havemade extensive plans for putting medicaid to work for tieir residents. One of the major reasons for calling this hearing in California wasto get firsthand information about your medicaid program-or Medi-Cal as it is called. As I understand it, there was some fear 8 or 9 months ago that thisprogram would produce a deficit. Then it turned out that you had a surplus. And now there are new State laws that permit cutbacks when costsreach a certain level. IV'hat are the effects of the Medi-Cal program on the provision ofhealth services for the elderly in California? We will look for someanswers to that question today. The first two hearings have also yielded much informative discus-sion about the need for prevention or early detection of chronic illness.612COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 613 One of the hospital directors interviewed during preparations forthis hearing was asked how to keep hospital costs down, especially thosehospital costs supported by medicare. His answer was prompt. He saidwe should try to keep as many people as possible out of hospitals. Oneway to do that is to promote health maintenance programs, includingregular disease detection screening. As things stand now, however, wefocus Federal funds and attention on the obviously ill person, whilewithholding the funds and concern needed for actions that will preventsuch illness. HEALTH CARE) IN THE HOME Another way to keep people out of hospitals is to provide the meansto give health care to people in their own homes. I personally knowof people who are in hospitals only because there was no one, not evenfamily, who could give them their daily meals and a few essentialservices. *We'll look to our witnesses today for a few good ideas about homehealth care, too. In fact, we expect to receive many good ideas here today. Californiahas many problems; but it also has many people who care about solvingthose problems. We've found over the years that many far-reachinginnovations have originated in this State, and there is no reason tobelieve that this is no longer true. To close, I would like to thank Senator George Smathers, who con-ducted the first two of the hearings on this subject as chairman of theHealth Subcommittee, for taking us so far along in our study. I knowthat he had hoped to be here today but I have agreed to conduct thehearing in his place in order to advance our work in this area.W;e w-ill move on to our first witnesses after a statement from oneof our most eloquent and distinguished Senators, Senator JenningsRandolph of West Virginia. Senator RANDOLPH. Mr. Chairman, I have no desire to speak thismorning. I think it is important that we proceed with the hearing.I thank you very much. I am delighted to be here to join with allthose present who want to make this program here today one of onepurpose. Thank you very much. Senator WILLIAMS. Our first witnesses will be Miss Elsa Carrow,administrative assistant to Mayor Yorty, and Mrs. A. M. G. Russell,chairman of the California Commission on Aging.Now, these girls know what they are doing here. They are alreadyin place. Who goes first? Miss CARROW. I am the chairman. Shall I go ahead?Senator WILLIAMiS. For the record, Miss C arrow. STATEMENT OF MISS ELSA CARROW, ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT TO MAYOR YORTY, MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES, CALIF. Miss CARROW. Honorable Chairman and members, I am pleased towelcome your committee to the city of Los Angeles on behalf of ourmayor, Sam Yorty. A previous commitment prevents Mayor Yorty from welcomingyou personally today. He asked me, as his coordinator for senior citi-zen activities, to bring you his personal greetings.614 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS And further, he wished me to express his deep concern about the subject of your inquiry, the costs and delivery of health services to older Americans. Los Angeles historically has been a mecca for the elderly and re- tired, who seek sunshine, comfort, and ease of living in their later years. Approximately 10 percent of our city's population is aged 65 and over-that is, some 300,000 senior citizens. Senator WILLIAMS. Would you just repeat that? Miss CARROW. Yes. Approximately 10 percent of our city's popula- tion is aged 65 or over-that is, some 300,000 citizens. Senator WVILLIAMiS. That is just the city of Los Angeles? Miss CARROW. That's right. This important segment of our population comprises a community with few geographical limits but with special needs that must be met by special services from both government and private enterprise. From the earliest days of his administration Mlayor Yorty has taken active interest in the challenges and conditions encountered by our senior citizens. One of his first official acts was to form the Mlayor-s Committee on Senior Citizens Affairs. Composed of outstanding persons in fields of endeavor identified with senior citizens, the committee explores and recommends improve- ments in such areas as recreation, transportation, housing, employ- ment, and health. Not all of these areas are within the province of the city health services for one is the concern of county, State, and Federal Government. Even though health care is outside his jurisdiction, Mayor Yorty believes adequate medical care is a primary concern and a right to be enjoyed by all senior citizens. For that reason he has sponsored inedi- care and its California State counterpart, Medi-Cal. He has urged a full measure of attention to the health needs of our senior citizens. The path of medical assistance for the elderly has not been smooth, as you will hear from other speakers today. That is one reason why we welcome your hearing here in Los Angeles. 'We believe, as Shakespeare wrote, \"To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve the silver livery of advised age,\" is one of the rights of all. We hope and trust that the outcome of your hearings here and across the Nation will make that right a reality for all Americans. Thank you. Senator WILLIAMS. I would like to have you repeat that Shake- spearean quote again. Aiss CARROW. Thank you. \"To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve the silver livery of ad- vised age,\" is one of the rights of man. Senator WILLIAMS. Bill Oriol said, \"I wish I had said that.\" Thank you, Miss Carrow. Miss CARROW. Thank you. Senator RANDOLPH. Longfellow said it another way. He said \"For age is opportunity no less than youth itself, though in another dress,\" since we are talking about poetry. Senator WILLIAMS. Thank you very much. Mrs. Russell, from the California Commission on Aging. You are chairman, as I understand it?COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 615 STATEMENT OF MRS. A. M. G. RUSSELL, CHAIRMAN, CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING Mrs. RUSSELL. Senator Williams and Senator Randolph, and gentle-men, I am Mrs. A. M. G. Russell, chairman of the California Commis-sion on Aging, and on behalf of myself, of Mr. Charles W. Skoien,Jr., executive director of the California Commission on Aging, andof Mr. Carel Mulder, director of health care services of the State ofCalifornia, and as representative of Governor Reagan today, we wel-come you to the State, a State with a senior population of nearly 2million, approximately 10 percent of our national senior population.Senator WILLIAMs. I will say we a-re going to be a little less thanformal here. I don't know what your full name is. I have it A. M. G.Mrs. RUSSELL. I'm Bonny Russell.Senator WILLIAmS. They call you Bonny?Mrs. RUSSELL. That's right. Because of the importance of this hearing today, and those youhave had in the past in Washington and in New York, I would liketo provide you with a little bit of background regarding activities thatrelate to the delivery of health care services in California.It is the role of the California Commission on Aging to advise andcounsel, and cooperate with all govermnental and private agenciesthat are serving the senior Californians.It is the job and responsibility of the commission to work as enablersin the provision of health services. It is our sincere belief that in order to render quality health serv-ices it is vital that the responsibility not be vested in any one agencyor organization-but, must be shared by all. This means that our na-tionaf society must work together to create an adequate health pro-gram for all. It has been our privilege in California to see our senior Californiansgive of their time, their talent, and energy-and most of all, theirexperience to the local community not only for their own personalbenefit, but for the benefit of the health and welfare of each of theircommunities. Also, through many innovative and creative ideas, California isdeveloping many new ways to serve the elderly through preventivemeans. For example, there are two senior Californian regional educationcenters, one in San Jose and one in Los Angeles; centers fundedthrough the Older Americans Act with programs which bring thelocal community and the local college or university together to pro-vide a comprehensive senior program.Through this effort, in the field of health we will be providing dailymeals, nutrition program health lectures, training of health leaders,and-most of all-a public education program showing the communitythe need for adequate health planning. Other aspects of this program will be a 7-day-a-week multipurposeprogram, a training center for college and university students, a com-munity outreach program utilizing the senior Californians in the com-munity on a paid basis, and an extensive training program for ad-ministrators of nursing homes, board and care homes, homes for aged;administrators in the fields of housing, employment, religion, educa-616 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS tion; for civic leaders, for those in charge of service clubs or women's organizations; and, of greatest importance, a training program for the seniors themselves. FUNDED BY OLDER AMERICANS AcT This example is one of the 44 Older Americans Act programs admin- istered and funded by the California Commission on Aging. The Older Americans Act programs in California are providing pro- tective services, information and referral services; there are multipur- pose centers, Foster Grandparents type programs, reachout programs, shutin programs, counseling services, visitation programs, education classes, casework and group work programs, volunteer services, part- time employment services, trainingo of professional and volunteers and the Older Americans Act in California helps provide complete coordination of services. With these programs and through the efforts of the 58 counties and the 401 cities in our State, we believe that we can successfully meet the needs for delivery of health services to the people of our State through good sound planning and the development of new and creative ideas. Full cooperation must be given by the family, community, and society in Flelping the senior Californian realize an adequate health program. It is our desire and the Governor's desire-in California-to provide every senior Californian a retirement that is productive, creative, and meaningful. Some of the health service needs are being met through the funding of the Older Amiericans Act, and as additional funds from this act and others are provided, more services can be made available. We are aware of many of the needs and will continue to work, as a pow- erful force composed of government, business, industry, and concerned individual Californians, toward meeting the health needs of all our citizens. We shall be here throughout the day, gentlemen. We shall be very glad-the three of us-to answer any questions that you might have concerning our program here in California. Thank you. Senator WILLIAMS. Very good. Your statement indicates a most en- lightened program here in California, which is what I would also de- scribe as a retirement State. So your percentage of people who are in retirement here probably equals Florida, Arizona, and places where Mrs. RUSSELL. Our percentage is a rather normal percentage, be- cause California attracts the young as well as the old. It is under the national average-percentagewise. Mr. WILLIAMS. You are moving across the board to meet the needs of the older people. You are moving across the board to meet the needs of the older people. Mrs. RUSSELL. We are certainly trying to. Senator WILLIAMS. How do you-I hate to talk money-but as a budgetary matter, how do you budget the programs, and how much do you put into the programs you discuss? Mrs. RusSEIT,. Of course the amount varies as to the kind of program and the size of the community. The regional educational programsCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 617 that we are establishing-the center programs-have been funded by the commission at around between $i32,000 and $35,000. Of course the community adds a great deal to this, too, in matching funds. They are required in the first year to only match up to 25 per- cent. But I think in the two places that we have programs established at the moment, they are matching to a much greater extent than that. SenatorWILLIAMs. The two places are San Jose and- Mrs. RUSSELL. San Jose and right here in Los Angeles. Senator WILLIAMS. Yes. And you have many more communities to reach. Mrs. RUSSELL. Yes. These are regional programs, and we intend to reach into five areas of California, and hope that these centers, on an educational basis, will serve the entire region. Senator WILLIAMS. Is there any great resistance from the taxpayers? Mrs. RUSSELL. There seems to be a readiness, certainly, to provide pro grams in California for older persons. We do have 44 programs funded under the Older Americans Act. And a good many of these are entering their third year of funding and hopefully, some of them, will receive funding by the local community or by private agencies, in the fourth year. We had perhaps hoped that some of them would have a fourth year of funding allowed. Senator WILLIAMS. I presume, to make the conclusion, that you unequivocally approve of continuing the Older Americans Act, and you speak for the Governor of the State of California? MlS. RUssELL. Yes. Thank you. Senator WILLIAMs. Yes. Very good. Senator RANDOLPI-I. Mrs. Russell Mrs. RUSSELL. Oh, I am sorry. Senator RANDOLPH. That's all right. I shall not keep you very long. I wanted you to tell us what percentage, if you have it as a fact, of the persons over 65 in California who reside -with a son or daughter,rather than live in a house or in an apartment which is maintained by that older person. Mrs. RUSSELL. I don't have that figure, Senator, I think probably along the lines of the national figures-which are rather high in this category. A good many of our older people continue to live with their chil- dren, particularly the very elderly-the people in the over-S5 group. A great number of them live with a son or a daughter. Senator RANDOLPi-. Now the areas in California, as in other parts of the country, where the older people have been grouped together: How are they working out in California? Just to use Leisure World as an example REAMcoN TO RETIREMENxT COM3usNITIES Mrs. RUSSELL. Well, it is very interesting to discuss that, and I think that perhaps for the most part they haven't been established long enough to really know their impact on the comnmunity. Reports from individuals living in the communities are very favor- able. They like it. And very few of them have, really, moved away from them. On the whole, they are a rather young group at the mo-618 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS ment, speaking about the older people in the community. They move there in their younger years-of their retirement-so that, in years to come, it will be an older group and perhaps will change in com- plexion to some extent. Senator RANDOLPH. Thank you, Mrs. Russell. Senator WILLIAMS. We are grateful to you ladies for your very helpful testimony on questions of vital interest to the whole Nation, and of legislative concern to ourselves. We will pause for a moment. I understand the speaker of the Assem- bly of the State of California, Jesse Unruh, is beleaguered by television interviewers with political questions outside the door. Senator RANDOLPH. Mrs. Russell, how long have you been in the work in which you are engaged? Mrs. RUSSELL. Thirty-seven years. Senator RANDOLPH. You know, I sensed this as you spoke. You were very well grounded in the subject matter. I didn't want to pursue it with further questions-I can tell. Senator AITILLIAMS. I did overlook introducing John Guy Miller, who is one of the members on our staff for this discussion-for the Committee on Aging, and I forgot to ask you if you wanted to ask any questions, John, but we will catch up with that later. We are honored, indeed, to have a television personality-all those cameras were out there for you, weren't they, Mr. Speaker? Mr. UNRuH. Well, they are really out there for the Governor-what I had to say about him. Senator WILLIAMS. The Honorable Jesse M. Unruh, speaker of the Assembly of the State of California. We want to express our gratitude to you. You came here today to help our discussions on an important matter dealing with older people. STATEMENT OF JESSE MI. UNRUH, SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. UNiiUH. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, let me intro- duce Mike Manley, who is my legislative assistant in Sacramento and is here with me today in case you have any detailed questions beyond what I might, with my somewhat cursory knowledge of the detail in this field, be able to answer. Let me apologize, first of all, for my having absorbed what I am afraid is far too much attention that should be directed on the activi- ties of this committee. Unfortunately, I had little control over what the Governor said yesterday about the legislature, and that is what at- tracted the television attention. The attention should be focused on this hearing, because what you are doing here today is far more important than anything the Governor and I might have to say about each other. I do express my thanks to you and your staff for asking me here to testify before you on something which I think is of central, present public concern, which is provision of health care to our senior citizens. As I said, I am not an expert in depth in this field, but I am very concerned over it. It seems to me there are two fairly obvious comments about the problems of costs and delivery of health care services to older Americans. The first is that using health care in its strictest interpre-COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 619 tation, the problems of providing health care services for the elderly are much the same as for the rest of the population, the major differ- ence being that the elderly require more services. In the broader use of the term health, there are fairly significant differences in the life styles of the elderly which must be taken into consideration in developing a program of comprehensive health care for them. HEALTH COST ESCALATION A Syprrom Mv second comment is that the recent rapid increase in health-care costs is merely a symptom of much deeper problems of health care. It is for this reason that the actions of both our Governor here and to some extent the Congress have been irresponsible. Because those actions have been aimed at control of the symptoms by reducing expen- ditures at the governmental level they are trying to protect. These actions have been in the form of either service cuts as here in Cali- fornia or recipient cuts by the Congress. In neither case has there or will there be any meaningful effect upon the total costs of health care: there will merely be a shift of costs to some other governmental level- in California., to the counties. All of this activity in an attempt to cut costs has tended to belie the official position of HEW that medicare and medicaid have not been a cause of recent spiraling increases in the cost of health care. Two examples from the Medi-Cal program in California should suffice to illustrate what a basically open-ended program will produce. Prior to Medi-Cal, the public assistance medical care, PAMC, paid for physician services on the basis of a fee schedule using a conversion factor of $4. Two years later, allowing billing on the basis of usual and customary charges, the average conversion factor is $6, an increase of 50 percent. If we had remained on the old fee schedule, our costs would have been $40 million per year less and a 25-percent increase to a conversion factor of $5 would have cost us $20 million a year less than the present system. The second example involves county hospitals. Part of the financing for Medi-Cal involved a guarantee by the State to county governments that if they chose an optional method of contributing to Medi-Cal, they would not have to spend any more on their county hospitals than they did in 1964-65, except as adjusted for population increases. Most large counties chose the option method and this year it will cost the State about $50 million more even though there has been no appreciable increase in the number of persons served in county hos- pitals, and even a decrease in some cases. This committee has asked for a summary of the conflicting argu- ments made over the.Medi-Cal program late in 1967 and early this year. That comprises, I think, one of the most astonishing episodes of governmental incompetence and medical irresponsibility. It illustrates two very important points. The first is the extent to which the State administration can and did manipulate dollar figures in an attempt to undermine a medical care program for the people of California. The second is the ability of an independent and well-staffed legislative branch to thwart such an attempt by obtaining the facts before acting and then acting on the facts instead of on propaganda.620 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS The story is fairly complex. It involves a great number of varying, and I quote \"official,\" estimates of the program's cost as well as various legal opinions of provisions of the basic law which affected those estimates. It also involves the fact, which is hardly a secret to anyone, that our Governor is out of sympathy with programs like Medi-Cal which attempt to meet the health care needs of the needy citizens of California. Thus, when the Governor was presented with estimates which indicated originally, although those estimates were very sketchy and based on a very short experience span, he jumped at the chance to ask for a major cutback- Senator RANDOLPH. In Medi-Cal? Mr. UNRUH. In Medi-Cal. Senator WILLIAMS. Well, now, could we pause? I won't interrupt you again. Mrs. Russell said that your budget was-what was it? Mrs. RUSSELL. I am speaking of the older Americans budget at this point. The older Americans emphasis is different. Mr. UNRUH. Well, this is the Senator WILI AMS. Say that again? Mrs. RUSSELL. I am speaking of the older Americans program. Senator WILLIAMS. I asked about the budget on Medi-Cal. Mrs. RUSSELL. I am sorry, I misunderstood you. Senator WILLIAms. But it is your position, Mr. Speaker, that it is inadequately budgeted, and without an adequate budget, you certainly aren't going to get the appropriation; is that it? BACKGROUND OF MEDI-CAL CoNRovEEsSY Mr. UNRUI. No. What I am trying to relate now, Senator, is the entire background of the raging controversy over the whole Medi-Cal program in California, which always involves medicare because, in general, in the public mind the programs are relatively indistinguish- able. So when there is an attack launched upon the Medi-Cal provisions, title 19 provisions of this program, it invariably slops over and causes the same kind of resentment that generally takes place in these pro- grams against the Medicare portion of the program. And we had, as you may remember, last year, about a year ago now, a special session of the legislature which was called by the Governor. We were already there on another matter, but the Governor added the Medi-Cal question to that special call. When he got some preliminary figures which indicated there might be a deficit in the Medi-Cal program, he called a special session. He first of all tried to shift that program, as the money had been appro- priated by the legislature. After a court case which indicated he could not make those cuts unilaterally, he then called us into special session to give him the right to make those cuts, so that he could meet what he said was, at that point, an original $210 million deficit in the entire program. Now, the $210 million deficit-we got varying estimates along the way reducing that, and as a consequence, we eventually after we got all the facts together, we put a bipartisan, two-house committee of the legislature into that, and hired actuaries to check the estimates.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 621 That program actually wound up in the 1967-6S budget year on the basis of the figure the Governor was using with a $185 million surplus.And actually if you throw out the fluff and -et that down to actual costs, it was a $135 million total gubernatorial error. And that's apretty big error in what amounted finally to a $200 million program. As you know, in California, like manv other States, we have to livewithin our budget. We cannot rely upon deficit financing. Senator WILLIANIS. What was that gubernatorial accounting error- $135 million? Mr. UNRmI. Well, reduced to actual dollars, it was a total error of $135 million. Now, the program, instead of having-if you want to use the same figures that the Governor did when he utilized the $210 million, which was the total figures for the program-then it would amount to con- siderably more than that. It would be around a $400 million guberna-torial estimate. But if you break it down to actual State dollars, which is what we were talking about-what we are concerned about at my level-it was a mistake of $135 million on a $208 million program. Senator WiLmLIAs. You had better get that office computer on it. Mr. UNRUH. Well, the computer still answers according to what youput into it, and if you put in something expecting to get out an answer, that is generally what the machines give you. Now, to insure that Medi-Cal will stay within its budget, we have to develop a real program. The Governor, of course, recommended that he be allowed to reduce or eliminate services to recipients. That was his answer to the fiscal crisis that he said threatened. CATEGORICAL ELIMINATION OF SERVICES There are, of course, a number of problems with this approach. One is the administration's proposed elimination of services on a categor- ical basis so that some persons would be denied services they needed badly, while other persons would still receive other services that werenot needed nearly as much. In other words, what he wanted to do was cut out a block of recipi- ents, totally and completely. Another is that- Senator WILLIAMS. What kind of blocks? Could we have some de-tail on that, Mr. Manley? Mr. MANLEY. At one point, Senator, he threatened to completely remove from the program those people classified as medically indigent.And that amounted to-as I recall the figure-600,000 people. That figure may be high. He never did do this. That was his threatat the time he called the legislature into session. In other xwords, ifthey didn't pass the Senator WILLIAMS. I thought that's what Medi-Cal was all about. Mir. MANLEY. That's correct. That's what title 19 is all about. To continue the story, the result was that he did not make those cuts. Mr. UNRUH. Well, because we refused to give him the authority. Senator WILLIA3iS. But it was a cliffhanger for a while?Mr. UNRmH. That's right. 24-798-69-pt. 3-2622 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS The other thing that is wrong with that kind of an approach is that many of these services are also provided by the county hospitals for these people. Any decrease in Medi-Cal services just results in an increase in the county-provided services in their costs. Still another is that such an approach may have no relation to the causes of increased costs. For example, hospital and physicians' serv- ices are very understandably among those exempt from reduction or elimination. However, the cost of these services are the ones that have increased most rapidly, and should their costs continue to rise, other services would have to be cut to compensate for any unexpected increase. Now. we, as I said rejected that approach and came up with one which was more nearfy geared to the causes of the problem, although we don't propose that this is perfect, either. This changed the law so that if cuts are required they must first be made in the amount of payments for services not to exceed a 10-percent cut. If this is not adequate, then the administration may postpone those services, which are elective, regardless of their category. These measures are designed to reduce program costs until the legislature can decide to make an emergency appropriation or make other program modifications. The legislature also required that if any one service item threatens to exceed its budgeted amount, and that's the way we budget in general areas, the amount of payment for that service, that particular service, may be reduced by 10 percent. This approach we think comes closest to meeting the problem head on. It may tend to discourage fee in- creases and overutilization by providers since these, if they get out of line, could result in an immediate 10 percent reduction. If I could look back with hindsight on the results of California's manufactured crisis with its Medi-Cal program, I would say that our experience indicates what can be done to any new governmental pro- gram-which in this case has not been fully tested out-by somebody who simply does not like the program and is out to wreck public con- fidence in it. It appears clear to us and to most California observers familiar with Medi-Cal that our Governor did not like this program and his disagreement with the Federal legislation which authorized it which was largely to blame for this State's crisis over the program. Among other things, during the course of that controversy we had when we were there, we were expected to give the Governor the power to unilaterally cut this program. He had a television appearance, in which he got on television, and utilizing the Medi-Cal card, the one which goes to welfare recipients, and displayed this card and said, \"If you have one of these welfare cards-\" or words to that effect, \"you can get better treatment\"-or \"they can get better treatment than you can,\" pointing to the television audience, \"than if you don't have one and you have to pay for it out of your own pocket.\" In addition to being just in general disagreement with that kind of an approach to government, at this point I think that is one of the most dangerous things that can happen is when we try to put one group of our people against another. We have too much of that in ourCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 623 society, already. It certainly is damaging to a program that has justbeen instituted for any public official to get on before the programhas really had a chance to settle down-and make those kinds ofcharges. The fact that we disagreed with the Governor's position on this isnot really the point. The point that I would like to stress is that asa result of these pretended claims of bankruptcy, the very real methodsof controlling Medi-Cal's costs were overlooked. FIE SCHEDULES FOR PHYSICIANS The fact is for quite a while and still to some extent, although Ithink it is considerably less now, due to the scrutiny they have beengetting, a few irresponsible doctors have made outrageously exorbi-tant profits out of the operation of this program. The people reallygetting well under this program are the doctors-and some of themare getting awfully well indeed. Last year a thousand California doctors collected as much as $70,000each simply from treating Medi-Cal patients. Some of them are makingas much as a hundred thousand dollars yearly off of this program.Now, I don't know that we have very definitive figures on how muchof this was profit, but we have been told by people in the medicalprofession that this is considerably more than the average doctormakes, and we estimate that some of them are making somewherebetween $35,000 and $60,000 net profit out of this program each year.It is obvious that the most direct method of controlling costs isthrough the imposition of fee schedules on doctors and the other pro-viders of medical services. Yet, despite pleas from members of thelegislature, the administration which we gave the authority to hasrefused to set such limits, and in my opinion that refusal, or the threatof using that, is almost totally responsible for those soaring, runawaycosts which have occurred. You know, it's very interesting-some of our Governor's conjec-tures about the use of the bomb in the Vietnamese conflict ought notto be ruled out because that gives away our plans to the enemy, andyet, at the same time, the administration has so steadfastly refusedeven to consider the threat of imposing a fee schedule that, quiteclearly, there is no fear on the part of the people who are out of lineon this, that it might be. I don't advocate flatly at this point that a fee schedule be used butI think it clearly ought to be setting there as an alternative, and thatthose people who are out of -line ought to understand.Senator WILLIAmS. Are you a lawyer?Mr. UNRuH. No, I am not. Senator WILLIAMS. Well, in the law, at least where I used to prac-tice, we had a schedule of fees where somebody could go beyond theschedule, but we had an ethics committee that could receive com-plaints. Is there anything comparable- Mr. UNRUJI. Yes, there is, Senator, and I was going to add that Ithink the ethical, reputable doctors in the business are doing theirdead-level best to try to do something in this area.624 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS I think, to some extent, they have been successful. It may well be that the medical profession may be able to contain this themselves; if so, certainly that is a better approach to this. Senator WILLIAMS. I am glad you raised this. I think that this would be most appropriate in our hearing-testimony-what you said. We report to the full Senate, and we will make a significant point of just what you concluded on that fee situation. Mr. UNRUH. Yes. The one weakness of this approach that I see, Senator, is of course that usual customary fee business. So that the basis of ethics is placed upon a broad based group without too much concern for the escalation of costs. And that's a weakness of the peer group ethics question, as I see it. As long as the overall costs escalate, there is no obligation, that I can see, to contain or to agitate more businesslike procedures-the handling of billing and other things. They are concerned with keep- ing the individual doctor from profiting at an exorbitant. rate on an individual basis, but if the entire fee schedule escalates, there seems to me to be no obligation on the part of the profession as a whole to hold that down. Now, I may say as a result of all this, and certainly I would not argue that all of this could have been escaped, that the additional costs of the past 2 years of this program has been in this area of $40 million. I think that the administration's refusal to at least consider or to resort to this, refutes pretty well the claim that they want to control the program costs. I think the medical profession owes it to the State to control costs, not only to restrain those few doctors who are out of line with their peer group, but to exercise some self restraint insofar as managing overall costs is concerned and the escalation of those costs. I don't know, Senator, whether you would like me to go-I will skip the second part of my testimony at this point, if I may, which was on a program that the legislature devised some years ago for a relatively new total approach to this program. Senator WILLIAMS. Would you like that part to be included in our testimony? Mr. UNRUH. I think that would be of interest to the committee. We still think it has a great deal of merit. Senator WVV=Ams. Senator Randolph suggested that, and I think wve will not object to that. It will be included. Mr. UNRUI. I will be very happy to discuss that, and answer ques- tions on it. It is on the basis of getting everyone into the program on the basis of need and also on the basis of what they can afford, or when they might get into situations where, no matter how affluent they are, the medical costs could reduce them to a poverty level. We think it is a good program, but when the cut was adopted by Congress, we did not feel that we had developed this far enough to present it as a program in which they had to pick up the principal costs on.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 625 THE CAL-MED PROPOSAL Let me take several moments to outline to this committee, as youhave asked me to do, the major features of the basic health care pro- gram which I suggested to the California Legislature in 1966. In keeping with the current practice of giving all new government pro- grams catchy one-word names, we called this plan Cal-Med. Cal-Med was suggested almost exactly 2 years ago. It was pre- sented as an alternative to the proposal then before the legislature which was eventually to become the Medi-Cal program. It represented an attempt to break away from the past patterns of public medical care programs which were being advanced under title 19 and to avoid the copying of existing health insurance programs which were taking place under title 18. Like those programs, it was basically a method of financing health care, but unlike them, it also addressed itself to the problem of doing so as efficiently and economically as possible. It didnot tackle the serious problems of health manpower, facilities or com- prehensive health planning, but no financing mechanism can really do that directly. Cal-Med would ideally include all citizens of the State within its protection although to differing degrees depending upon the basic variable of income and family size. There would not be any categories as there are under the present AMedi-Cal program because of title 19 restrictions. There would be three basic classes of protection under Cal-Med. The first would include those persons whose income is not adequate to provide health care services for them and their families. They would receive comprehensive health care services without cost as is now the case with cash grant recipients under Medi-Cal. The second would include those persons who are now considered medically needy as well as those who are poor risks. These are persons who can pay for some but not all of their health care either because of low incomes or because their physical condition makes health care costly and insurance coverage prohibitive. These persons would have two alternatives; they could choose to make a monthly payment toward the purchase of a health care plan when they were either sick or well. This monthly payment would be supplemented by Cal-Med to the extent necessary to obtain comprehensive coverage. The other alter- native would be for the person not to prepay for health care protec- tion, but then be required to spend down a given amount when he required services, as at present. The third class would be those persons who are able to afford com- plete and comprehensive health care protection but because of some catastrophic situation their coverage is exhausted and they are faced with continuing high health care costs. These three basic classes should include all the citizens of the State who would require assistance in order to have adequate health care services. It is the purpose of Cal- Med to provide some or all of that assistance depending upon its level of funding.626 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS One of the basic theories behind Cal-Med is that it is desirable for individuals to obtain prepaid health care protection. Consequently, Cal-Med would offer incentives to those who do so. Instead of forcing people to obtain such coverage, they would receive more services or Cal-Med would participate to a greater extent in their catastrophic coverage if they had comprehensive health care coverage. This is de- signed to encourage the further development of such plans. CAL-MED AND RIsING COSTS Another factor in the development of Gal-Med was the issue of rising health care costs. It was felt that one of the best ways of combat- ing such rising costs was by the encouragement of efficiency and inno- vation in health care organization through the stimulus of some healthy competition. This would be entirely different than the present title 18 and 19 programs which basically make payments on the basis of a fee for each service or on reasonable costs through a fiscal inter- mediary which takes no financial risks. Cal-Med would develop a comprehensive set of benefits and ask health care plans such as Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Cal-West, Occidental, Kaiser, Ross-Loos, the county foundations, and others to bid on providing the benefits. Even though the bids might vary considerably, it would be desirable to have wide participation, especially at first, so that all reasonable bids would be accepted. This would give each recipient a wide choice of plans to choose from. It is also desirable for the recipient to be aware of the financial nature of his choice of plan. This can be done quite easily for those with a share of cost because their share can be made to differ depending upon the cost of the plan. Those with no share of cost present a more difficult problem. One solution would be to provide more benefits for those who choose lovw- cost plans than for those who choose high-cost plans, but this would appear to conflict with title 19's comparability of services requirement. This entire area is one which is vitally important as far as the future of public health care programs are concerned. In any vendor-type program there would appear to be two basic approaches to the problem of costs. One is to impose external controls upon cost and utilization and the other is to develop a program which will create its own inter- nal controls. To date, most programs have followed the former pattern. Even with all these controls there are still not very good means of knowing what Medi-Cal is purchasing and whether the price is right. How much better to use the competitive model which rewards efficiency, economy, and innovation which produces services at reasonable costs. Those plans which can produce will grow and those which cannot will -wither and die. We know that there is a ready market for quality serv- ices at reasonable costs from the phenomenal growth of Kaiser in California. W1rhat is needed is the type of competition which is paid such lip service, but is really so feared and is a major reason why there is often such hostility to proposals like Cal-Med. Those who have been able to merely pass the costs of their decisions on to the patient or the insurance company, and at the same time make substantial in- comes do not look kindly upon the suggestion that they bear some financial responsibility for the way they provide health care, but it is past time they did so.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 627 Let me comment for a moment on the specific medical and health needs of California's aged and the coverage of the programs now avail- able to them. Theoretically, the elderly are being served very well by the Aledi- Cal program. They have a wide range of benefits available to themn as supplements to medicare. However, since Medi-Cal is basically a financing program, it has developed within the existing system which appears to leave a great deal to be desired as far as the elderly are concerned. HEALTH CARE VERSUS MEDICAL CARE Medicare, and to a lesser extent Medi-Cal, place primary emphasis upon fairly short term acute care although the greatest need of the elderly would appear to be for long-term chronic care. They also place a great deal of emphasis upon medical care as contrasted with health care which has a much broader meaning. For example, medicare institutionalized the extended care facility as a halfway stop between acute hospital care and home. At the same time, title 19 allowed for skilled nursing home care which in California was seen as long-term care. Then HEW required all skilled nursing homes to meet ECF standards which place major emphasis upon medical and nursing services. However, not all nursing homes in California can meet ECF stand- ards and not all persons in California nursing homes need such a high level of care so that such a requirement is unrealistic and we think needs to be met by more flexible and understanding programs. Congress evidently realized this and invented the intermediate care facility which will be much the same as California's nursing homes but will not be paid for under the medical care program. In addition to the almost complete lack of coordination which has occurred at the Federal level as to the decertification of nursing homes and the imple- mentation of intermediate care facilities. this episode illustrates the arbitrariness of the distinctions that are made. And I think that, more than anything else, what is needed is an effort to provide care for the elderly with little regard to whetherit is called medical or not. The primary objective ought to be to assist elder Americans to remain as healthy and as independent as possible. This is in their best* interests and it also makes sense from a fiscal standpoint. It is much less expensive to maintain an older person in his own home than to place them in an institution-and it is far, far better for him-whether it be nursing home or State mental hospital. However, in order to do that we must develop flexible strategies which are directed to that end. An older person may need someone to assist with his housekeeping or taking a bath, bringing him groceries, drugs, or hot meals. Even though these may not be medical services, they certainly have a direct bearing upon a person's health and whether he is goinglr to require institutional care. It may be in many cases preventive. It is far cheaper, we feel, than the steps that have to be taken if we institu- tionalize him. We also need to reexamine the impact of our policies upon the families of the elderly. The way our modern society has developed has628 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS made it increasingly difficult for children to care for their elderly parents. This fact has evidently been reflected in the relatives' responsi- bilitv section of title 19. HARDSHIPS ON FAMILIES OF THE ELDERLY One effect of that provision is to make it financially easy for children to place their parents in nursing homes. We could once again require relative responsibility as a deterrent to that action, but this might create added hardships for families of the elderly. Let me illustrate, if I can, what I mean in regard to another program which the legislature developed in California in the treatment of our mentally retarded children. For many, many years California had a mentally retarded program. That program provided simply that if you had a mentally retarded child, you would place him in an institution. Now, the progress in institutions even of the best kind is generally slow for those children. In addition to that, it is very, very expensive, with the result that almost every 2 years Ewe had to increase the facili- ties and even then we had a long waiting list. We developed a flexible program which allows a family to acquire State financial aid for children, if they desired to keep that child in the home. We developed a system of foster homes and also local, private facilities, so that -we now have alternatives. We found, after conducting a very intensive survey, that the parents of these children, manv times, did not want to institutionalize them. The financial burden, in addition to the emotional and physical diffi- culties in keeping this child in the home were just too much for the parent, particularly with other children, to bear. If they could get a little help so that they once in a while can have a day or two rest from that. they still prefer to keep the child in the family. We think this would be the case with the elderly. A more flexible system was devised so that instead of simply en- couravging them, as the program now does to some extent, to institu- tionalize these people, many young people would keep the elderly, even those with some problems in the home, if they had some help. And I think that is the general thrust that the program ought to take. A program would have to be devised in this area that is flexible enough to allow this. I think the program that needs to be devised ou0hlit also to be flexible enough to allow those who wish to resort to this kind of flexible approach, and other innovative ways of treating the elderly, or helping the elderly, to proceed with it. I believe all Federal programs should provide floors, as I am flatly convinced that they must, because of the niggardliness of some of our States, and at the same time they ought not to comprise ceilings bevond which those States who wish to proceed with better care and more imaginative programs cannot proceed. Senator WILLIA3rS. I wonder if an idea that we have been advancing, but has not been enacted. fits in at this point. We call it the community service corps volunteers of older people in retirement, and one of the ideas that we thought could be incorporated into the program would be for older people who are active, energetic, and understanding could help in this home service situation that you are indicating.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 629 I haven't described it fully, but does that idea suggest merit to you ?Mr. UNRUH. Yes, it does, Senator: I am very strongly in favor ofthat program, particularly I think it is apropos to the elderly whosort of get pushed out of our society now to feel, among other things,they aren't wanted. That is unfortunately, I think, too much the case.I think the program in addition has broad social significance-socially significant values-and if we are indeed to have the changein the kind of politics that too often has pervaded us in governmentand in our society in the past, that is, I think, more and more peoplehave to be concerned with something other than simply No. 1, andthis is a group of people who obviously could be.They have the time, they have the experience, and I think it hasgreat, great value. Senator WILLIAMS. Thank you.Mr. UNRUH. Senator, I just want to conclude by saying that I thinkour goal should be the maintenance of the health and independenceof our older citizens. To accomplish this goal, we have to realize that health is dependentupon all sorts of nonmedical factors, as well as medical factors, thatthese ought to have equal priority with medical care in any programsdevised for the elderly. Thank you very much. That concludes my testimony.Senator WILLIAMS. I have interrupted you many times. It has beena magnificent statement, and we certainly appreciate it-I am notsure everybody will, but any statement of importance will have tofind some disagreement-whether they live in Sacramento or New YorkCity. I know one person who will not be in disagreement, and he isfrom the most beautiful State of West Virginia.Senator RANDOLPH. I can aaree that that is the most beautiful State.I don't know if I can agree on the rest.Senator WILLIAMS. Let me draw back, if I can. \"The most beautifulState of West Virginia.\" That doesn't mean that I rule out my State.Senator RANDOLPH. Well, autumn touches West Virginia withbeauty just now, you understand. Mr. Speaker, on page 2, would you refer to your informative state-ment-very informative statement. You say that Congress has been irresponsible. Now, I think for therecord, you want to be definitive in reference to such a statement. Iimagine that I know what your reply will be, but I think it shouldbe on the record. CONGRESSIONAL CUTBAcKs DiscUssED AMr. UNRUH. Yes. I refer to the capping action which Congresstook after throwing out this program, and then finding that one Statewas somewhat more enterprising than perhaps they should havebeen in utilizing the open endedness of the program. That reallypulled the rug out from under us on our Cal-Med program. which I think, if we had been allowed to develop it, would have provided abetter cap to the costs of this program than is provided by the ratherarbitrary action of simply saying, \"This is the flat dollar a-iountthat we will support.\"630 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS I think a program which is devised to meet a particular social need ought not to be largely altered, as I think this was-the possibility of the program being developed was-by the capping of a flat dollar amount which had to significantly cut into the purposes of the program. Senator RANDoLpH. Are you specifically referring to the 1966 social security cutback? Air. UNRUH. I think in 1967. The Mills amendment, as I recall. Senator RANDOLPH. The medicaid cutbacks? Mir. UNR-UH. It was the Long amendment, I believe. Senator RANDOLPH. Well, of course the Long amendment has not become law. Mir. UNRuH. I am not talking about the- Senator RANDOLPH. MIr. Oriol, let's have an explanation. Mr. OlioL. Well, there were two Long amendments, so-called be- cause they were introduced by Senator Russell Long. That of 1968, which did not become law, and that of 1967, which did. You were referring to the 1967? Mr. UNRUH. Yes. The 1967; that's right. Senator RANDOLPH. And what was thiat amendment? Mr. UN-RuH. That was the amendment which said that the income of a person receiving this could not exceed 11/3 times the AFDC limits. Senator RANDOLPH. You recognize that the Congress was faced, Mir. Speaker, with, let's say, a cost squeeze. And not on one program, but across the board, and I am not attempting to argue the point, but would you agree with me that once this situation in the Congress- Mr. UNRuH. Well, I am not in a position to argue with you, Senator. You know the facts better than I do, but I am inclined to believe in a system of alternatives that this ought to have had considerably more value than other things that Congress did spend money on. I am not prepared to argue that. It may serve little purpose. In fact it has been done. I think the net result of that was to drastically cut back the quality of medical care in the State of New York, and to hobble innovation in the State of California which might have provided a considerably better health care program, and even at somewhat less cost, had we been allowed to develop a program as we thought we were being invited to do by the Congress, the year before. Senator RANDOLPH. I think that is a valid statement; that there was encouragement given. I just wanted it to be on the record, because West Virginia is one of those States-38 in number-that have had the necessary implementing legislation on medicaid, as California, of course. Mir. Speaker, would you turn to page 4. You have underscored a statement here-a situation in California. You used language, let's say, which is very understandable-I would say it is strong language-you speak about the undermining of the medical care program to the people of California. Now, where does California stand in this list of States-percentage- wise ? Of course, New York-very liberal. Arkansas-very conservative.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 631 Mr. UNRUR. Well, I don't have that in front of me at this point,but as I remember, the cap on our program, as far as income is con-cerned, was far, far below that of New York, and considerably belowthat of several other States. How many, I do not know.Senator RANDOLPH. Mr. Speaker- Mr. UNRUH. Our cap on income is $3,800-in the State of California.New York was $6,000. I think there are two or three other Stateswith a- Senator WILLInAs. Notwithstanding the size of the family?Mr. UNRUH. A family of four-which is the usual family.Let me sag that is one of the tragedies of not being able -to developthe Cal-Me program, because we felt that quite clearly, $3,800 isnot a very wildly irresponsible figure insofar as the cap is concerned.It is clear that any little extra jiggle in the health pattern of a familyis going to upset that. Those people with more income ought not to be thrown into thepoverty level by an unforeseen health consequence. That is the kindof a program we were trying to develop here so that we could helpthose people above that level with unforeseen costs.Senator RANDOLPH. This would not be in the category of the agedalone, but would go across the board, even including 'the middleaged;is that correct? Mr. UN-RUH. That is correct. That program would have covered, ineffect, virtually everyone in the State. PHYSICIANS' INCoME FROM MEDI-CAL Senator RANDOLPH. Mr. Speaker, a final observation, and perhapsa couple of other observations. Would you turn, please, 'to page 8. The percentage, Mr. Speaker, ofthese, let's say, unethical physicians-members of the medical profes-sion-that you had spotlighted here by your use of the figure 1,000.How many persons are involved in administering that program inthe State of California? Mr. UNTRum. I don't believe I could-are you talking about thedoctors that are- Senator RANDOLPH. The Medi-Cal patients.Senator WILLIAMS. Patients, or doctors?Senator RANDOLPH. No, the doctors that administer the program.Mr. UNRUH. Somewhere between 2,200 and 2,400 doctors.Senator RANDOLPH. You mean that when you say 1,000, you arespeaking of, let's say, 80 or 60 percent-50 percent?Mr. UNRUH. Forty percent-roughly 40 percent of the doctorswould be making that figure.That is a, gross figure, Senator, I would hasten to add.Senator WILLIAMS. That does not include the expense of medicinesand nurses? Mr. UNRUH. No. Mr. MANLEY. May I add-something here?Mr. UNRU'H. Yes, Mr. Manley would like to632 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Mr. MANLEY. I am informed, Senator, that there are approximately 25,000 doctors who participate in some fashion, in some small or large fashion, in the Medi-Cal program. However, there are only about 2,000 of them who participate in a large way in the program. So what we are saying here is about half of those doctors in the last fiscal year did gross $70,000 a year. Mr. UNRUH. From the program. Senator RANDOLPH. Thank you, Mir. Manley. Mr. Speaker, now let's take the 40-percent-figure, and let's think in terms of the gross income. I would like to ask you if those members of the medical profession are using, let's say, a major portion of. their time-70, 80, 90 percent- on this program, or are they practicing other medicine? Is this the major proportion of their income, or is it only 20 or 30 percent of their income? Mr. UNRUH. I think, Senator, probably that this constitutes a major portion of their income. In some cases it may constitute vir- tually all of it. The only thing that I would add to that is that our indication is that exceeds the average income of those doctors who are not prac- ticing in that field. Senator RANDOLPH. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and Mr. Manley. Mr. Chairman, I think we might perhaps through staff research go into this matter. It reflects itself not only in this State, but I think we might study it more carefully in other States as well. I am not attempting to- Mr. UNRUH. There are other cases, but I did not list or go into them in depth because they are sensationalizing-pointing to the practices of some individual doctors which are part of the attorney general's investigation in this State,* which is supposed to be out, I believe, the first of next week-so far as the results of that are concerned. But we would be very happy to communicate that to the committee. Senator RANDOLPH. Thank you very much, MIr. Speaker. Senator WILLIAMS. A most helpful statement, Mr. Speaker, and the part that you did not read, as we said, will be included in the record. I agree with Senator Randolph that further study is indicated along many lines that you discussed. We will go off the record for a moment now. (Discussion off the record.) Senator WILLIAMS. On the record. Mr. UNRUH. Thank you very much. I appreciate the oppor- tunity to come before you. It is a very great problem, and I appreciate the opportunity to lay it before you. Senator WILLIAMS. Thank you very much. (Subsequent to the hearing, Senator Williams asked the following questions in a letter to Mr. Unruh:) 1. You will remember that there was some discussion of Governor Reagan's proposals to \"cut out a block of recipients totally and completely.\" Mr. Manley gave as an example the \"medically Indigent,\" a group of some 600,000 individuals. May we have additional details on this proposal and other proposed cutbacks? 2. You noted that \"ethical, reputable doctors ...are doing their dead level best\" to arrive at some kind of fee schedule that could be employed in Medi-Cal. Have you additional information on this point? *Letter and report from California office of attorney general. see app. 3. pp. 811-836.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 633 3. May we have additional details on your comment that the relative's respon-hility section of Title 19 has made it \"financially easy for children to place theirparents in nursing homes?\"4. MIr. Carel Mulder of the California Department of Health Care Services, saidlater in the day in regard to a fee schedule under Medi-Cal: \"the physicians whocustomarily charge below the average will immediately move up to the average,and that physicians who customarily charge above the average will becomedisinclined to participate in the program, if it doesn't provide them with theirusual fees.\" We would like to have your reply to this statement. (the fulltext of Mlr. Mlulder's testimony is enclosed, for whatever additional commentaryyou may wish to make. We are also sending to Mr. Mulder a transcript of yourremarks.) 5. Your discussion of the CAL-MIED proposal prompts three questions:a. How would CAL-MlED mesh with the Federal Medicare coverage?b. Is it fair to assume that more emphasis could be placed upon health main-tenance, or preventive medicine, than is now the case-particularly among peo-ple from age 45 and up, when such health practices and services can yieldmaximum benefits? c. Your testimony mentions several private organizations that offer compre-hensive health services on a prepaid basis. Would such organizations have thecapacity to provide the services called for by CAL-MED? What incentives couldbe offered for organizing personnel into similar organizations? Could Federalresources be helpful here? (The following reply was received.) ASSEMBLY CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE, Sacramento, Calif., November 22, 1968. DEAR SENATOR WILLIAMS: In response to your request of November 7 that Iamplify on remarks I made before your U.S. Senate Committee in Los Angelesearlier this fall, I am enclosing answers to each question you posed. In addition, Iam forwarding to you a copy of a report of the California Attorney General onour Medi-Cal program operated under Title 19.* This report was the one I alludedto in my testimony which had not then been published. It contains several illustra-tions of fraud current in our program, plus a wealth of other material andsuggestions for improved administration. Since the report is perhaps the first ofits kind to be attempted by any state operating a Title 19 program, you may wishto include it in your Committee's hearing record.Suffice it to say that the Attorney General's report completely bears out mycomments that some physicians and other providers of health care services inCalifornia are making exhorbitant and unjustified profits from the Medi-Calprogram. I hope this material is of use to you. If there is anything additional I can pro-vide to assist your Committee please do not hestitate to let me know.Sincerely, JESSE M. UNRUH, Speaker of the Assembly.[Enclosure] 1. The correct number of medically indigent who would have been cut byGovernor Reagan was 160.000, not 600,000. These are persons who are not quite aspoor as those who are public assistance recipients and in the original Medi-Callegislation were given a lower priority for services and continuation in the pro-gram. The Governor could have legally eliminated these persons from the programand threatened to do so unless the Legislature changed the Medi-Cal law. Thisthreat was not considered seriously by the Legislature since the result wouldhave been greatly increased county costs because the counties would have had tocare for these persons. The other proposed cutbacks by the Governor would have eliminated most ofthe non-required services except most drugs, emergency dental care and homehealth care. These were ruled illegal by the State Supreme Court. Other so-calledcutbacks included a limitation of length of stay in private hospitals to eight daysand a roll back of physician fees to the sixtieth (60) percentile of usual andcustomary fees. The latter program modifications are still in effect. *See app. 3, p. 811.634 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 2. Many physicians in California are not unequivocally tied to the concept of usual and customary fees which has been so vigorously advanced by the California Medical Association. A particular problem has been encountered by physicians in and around the Watts area of Los Angeles with whom I have discussed the problem. Because of the low economic status of their patients, the usual fee of these physicians has been relatively low. Thus the usual and customary concept, at least theoretically, requires that they receive the same low fee for Medi-Cal patients. This has a depressing effect in these areas, especially when physicians from other nearby areas receive higher fees for the same services. These phy- sicians feel that payment should be on a reasonable basis for the service rendered and should not depend as much upon the desires of the individual physican regarding the fee he wishes to receive. 3. Title 19 does not allow states to require that children assume any responsi- bility for their parents. There are good reasons for this provision, but I merely wished to point out that it also has adverse effects. In California, under old age assistance, there is relative's responsibility. Thus if the children wish to keep the parent in their home or place him in a board and care facility, they must share in the cost. However, if the parent is placed in a nursing home under Medi-Cal there is no responsibility at all. This leads to inevitable pressures for placement in nursing homes which are the most expensive alternative. What I was proposing is that we develop a more flexible approach so that the least ex- pensive alternative does not place a greater burden upon the responsible relatives. 4. The statement by Mr. Mulder appears to have a certain amount of validity. However, there is no evidence that physicians can't or won't raise their fees under the usual and customary concept; in fact, all the evidence would appear to be the contrary. It should also be noted that even now the state does not really know if the charge a physician makes to Medi-Cal is his \"usual\" charge. The best that is known is whether it falls within a range of fees which is \"customary\" in the community. The observation that some physicians will be disinclined to participate under a fee schedule is undoubtedly true. We know that some do not participate today under the usual and customary concept at the sixtieth (60) percentile. The real question that Medi-Cal should ask is: What fee should we pay in order to get an adequate number of physicians to participate. I do not believe that question has really been asked. His answer should be the basis for establishing a fee. 5. (a) CAL-MED would provide supplementary coverage to Medicare depend- ing upon the income and family size of the person involved. (b) It would certainly be desirable for more emphasis to be placed upon health maintenance or preventive medicine, but I am not sure that such an approach would occur automatically under CAL-MED which is essentially a funding mech- anism. However, to the extent that prepayment organizations accept the re- sponsibility for providing comprehensive services to persons, it is hoped that they would develop such approaches as a means of reducing ultimate costs. (c) Existing prepayment organizations would probably not have the capacity to provide CAL-MED coverage to all eligible persons. The incentive for organization will most likely be created by the demand for these services. This will occur, if it does, because of the lower cost in providing services. CAL-MED will operate on a competitive basis and only those organizations which can provide quality services at a reasonable cost will survive and grow. Senator WILLIAmS. Congressman Reinecke has a time problem. Is Congressman Reinecke still here? Do you want to submit a statement? STATEMENT OF HON. ED REINECKE, REPRESENTATIVE IN CON- GRESS, 27TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, CALIFORNIA Mr. REIN-ECKE. Yes, Senators. I would ask the inclusion of a state- ment I have already delivered to the Secretary. I would just like to express my ap preciation for the care and time that you gentlemen are taking away from your schedules, when I am sure you have other requirements at this time of the year. We appreciate that you would be here to concern yourselves about the health services for our citizens here in California.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 635 Senator WILLIAMs. Well, we appreciate your time. I know we areworking in a common purpose. Mr. Reinecke. We are indeed. (The complete statement of Congressman Reinecke follows:) PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE ED REINECKE, REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS, 27TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, CALIFORNIA Mr. Chairman, I am deeply gratified to appear here today, and I welcome thisopportunity to be able to participate in these Hearings. The fine work of thisSubcommittee in probing the causes of the increase in the costs of health serviceshas been widely recognized. Your impartial examination of present organizationof services and present patterns of practice have shown that both human andfinancial resources are being wasted. Your investigations have also yieldedvaluable information as to how the deficiencies in our health services may becorrected so that public confidence in the programs of Medicare and Medicaidmay be restored. I am pleased to be able to participate in these proceedings notonly because of my deep interest in the subject, but also because of my long-standing concern for the well-being of those who have contributed so much to thegrowth of this Nation. We cannot afford to turn our backs on those of ourelders, whether through no fault of their own, are no longer able to providefor themselves or whether they are able, at sacrifice, to pay their bills. Testimonygiven at previous hearings in Washington, D.C. and in New York City, certainlymade this point clear. Hopefully, the hearings here in Los Angeles will proveequally valuable. Los Angeles is a particularly appropriate place in which to continue yourinquiry. Like any large city, it has its quota of problems. But it also has morethan its quota of intelligent and innovative leaders and institutions. Their ex-perience in dealing with the costs and delivery of health services in this area,will no doubt provide valuable lessons for the rest of the Nation. EFFECT OF RISING COSTS ON MEDICARE PROGRAM Mr. Chairman, perhaps the most important problem confronting Congress withrespect to the medicare program is the effect that raising costs have had onthe program and the older people it is designed to protect. As you will recall,last year Congress had to increase the payroll taxes which support the hospitalinsurance part of medicare, known as Part A, by more than one billion dollarsa year-just to meet the increasing cost of hospital care. And I want to em-phasize that this increase was not the result of greater use of hospitals by olderpeople-it was solely the result of the increase in the costs of hospital care.The American Hospital Association announced earlier this year that hospitalcosts will probably go up by 15% a year for at least three years. It is fortunateindeed that actual increases have not yet reached this level, but there is goodchance that the AHA assessment may still prove correct. If Congress had beenable to spend even half of the billion dollars for increased health benefits underthe program, significant improvements affording additional protection to theelderly could have been made. Instead all of the increased taxes had to go forthe higher costs of the existing program. In fact, the benefits under Part Awere even slightly reduced. As you know, Mr. Chairman, the premiums under the medical insurance partof medicare-the so-called Part B-had to be increased by one-third, from$3 each for the aged person and the government, to $4 each. This increase wascaused largely by the fact that physicians' fees rose very rapidly during theyear after the medicare program was enacted. Though earlier this year theaged were given a modest and much needed increase to their cash benefits, agood part of that increase had to be paid out for increased premiums. EFFECT ON MEDI-CAL The increase in the costs of health care dramatically affected the medicaidprogram here in California, known as Medi-Cal. The Department of Health,Education, and Welfare estimated last December that the Federal share of themedicaid program for this fiscal year would be a little over $1.5 billion. Theestimate now for this year is one billion dollars more! While not all of this636 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS change can be ascribed to increases in health care costs, probably a third of it can be so attributed. Thus, Mr. Chairman, Congress is already painfully aware of the effect which increasing health costs have had on Federal programs designed to assist the aged in financing their health costs. The effect of these increasing costs has been to bar countless numbers of older people from seeking the care they need under Medicare. This recently announced increase in the deductible under Part A of medicare from $40 to $44 is a straw in the wind-a sure sign that hospital costs will continue to rise. Next year the deductible may even go as high as $52, because of still higher hospital costs. The question of just when a deductible becomes a barrier to ob- taining medical care is a question which cries out for an answer. I hope that the testimony before this committee will show, in more detail than is now avail- able to us, the effects of the medicare deductibles and co-insurance provisions on the health of older people. Those of us in Congress need to spur our efforts and the efforts of others to take the steps necessary to stem the swelling tide of increasing health costs. This is the bitterest form that inflation can take for our older citizens. Neither the Nation as a whole nor its older citizens as a group can bear indefinitely the, increasingly heavy burden inflicted by the runaway inflation of health costs. The problem of rising medical costs is a compelling aspect of the most serious of all the problems facing older Americans-that of achieving and maintaining an adequate income. The massive loss of real income through inflation must be recognized for what it is: the Number One economic public enemy in this Nation today. Americans who have reached the age of 65 now number almost 20 million. By 1980 there will be approximately 25 million in this age group. With such a rapidly growing aging population, we will be faced continually with the neces- sity to deal with new problems as they arise. To deal effectively with new prob- lems. whatever they may be, we must first solve the most basic of them all-the economic problem. ECONOMIC PLIGHT OF THE ELDERLY The bills that I have introduced during the 90th Congress seek to relieve the economic plight in which so many older people live, while yet preserving their independence and sense of dignity. To strive for one goal without the other would be shabby treatment indeed for all those who fought and survived two world wars, who weathered the great depression, and who have borne the brunt of entry into the atomic age. It is a matter of plain justice for this Nation to help protect its older citizens against the skyrocketing cost of living-amounting to nearly 20 percent in the last eight years alone. Periodic increases in social security benefit levels will not suffice of themselves. For no matter how great the benefit increases are, they always lag behind the increase in prices. Nearly all of us are hurt by inflation; but no single group suffers more than older Americans. One obvious way to protect the elderly is to provide an automatic cost-of-living increase in Social Security benefits every calendar quarter, to ad- just benefits according to rises in the Consumer Price Index. H.R. 5347, which I introduced in February of last year, would do just that. There are other ways in which the economic situation of older Americans can be protected, and I have introduced several measures accordingly. H.R. 5158, for example, would amend title II of the Social Security Act to increase the benefits of a surviving widow to 100% of her husband's allowance. EARNINGS LIMITATION CAUSES PROBLEMs There is also injustice in the regulation that a Social Security recipient must keep his earnings below a certain level, or otherwise lose his benefits. I think that the limitation on allowable earnings should first be raised and then even- tually done away with altogether. As a first step in this direction, I introduced H.R. 5157, which would permit those receiving Social Security to earn as much as $3.000 annually instead of the present $1,680 before their benefits are diminished. From even the briefest review of the problems facing the majority of older Americans, we can see that new legislation to protect and assist them is es- sential. But legislation can only be as good as the architects who draft it. We must be sure that these architects are the best informed people available. TheyCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 637 must have a thorough knowledge and understanding of the complexities of agingin the modern world. It is essential that we pause from time to time, to take stock of present pro-grams and policies concerning the elderly, and to consider what directions ourfuture efforts should take. The 1961 White House Conference on Aging is widelyrecognized for the vital role it played in stimulating significant new programsfor older Americans. I am confident that the 1971 White House Conference wvillprove equally fruitful.In summary then-we have a problem today-we will have a larger onetomorrow. Our attention today must be to reducing costs. Law generated re-quirements (red tape) must be reviewed and reduced. Private industry handlescredit at a profit-so government could well learn from private industry.Second, let us ask the Medical Profession for its recommendations for imple-menting the law without comprising quality or quantity of health services.And finally let's ask the Hospital to recommend solutions to reducing costs.Legislation, subsidies, and political polemics are not the sole solution.Thank you for your interest. Mr. REIN-ECKE. Rather than to summarize what is in the statement,because it is already in the statement-I would simply say that we hopeit is recognized that the law alone will not solve the problems. We needa great deal of cooperation from the citizens, from the State andcounty governments, from the medical profession, and the hospitalpeople. I would hope that we could recognize, too, that perhaps a reductionin some of our own paper work that we have generated through ourlegislation-and I supported medicare when it came on the floor a fewyears ago, so I do support this program-but I recognize also the fi-nancial risk and the problems that have developed since that time.It was not my intention to make any political comments, but in viewof some of the statements that have been made by the previous witness,and in view of the fact that you gentlemen are vitally interested ingetting an objective story, and further, in view of the Senator fromWest Virginia's statement that some of Mr. Unruh's statements calledfor further study, I would hope that part of that further study wouldcome from a rebuttal statement from our own Governor's office.I sincerely question several statements made-but I do not want toget involved in a political debate-it is unfortunate that politicsdoes get into health problems. Certainly that is no place for it, but it ishere, and you just heard it a few minutes ago.I would hope very sincerely that you would submit Mr. Unruh'sstatement to the Governor's office'I and ask him for his comments,so that you, in your judgment, could find from that the statementsthat would affect the future legislation of our country.Gentlemen, I won't take any further time. I am most grateful toyou, and happy that you did find a good day here in Los Angeles.And I say thank you, again.Senator WILLIAMS. Well, I have just conferred with Senator Ran-dolph. We feel that it would be appropriate to do exactly what youJust suggested. Mr. REINECKE. I thank you kindly, Senator. Thank you also forallowing me to appear here out of order.Senator WILLIAMS. Of course we do have the Governor's representa-tives here, but we certainly will give the Governor an opportunityto submit a statement. I Statement by representatives of the Governor appears on p. 675. 24-798-69-pt. 3-3638 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Senator RANnoLPH. What is your district? Mr. REINmcKE. Twenty-seventh Congressional District. It is part of Los Angeles. Most of the constituents do live in Los Angeles, or Los Los Angeles County. We have about 50,000 up in Kern County. Senator WILLIAMS. The metropolitan area? Mr. REINECKE. Yes, metropolitan. Many senior citizens projects are very much concerned. I have sponsored a great deal of legislation concerning benefits that are necessary to allow our senior citizens to remain their prideful selves and productive citizens of our community. Senator WILLIAM:S. Thank you very much. What term are you in, by the way? Mr. REINECKE. This is my third term-coming up. Senator WILLIAMS. Confidence will get you everywhere. Who is next here? Dr. Lester Breslow. Where is Professor Breslow? There he is- from the UCLA health services. STATEMENT OF LESTER BRESLOW, M.D., M.P.H., PROFESSOR OF HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT LOS ANGELES Dr. BRESLOW. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I am pleased to have this opportunity of appearing before you to discuss a subject of great consequence to the American people. I am conscious of the fact that your committee has already covered a good deal of the subject in previous hearings, so I will confine my remarks to three points: (1) Are the medicare and medicaid programs raising or lowering the quality of health care? (2) What can the Federal Government do to favor higher quality of care? (3) Can and should preventive medicine in the form of multiphasic screening be incorporated into federally supported health care? One must carefully differentiate medicare and medicaid in consid- ering their impact on quality because they have had opposite effects. Part A of medicare, because the legislation specifically provided for it, has tended to raise the quality of hospital and related care. The legislative requirements of standards for hospitals, utilization review, agreements between hospitals and extended care facilities, standards for home care agencies, have encouraged nationwide atten- tion to the problems of quality of care. The impact of part A of medicare on the quality of institutional health services in this country has been favorable. It has been good not only for older persons but for the entire population receiving hospital and related care. IMPAOT OF MEDICAID Medicaid on the other hand, the welfare medical care program, has tended to bolster the poorest kind of medical care. This has oc- curred because the basic legislation gave no attention to the matter of quality. Contrary to the medicare legislation which established a framework for quality standards, especially in part A, the medicaid legislation ignored this critical problem.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 639 State and local welfare administrators have tended to purchaseand pay for more of the same kind of care that poor people were ob-taining previously. The personnel and facilities in neighborhoodswhere poor people obtained care were often inferior and, most im-portant, medicaid offered no inducement to improve. It simply finan-cially supported what was present.In some parts of the country, particularly in California, those re-sponsible for medicaid (or Medi-Cal, as we call it) have endeavoredto link it up with the quality standards of medicare. To the extentthat -this has been possible medicaid patients have benefited from themedicare standards. On the second question, what can the Federal Government do toimprove the quality of health care, I would suggest three approaches.The first is to incorporate into all Federal medical care programs alegislative framework for establishing standards of quality, such aswas done in the medicare. Second, the Federal Government should assure payment of reason-able amounts for the services provided. It should not leave such deter-minations, as in the case of medicaid, to local officials who do not ap-preciate the fact that in health care, as elsewhere, you usually getsecond-rate service-or worse-if you try to get by cheaply.Senator RANDOLPH. Could I interrupt at that point, without break-ing your continuity? Now, does your statement lend itself to an opposing or an agreeingviewpoint with that of Speaker Unruh? Dr. BRESLOW. Well, he made a number of statements.Senator RANDOLPH. Well, I mean on the matter of cost.Dr. BRESLow. The point that I would emphasize with respect to thefee issue that was raised by Speaker Unruh, is this: Much more im-portant than the question of whether you pay $1 or $2 for an injec-tion, or whether you pay $200 or $400 for the appendectomy is thequestion of whether you needed the injection or the operation in thefirst place. I believe that a tremendous amount of the waste in medi-caid results from a failure to take into account that aspect of theproblem. So I must direct attention to the question of the quality of care. Toprovide the care that is needed when it is needed, rather than the issueof fees. I think, really,' that fees are a secondary issue although they haveattracted the greatest attention. Senator RANDOLPH. Thank you, doctor. NEED FOR DATA ON QUALITY OF SERVICE Dr. BREsLow. Further, I believe the Federal Government shouldinsist that its programs include a health data system that routinelyturns out information on the quality of the service being provided.This is now possible through computer technology. Senator WILLIAMS. I as sure you are right on your conclusion, butI am sure a fellow whose discipline is not medicine-not technology-who practices the inexpert profession of law and politics, I wonderjust how would this help a doctor in his office?Dr. BREsLow. The State department of public health, in the earlydays of Medi-CaI, developed just such a system which disclosed partic-640 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS ular physicians and other providers of care who were \"way out\" in their practices. For example-and these are only crude examples-some physicians gave far more injections or did far more operations of certain types than usual in a community. Now, to answer your question a little more fully-this system identifies and puts onto computer tape every service provided to every patient in medicaid, giving the place of the service, the name of the provider, the patient, the charge for the service. Running out tables from such data, one can therefore identify individual physicians who, for example, give on the average more than one inj ection per patient visit. Senator WILLIAMS. They have to feed that data in it? Dr. BRESLOW. They have to feed that data in, because they must submit bills in order to collect payment for their services. What this system does is to take advantage of bill submission in order to examine, not only the issue of the fees, which can also be done of course, but also to examine the issue of quality. The system permits identification of physicians and other pro- viders-not a few, there are several score of them-who have far ex- ceeded the norms of practice. One can identify physicians, for example, who do a great many operations for umbilical hernia on infants, which in most physicians' judgment can usually be treated effectively without the operations. Senator WILLIAMS. By the way, this idea-who would be the re- cipient of this bank of information ? Dr. BREsLow. In the early days of Medi-Cal, the information came to the State agencies, in those days to the State department of public health, which developed and maintained the State observation over the system. It also, of course, was in the hands of the bill-paying agency-the fiscal intermediary, Blue Shield. Now, the State, I understand, has abandoned its direct surveillance of this operation, and has left it entirely up to California Blue Shield. Senator WILLIAMS. Well, you used to be in State government? Dr. BREsLow. Yes, that's correct. Senator WILLIAMS. You are no longer? Dr. BREsLow. No, except I am in the State university. Senator WILLIAMS. Why didn't you stay? Dr. BRESLOW. Well, sir, in California the director of the State de- partment of public health, which was the position I occupied just before leaving, is an office for a term which expires 1 year after the coming in of any new administration. That's when my time expired. Senator WILLIAMS. I think I get the point you make. Dr. BRESLOW. California Blue Shield has taken over this system. I believe, senator, it would be useful for your committee to explore this system in some detail with a view to incorporating some such system into all medical care programs that are supported by Federal funds. It certainly would be a vast improvement over the situation in many States where there is no statewide medicaid data, even on the eligible population or on the services provided.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 641 Information on each of the individuals served and each of the serv- ices provided them, as in the California plan, could become the basisfor quality control. Senator WILLIANES. Would the doctors welcome this opportunity to contribute their information? Dr. BRESLOWV. There are probably some physicians who resent thefact that they are, so to speak, locked into such a system, but I thinkit is to the credit of the California Medical Association, and California Blue Shield, that they have supported this system. I think there might be some debate about the vigor with which there is pursuit of the so-called deviant practitioners. But there is no doubt about the overwhelming support of the medical profession, in Cali- fornia, for a system like this. PREVENTVE MEDICINE; MULTIPHASIC SCREENING On the last item, in which I know I share a considerable interestwith you, Senator Williams, namely the incorporation of preventive medicine in the form of multiphasic screening into Federal health programs, I would say that this is desirable and feasible. It is technically and economically possible, as well as medically use-ful to detect evidence of many significant diseases by a series of simpletests, now largely automated or performed by technicians under medi- cal direction. When these diseases such as diabetes, certain forms ofheart disease and cancer, anemia, and many others are detected intheir early stages, the outlook for success in treatment is much more favorable than if they are allowed to progress into advanced stages.In fact, the difference not infrequently is life or death. Such tests are now often incorporated into comprehensive healthexaminations for industry executives. The American Medical Asso- ciation for several years has offered them to physicians attending theirannual convention. The Kaiser health plan in northern California provides them. A joint labor-management trust fund in the Californiacannery industry has made them available through a mobile unit to thousands of cannery employees scattered throughout the State. Several hospitals are now planning to install multiphasic screening. I think that if it is good for all of these segments of society forphysicians, for industry, for executives, for cannery workers andothers then it has been tested well enough now to be able to say thatit would be good for all the people. Providing this service as part of Federal health programs would be a major contribution to improving health, especially for older per- sons who are more likely than younger persons to be affected by the chronic diseases that may be detected through multiphasic screening. It would be a positive contribution to health. The success and growing acceptance of multiphasic screening makeit timely for consideration of incorporation into Federal health programs. Senator WILLIAMS. Are you familiar with the Kaiser program? Dr. BRESLOW. Kaiser health plan is the name for the plan, I think.Senator WILLIAtMS. Are you familiar with how the-I talked about multiphasic screening. Someone, I don't know who it was, maybe it642 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS was Bill Oriol, my trusted leader of the staff-who had tabbed it \"preventicare.\" I have talked about the Kaiser-they were pioneers, I believe Dr. BRESLOW. Right. Senator WILLIAMS. I have talked about them a great deal and said that this is proof that it can work. An early incipient disease can be detected. And the earlier it is detected, the more likely we are to avoid costly treatment or surgery. Now, how do they work? Who are the people who come in there to get tested? KAISER HEALTH PLAN Dr. BRESLOW. In the Kaiser health plan-and I think it would be well if you had an opportunity, Senator, to actually visit the installa- tion and see for yourself what is being done there-the subscribers to the Kaiser health plan-that is, the individuals who are prepaid through their unions or employers or themselves-for health care Senator WILLIAMS. It is an in-house operation, is it? Dr. BRESLOW. That is correct. These subscribers are eligible for examinations by physicians once a year, or oftener if necessary. A week or two before they see their own physician, they are scheduled to come in and have a series of tests called multiphasic screening. When the physician sees the patient for the examination, he receives a brief history of the patient with the symptoms that the patient has written down ahead of time, and also the results from a quite wide array of laboratory, X-ray, and other tests. The physician can see these results when he first visits with the patient. That means that he has a tremendous leap ahead in his examination. He doesn't have to order the tests of a routine sort that are included in multiphasic screening. He has the results when he first sees the patient. He, of course, can and does follow up these screening tests with more elaborate examinations, X-ray, laboratory and others. This is the way it works in the Kaiser health plan. They found a great economy as well as medical use for it. Senator WITLIAAMS. So it is a two-phase operation. The employee goes to the doctor, and then the doctor makes findings, and the next step would be the whole Kaiser program; is that it? Dr. BRESLOW. The basis for the diagnosis and treatment plan is this survey which can be carried out now quite effectively through these series of tests organized, as has been done in the Kaiser health plan and in manv other situations as well. Senator WILLIAMS. I didn't know that there were two phases, to tell you the truth. Dr. BRESLOW. Many of us feel that this is the best way to provide this service. You go first for the screening tests, provided incidentally at offhours, evenings, and so on, so as to make it more convenient for patients. This also uses their equipment most effectively. Then the results are assembled by computer and given back to the physician at what you call the second phase, when he has an appoint- ment to see the physician. Now, multiphasic screening itself is of course just a series of tests, with results and the referral. All of this is of no value unless it is fol- lowed up by the patient's physician.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 643 Senator WILLIAMS. Why does he have to go through the screening process with the physician? Why not just go right into the multi- phase operation? Isn't that supposed to determine Dr. BRESLOW. Well, he does go directly into the multiphasic screening. Senator WILLIAmS. I understand he went to a doctor first. Dr. BRESLOW. I am sorry if I gave that impression. He has the appointment with the physician scheduled, but before he sees the physi- cian-a week or two before-he has the multiphasic screening. Senator WILLIAMS. So the first phase is the Dr. BRESLOW. The multiphasic screening. Senator WILLIAMS. I understand. Dr. BRESLOW. I am sorry if I didn't make that clear. Senator WILLIAMS. I am sorry I misunderstood that. Dr. BRESLOW. The point is the findings from the multiphasic screen- ing are referred to the physician. Senator WILLIAMS. That I understand. Would you recommend that as a national program? Dr. BRESLOW. Yes, I would. EXPERIENCE Jus1rIms NATIONAL PROGRAM Senator WILLIAMS. By the Federal Government? Dr. BRESLOW. I would; I would recommend that as a national program. I think we have had sufficient experience with it in different forms, different places, different circumstances, that it is certainly justifiable as a national program. It is something like the situation with respect to home care, a few years ago. There were some demonstrations of home care. There were some questions as to how useful it might be, whether it should be in- corporated into a national program. When the issue arose about incor- porating home care into medicare, some asked whether we had suffi- cient experience with it, whether there were sufficient resources for home care available to justify putting it into medicare. Many of us, at that time, took the same position that I would take now with respect to that multiphasic screening. We have had suffi- cient experience with it. It is sufficiently well known in the medical community that, if the Federal government were to incorporate it into a national program, then it would expand with the impetus of the funds available to pay for it. Senator WILLIAMS. Are there any dissenters on that point? Any dissenters? Mr. CuEBLER. As a matter of fact, it would be required for children after July 1, 1969, as a result of the 1967 amendments. As long as it is used only for the purpose of identifying diseases in order to treat them, rather than excluding them from the program, it is a very, very good idea, sir. Senator WILLiAMS. Will you identify yourself for our record? Mr. CuBBLER. Charles Cubbler, C-u-b-b-l-e-r. Senator WILLTAMS. Dr. Breslow, you don't look as healthy as the last time we worked together on arbitrary labor. I don't think you have been taking enough grapes. [Laughter.]644 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Dr. BRESLOW. We use grapes for a lot of things in California. I recall one time studying the problem of quackery in the treatment of cancer. We found that grapes were being offered as a cure for cancer, and action had to be taken against the individual who was advocating and offering that particular form of treatment. I am sorry that my voice is hoarse. Senator WILLIAMS. No, I was only kidding you about that. It hurt me when grapes were being served on the plane coming out, and they looked so good. But they were the forbidden fruit, because of the current boycott. I wish we could get that all straightened out-but that's another matter entirely-bringing order, harmony, and agreement in the farm labor situation. Dr. BRESLOW. The progress that you and others in the Senate and the Congress have made with respect to health services for farm work- ers, migratory workers, has been quite important in bringing to the attention of the whole body politic the situation of farmworkers in California and elsewhere. I think it is generally true that health services, as supported by government in such situations as the migratory labor camps are more widely accepted than some other approaches to the problem. I hope that you will continue to pursue your interest in that matter of assuring that at least minimum health services are brought to people in that situation. Senator WILLIAMS. Well, that isn't germane to our discussion, but I am glad you made the statement. The last time we were out here talking about migratory workers we had Senator Bob Kennedy with us, and he certainly made an impact upon the farm community. Senator RANDOLPH. Mr. Chairman, at that point I do want to mention, and I do want the record to indicate that as you had this colloquy with the doctor, that President Johnson yesterday signed the Medical Services Act of 1968, and as you well know, there is a provision in that act for medical care for the migrants of this Nation. That is a part of the complex, overall program, which has been enacted into law. I don't want to be pollyanaish at this point, but I want the record to reflect that the Congress of the United States has perhaps made errors and committed mistakes, but that the recent Congresses have been most energetic and effective in moving forward the programs of health in the United States of America. I don't want to attempt to be partisan whatsoever, but I do think that the record is one which is very clear, very understandable, to those who will study what we have been doing. We may have retraced our steps: at times, for reasons, but just this one act alone, doctor, and Mr. Chairman, passed by this Congress and signed into law yesterday, it is a notable, a significant advance in program for the persons who need the medical care. I compliment our chairman and this committee who have done so very much in our Subcommittee on Migratory Labor, and the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. But you know, I think it is necessary these days to sometimes speak in praise of something-and not constantly to be negative. There are mistakes made and errors committed, and programs that are short-COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 645 changed, but I for one want to keep in balance the good with what Icalled the bad. [Applause.] Senator WILLIAMS. I wish that the reporter would record that therewas applause at that point. Dr. BRESLOW. Senator, I would like, if we have just a minute, to goback to a question that was raised with respect to testimony that anearlier speaker gave on the Medi-Cal program. MEDI-CAL BUDGET CONTROVERSY I am not sure that I fully and directly answered the question con-cerning the estimates of cost of the Medi-Cal program. During its firstyear in office the Reagan administration publicized such wild estimatesof the cost of Medi-Cal that it seems the distortion of statistics couldhave only been either malicious or based upon gross ignorance. The allegations that Medi-Cal would bankrupt the State apparentlywere designed to frighten taxpayers. Such allegations certainly hadthe effect of seriously disrupting the program by forcing cutbacksunder the threat of runaway costs. In fact, the original estimates of Medi-Cal costs and budgeted forthe March 1966 to June 1967 period were very close to actual expendi-tures for that period. In the subsequent year-the one just ended inJune 1968-expenditures were way under the conservative budgetthat was prepared under the fanfare of headlines about runaway costs. Senator WILLIAMS. Very good. Thank you very much.Dr. BREsLow. Thank you, Senator. (Subsequent to the hearing, Senator Williams asked the followingquestions in a letter to Dr. Breslow:) 1. Your prepared statement said that many individuals in California andelsewhere have endeavored to link up Medi-Cal with the quality standards ofMedicare. May we have a summary of the suggestions most often made?2. How would you implement your recommendation to \"incorporate into allFederal medical care programs a legislative framework for establishing standardsof quality.\" What programs would be thus affected? Would any be of specialimportance to the elderly? 3. Your strong recommendation for adequate health data systems in federallysupported health programs is of great interest to the Subcommittee. In yoursuggestion that the Committee \"explore this system in detail with a view to in-corporating some such data system into all medical care programs supportedby federal funds,\" what do you see as the major questions that should beexplored? (The following reply was received:) UNIVEaSITY OF CALIFORNIA, Los ANGELES, Los Angeles, Calif., November 26,1968. DEAR SENATOR WILLIAMS: * * * The way to link up Medi-Cal (the California version of Medicaid) withMedicare is simply to require that all services paid for by Medi-Cal must conformto the standards established for Medicare. This policy would disallow payment forcare under Medi-Cal in hospitals, laboratories, home health agencies or otherfacilities whenever these facilities had not been certified for participation inMedicare. For example, this policy would not permit what many regard as dissipationof Medi-Cal funds in individual home services that are not a part of organizedhome health agency services. Each state, of course, could establish such requirements for its Medicaid pro-gram, but it would be far preferable to have this established nationwide as inMedicare.646 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS To incorporate into all federal medical care programs a legislative framework for establishing standards of quality, I would suggest following the pattern of the Medicare (Part A) pattern. You will recall that the Medicare Law (Title XVIII) specifies in considerable detail the standards which must be met by hospitals and other providers of care, and extends a framework for state parti- cipation in determining compliance with the standards as well as an opportunity for states to establish higher standards than those in the nation as a whole. I believe that every federal program for health care should establish the same kind of legislative framework as that now embodied in Medicare (Title XVIII). This would affect primarily the Medicaid program which provides services to ithe elderly as well as the other services, and all other major federal health programs. In exploring health data systems for federally supported health programs I would suggest attention to the following questions: 1) Will the data meet the needs of program administration, and the Congress for information on the costs and utilization of the various types of health services provided to the population groups that are to be served? 2) Does the data provide information concerning the quality of care provided? 3) Is the data system linked to administrative action? For example, if the data disclose providers of care who are deviating so extremely from the norm that investigation is needed, is there a system for in- vestigation of these deviant providers under appropriate professional direction, and is necessary action taken, including when appropriate, recovery of money that has been paid and suspension from the program. 4) Should national mini- mum standards and reporting be established for the data, as in the case births and deaths, and certain diseases such as tuberculosis and cancer? 5) What would be the cost of such a system incorporated into present administrative providers, and would it contribute to cost control of the program? I believe that your investigation would disclose answers to the above questions that would strongly support the establishment of a health data system such as I have proposed. Sincerely yours, LESTER BRESLOW, M.D., Professor of Health Services Administration. Senator WILLIAMS. Dr. Malcolm Todd, president of the California Medical Association. STATEMENT OF DR. MALCOLM C. TODD, PRESIDENT, CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION Dr. TODD. Mr. Chairman, members of the Senate Special Commit- tee on Aging, I am Dr. Malcolm C. Todd, president of the California Medical Association, representing 24,000 physicians in this State. As a surgeon engaged in the private practice of medicine in Long Beach, Calif., I take care of people when they get sick, I operate on plumbers for ruptured stomach ulcers, I remove breast cancers on professors' wives, and I operate strangulated ruptures on little children. I also remove diseased gall bladders on preachers, take out colons for cancer on machinists, and I do hysterectomies for tumors on secretaries.For years I have operated at the county hospital and have taught at the University of California without remuneration. In other words, I receive no pay, whatsoever, for my skill and time, but there is one great satisfaction, and that is to know that I have helped restore many injured and sick indigent patients to good health. Accompanying me today is Dr. Marvin J. Shapiro, who is a mem- ber of our association's council, or the board of trustees. Dr. Shapiro is a radiologist in private practice in Encino, Calif.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 647 I wish to sincerely thank you and the committee for the opportunity to appear here today. In the question sheet accompanying your letter of invitation, Mr. Chairman, several excellent questions were raised for possible discus- sion in my statement. I shall address myself to these inquiries. But before I enumerate current activities of organized medicine on the subject of utilization and peer review, I would like to point out that these were ongoing activities of organized medicine prior to the passage of Federal legislation. The importance of this pioneering ac- tivity has been adapted to Federal-State funded medical care pro- grams to the benefit of both the taxpayer and the beneficiary under these government-financed medical care programs. The important result of these pioneering efforts has been a dramatic adoption of these activities by the county medical societies. This re- action by county medical societies is not to be minimized. GUIDELINES FOR UTILIZATION REVIEW As the committee knows, utilization review procedure was part of the medicare law and our association has encouraged this activity as a regular function of the hospital staff. Our manual, \"Guidelines for Utilization Review,\" is used as a guide in California and in many other States. The California Medical Association program of medical staff sur- veys in hospitals were developed, and we recognized the importance of utilization review as an educational hospital staff activity and so. incorporated it as one of the six basic staff review activities. We were cognizant that utilization review is primarily a function of the medi- cal profession and it requires determinations not only of medical ne- cessity, but also whether the most efficient use of available facilities and health services is being made. I feel the effectiveness of utilization review in the newly established and not-so-well-understood extended care facility needs some improve- ment. With others, we are experimenting with regional utilization re- view practices by increasing emphasis on this responsibility, and in some cases, our county societies are currently providing utilization review for extended care facilities. We have published a booklet entitled \"The Physician and the Long- Term Care Facility\" to assist component medical societies in develop- ing a structure for close liaison between the medical community and facilities providing supportive care for chronically ill patients. Concurrent with this effort, we have attempted to define and de- termine guidelines for the level of care to be supplied Medi-Cal pa- tients in extended care facilities as distinct and separate from custodial, that is, room and board care. I know these guidelines have assisted physicians in designating the type of facility required by patients. Another example of activity in the field of utilization review is the California Hospital Association-California Medical Association \"Pro- cedure for Review of Effective Utilization of Hospital Services.\"648 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS This plan was adopted by the State Office of Health Care Services, on June 12, 1968, for the title 19 Medi-Cal program. I will be pleased to submit this full procedure as an appendix to my statement '-but I can briefly state our aim is to provide Aledi-Cal with a system of safeguards in the utilization of hospital services and to assist hospitals to maintain and strengthen standards of care. We recognize that as providers of health services, we have a respon- sibility for assuring that the public interest is being served in the delivery of hospital care. We also believe that quality is the most important component to effective hospital service. Therefore, in coop- eration with the carriers for the Aledi-Cal program, we have agreed that standards of quality can best be judged by professional peers, functioning expressly to review patterns of hospital practice. The methods are: first, screening for irregularity; second, detecting irregularity; third, referring for peer review by a panel of practicing physicians and hospital administrators. We also make provisions in this plan for evaluation of these procedures on the basis of their effectiveness. To discuss peer review is a broad assignment. It can mean the grievance or mediation committee of a county medical society which attempts to fairly adjudicate a patient's complaint based on the con- sidered judgment of a panel of involved physician's peers. Or it can mean a tissue committee in a hospital which reports on the attestable need for the surgical procedure performed. It can mean an ethics committee of physicians charged with the interpretation of ethics involved in the professional conduct of a colleague. Or it might mean a claims review committee in a county society advising an insurance company, a consumer or his designated representative on the propriety of the medical procedure and the reasonableness of the charge. Certainly a utilization committee is an example of peer review. Our medical review committees help evaluate and advise on variant medicare claims in cooperation with the carrier. Both carriers for title 18, part B, and Medi-Cal have instituted a very sophisticated system-a medical adviser system composed of about 150 practicing physicians over the State who have served on claims review committees. These doctors work in liaison with the countv societies in behalf of the carrier to assure the highest quality of care at the most reason- able cost. There is inquiry as to the results of peer review. Gentlemen, I can say with the deepest sincerity that we know we get results. I have served on various peer review committees in my own county society- California physicians give freely of their time, which adds up to thousands of hours annually, to serve on these committees. Yes, gentlemen, I repeat-these reviews have been carried out at no cost to the government and none to our patients. It is truly a volun- tary effort on the part of physicians performing these services and performing them at their own expense in behalf of making the pro- gram work. Our county societies have recommended suspended participation in Medi-Cal for deviant doctors and they also adjust claims in a forth- right manner, according to a program regulation and medical I See app. '1, p. 7tT7.COSTS OF HEALTH1 SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 649 appropriateness. We pledge continued effort to further strengthen allaspects of peer review. Now, we as a profession testified and warned government socialplanners, back in 1962 and 1964, for example, that hospitals would becrowded, that costs would rise, and the program would be inflationary.And frankly, wve have not been wrong in this prediction. AvAILABILITY OF HEALTH SERVICES Now, a second question is asked if there is a significant number ofelderly persons in California who encounter difficulty in securinghealth services because of unavailability or increasing costs of such services. In all candor, I believe there are yet a number of people of all ages,young and old alike, who do not receive adequate medical care forsome reasons. Accessibility is sometimes a reason, but, I must addtwo other reasons for this difficulty; they are ignorance and psycho-logical barriers such as fear, mistrust, and apprehension. I believe many of these deprived people live in our city slums andin rural areas. Our recommendations-well, let's recognize the socialproblems along with medical problems. Ignorance has to give way toeducation; favored home remedies have to give way to desires for scientific medical care-and quackery has to be eliminated. And we have to overcome our shortage of health care professionalsif we are going to be capable of giving medical care to every citizenof this country in the most ideal terms of modern scientific medicine. What then are we doing? The medical profession is involved inseveral OEO neighborhood health center medical programs in additionto rural migratory health care programs. We are working with thehealth insurance industry and Blue Shield to improve voluntary prepaid health insurance. Our association is now compiling the\"Essential Components of Adequate Health Care Coverage\" as aguideline and standard for the consumer public. We are also trying to educate the public to the advantages of pre- ventive medicine. Los Angeles County Medical Association supported a public education program on the necessity of \"Pap smears\" in aportion of Los Angeles called the Watts area. We have sponsored ourState's cancer antiquackery law which has saved patients' lives-bypreventing futile treatments and wasteful expenditures. Our delegation to the American Medical Association supported advocacy, in a preliminary report, of the concept of income tax creditsto provide financial assistance to that segment of our population unableto afford complete and adequate health insurance coverage-regardless of the age of the needy individual. We hope and urge this conceptwill receive legislative consideration by Congress during the next session. Now, we all have a responsibility in programs for the aged. First,to lower the cost of health care. Second, at the same time to maintainquality of health care. I say to you, doctors will accept their responsi-bility. But we feel that the patient, his relatives, and his family, mustalso accept theirs, and not demand a stay in the hospital longer than isnecessary, and not try to remain in extended care facilities for a longerperiod of time than is absolutely necessary.650 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS And that they not ask for unnecessary medical services. I also feel that social workers have a responsibility to try to control health care costs. She should not side with the patient on every request that is submitted, but must carry out just what is provided in the terms of the law itself. The third injury concerns the impact of medicare and Medi-Cal on the quality of health services provided for the elderly. While some feared that these programs would greatly overtax our present system of providing health care, I do not believe we are in a crisis. Yes, our hospitals are crowded-and yes, we do need more health care professionals. But I believe the quality of care rendered today reaches a broader segment of the public. I realize this is a generaliza- tion, but I am speaking from my experience and that of many of my many colleagues over the State. The quality of mainstream health care in California is high-yet .it is most important that we work together getting all of our citizens into that mainstream of medical care. QUESTIONS ABOUT PHYSICIANS' FEES Too much attention has been directed toward the physician's fees. Figures can be made to mean anything that they want to. But in an effort to achieve solutions to medical services for the aged, and to cut medical care costs, there are some things that I would like to mention. It is interesting to note that the AMedi-Cal budgeted in 1967-68, $159,500,000 for physicians' services. But they actually paid out only $122,100,000. I would also like to state that over the overall health care cost dollar in the Medi-Cal program, the physician's fees amount to just 19 to 20 percent of the entire health care cost dollar. But it is that extra day in the acute hospital that we must not allow to be abused, because this is where the cost of this program centers. Doctors need legal and administrative regulations to enable them to apply sound medical judgment consonant with the economical implementation of the law in regard to extended care facilities. A difference between needed nursing home care and custodial or remedial care must be acknowledged. Also an attempt should be made to investigate unnecessary and un- justifiable use of ambulances and ancillary services. There must be developed a better planning of hospital beds and facilities and develop new health services; that is, methods of preventive and rehabilitative medicine. I think, too, that we should see that our voluntary health insurance plans develop provisions for payment of voluntary out-patient serv- ices, diagnostic services, and minor surgical procedures themselves. The final inquiry stems from the possibility of congressional cut- backs in the title 19 program. As you know, the medical profession supports the principle of government providing financial assistance to persons not able to provide for their own health care. Title 19, the medicaid law, is based on this principle. I therefore strongly oppose proposed cutbacks in the present pro- gram as a deterrent to the provision of health care for this needy class of people. I think this response speaks for itself.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 651 May I again thank you for the privilege of allowing me to presentthese remarks, and at this time, with your permission, I would liketo call upon Dr. Shapiro, if he has any comment to make particularlyin regard to migratory labor. Senator RANDOLPH. Do you want questions, Mr. Chairman, thatwould refer to the testimony of Dr. Todd? Senator WILLIAMS. I think we would. I think we ought to, if youhave questions, I think we ought to address them to Dr. Todd beforehis associate speaks. Senator RANDOLPH. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Youspeak of the deviant doctor in California or elsewhere. Now, I am wondering if you, for the record, would say that thisis a very small percentage of the medical profession in California,or say, otherwise, and say what steps are being taken that you haveindicated to keep this a small segment. Dr. TODD. Thank you. I am glad to have this opportunity. In the earlier presentation that was made, a question was asked as to how many doctors participate in our California Medi-Cal pro-gram, to begin with. As I stated earlier, we have some 24,000 membersof the California Medical Association, and I am happy to say thatwith the program that is now in operation we have over 18,000 ofthose doctors participating in the Medi-Cal program-much in con-trast to previous testimony that was given. I have the documented figures in front of me. I said 18,250 out of 24,000. Now we recognize that there are some of these individuals who are deviant practitioners. We, as a medical profession association,feel that we have an obligation to protect the public and public funds. And deviant physicians are those who we simply will not tolerate.Through our peer review committee activities we are able to pickup a number of these men whose practices are far from the usual. These are turned over to the bureau- Senator WILLIAMS. What do you call that bureau ? Dr. TODD. The office of health care services. Senator WILLIAMS. No, no. Who reviews it? Dr. TODD. Who reviews it? The deviant doctors? Senator WILLIAMS. The peer-what ? Dr. TODD. These are made-oh, the peer review? PROTECTION AGAINST DEVIANT PHYSICIANS These are made first by California Blue Shield-that is, the carrier.These in turn then are turned over to the peer review committees ofthe county medical societies. If they find that claims are unjustified-that there are excessive practices-that there is overutilization of serv- ices themselves, the physician is called in and talked to in this regard by his own peers. After this is done, a warning is given. If he does not heed the warn-ing and does not follow the suggestions, he then is notified that he has-his name has been presented before the Office of Health Care Servicesof the State administration. And they in turn then have the obligation of submitting his to the attorney general.652 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Senator RANDOLPH. Doctor, I wish to pursue what the chairman has said. You say this is the procedure, and I commend you. Now, how many persons, to your knowledge, have been called before those peers and had discussions of their malpractice? This is important to the committee. Dr. TODD. Yes, it is. It is a function that varies entirely with each one of the county medical societies. In Los Angeles County itself, our largest county, and of course the largest county medical association in the country, has been very active in this activity, and a number of physicians-a proportionate number of physicians-have been called in and had this discussion with them. I can tell you, specifically, that of the physicians alone, some nine or 10 physicians have been reported to the office of health care services, and in turn, turned over for review by the attorney general's office. Senator RANDOLPH. Thank you, Dr. Todd. I think that the record should indicate that not only would the medical profession, as you have indicated, be very desirous of checking these practices, which are not consonant with good medical ethics, but I think here also I would like to speak from personal knowledge. I think that the voluntary health insurance programs have helped to ferret out some of these people. I think the Blue Shield needs a word here today for their efforts; would you agree? Dr. TODD. I certainly would. I think they have had a tremendous task. I wonder if you gentlemen can envision the receipt of 100,000 claims per day? This is a tremendous task that they are faced with. The computers-they have six computers during this operation here for this alone-this is a tremendous job, and there obviously have been some errors in the State. But I think we are making progress in this activity, because I want to sincerely say to you that the majority of doctors practicing medicine are interested in making this program work. Senator RANDOL.PH. May I pursue one or two other questions, Mr. Chairman? You have spoken, doctor, of ignorance and psychological reasons why perhaps programs have not been as effective as they might have been. Now, where does education come in, and how can education be used, and perhaps in what way can the Congress, without laying down a straitjacketed guideline, are there criteria the Congress itself, through agency administration, can bring into being to aid this effort? Dr. TODD. Yes. Dr. Shapiro would like to answer that, if you would. He is the chairman of our Community Health Commission of the State Medical Association. STATEMENT OF MARVIN J. SHAPIRO, COUNCIL MEMBER, CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION Dr. SHArnRo. Senator, I think that reference was made earlier to this cannery workers multiphasic screening program. I think what we have learned from that illustrates this particular problem very well. The cannery workers program last year surveyed several thousand people. When they got quantitative results, they found that 48 percent of these people had no doctor to whom the results could be sent, whichCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 653 of course raises another problem in the area of multiphasic screening-being different from that of the Kaiser program, where they already havena doctor. California Medical Association was brought into it by the trust in anattempt to see to it that the patients on whom abnormal findings were detected were referred to doctors who would follow up and see thatthey were properly taken care of. We worked very actively with the trust on this. One of the big problems, however, has been that no matter howvigorously the recommendations are made to the people, on whomabnormal findings are detected, we can't get them to go to the doctor.And it doesn't do much good to get the abnormal findings if we can'tget the followup. I think this is the sort of thing that the doctor is alluding to, andcertainly that we must educate the people of the necessity of followup. It has to be a constructive program. Senator RANDOLPH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That's all the ques-tions that I have. Senator WILLIAMS. Thank you very much. Did you have any other- Dr. SHAPIRO. Nothing that need take the time of the committee, I am sure. Senator RANDOLPH. Your testimony was very informative and help-ful, I am sure, to our committee. Dr. TODD. Thank you. It is a pleasure to be here. Senator WnijAxis. I was very encouraged by your statement, Dr.Todd. I have had a feeling that the medical association was very slowin coming to these positions-the particular programs of medicareand Medi-Cal, but evidently the acceptance is there. Dr. TODD. We are trying to work with it, and you will find that doc-tors are participating with the program. Senator WILuIAMs. Thank you. Very good, thank you very much. Is Mr. Carbray here? The chairman of the senior citizens activitycommittee of this county-and I think you know something aboutthe AFL-CIO; don't you? Mr. CARBRAY. I have a feeling that I do, Mr. Chairman. Senator WmLLiAms. You have Mr. Davidson and Mr. Hartley withyou? Mr. CARBRizY. That is correct. Rob and Louie; would you come uphere? STATEMENT OF JAMES CARBRAY, CHAIRMAN, SENIOR CITIZENS ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE Mr. CARBRAY. If I may, Mr. Chairman, may I express the apprecia-tion of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and also the ap-preciation of the National Council of Senior Citizens, on my ownbehalf, for this invitation. However, as you will note from the agenda, I am speaking today forthe Federation of Labor of Los Angeles County. Immediately follow-ing my rather brief testimony, I would respectfully suggest that youhear a very brief statement from Mr. Davidson and Mr. Hartley.And now, taking the lead from Senator Randolph to say somethingobjective once in a while about the things that come to our attention, 24-798--69-pt. 3-i654 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS I would like to extend our thanks to you, Senator Williams, for the presentation of S. 4115, recently in the U.S. Senate, which calls for the establishment of an Institute for Retirement Income. I think that this is long overdue, considering the fact that we live in a rather youth-oriented society, and that poverty, where it lies, hurts the seniors to a greater degree, because of his inability to work, than it does the junior. And this I am most appreciative for. Now, I want to preface this with a comment regarding the general statement of Dr. Todd. I don't want to construe that what I am about to say in the form of testimony is derogatory or a reflection on all the people within the medical profession or all the people who are responsible for administering hospitals. I think Dr. Todd touched on the fact that there are some scoundrels probably in both areas. But those of us in the federation of labor, and those of us in the senior citizens organizations are aware that by and large a maj or nortion of our doctors and our hospitals are dedicated and sincere. DELUGE OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT COSTS Since the advent of medicare and Medi-Cal, union officials and of- ficers of senior citizens organizations have been deluged by complaints of increased hospital costs and doctors' fees. These increases were re- flected in a social security bulletin, as I recall, dated July 1, 1967, which is after 1 year of medleare experience, and as I recall, this report showed an increase of approximately 22 percent in daily hospital charges and just over 5 percent in doctors' fees on a national average basis. Several studies by responsible researchers have been conducted since 1966, one such study having been made by University of Cali- fornia at Los Angeles, which involved some 75 or more-it seems to me the correct figure is 77-hospitals in the Los Angeles area. The study showed an average daily hospital charge of $74 during the first quarter of 1967, according to hospital officials; but the hos- pitals who replied to the study questionnaires showed an average daily charge of in excess of $86.50 for the first 6 months of 1967. Let's compare this with the Blue Cross daily average of $75 for the last half of 1966. You show a daily increase of $11.50. During the time of this study, which was the study quoted, during 1966-67, discussions were held with health plan administrators, gov- ernment officials and insurance company representatives specifically regarding doctors' fees which indicated some increases in fees of 50 percent, and considerable gouging in routine office visit fees for medi- care patients. The UCLA study discloses that information provided by represen- tatives of Blue Cross, Occidental Life, and California Physicians Serv- ice to the Benefit Plan Administrators formed the basis for the fol- lowing statements made to the UJCLA representative. (a) Thousands of medicare and Medi-Cal claims submitted are being held up and investigated because of suspected excessive charges on overutilization. The same applies in some respect to prescription drugs. (b) A few individual doctors may be receiving, from the services alone, in excess of $100,000 a year.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 655 (c) On the basis of claims submitted, one doctor apparently was seeing over 200 patients a day-an average of one every 2 minutes. (d) Some claims are being paid on the basis of $9 to $12 a visit on the California Medical Association relative value study. Such claims were unusual prior to medicare and $5.50 to $6.50 per unit gen- erally considered the reasonable customary charge in Los Angeles County. Claims reviewed-this is all during these studies-disclosed the following: (1) One doctor charged each of his medicare repeat patients after July 1, 1966, for his first visit on the basis of a complete history and physical even though it was just another routine visit. This provides for an allowance of 11/2 to 2\u00bd12 times what he should have been allowed. This doctor was therefore paid from $20 to $35 for a routine visit. One doctor raised his routine visit charge, treating the same patient for the same condition from $5 to $6 per unit to $8 or $10 per unit. Routine office visit charges for medicare patients of $15 to $20 were paid to one doctor. One doctor, using an automated laboratory for blood work, was paid $140 for tests which probably were billed to him at less than $5. COST OF PRESCRPTION DRuGS Directly related to the health care costs of the elderly is the cost of drugs, and in particular prescription drugs. The concern of the elderly is reflected in the complaints received both by labor organi- zations and senior citizens' organizations and it is quite significant that where drugs can be purchased under the generic name the savings are substantial, which accounts for the demands of responsible sen- ior citizens' organizations that prescription drugs be covered by medi- care, thereby allowing the Federal Government to purchase drugs under their generic name through the means of competitive bids. Senator WnILIAMs. Did you hear Dr. Todd's testimony? Mr. CARBRAY. Yes, I did. Senator WILLIAMS. It seems to me that he said there was a surveil- lance system in the medical profession Mr. CARBRAY. That's right. Senator WILLIAMS (continuing). That brings these scalpers or gougers to heel. Mr. CARBRAY. That is right, Senator, and that is why I prefaced my testimony with the statement that I did, because I do have respect for Dr. Todd, not only for his qualifications, but for his reputation as a real humanitarian inthe field of medicine. Senator WILLiAMS. Thank you. Mr. C(ARBRAY. This sampling reveals the need for a comprehensive study in detail of both hospital costs and charges, should some hospitals refuse to cooperate, appropriate steps should be taken to assure disclo- sure of all records, even if by legislation if necessary, for we must bear in mind that many hospitals are operating under the banner of non- profit ventures. Senator WILLiAmS. Well, we have a double nexus with the Federal Government and hospitals. Not many of them have benefited under656 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Hill-Burton under that application, and of course medicare as the other leverage for Federal attention. Mr. CARBRAY. Now, we feel that a similar comprehensive study should be made of doctors' fees; for during the past 2 years the press, and other news media, have reported marny instances of excessive fees, and almost unbelievable increases in doctors' income since the advent of medicare and Medi-Cal. Numerous samplings this year, during 1968, indicate hospital charges are averaging nearly $100 daily. This would indicate the up- ward trend continues. RECOMMENDATIONS The current deductibles in the medicare program are in reality an economic roadblock to health services for millions of elderly in the low- income bracket and we feel they should be eliminated. Compounding this injustice in California is the fact-and I might say that this is also true in many other States-I think 34 other States- that recipients of State old age assistance suffer a reduction in their State assistance checks in an amount comparable to the increase in Social Security benefits as the result of vetoes by the Governor in 1967 and 1968 of legislation which would have eliminated this injustice. Prior testimony before this committee by officers of the National Council of Senior Citizens calls for appropriate amendments to the medicare program which would remove such deterrents to health services to the needy. The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor concurs in these amendments. In many instances the billing procedures of hospitals and doctors are suspect due to failure to provide a dupli- cate itemized bill for services rendered to the medicare patient. In the absence of such proof of services rendered, how can the car- rier, or the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welf are, combat the abuses that are alleged ? May I suggest uniform billing standards as a means of combating such abuses! And it would seem to me that this would also help the program of the peers committee that Dr. Todd made reference to in this State. I might supplement this with one thought that I just learned of yesterday that, in some instances, I am informed that some hospitals and some doctors likewise, have a code method of making bills-I haven't seen one, I heard of it yesterday-which even though a copy is given to the recipient of medicare, he doesn't really know what it means. And it would seem to me that it is very simple for a physician or for a hospital to present that patient-that recipient of the medicare- with the type of statement that would properly reflect the type of service that has been rendered to him. I think this would 'be a constructive way of obviously, in my opinion at least, of eliminating some of the possibilities of skullduggery on the part of those who are unethical. And again I want to say, I know it is a minority, not a majority, of the profession that we can say this about. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator WmLisms. We appreciate your appearance very much.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 657 (Subsequent to the hearing, Senator Williams asked the followingquestions in a letter to Mr. Carbray:) 1. You called for a comprehensive study in detail of both hospital costs andcharges and additional legislation if necessary to assure disclosure of all records.May we have additional discussion of subjects that would be considered in sucha comprehensive study, and suggestions for major provisions of the legislationyou mentioned? 2. Do you have any additional information on the \"code method of makingbills\" mentioned in your testimony? 3. What in your opinion will be the effects of the newly-announced 10 percentincrease in deductibles and coinsurance for Medicare? (The following reply was received:) NOVEMBER 18, 1968.Dear Senator WILIUAMS: (1) I am sure you agree with me that in the absence of complete and detailedrecords of hospital and nursing home operations a wholly comprehensive study ofservice and related costs is not possible. My reference to the need for legislativeamendments is based on the refusal of hospitals, nursing homes and doctors tomake such records available. I feel it is necessary that legislation be enactedwhich (a) requires the keeping of detailed records or services rendered, and re-lated costs. (b) Make such records available on request for inspection by, anauthorized representative of, the appropriate Federal Agency, the appropriateState Agency, and/or the authorized carrier. These requirements should be acondition of Certification by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare;for all hospitals and nursing homes wishing to participate in the Medicare Pro-grain. Similar conditions should apply to the Medicaid Program. (2) I have no additional information on the \"Code Method\" of billing bydoctors; but I shall continue to pursue this. (3) The pending 10 percent increase in deductibles and coinsurance will onlycompound the prevailing hardship resulting from inadequate finances for thedeductibles. I have had numerous protests from seniors accompanied by requestsfor an explanation. Note: The recent hearing here resulting from the expose of abuses of the Medi-Cal Program by Attorney General, Thomas Lynch, lends support for the pre-viously expressed idea that the Medicaid Program should be federalized.Personal best wishes. Sincerely, JAMES CARBRAY, Executive Board Member. Mr. CARBRAY. Now, I would like to have Mr. Hartley and Mr. David-son for just about a couple of minutes-each of them has one specificthing they want to relate which relates to some of the testimony in mystatement. STATEMENT OF ROBERT HARTLEY, FOR SENIOR CITIZENS ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE Mr. HARTLEY. I have been asked to make a statement of charges asI have noticed in the past few months in my family from the hospital.For a 3-day period in one of our Los Angeles County hospitals, acharge of $342 for 3 days' services. That doesn't include the physician'scharges. That is paid elsewhere. On a second visit within the past 3 months, an 8-day stay-and Iwill explain it this way-when I checked out I asked the attendantwhat the charges were for the full 8 days. She told me that it was onlv made out for 6 days.I said, \"May I have the charges that you have on your book here?\"658 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Six-hundred-and-thirty-some-odd dollars for 6 days. And that doesn't include a physician's charges. Now, over and above this second charge, an anesthesiologist charge of $90 for his services for the operation. An assistant doctor-surgeon-his charge was $60. In the past, I will say 4 years-5 years, I will make it-I was in the hospital in the Middle West. The charges that came through on my Blue Cross statement, as the hospital charge per day, was about $35 per day. The charges as produced by the present hospital visit means a very substantial increase, and if we are not covered by prepaid medical care, the senior citizen who is on a static income-he is on a pension in social security-it is impossible for him to absorb these increases. LEGISLATIVE AsSIsTANCE As=y We of the senior citizens and of the labor unions are vitally interested in those people in our organizations that are suffering from the in- creased costs that they cannot cover. We would like to see some legisla- tion in the form that would give them assistance-that would alleviate some of the abuses that they are subjected to when they have to have medical care. I thank you, gentlemen. Senator WILLIAMS. Thank you, sir. Mr. CARBRAY. Mr. Davidson. Senator RANDOLPH. So as to save time, I want to comment on the gentleman-your associate-who spoke of the hospital charge. The figure you gave for another area of the country was $30 a day. How long ago was it-I want to make sure? Mr. HARTLEY. That was about 5 years ago. Senator RANDOLPH. Five years ago. And the figure you gave was for Mr. HARTLEY. Kansas City, Mo. Senator RANDOLPH. And the figure you gave for Los Angeles-8 days-although charged for 6 days, but running it out on 8 days would make it about $80 a day; is that right? You said six-hundred-and- some-dollars? Mr. HARTLEY. But that was for 6 days, only. The remaining 2 days was not on the bill. Senator WLTLIAMS. Well now, who paid all of this money? Mr. HARTLEY. A prepaid medical plan pays for this. Mr. CARBRAY. A supplement to- Mr. ORIOL. A supplement to medicare? Senator WILLIAMS. What is medicare right now? Mr. CARBRAY. They pay 80 percent. Senator WILLIAMS. They pay 80 percent? And your- Mr. CARBRAY. Eighty percent for the physician. Mr. HARTLEY. Eighty percent for the hospital. Senator WILLIAMS. Eighty percent for the hospital? And the bal- ance was paid by the plan that you got into? Mr. HARTLEY. That is correct. That is correct. Senator RANDOLPH. Mr. Chairman, I am trying to determine what the cost was per day.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 659 Mr. HARTLEY. The cost was over $100. Senator RANDOLPH. I see it now. The 6- and 8-day figure-I wasn't clear. In other words, $30, 5 years ago in Kansas City; $100 in Los Angeles County. Mr. HARTLEY. $110, to be exact. Senator RANDOLPH. $110? Mr. HARTLEY. Approximately $110 on the first hospital visit- $342. On the second hospital visit-for 6 days-630-some dollars. Now, there is a variation there, but it still runs approximately $110 per day. Senator WILLmAMS. Why did they take 8 days and reduce it to 6 days? Mr. HARTLEY. They didn't. Due to the fact that I am covered by a prepaid plan, I could get a release from that hospital and they didn't have their bills made up, because I didn't have to pay it. My carrier would take care of that. But the office girl related to me that for a 6-day period, there was a charge of 600-some-odd dollars. Senator RANDOLPH. Mr. Chairman, I find no witness from the hospi- tal profession as such; is that correct? Mr. ORIOL. There is nothing today. Senator WILLAMS. I would say go ahead and do it. I will say, if you have to return to the hospital, I wouldn't go to that hospital. Mr. HARTLEY. That's beside the point. If those charges are proper in this area, then you are going to have to go to some hospital. I will say this of this hospital: It is a very lovely hospital and the service is excellent. I am not griping, I might say, about what has to be paid here. Medicare and the prepaid plan pays it. Senator WILLIAMS. You are doing a service, and I wanted to de- velop that you didn't pay it, because you were under medicare and also under your insurance program. So it is a service for you to come here and talk to us. Senator RANDOLPH. Don't misunderstand me on this point, and I don't want to lay a finger on anyone, but there is a tendency where you are not paying, or the chairman is not paying it-you are speak- ing about a nebulous group that pays something-and then you sock it to them, because you can't put your finger on you, or you, or you, and I think it is very important that this be developed. Senator WILLIAMS. Well, I will say this: I know in the State where I live, the Blue Cross rates go up and up and up, and this is part of it, and you know who is in the forefront of the opposition-the AFL-E CIO. Mr. HARTLEY. I have had very good service in this hospital, and I would object to anything like that-the prices of this. The problem I am objecting to is the raises that cannot be met by the people in my age group, people who cannot afford- Senator WILLIAMS. That's right. Mr. HARTLEY. Prepaid medical plans. Senator RANDOLPH. Mr. Chairman, again I want to stop talking about this-I want it broken down so as to be definitive-the hospital660 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS charged this. There may have been some services that I want to know about, do you understand? Mr. HARTLEY. I do. Senator RANDOLPH. Not just bed and board. Mr. HARTLEY. Bed, board, and food. Senator WILLiASrs. Many X-rays, and other Mr. 1-LARTLEY. Well, the equipment that they use-laboratory tests- Senator WILLIA1AIS. Oh, I mean in your case. Mr. HARTLEY. Oh, in this case-no X-rays on this particular visit. Senator WILLIAMS. What is your name, sir? Mr. DAVIDSON. Louis Davidson. STATEMENT OF LOUIS DAVIDSON, FOR THE SENIOR CITIZENS ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE, LOS ANGELES FEDERATION OF LABOR, AFL-CIO Mr. DAVIDSON. I would like to make a preface. Because we have complaints does not mean that the senior citizens and their unions underestimate the importance of medicare. I think there is nobody that more appreciates medicare and all its functions, even with its difficulties, as much as the senior citizens do. However, I would like to make a couple of points which will serve to substantiate what the previous speaker spoke of-and many of the other complaints. People living on a standard like mine-income, say, about $200 a month-because of the deductibles and because of the additional costs for doctors are, in a certain way, prevented from utilizing medicare benefits. And I will substantiate by saying this: I have recently almost en- tirely lost my hearing. A certain very important and very good doctor, in his profession, was recommended to me. He examined me in his clinic, and he helped me a great deal. He somewhat restored my hearing. His charge was $25 for the examination, for which medicare does not pay, and $40 for the service, which also has to be paid by me because the first $50 of treatment is not paid by medicare, and has to be paid by me. That's $50 deductible. The recommendation of the doctor was to operate. He thought-and he is a very good doctor-that he could put my hearing in good condition. After I left his office I went to make an appointment for the recom- mended operation. The charge was to be $650 for the operation and $50 for his assistant-which came to $700. Incidentally, a friend of mine was operated on by the same doctor in 1959, and was charged $250. If I had arranged for the operation, I would have been required to pay the 20 percent plus the $50 deductible. I would have had to pay $100 for admission to the hospital-which means several hundred dollars. People in my income bracket couldn't afford that kind of money, and therefore I had to give it up.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 661 DEDUCTIBLES BAR TREATmENT I know of three more cases. People who are suffering with their sicknesses but they cannot go through with the operation because thedeductibles and all of this are just more than they can manage. Dr. Todd made a very good point when he said that there are a great number of participants in the medicare program-but there are also a number who don't participate, in Los Angeles particularly. The people who provide the necessary services charge an awful lot,and some of the senior citizens don't have a pocketful of money. Even in regard to those people who do participate, I have a couple of complaints-particularly one woman that I knowv of-who goes toa certain doctor for many years, who has not overcharged. He participates, but when she goes in for the next appointment, the nurse, who is the secretary of the doctor, makes her feel so bad that she, instead of taking the bill from the doctor and sending it to medi-care, she just takes out the last dollar that she has to live on and pays the doctor. One more point I would like to make, and that is in connection with Medi-Cal, which Speaker Unruh spoke for: It is true that California is one of the States that participates in medicaid. The top income of onesingle person has to be $167 a month. I come originally from-I am a neighbor of yours, Senator, f rom New York-where it is quite different.And something else: I have a complaint that a certain person-par-ticularly-who has recently gone in to apply for Medi-Cal-her income is $107 a month. She was unfortunate in that her husband left her aninsurance policy of $1,500. After an hour and a half of interrogation by the clerk, they foundthat she was not entitled to Medi-Cal-even though she only gets an income of $107-because she has $1,500 in cash. Furthermore, according to the law, there is supposed to be an allot- ment, first of all, of some of the money that is in the bank for living- supplementing this $107, and also she is entitled to $700 funeral serv- ice. That has not been taken into consideration. It may not always be handled in the same way. Not all interrogators mav be the same. But I say that those things happen that discouragedignified people from-even if they cannot get along-to apply forthis service. Thank you very much. Senator WILLIAMS. That comes from your personal experience? Mr. DAVIDSON. That's right. Senator WILLIAMS. That is why we are here-to try to find outwhat is happening. Our mission is to try to improve situations that should be improved. Mr. DAVIDSON. That is why I am very happy to come here, because I know that you are very much interested in solving this problem.Senator WILLIAMS. Thank you very much, gentlemen. You have been most helpful. It is now 1:26 p.m. We -will have one more witness before -we recess,and Mr. Robert Thomas is available right now.662 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS STATEMENT OF ROBERT THOMAS, VICE PRESIDENT, BLUE CROSS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA Mr. THOMAS. Mr. Chairman, and Senator Randolph, and gentlemen, I am Robert J. Thomas, vice president of Blue Cross of Southern California, with the responsibility for professional and governmental relationships. It is my pleasure this morning to make, really, a short report on our performance as intermediaries under title 19, which is, as you know, known as Medi-Cal in this State. In the interest of time and your recess, my remarks here this morning will just be informal. California's Assembly bill No. 5, which was the enabling legislation to permit implementation of title 19 in this State, was enacted in the fall of 1965 in a manner which permitted the State to take advantage of the existing resources of private enterprise in the administration of health care benefits under this program. By resources I mean our facilities, our equipment, our staff, our systems, and particularly our experience and experitse in this field. For example, the organization which I represent has been in the business of health prepayment for more than 30 years. I have a history of having been a hospital administrator for more than 18 years. In any event, I am pleased to report that in response to requests from State officials, from the medical profession, and from the health field in general, Blue Cross of Northern California, Blue Cross of Southern California, and California Blue Shield, joined together and submitted what turned out to be a successful bid for us to serve as intermediaries under this program on a no-profit, no-loss basis. Senator WILLIAMS. Is there an advantage there, do you think, in- stead of the State handling the whole thing itself ? Mr. THoMAs. I think there is, Senator, particularly because of our long experience in the field of health and administration of health benefits. Because of our close association with institutional providers of care, in my case, and in California Blue Shield's relationship with physicians, we are known to them-we know the ins and outs of the business. We know the good and bad operators, as it were, and I think in most instances, certainly from the providers' standpoint, they want a buffer between the government and their own activity. We provide that, and we are, I think, regarded as a part of the health team. So I think we do provide a service that could not be provided normally through the existing government channels. Senator WILLIAMS. And has this matter substantially increased costs in Blue Cross-whatever you want to call it-premiums? Mr. THOMAS. Rates. Senator WILLIAMS. Has it made a substantial increase? Mr. THOMAS. Our rate increases have gone hand in hand with the overall increases in the cost of care which we have heard referred to here this morning.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 663 Obviously our rates are set on an actuarial basis, and as costs go up, our rates must go up to cover them. Senator WILLTAMS. And those rates have to be approved by a depart- ment of State government? Mr. THOMAS. Yes. Although we are a nonprofit corporation, we are still subject to the regulations of the State insurance commissioner- and those rates are approved by him. Senator WILLIAMs. As a conclusion on that point, you are in favor of the intermediary, rather than pure government handling the whole program? Mr. THOMAS. Well, not only am I in favor of it, because we are administering the program, but I know I speak for the professions and the different provider organizations with whom we deal and whom we represent. Senator WILLIAMS. How did you become intermediary? Did you have to compete on a fitting basis with insurance companies, for example? Mr. THOMAS. Yes, In this State the intermediary role was let on the basis of bid, and evaluation of bids. Senator WILLIAMS. Check. Right. Mr. Tnoz[As. And even though we joined with California Blue Shield in this bid, I think Dr. Malcolm Todd has spoken quite suc- cinctly about their role. RELATIONSHIPS WITH PROVIDERS OF SERVICES And so again in the interest of time, I will limit my remarks just to Blue Cross and its relation with the institutional providers of serv- ice, the hospitals, the nursing homes, health agencies, rehabilitation centers, free clinics, and so on. Now, in the 30 months that this program has been under way in this State, 4,800,000 institutional claims have been paid in behalf of eligible Medi-Cal recipients. And this amounts to a total expenditure of in excess of $730 million to date. I am sure that before this fiscal year is out, this will surpass the $1 billion mark. These payments have been made to more than 1,900 institutional providers in this State. About 560 hospitals, 1,200 nursing homes, 120 home health agencies and free clinics, so I think you can see that Medi-Cal, which sort of sounds like a drink for weight losers, is certainly not a slim program in this State. It is a very large and a very complicated program. I would like to sav right here, if I may, that I feel that our success as an intermediary has been due in no small measure to the rapport and certainly the very capable cooperation that we have had from the State department of health care services. Each of us has a very important role to play in this program and I think we present an excellent example of private enterprise and government working together in concept.664 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS I would say also, that our Blue Cross policy, since the inception of this program, has been to handle it on the same basis with the same safeguards and at the same level as we handle our own business. Certainly to insure high quality of care in any of these programs it is necessary to verify that those persons admitted to institutions ac- tually needed to be admitted. And once they are admitted, we must determine that neither over- utilization or underutilization of the institution's facilities, its tests or its treatments, were allowed. And also we must check to see that the length of stay of the patient is commensurate with the severity of his illness. I think if we are going to get the fullest economic use of the facili- ties we have in our community here, it is absolutely imperative that we get people out of the acute beds and into nursing homes and to home health agencies, home ca-re programs or outpatient care, just as soon as we possibly can. INTERMfEDIARY ROLE Now again, in the interest of brevity, let me just comment that as far as I can see there are really about three major functions in this intermediary role which I think we are carrying out very vigorously. The first is to receive and process and pay institutional claims in an efficient manner. The second is to provide assistance and counseling to providers in the field and to conduct utilization review and medical audit activities in the field to prevent abuses of the program. And the third, of course, is to perform fiscal audits to verify that costs and charges are compatible for the services rendered. Each of these functions which is carried out by us can be carried out on our Blue Cross business, on our medicare and our Medi-Cal programs at the same time, and 'with the same personnel with an ap- propriate sharing of the costs. And this, of course, results in considerable economy for each of the participants in these programs. For example, in the area of claims processing, we receive approxi- mately 40,000 claims a month which involve both medicare and Medi- Cal benefits. As has been previously mentioned on the basis of the patients en- titlement to medicare, many times he can't pay his coinsurance or deductible. Now, if he is eligible for medicare, then Medi-Cal pays these for him. Because in almost all of the cases we serve as the intermediary for both medicare and Medi-Cal, we can process the claims and make pay- ments under both programs from a single medicare form. This, of course, is a real saving of time and paperwork-not only for us, but for hospitals and other-institutions as well. In the functions of assisting and counseling and utilization review and medical audit, we have 76 full-time field representatives. And on each visit made by these people, all three of these programs are covered.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 665 So each program really only pays about one-third the cost of eachvisit that is made. COMPATIBLE COST REPOTrING FopMis And similarly, in the performance of our fiscal audit, compatiblecost reporting forms have been developed so that one audit of the in-stitution's books will suffice for all three programs-again with ap-propriate sharing of costs. In this joint administration of medicare and Medi-Cal and BlueCross, too, I believe we have an excellent mechanism for assisting inthe maintenance of high quality care and in an economical manner.For example, our administrative costs and claims processing, todate, under the Medi-Cal program, is just 771/2 cents per claim. Thisamounts to one-half of 1 percent of the amount paid for institutionalservices rendered. I think you will agree this is a. mighty low administrative cost. Asthe charts that have been filed with your committee will show, thevolume of patient care in medicare-in Medi-Cal, rather-is increas-ing rather dramatically. More and more eligible people seem to be availing themselves of theMedi-Cal benefits, and each has been seen by a doctor who has deter-mined that the patient needed institutional care.So I think this way we can see that the program is bringing care toa great many people who apparently needed it before, but for one rea-son or another had not been getting it.I think, just in summary, if I may, Senator Williams, I would saythat we had many problems at the outset of this program, as can beexpected, but there have been a great many improvements in the pro-gram since its beginning. A lot are in the mill right now, and comingto fruition. I am sure we can look forward to a great many more in the verynear future. And with the pros and cons we have heard here this morning, I ampleased to tell you that, all in all, -we of Blue Cross can say that weare very proud to have been a part of what we feel is a great programand which is bringing a great deal of good to a lot of people.If you have any questions, sir, I will be glad to try and answerthem. Senator WILLIAMS. I think you have answered all of the questionsthat I had prepared to ask. How many States are included in medicaid, which is yournomenclature-is Medi-Cal? Mr. THOMIAS. I don't know. I can speak for this State-well, uparound 40, I believe. Senator WILLIAMS. Is that right? Blue Cross is the agent inter-mediary in many of these States? Mr. THoMiAs. A great many. This is the case, as you well know, itis up to the individual States to decide in their programs as to whichway they will be administered. A majority have chosen to go the route of the intermediary.666 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Senator WILLiAMs. Mr. Thomas, I know we have to adjourn-peo- ple have been sitting here for a long time, and you are entitled to a little luncheon-we will recess now. It is 20 minutes till 2. Senator Randolph has a schedule problem. We will be due back at 2:15. That will give you a chance tohave a long, leisurely 20-minute lunch. (Whereupon, at 1:40 p.m., the subcommittee recessed, to reconvene at 2 :15 p.m., the same day.) AFrERNOON SESSION Senator RANDOLPH. Our hearing will resume. Will the witnesses now please identify themselves for the record. STATEMENT OF JUANITA C. DUDLEY, ASSISTANT REGIONAL DIREC- TOR, WESTERN REGIONAL OFFICE, NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE Mrs. DuDLEY. Thank you. I am Juanita C. Dudley,* assistant regional director, western regional office, National Urban League. I am particularly concerned with health in the western region- which encompasses six States in which we presently have affiliates. I have many concerns regarding the delivering of health care to the aged. Accompanying me today is Dr. Clarence Littlejohn, health chair- man of the Los Angeles Urban League. He will try to answer some of the five questions-along with me- that we were requested to answer. For brevity, and because of the time, we will move very quickly through all of our questions without stopping. Now it has been clearly established that payments under Medi-Cal to practitioners in the black and brown communities have been less than prompt and equitable. The fiscal agents, Blue Cross and Blue Shield explained that this county is divided into 16 regions and the payment scale varies in most of these regions. The fiscal agents said that payments are rendered within a 3- to 4- week period after submission and suggested that any problems that are existent are due to negligence and irresponsibility on the part of the submitting practitioner. My office requested Blue Shield to run a check on a specific physi- cian's file, and it was determined that none of the problems around payment were due to his errors. This physician had not received payment for any services rendered under the Medi-Cal program for the last 6 months. Both Blue Cross and Blue Shield have stated that seminars are being held in the communities to help the practitioners correct defi- ciencies emanating from incorrectly filed forms, et cetera. *See app. 1, p. 724.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 667 SPEEDIER PROCESSING REQUESTED We have asked both the State department of welfare and the fiscalagents to insure a more speedy method of processing claims as itappears that the bogging down occurs equally as much in both areas.We would like to request that a standardized set of procedures forall medical services under both title 18 and 19 be quickly implementedin line with the procedures that are followed with respect to 18 atpresent. In answer to the second question: Are medicare and Medi-Calprograms sufficient to provide the services to those people most inneed of the services? If not, what suggestions do you have for im-provement? Medicare is the most significant innovation in the American SocialSecurity system since 1935. It works especially well for most, thoughits major problem may be that it is contributing to a higher medicalcost for the nonaged as well as the aged. Ten percent of the aged are not eligible for social security pen-sions: After 1969, what happens to medical care for this percentage,which includes State and Federal Government retirees?We would like to recommend that all 65-year-olds be includedunder the Medi-Cal insurance provisions of medicare, irrespective oftheir lack of coverage by social security.In southern California 400,000 claims per year are made for medicalcare of the aged. This approximates a population of 32,000 persons permonth. Blue Shield, the fiscal agent for title 19, states that they arereceiving from 110,000 to 115,000 claims per day with 85,000 to 90,000under Medi-Cal for the aged. It would appear that Medi-Cal is being used as a secondary insur-ance plan for the elderly poor when medicare title 18 provisions havebeen exhausted. Compulsory hospitalization prior to a patient's move-ment into an extended care facility has filled existing hospital beds.It would appear that most of the aged poor are in need of lengthyinstitutional care due to inadequate home health care. CUSTODIAL NURSING HOMES We recommend that custodial nursing homes may be the answer tocostly care, relieving hospitals for immediate needs. Frequently, theaged poor are unable to pay the first day's deductible and, consequently,continue to use the emergency room of public hospitals for regularmedical needs. It has been projected that a patient entering a custodial nursinghome would remain there for his life expectancy, or about 41/2 years,since he would probably enter about age 82. We are urging title 18and 19 coverage of custodial nursing care and there are obvious rea-sons why nursing home and extended care facilities are often unableto accept Medi-Cal (title 19) patients who are aged and poor. Theyare described as being less intelligent, less sophisticated, and moredifficult to care for.668 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS We would wonder if this is not based on the differential in terms of revenue between the two programs per patient. Once again, we emphasize the need for standardizing in all States payments for care under title 18 and 19. In answer to question No. 4: \"What suggestions do you have for increasing health services manpower in a densely populated, essentially urban area, or are there now such shortages of manpower?\" Health services manpower in Los Angeles County is taken from the Los Angeles County Medical Society figures which include a total of 11,964 practitioners. Attached is a chart showing the actual breakdown in numbers and the ratio per 1,000 to the population.

Source: California Medical Association, Bureau of Research and Planning: Reference Book on Selected Health Man- power Data, tables 1 and 2, containing previously unpublished data provided by American Medical Association. We estimate that there are approximately 450 Negro practitioners in Los Angeles County with a large percentage working in public health or other clinical and group settings. Senator RANDOLPH. Just a moment, Mrs. Dudley. According to your written statement it is 350. Was there an error? Mrs. DuIDLEY. I am sorry; yes. It is 450. We are also aware of the very small number of minorities now in attendance at the major medical schools in this county, realizing that the decrease in medical manpower will be more keenly noted within the next 3 to 5 years. PARAMEDICAL TRAINING URGED We urge an expansion of paramedical training in the areas of home health aides, nursing and other allied fields. We have launched a pro- gram to help secure training for returning Vietnam veterans who served ably on the battlefield as medics. We hope that Hill-Burton funds could be extended to update and reclaim many of the existing medical facilities which are being phased out of use. Comprehensive health planning coupled with regional medical pro- grams for heart, cancer, and stroke must look carefully at the use of an incorporation of the paramedic in their plans for extending better health care to disabled and aged at the lowest level. Preventive multiphasic health screening at the community level appears to be an obvious solution to high medical costs as so clearly evidenced by group programs such as Kaiser Permanente Foundation of California and the HIP plan in New York. Effective delivery ofCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 669 any health service can only be measured in terms of care to the patient. 'When we discuss children and their health problems, we quickly look at the mortality rate of the area concerned. When we discuss the aged, we also examine the mortality rate, yet these crude death rates do not give us a true picture of the causesand effects. We must examine them for reasons. When the aged reach the hospital in extremis and die within a 24-hour period, we do not consider this a problem of the receivinghospital, but rather the nursing 'home that waited until the last moment to hospitalize the patient. Medical schools might extend their training to provide wardbound services in nursing homes in order to prevent patients having to enterthe hospital too early or too late. Senator RANDOLPH. Mrs. Dudley, the nursing homes that waiteduntil the last moment to hospitalize the patient-now, did the nurs-ing home do this because of its interest in making another dollar, orwas it because in the nursing home there was no one who realized the need of the patient for hospital care? Mrs. DUDLEY. I would not wish to indict all nursing homes in termsof that statement. But I do feel very strongly that many times the patients are sent to the hospital during the middle of the night, orduring periods when the doctor may not have been in the nursing home to look at the patient. I think that most treatments are at the request of the visiting physician who goes to the nursing home to see the patient-unless there is an accident-the patient falls out of the bed and breaks anarm, which is a very obvious infirmity that can only be taken carewithin the boundaries of a hospital. Senator RANDOLPH. Then you would relieve, in general, the nurs-ing home of the responsibility? Mrs. DUDLEY. Yes, I believe that most of the treatments are direc-ted by the visiting physician in that nursing home.Senator RANDOLPH. The reason I ask you that question is because you really hadn't differentiated here between the nursing home andthe physician who made the examination. Now, I am not trying to draw any comparisons-odious or other- wise. Mrs. DUDLEY. This is why I suggested that possibly the schools ofmedicine mnight use their training physicians to do ward rounds innursing homes as they are doing in some' of the training hospitals. Senator RANDOLPH. Thank you, Mrs. Dudley. (Subsequent to the hearing, Senator Williams asked the follow-ing questions in a letter to Mrs. Dudley:) 1. Mrs. Dudley's statement indicates that the California State Departmentof Welfare was asked to \"insure a more speedy method of processing claims.\"What was the reply to this inquiry? 2. May we have additional details on your program to help secure trainingfor returning Vietnam veterans who served in combat as medics? Would theirservices be especially helpful in providing services needed by the elderly withchronic illness, perhaps in nursing homes? 3. What is the \"differential in terms of revenue\" nursing care reimbursementunder the Medi-Cal and Medicare programs in California? 4. Has the OEO Neighborhood Health Center been of help in providing neededservices in ghetto areas? If so, would you care to see an extension of suchservices? 24-79S-69-pt. 3-5670 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS (The following reply was received:) 1. Enclosed is a copy of the letter which I wrote to Spencer Williams, Director of Human Relations, State of California.* His reply was: (1) that it was too costly to establish a computer center in Southern California, and (2) plans are underway for each certified recipient to have more than one eligibility card in order to facilitate faster service. Since our hearing before your committee, much has happened in California, relative to an investigation report of MediCal abuses by the office of the State Attorney General. I feel that as a result, changes in the processing of claims by the fiscal agent Blue Shield will be made. (See newspaper article attached.) 2. The Los Angeles Urban League has a Department of Veterans' Affairs. Meetings were held with the Director of the Veterans' Administration Hospital, Director of Para-medical training at the Lutheran Hospital and other educators in order to establish paramedical training centers for returning Vietnam vet- erans who had ably served as medics while on duty. State Senator Dymally, Chairman, Senate Health & Welfare Committee, introduced legislation (which is described in enclosed bill) to facilitate returning Veterans getting credit for their military training. We feel that those Veterans have a wealth of on-the-job training in paramedical care. There must be a transitional use of these men and women at a pay scale that would be inducing. I've noted that nursing homes have a high percentage of male nursing staff which is reflective of the acceptance by men of the paramedical professions. 3. Blue Shield and Blue Cross have described the \"differential in terms of revenue nursing care reimbursement\" as follows: Medicare-pays for costs incurred on a cost-plus basis. Medi-Cal-A ceiling is placed on care. California State Department of Finance allows a maximum of $14 per day. (Mlost facilities are paid at an average rate of $8 per day.) The fiscal intermediary sets the fee for each facility on the basis of information submitted by the facility. On January 1, 1969, all nursing home facilities will be certified under MediCal in the state; we questioned their efforts to weed out the less desirable facilities. 4. The Watts OEO Center, as well as others in the United States, are providing major health care to their communities. Barriers to acceptance of this care range from undemocratic geographic boundaries to over-subscribed emergency room use. Aged patients need immediate emergency treatment when threatening heart failure. Community multi-service units of health care offer this needed care. I would hope that multi-phasic, multi-service centers of health are to be a way of life in the future in America. Emphasis on multi-phasic screening for preventative health must be stressed as an important adjunct to this service. I hope that your four questions have been adequately answered. We have very definite feelings about the use of the returning veteran. and would hope that his role could be spelled out nationally in this field of health care. California has become receptive. The AMA Emergency Health Forum of 1968 was asked by me, to consider the use of the Veteran Medic also. They felt that the pay-scale for such services were much too low to induce their interest status and com- mensurate pay can be achieved, I think. Senator RANDOLPH-I. Dr. Littlejohn xvill now speak ito you regarding questions 1 and 3. STATEMENT OF CLARENCE G. LITTLEJOHN, M.D., FAAP, MEMBER, BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CHAIRMAN OF HEALTH COMMITTEE, URBAN LEAGUE OF GREATER LOS ANGELES Dr. LIyrLEJOHN. Honorable Chairman, Members of the subcom- mnittee, I am Dr. Clarence G. Littlejohn, member of the board of directors of the Los Angeles Urban League and the health chairman of this organization. I am practicing pediatrician and pediatrics cardiologist on the staff of several major and minor hospitals of the city. I am a volunteer pro- *See app. 1, p. 724.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 671 fessor at the USC School of Medicine. I am also involved in the blackcongress of the medical association of the medical society and the LosAngeles County Medical Association. As a major organization concerned with the health and welfare ofour community and our Nation, we are pleased to participate in thishearing, hoping that by such deliberations the impending crisis inhealth care of the poor and needy will be averted. The Medi-Cal program as presently administered actually promotesthe exodus of medical resources from the ghetto. More and more healthcare vendors are becoming disgusted with the program and phasingit out as an economic hazard. More and more recipients, frustrated intheir attempts to obtain health care near their homes, have returnedto the county corridors and/or neighborhood emergency rooms fordisjuncted, crisis-type medical care. Whly is this so? As a black physician, a product of the ghetto andas chairman of the Health Committee of Greater Los Angeles UrbanLeague, I have been intimately involved in health care of our com-munity and discussions of the same. The above observation continuesto prevail in spite of the numerous efforts of the health care vendorsof the black and brown communities, individually, and in groups,locally and in Sacramento, to rectify the inequities in the program sothat they might continue to take care of their people. Considerablesacrifices of time and money have been made by these vendors withonly minimal progress. iDr. Francisco Barbera was in the audience prior to the lunch break.He is a representative of the Mexican-American community. He lefta little document I would like to present to you.His business was that of attending other business meetings, theresult of which is to help subsidize his medical practice.The observations made herewith are based upon individual andgroup interviews and conferences with scores of physicians, dentists,pharmacists, other health care vendors, and Medi-Cal recipients. Thelong delays in payment, nonpayment of many justified services, har-assment of vendors, geographic discrimination in payment schedulesand the demeaning superscrutiny of claims of ghetto doctors-with the\"all those doctors in the ghetto are cheating, giving bad medicine, andmaking too much money\" attitude-are all contributing to the rapidreduction of health care services. Many health care vendors feel that those in charge are purposelyagain decimating the poor and needy by forcing -them to barter theirdignity for health care in crowded clinics and county corridors-par-ticularly in Los Angeles-often many miles a-way and receiving suchcare all too frequently in a demeaning, discourteous manner.Who suffers? The community. The recipient. The vendor is greatlyinconvenienced, but he can move out and become employed elsewhere.Health care among the disadvantaged approaches \"pre-Watts\"days. One of the lessons learned, hopefully, from the Watts conflagra-tion was that a large segment of the population of civilized Los Ange-les had been sorely neglected-particularly healthwise-but couldand would not be forever neglected. When the State administration announced its cuts, considerableconfusion, unrest and apprehension permeated the area. This feelingis again becoming more and more evident as more and more Medi-Calrecipients are frustrated in their attempts to obtain medical services.672 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Emergency rooms are having difficulty referring these patients for followup care to health care vendors in their respective communities. To many vendors, the Medi-Cal program is just too hazardous, economically. GHETTO PHYrSICIANS HARD-HIT Ghetto physicians and other vendors are hardest hit, but intimida- tion and fear of reprisals prevent many from speaking out. Some have practices consisting of over 95 percent welfare recipients. Most have had to hire more personnel just to handle the Medi-Cal paperwork. In spite of unfulfilled promise after promise on the part of CPS, many vendors have continued to empathize with the underprivileged, continuing their health care services. Many have exhausted their savings, have gone on to borrow thou- sands of dollars to make payroll and other expenses and/or lost their credit ratings, due to nonpayment or long-delayed payment of Medi- Cal claims. Entire clinics have closed up. Many pharmacists have closed and others are on the verge. Near-foreclosure on homes have occurred as well as actual repossession of doctors' office equipment. Banks have refused loans on accounts receivable from Medi-Cal due to inability to ascertain dates-and amounts-of payment. An economic lid is placed on the ghetto. This ceiling restricts the quality of employees, the adequacy of working conditions, the desira- bility of the physical structure of the office or establishment, and frequently the quality of service rendered. The unpredictability of payment-both time and amount-pre- cludes any planning, even short-range planning for health care facil- ities by private concerns. In such a blighted area, private enterprise should be encouraged, not discouraged. As vendors of services leave the area, they are not being replaced. More health care personnel become unemployed. The economic ceiling on the ghetto was recently endorsed by a county supervisor who was quoted by the Los Angeles Times as saying that private doctors should earn no more than $11,000 to $14,000 from taking care of county welfare cases. Computing this on a 40-hour week-most doctors work in excess of 50 hours a waeek-this is maximally $8 per hour, less than plumbers' fees and considerably less than attorneys' fees. Inequitable sub- standard fees imposed on the ghetto suggest a continuing desire to keep the ghetto poor. Rape of the ghetto of medical services is becoming increasingly evident as more and more vendors of health care are leaving the area. Many are locating on the periphery of the ghetto and are reducing their Medi-Cal participation as rapidly as their private practice in- creases. Others are moving to the periphery in order to increase the amount of Medi-Cal payments and decrease delays in the receipt of such payments. Some are seeing recipients only on certain days or at certain times during the day. Some are outright refusing to see recipients. Con- tinuity of medical care is becoming nonexistent. Community hospitals are having increased difficulty obtaining consultants in upgradingCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 673 medical care at the community level and with Los Angeles so spread out, this is profoundly tragic. MOONLIGHTING PHYSICIANS Moonlighting in Watts and east Los Angeles is becoming more prevalent and it is as evil as the absentee landlord system. All toofrequently, the moonlighting physician is not available more than one-half to 1 day per week for followiup, and emergency rooms, orthe few doctors left in the ghetto are asked to perform this service. The moonlighting vendor is frequently from an area with ahigher unit-fee for service-rating by the Medi-Cal program and,of course, bills from his office-so located. Denial of equal job opportunity is inherent in these inequitable andprobably illegal disparities. Discriminatory and severe reviews of claims of major providers ofservices to the poor frequently cause interminable delays in paymentsand denial of payments for substantiated services. Many cuts and deletions appear capricious, arbitrary, and certainly discriminatory.For example: two comparably trained physicians billing for com- parable services on patients in the same hospital side by side in the same room may receive different fees dependent upon the location oftheir billing office in Los Angeles County. Frequently, in the same batch of claims returned to vendors, there may be three or more different fees for the same item or service num-ber. These claims are supposedly reviewed by peers. The whimsical nature and arbitrariness of cuts, particularly of claims from ghetto physicians, suggest lack of guidelines and/or the political philosophies and prejudices creeping into the judgments of some reviewers. It alsosuggests that many reviewers are ill-informed and/or insensitive tothe health care among people of poverty. This system must be improved. Financial and tax incentives are being suggested as means of attract- ing more dedicated businesses, teachers and other needs of the ghetto. The health care vendors have not asked for nor do they expect any suchincentive. The vast majority are dedicated men and women who want only equal job opportunity to help to provide equal health opportunityto those who so drastically need it. PHYSICIANS FEES DEFENDED Here I would like to make a comment about the much-discussed andprobably too-much-discussed fees. It was pointed out by one of thespeakers that over a thousand doctors in California made $70,000 to $100,000. Just some quick computations on that. You take the average doctorworking 50 hours per week. This averages out to $12-the gross isusually about 50 percent-I mean, the net is about 50 percent of thegross. This averages about $12 to $15 per hour. Even the doctor who makes $100,000 does not get more than $20 perhour. Now, the county medical association-the California Medical Asso-ciation-did some investigation, and these figures were published, and674 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS it was found that many of these claims were filed by doctors who hired two or more doctors under the same vendor number. This is highly emphasized, somewhat to the discredit of these physicians. Now, also, Dr. Todd pointed out quite clearly that less than one in 1,800 doctors had been found to be guilty of these practices. So I think the scapegoat has to stop, and I think some inequities have to stop, and some serious planning has to go into at least making the Medi-Cal program available to people who need it. The ghetto is suffering because of these inequities, and we are ask- ing, frankly, that special attention be given to the ghetto in the process- ing of claims, so that the people in the ghetto will not suffer from lack of services. I would like to introduce Dr. Phillip Smith, who is a member of the Drew Medical Society, which is the Los Angeles wing of the na- tional society. Senator RANDOLPII. Yes, Doctor, we would be pleased to have you speak briefly. STATEMENT OF DR. PHILLIP M. SMITH, VICE PRESIDENT, CHARLES R. DREW MEDICAL SOCIETY Dr. S3IITH. I only came down to substantiate the statement that Dr. Littlejohn made. The Drew Medical Society-the Los Angeles chapter of the National Society-is interested in getting medical services to the. ghetto area. As President Johnson stated at our meeting in Houston, one of the rights of people of the ghetto-of all people-is the right to adequate health. Health services in the area cannot be given equally, and people can- not be placed in the mainstream of medicine unless we have equal opportunities for everyone involved. In stating reasons for medicaid to the aged, there are hospitals in the Los Angeles area which will not admit medicare patients-if a black physician has this medicare patient-this patient is discriminated against. These have to be taken care of. Theme are some hospitals, also, in the Los Angeles area which will not-which have a limitation-who will not admit black physicians to their staff, but yet and still, they can have a medicare patient ad- mitted-one or two token-and this is discriminating against the physician. We are not thinking about physicians-we are thinking about the people the physicians treat. Once you discriminate against the physi- cian, then you don't think about him, you think about the people he is treating, and these are the people we want to put into the main- stream of medicine. Also, as one speaker stated about the fees-it is almost as though he feels that the doctor goes out and recruits patients. You must re- member that in the ghetto area the physicians are in an area where the people are indigent. They were attracted there before the bill came out-like my practice is there-and one must realize the truth at that time.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 675 OUTSIDE MIEDICAL RELIEF They had a system at that time called the OMR-outside medical relief. These doctors donated time-which, I have a card in my pocket which says, \"You will treat these patients without any profits.\" Well, they had thousands of these type of cases which you were treating for $3 a visit. At the time of medicare, all these patients were referred to medicaid patients. So you already had free patients in your practice. It must be stated also that we are interested in care for the patient. If the doctor is working hard enough to warrant his fees-his money- then it should be given to him. If you look at previous statements made by another person, you would feel that the cost of care is the most important. If the doctor is making $200,000 a year and giving quality care, I don't see why anyone should care. Senator RANDOLPH. Thank you very, very much, Dr. Smith, Dr. Littlejohn, and Mrs. Dudley. Your information you have given and your comments that you have set forth will be most carefully considered by the members of the subcommittee and the committee on aging. I want you to know that even though we appear somewhat hurried as you gave your testimony, that will not be so when we go over what you have said, and attempt to evaluate it. And certainly, we shall not only find it informative, but challenging, as we do our work. Thank you very much. Mrs. DUDLEY. Thank you. Dr. LirrIEJo-N. Thank you. Senator RAN-DOLPH. Mr. Mfulder. Mr. Mulder, you were present earlier today when the speaker of the assembly. Jesse Unruh, read his statement and made addi- tional comment and answered questions from the members of the com- mlittee-and the colloquy-do you recall his statements? Air. MOLDER. In general, yes, sir. Senator RANDOLPH. *Would you have any comment-rebuttal, or what woutld vou describe from your standpoint as the errors or mis- takes, inaccuracies, or whatnot, if there were any, in his statement? Mr. MItLDER. There are a few observations I would like to make for the record. STATEMENT OF CAREL E. H. MULDER, DIRECTOR, CALIFORNIA DE- PARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES, HUMAN RELATIONS AGENCY Mr. MIULDER. My name is Carel Mulder. I am the director of the department of health care services. I am a career public servant- 21 years in public welfare, and 11 years in health care. I would like the committee members to have a few points under- stood about the Medi-Cal program which may have escaped you in the course of the day.676 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS One of these is you might believe that Medi-Cal does not provide preventive services. I must tell you that Medi-Cal strongly supports preventive services-that the instructions to social workers are that people who do not have a personal physician, must be encouraged to seek such a personal physician, to undergo examination in order that any illness may be detected early and be subject to treatment when it can be treated sensibly and with a good chance of success. The main problem with the program in the past has been the ex- treme haste with which it was put into operation. The fiscal inter- mediary testified this morning about the contract: the contract was entered into just a few weeks before the operation was to start Senator RANDOLPH. Am I correct in saying not only the haste, but to a certain degree the magnitude of the problem of a State like California-and I am not attempting to lead the witness-but would you say that that is a problem, as well as the haste with which you stress Mr. MULDER. It is, indeed. It continues to be a problem. We have made many improvements in the operation of the system. The claims processing is going a great deal faster than it has. There has been much more emphasis on the medical audit. We now have operating in most counties very active peer review committees. Not only in the field of medicine, but for other fields as well. MEDI-CAL COM1PLEMENTARY TO MEDICARE Another observation I would like to make is that with respect to the aged, Medi-Cal is really a complementary resource to medicare; that the majority of the care received by the aged is really medicare- financed, rather than by Medi-Cal. The speaker this morning spoke about the problem around reim- bursement for physicians and indicated that there had been a stead- fast refusal on the part of the Governor to consider a fee schedule for physicians' services. In that connection, the committee should know that the law which was enacted before Governor Reagan took office contains the require- ment that payment be made on the basis of \"reasonable charges\" and that these reasonable charges are to be determined in relation to the individual physician's usual charge-customary within the locality- and within the prevailing charges in the locality. Senator RANDOLPH. When was that law passed? Mr. MULDER. It was passed in November of 1965, and became op- erative on March 1 of 1966. The fee language is the same as the fee language which is in title 18, the medicare program. The legislature did have opportunity for re- viewing the method of payment to physicians. Two committees gave it their attention and fee schedules were considered by legislative committees, and they did not proceed with them. It has been our position that with, respect to a fee schedule, if it is to provide adequate payment for the average physician, this will happen: that the physicians who customarily charge below the aver- age will immediately move up to the average, and that physicians who customarily charge above the average will become disinclined to participate in the program, if it doesn't provide them with their usual fees.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 677 And the end result is that you pay the same, except that you pay it to fewer physicians who are predominantly, usually, charging lower. And the end result we felt would not be substantially different in terms of outlay. Another observation with respect to some of the testimony of this morning: reference was made to utilization surveillance. Lest there be any misunderstanding, the system which Dr. Breslow, when he wag director of public health, instituted in the early stages of the program still exists. We do receive paid claims which are arranged in month of service order, and these records are reviewed to detect any pattern of care that appears to deviate from the accepted community norm. Anything that looks deviant is referred to Blue Shield, where it is again subjected to medical audit, and then may go to the peer review committees that were described by Dr. Todd this morning. Likewise, in our office, we receive complaints from a variety of sources, such as the licensing boards-indications that something may be wrong-and wherever professional judgment is needed to deter- mine what went wrong and what should be done about it, we use these peer review committees. SAN JOAQUIN COST REVIEW PROJECT In fact, in one area, the San Joaquin valley-the northern part of the valley-we are experimenting with an even deeper type of review. As was indicated this morning, physicians services constitute only 19 or 20 percent of the medical care dollar that is paid in Medi-Cal. On the other hand, about 75 percent of the dollars are for services which have been ordered or prescribed or recommended by physicians. Therefore, a review of the physicians billings is really not sufficient to determine if there is economical and conscientious use of the program. In the San Joaquin project, which is operated by the foundation for medical care, records are reviewed with respect to all of the serv- ices so there is an intensive review of hospital utilization, drug pre- scriptions, and so on. This offers a much greater promise for control than we have found in the past, and if this will work, and if it is not too expensive-we have to balance cost against the result-we hope to expand it to other areas. We also want to expand the prepayment concept which is being ex- perimented with in San Joaquin Medical Foundation as well. It was said this morning that Governor Reagan would like to see Medi-Cal scratched. I want to assure you this is not so. The gov- ernor has observed from time to time that the Medi-Cal program is a problem which needs much tighter control, and it needs much, much improvement. We have been working toward that improvement and in cooperation with the provider organizations, we have better controls. The legislature has been responsive in approving legislation which will enable us to exercise more controls and to require prior authoriza- tion for certain services where this is warranted, and has also given us the means in case we do run short of money to have an orderly readjustment of the services in the program.678 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS If there are any other questions that you may have I will be glad to answer them. If I don't have the answers, we would be glad to fuirnish them to you in writing. Senator RANDOLPH. Thank you, Mr. Mul der. This committee now, I believe I will be speaking appropriately for all members, we are in novise interested in the politics of a par- ticular situation nor in the personalities involved in such a situation.We must, however, probe, search. This is our function. And the hear- ing is for that purpose as well as hearing testimony. So, when we hear the conflicting viewpoints, it is necessary that we attempt to have a presentation-even, perhaps, a rebuttal, if we wish to call it that-to keep the balance. And I personally am not so concerned-and I say this to our au- dience as well as to the witness-I am not so concerned with differ- ences. I am concerned only when people are indifferent. And that iswhat I want to find out-if there is a difference, yes, I have that with my colleagues who sit here at my right today. As I earlier sat here today. We do not vote all the same on all questions, but I can say for himthat he is not indifferent to this subject matter-as well as other sub- ject matter in the Congress. And I think, by and large, that would be said of the Members of the Senate-the body to which we belong. And so, if we can, with a spirit of objectivity, we can have view- points expressed as we have here today and not allow them to go off into tangents, but to keep at least on the body of *the substance of what we are talking about, then it is a service to us, frankly, when we have these different viewpoints that are expressed here today. I would not want the viewpoints to flow from imagined problems, you understand. We, in this country, can often create crisis. I don'twant to get into that-that's another subject-but we want to be very careful to deal with the substantive matters. I know our chairman feels that way, and I know all the members of the committee feel that way. And so, I think it is constructive that we have the discussion which we have had, not only from Speaker Unruh, but from Mr. Mulderand perhaps others who are contributing to the dialog here today. This is highly important. Yes, Congress passes legislation. Theintent is written, and then often the agency or agencies involved will not administer the law as perhaps we in the Congress really intended. This has happened many times, and we have to have an oversight committee to check up and to see, \"Now, is the agency carrying outthe law as intended by the membership that passed it?\" And so you see why conflicts often arise in these areas. I would hope that out of this hearing, and I will be speaking for all members, par- ticularly for our chairman, who of necessity is absent at this time,that we want the facts insofar as we can determine the facts. And we want to move forward to correct the inequities whenever those inequities have been substantiated by fact. This is very impor- tant. I think it is an obligation. As we go back on Capitol Hill, as we review not only the problem here in the immediate Los Angeles area, but in California.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 679 Well, perhaps I have talked too long about this, but I want the record to reflect that there is a purpose in the committee other thanto write legislation, but then, to go out into the countryside, as it were,and to see how the legislation actually, in operation, is coping withthe problems-sometimes solving the problems. In other words, acommitment which is a continuing one, with the necessity always, Irealize, for review and perhaps extension and refinement of the lawwhich may have been placed on the statute books at the outset. And I thank all those who have contributed today in this spirit inthis context. Mr. ORIOL. Were there any other comments you wanted to makeat this time, Mr. Mulder? Mr. MULDER. No; I was ready to answer any questions that thecommittee staff may have. Mr. ORIOL. Did you say that Medi-Cal participants are given screen-ing of some sort-a physical, requirement? Mr. MULDER. No; I wouldn't go that far. I say that, in California, w.7e have attempted to have in Medi-Cal a program that utilizes themainstream of health care services, so that people, whether they arepoor or rich can use this system-the available resources-the sameway. Mr. ORIOL. That is why I raised the question. I thought you wererequiring this on a wide scale. I wanted to ask whether you have the facilities to do it with.Mr. MULDER. No; we do not require it. We strongly recommend thateach person in the program have a personal physician, and if that physician believes that this should be done-some screening should bedone-the program will provide that. Mr. ORIOL. Well, when you said screening, I immediately thoughtof multiphasic screening on a scheduled basis. Mr. MULDER. Well, we do not have that. Mr. ORIOL. Do you feel there is need for more of that type of facil-ity within California, and if so, what age groups do you think itwould most benefit? SANTA CRuz EXPERIMENT Mr. MULDER. Well, there was a very successful experiment in SantaCruz County, many years ago, where applicants for old age assistancewere given opportunity, at the Public Health Department, for a bat-tery of tests the results of which would then be sent to their personalphysician. To the extent that there is manpower and that facilities are avail-able, I would like to see that extended, indeed. The physicians inSanta Cruz found this very helpful, and it helped the aged personswho had not yet sought out a physician, to do so. With the old pro-gram, the problem was that we only paid for the treatment of illness.It did not pay, at that time, prior to 1966, for diagnostic examinationsin the absence of symptoms. Mr. ORIOL. I have another question.680 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS If this is not properly addressed to you perhaps you could indicate that, and we will send it by mail to whomever you suggest. The San Francisco Chronicle of October 10 carried a story about a study showing that the death rate of elderly patients went up alarm- ingly after they were removed-and apparently with some amount of haste-from Stockton State Mental Hospital. The study showed that the death rate was 27 percent higher than of those who stayed in the hospital. I believe this was part of the hospital population reduction program, but this sort of study raises some questions, I would think, about that project. We will also address some questions by mail to the author of that study and will ask him some questions, too, but have you anything to discuss with us? Mr. MULDFR. No, I amn not conversant with the article to which you refer. I suggest you address the question to Dr. James Lowry, the director of mental hygiene in Sacramento. Mr. ORIOL. We will do that. Without objection, we will enter that article in the record. (The information follows:) [From the San Francisco Chronicle, Oct. 10, 1968] MENTAL HOSPITAL MOVE-STARTLING STUDY OF AGED (By Carolyn Anspacher) The death rate of elderly patients, abruptly removed from Stockton State Mental Hospital under orders of the State Department of Mental Hygiene has shot up alarmingly since the \"Hospital Population Reduction Project\" was in- augurated last January. According to a new, and carefully controlled study of geriatric psychiatric patient transfers, the mortality rate of the most helpless who had been removed to -nursing homes and convalescent hospitals ran 27 per cent higher than those allowed to remain in the familiar hospital setting. The research project was undertaken by Eldon C. Killian, a member of the Academy of Certified Social Workers, and a psychiatric social worker at Stock- ton 'State Hospital. It is being submitted with hospital approval to \"Social Work\", the authoritative scientific journal of the profession. He began his research last January when it was decided in Sacramento that the entire north area of Stockton State Hospital should be deactivated and, within the year, some 50 to 60 per cent of the slightly more than 800 geriatric patients moved out in a series of \"waves\". Some according to the transfer plan, were to be taken to other \"less crowded\" mental hospitals-Agnews, Modesto or Napa. Some were to go to nursing homes, convalescent hospitals, boarding homes or guests homes and family care homes. And some were to be kept at Stockton in south area wards. For his study, Killian took three separate groups. The first group totaled 71 males and 8 female geriatric patients who were transferred by chartered bus from Stockton to other state hospitals during the first three months of this year. The second groups, 21 male and 44 female geriatric patients (40 per cent of whom were non-ambulatory) were taken by ambulances and autos to \"extramural facilities\"-nursing homes, convalescent hospitals and the like. The third group, 52 men and 57 women, remained at Stockton State Hospital, but in otbor areas of the institution. An equal number of geriatric patients was selected from the hospital's Jan- uary 1, 1967 census and each matched to those in the 1968 study group as to age, sex, race, organic or functional diagnosis length of hospitalization and ambulatory or non-ambulatory status. Killian, found that the mortality rate was 4.98 times higher for the experimen- tal group transferred from Stockton to other psychiatric hospitals than for its \"control group\".COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 681 \"The mortality jumps even more dramatically to 8.99 times higher for the experimental group transferred to other extramural facilities than for its control group,\" Killian noted. \"Nine out of 65 died in this group during the four month followup, as com- pared toll out of 65 in its control group.\" Killian's study shows that in the second experimental group-those transferred to non-State homes and convalescent hospitals-26 out of the 65 patients were bedridden at the time and of these 26, seven died within the four-month follow up period. This was 27 per cent of the group. Killian has concluded that the older, non-ambulatory, hospitalized geriatric patients who were transferred out of their hospital home (and some had lived at Stockton for a great portion of their lives) had a significantly higher mor- tality rate than the base rate of matched control patients who had not been transferred. Killian believes that on the basis of his study, the mass unilateral transfers of old bedridden psychiatric patients from State hospitals can be seriously questioned. \"Is it possible,\" he asks at the conclusion of his paper, \"or an individual's environment to assume so much importance, in this case for the geriatric pa- tient, that upon sudden removal from it, his body functions may be affected by the emotional trauma, including death?\" And finally, as a footnote not included in his study, Killian added that on September 20, while the walls of his ward were being torn down around him, one elderly male patient at Stockton refused to leave. He was put into an ambu- lance and was dead on arrival at another area of the hospital. The death was attributed, not to grief nor shock, but to natural causes. Mr. ORIOL. Another question coming from the San Francisco Chron- icle of September 20 quoted you as saying that you agree with Governor Reagan's other earlier estimates of deficits in the Medi-Cal program. And, I understand that there was supposed to be a surplus, as of last June 30. Is there a contradiction here? if so, what is it? This is a knotty question. Perhaps you would rather do it in writing, but if you want to discuss it here for awhile, let's do that. Mr. MuLDER. Well, as I indicated, the program was started with great haste. The machinery was not perfect. There were delays in the processing of bills. There were delays in the compilation of the neces- sary statistical records which can be used for trending later. The law provided that any provider of services could hold his bill for 6 months before sending it in. As a result, in the spring of 1967, we had an extremely poor body of information on which to make the projections. We did make the projections. We did the best we could. We consulted experts in the field, actuaries, who agreed that with the data we had, these estimates were not unreasonable. Now, these estimates have turned out to be on the high side, but not as high as some people have said. Because when we found out that we were in difficulty, we took other actions as well. GOVER-NoR's TASK FORCE The Governor had appointed a survey task force which was con- tributed by private industry and in which permanent people in the medical association participated, and they made a number of recom- mendations as to changes that ought to be made in the medical program. These changes have been implemented and are still being implemented. The system has been improved in terms of the hardware and planning for the payment process. Some legislation was introduced and passed which deferred certain obligations which would be due under an accrual basis, to the next682 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS year on a modified accrual basis. And, as a result of all of this, we were able to live well within the budget. In the current year we are within the budget. From the better body of information we now have, it is our estimate that unless there are unforeseen contingencies, like the Long amend- ment-which we fortunately averted-that if these things do not happen, we will live through the year without the difficulties we have had in the past. Mr. ORIOL. No deficit? But, will there be a surplus of any kind? I don't understand what a surplus in a program of this kind is. Mr. MULDER. We operate on a closed-end appropriation as dis- tinguished from the Federal medicaid program appropriation. The program is financed by Federal funds to the extent that the certified people are eligible untder the Federal law and regulations. There is also local participation from counties. The local participation from counties, as I think Mr. Unruh touched upon this morning, is frozen substantially at the 64-65 level. Therefore, any increase in either the count of recipients or an increase in the utilization of the program, or an increase in the cost of the program, by and large, becomes a matter of 50 percent by the Federal Government and 50 percent by the State. And the counties do not share in this increased cost. And that's whv the pressure on the General Fund in this program is much heavier in an inflationary period than the pressure of normal programs. Mr. ORIOL. As we review the testimony, we probably will have other questions which we will submit by mail. Mr. Skoien is with you. Mr. Skoien and Miss Russell have been very helpful on this committee as they have been in other projects, and we appreciate it. I am glad to see you. (Subsequent to the hearing, Senator Williams asked the following questions in a letter to Mr. Mulder:) 1. I believe you were present when Mrs. Dudley, Dr. Littlejohn, and Dr. Smith gave their testimony (a copy of MIrs. Dudley's statement is enclosed.) You may remember that Mrs. Dudley said that she has written to the State Department of Welfare and the fiscal agents to assure a more speedy method of processing claims from so-called ghetto areas under Medi-Cal. Mrs. Dudley and her as- sociates presented an alarming description of wholesale departures by physicians from such areas because of such difficulties. I would like to have your comments in response to these statements. 2. Your statement emphasized that social workers under the MIedi-Cal program are instructed to encourage Miedi-Cal participants to seek the services of a per- sonal physician, with special emphasis on the need for preventive services. W hat information do you have as to the availability of such services, particularly in low-income areas? What preventive health services are available for the elderly under the Medi-Cal program? 3. You mentioned that physicians services constitute only about 19 to 20 per- cent of the Medi-Cal dollar. May we have details on expenditures for other serv- ices or care, with special reference to health care services of special importance to the elderly? 4. Have you yet decided whether the San Joaquin Medical Foundation pro- cedures will be applied on a broader scale in California? If so, what are likely areas of use? (The following reply was received:)COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 683 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES, ;5acramaiento, Calif., November 27, 196S.t ~* e * * * DEARt SENATOR AVILLIA.IS: As my extemporaneous testimony at the hearing indicates, Governor Reagan and his Administration are not opposed to publicly financed programs to provide needed health care to individuals and families who have insufficient resources. He has taken a dim view, however, of federal legislation which pushes states into massive programs which, by their very nature, tend to increase health care costs generally. In addition, the previous Administration and the Legislaturehad set a far too early effective date for the program which did not permit a well planned organization and system for its administration, so that when the Gov-ernor took office he inherited a most undesirable and inefficient operation. The fiscal controversy of 1967 was the result of insufficient planning for the gathering and use of cost data. The fact that the fiscal year was concluded within the budget was not solely because of previous overestimation but largely the result of administrative actions taken by the Administration and constructive legislation worked out on a non-partisan basis. The Speaker's statement that the Governor preferred to eliminate the medically indigent from the program is not correct. The Supreme Court, which interpreted the statute which the Gov- ernor inherited, clearly ruled that this was the only course the Administration was permitted to take. Since the Administration was unalterably opposed to this step it asked for alternate orderly means of reducing program costs; the 1968session fortunately did agree that the Administration should have more flexi- bility and passed legislation to that effect. The Committee's record already contains my correction that the Governor has not \"steadfastly refused even to consider the threat of imposing a fee schedule\" on physicians; the 1965 law clearly contains the provision that physicians, asdistinguished from other providers of services, should be paid on the basis of their usual and customary fees. Many of the statements made by the Speaker meet with our full agreement. We most certainly share his concern that the Congress should not retroactively and without notice reduce federal support of the state-operated assistance andhealth care programs Our principal effort should be directed to an improvement of the existing program, particularly in terms of controls, so that fraud, abuse,and inapproriate utilization of program benefits can be eradicated. You have also asked that I express myself on four questions appended to your letter. 1. The witnesses were correct that payments through the fiscal intermediaries,until recently, have been quite slow. For several months, however, we have de-termined that the properly completed claim which raises no question regarding utilization or propriety of fee is paid within 30 working days. The claims processing system does not distinguish between providers in so- called ghetto areas and those from other parts of the community. We do realize, of course, that a physician whose major part of the practice is composed of Medi- Cal patients has been more seriously affected by slow payments than other physi- cians. In cases where hardships were determined to exist the fiscal intermediary has been authorized to make interim payments. Although we too have heard that physicians are moving from impoverished areas, we have not been able to verify this, and doubt very much if the MIedi-Calprogram is the real cause of any relocation of their offices. AVAILABILITY OF PHYSICIANS' SERVICES 2. Physician participation in Medi-Cal is relatively high; almost 90% of allpracticing physicians participate to some degree, although we recognize that themajority of service is still provided by relatively few physicians. The availability of physician services in poverty areas is still less than elsewhere but we havenoted a marked increase in the number of physicians adjacent to such areas.684 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS As to the manpower availability for preventive health services, we can only guess. Such preventive services as are professionally recognized as part of the community pattern of practice are payable through the MAedi-Cal program. The extent that these services are actually furnished depends, therefore, upon the time and interest on the part of the individual practitioner and on the success of the admittedly limited health education activities in which the social work staff engages. 3. A distribution of the dollar expenditures by type of service is attached, both in table and in chart form. In reviewing this material it should be borne in mind that the Medi-Cal program is a supplementary resource to the aged and that the distribution does not include payments made on their behalf through the Medicare program. 4. The San Joaquin Medical Foundation approach of comprehensive review of all services furnished or generated by physicians is still under formal study. It is not possible to determine the advisability of wider application until more data has been collected and evaluated. Results of our initial evaluation are expected to become available by mid-1969. I have a strong suspicion this approach can be applied economically only if it is accompanied by the establishment of an effective EDP system for the compilation of profiles, both for patients and providers of service.

SKOIEN, JR., EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING Mr. SKOIEN. The only thing that I am going to repeat and empha- size is not only that statement this morning by Mrs. Russell, but also re-emphasize that California is the forerunner in these programs for health ca-re for our senior citizens. We must utilize the seniors in their own health programs, and we will mobilize-and must mobilize-and motivate the existing public and private agencies to recognize the need and then proceed. This is being done today by the California Commission on Aging at the level of the local community. The Reagan administration is endeavoring to provide California with a sound administrative program for the citizens of our State. Thank you. Mr. ORioL. Thank you very, very much. Our next witness is another person who has been very helpful to the committee. Dr. Elsie Giorgi from the School of Medicine at USC. You have a time problem. I hope we haven't caused you too big a time problem. STATEMENT OF DR. ELSIE A. GIORGI, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES, CALIF. Dr. GIORGI. I don't mind if you don't. At your request, I have pre- pared a statement. Before I start, however, I should like to make a few comments-if I may. Today, I have 'been impressed with the great interest and concern of all who have appeared here. It is obvious that there is agreement as to the need for change. I must say, however, that I have been dis- appointedl by the emphasis on funds rather than programs. We have much evidence that funds are no guarantee of service. This was particu- larly true of State government representatives. Mr. Mulder, for ex- ample, spoke of preventive care services for the elderly. He spoke about such services as if they were an actuality. Something Mr. Gal- braith refers to as \"word-fact\". Where are those serv ices? If they are present, they are certainly invisible. During the past 5 years, I have participated in many similar dis- cussions. We constantly talk, exchange ideas, and plan ad infinitum- and then nothing of significance happens. I think it's time to stop talking, stop blaming, and start doing. I hope this once, it will be different. I hope this committee will see to that. For the first time, I sense a motivation for doing. For the first time, I am encouraged. That's why I'm here. PROJECTED SHORTAGES AND COSTS We really have no choice. We are at least 40 years behind. Unless we join forces toward the common goal of improved health care for our people, I do not think it is an exaggeration to predict that within the next 5 years, shortages will be so great, and costs so high that weCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMIERICANS 687 will have a black market in medicine with care extended only tothose who can pay exorbitant amounts or who are agreeable to payingunder the table in governmnent funded programs. No amount of additional funds will help. Until we design newsystems; train new types of health manpower; effectively coordinatewhat is already there; and provide dynamic health education-thoseadditional funds will only serve to further inflate costs without im-proving or providing adequate health care services. 'We have alreadyseen this happen. We don't need more of the same. I think an impor-tant step would be to consider health facilities public utilities-sub-ject to the same type of surveillance and regulation as publicutilities. Why not? Health care is at least as important as our tele-phone and electric services. If such a system did nothing but preventunnecessary duplication down the line-wre would be well on ourway to curtailing costs. This does not necessarily imply socializedmedicine or government medicine. It would merely provide a muchneeded systems approach which the medical sector seems unable orunwilling to undertake. It is time for them to stop resisting newknowledge. I appreciate your invitation to appear before your subcommittee onHealth of the Elderly, with particular reference to the costs and de-livery of health services to older Americans. I would like it clearlyunderstood that my remarks are my own, and not to be interpretedas representative of any institution or organization with which I amaffiliated. TOTAL HEALTH At the outset, let me say that I find it impossible to confine my pres-entation to the elderly, since the health care of any age group reallystarts from birth or even before that. Man is inseparable not only fromhis physical and psychosocial environment, but also from his geneticinheritance. Total health involves careful attention to all of these inan integrated continuing and coordinated program. Neglect at anystage of growth and development requires increasingly heroic meas-ures for correction of defects in later years. Dr. Robert Kemp expressedit exceedingly well. In speaking of the care of the previously neglectedaging individual, he said-Why fix eyes that no longer want to see-why fix feet that no longer want to walk? I certainly concur. HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM cNEGLECTED Equally neglected is this Nation's health care delivery system. Itis now so sick and disorganized that nothing but heroic measures canpossibly bring some order out of the chaos and ferment. I shall notbore you with a repetition of its inadequacies and inequities. Theseare already well known to you. Instead, I should like to devote thisbrief time to some comments on our almost hopelessly ineffectiveapproach to correction of the defects and to some suggested alterna-tive methods. The current state of affairs did not happen overnight. In 1925, fully40 years ago, the distinguished Dr. William Welch bemoaned the everwidening gap between highly advanced medical research and its clini-cal application. We have had no real change in medicine since themonumental Flexner studies of 1910-11. Dr. Flexner's assumption that688 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS advanced scientific research and education would automatically result in quality care has not been borne out. What is sorely needed right now is a clinical revolution-counterpart of the scientific revolution that followed the Flexner report. I do not intend revolution in an anarchistic sense, but rather to imply rapid change, for we are at least 40 years behind. What has brought about this sudden state of emergency? Many things, to be sure-but principally an enlightened public made aware of its right to good health, chiefly through medicare. That piece of legislation stimulated demand by providing funds and public educa- tion. It focused attention on the fact that funds do not necessarily pro- vide services. There are some who argue-was it wise to precipitate such a situa- tion; to stimulate demand before services were available? Those who are concerned with quality and cost of care should not have wanted it any other way-for demand stimulates supply. If medicare accom- plished nothing but this-and indeed it has done much more-it could rest on its laurels. Without its impact, we would most assuredly have continued as we were; each year losing ground progressively and pay- ing more for less, while morbidity figures increase steadily as glaring evidence of our deficiencies-especially when compared with other nations of far less affluence and technologic skills. Mr. ORIOL. May I interrupt, Dr. Giorgi ? May I also say that demand might stimulate inflation-there are those who say that this sudden calling for services has caused too much demand for too little supply. Dr. GIORGI. I think you are right. Demand in excess of supply in- flates the cost. It always does-but it soon levels out because it outprices itself out of the market. I'm afraid that's what is currently happening to our prepaid health insurance plans. Any good which might be inherent in them is nullified when it becomes too expensive and unrea- sonable and untenable in costs. But there soon comes an end to that or it must go out of existence. This Nation possesses the greatest potential for total and compre- hensive health care. It boasts of the finest facilities, equipment, health manpower, and a generous national budget-all for the most part in advantageous ratio to population. What is needed is coordination of what is already there, and effective health education toward better health practices, as well as toward optimum use of existing services. Instead, we keep adding instant new programs, for the most part hastily and poorly thought out, which usually serve to further dilute our resources. OVERDIAGNOSED AND UNDERTREATED In medical school, we learned that diagnosis puts us well on the way to treatment and recovery when cure is possible. We have repeatedly and effectively diagnosed the ills of our health care delivery system. They are not incurable. We should be well on the way to treatment and recovery-Instead, we persist in studying them over and over again. We are overdiagnosed and undertreated. It has become obvious that current major governmental planning funds under Public Laws 89-239, 89-749, and even the National Center for Health Service Research and Development, are being allocated predominantly to more diagnosis, to education of the medical sector, and to training of planners. It is also obvious that the term \"partner-COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 689 ship for planning\" intended to involve-in the words of Dr. WilliamStewart-\"by no means only the medical sector\"-and not \"the sameold card players around the same old table\"-is rapidly doing just the opposite. Continued subsidy of existing institutions such as medical andpublic health schools has not, in the past, been effective in promotinadequate or significant change. Why do we expect it to do so nowlTheir role as advisers, educators, and their contributions in identifying unmet needs, are most valuable, indeed-but we cannot continue tooverlook the fact that such institutions are not service oriented andnot activists in a true sense. RECOMMtENDED CHANGES What we need is to apply what those institutions have so effectively studied and diagnosed in the past. Basically, what is needed is a reallo-cation of existing resources into a coordinated, unified health caredelivery system-and we need it right now. To this end, why not channel a good part of those funds to activistservice groups such as associations of health professionals? Why notenlist the expertise of the medical, dental, and public health schoolsto assist those groups in planning services based on what is alreadyknown? Why not grant fellowships under sponsorship of educationaland allied institutions to individuals who are adept at planning, andat grantsmanship-with a view to assigning them to work with suchgroups toward implementation of alternative health care deliverymodels? To be sure, we are told that such planning funds are available under section 314E of Public Law 89-749-but to my knowledge, theyare not very visible and those who might put such funds to use arejust not good at drawing up proposals. I have no objection to educa-tional institutions continuing their studies and their teaching ofplanners. I would just like to see them extend into the communityand help other groups design service programs-both are of equalimportance-and what better way to train planners than in the frame-work of service. Why not have them also make contact with future doctors and dentists, at the medical school and residency training level, encourag-ing them to understand and consider participation in new approachesto delivery of health care services? All of these would distribute funds and enhance participation atthe service level-far more effective than continued study and plan-ning at the institutional level, virtually in splendid isolation fromcurrent and future health practitioners. I am being repeatedly requested by medical students, by medicalresidents in their last year of training, by practicing physicians, by large consumer groups such as Union-Management, and more recentlyby large scale proprietary hospital ownership groups and city plan-ners involved in the design of new communities-to assist them inevolving and implementing comprehensive health care models.The medical profession and organized medicine groups are publiclyexpressing interest in change. The practice of medicine is becomingincreasingly difficult and emotionally unrewarding because of demands made upon it by the very complexities and multiple problems of daily690 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS living, as well as by the increasing amount of administrative and managerial tasks imposed by very necessary government standards and health insurance regulations. It has become impossible for the physician to go it alone and to be it all. The time for change was never so propitious. Activism is needed as it never was before. ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY PROPOSAL I have taken the liberty of appending to this paper, a suggested alternative health care delivery model, together with a recommended definition of roles for the various sectors involved in health care, including public, private, and philanthropy groups.* These comprised a proposal submitted by me to a private group interested in funding a Community Health Planning Foundation. We are still discussing this possibility. There is no doubt that governmental action of the same kind could also effectively promote the development of such services. These papers are too long to permit reading here. Briefly, the plan describes the creation of a unified health care delivery system, centering about comprehensive ambulatory diagnostic and care centers-called Health Care Facilities-pooling ancillary, paramedical, managerial, and administrative services, simultaneously permitting the one doctor/one patient relationship. It provides free and rapid transfer between the various components of the system and defines the role of each. These include the community-cottage- hospital, medical center, and extended care facilities and programs. All services are supervised by the managing physician, coordinated bv the health care team, and expedited by the family health agents. The latter is a new career-a peer related, informed advocate of the family. The plan coordinates existing services and is adapted at the individual community level-adding services only as the need for such addition is clearly demonstrated. It establishes effective quality and optimum utilization surveillance through a team approach. It is ex- pected that savings in cost will result from the pooling and more sensible use of those parts of health care which are the most costly- namely: ancillary, administrative, managerial, and institutional. The plan is offered as an alternative method. There is little doubt that the elderly would benefit greatly from it-perhaps more than any other group, since it permits easy availability and accesibility of all services through a single access, and also provides the means whereby they may be put more closely in touch with existing health services. Another service which is greatly needed by the elderly in urban areas, especially those that are relatively and absolutely homebound, is the meals-on-wheels concept. We should have more of this. FAMILY HEALTH AGENT The family health agent would be of great value in providing the elderly with information concerning their entitlement relative to gov- ernmental and other benefit programs. This type of medical manpow- er, together with other physical and emotional rehabilitation personnel *See app. 1, pp. 727-734.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 691 proviflded through the health core facility are of special importance to the elderly as well as to other groups with multiple problems. The OEO neighborhood health centers have clearly demonstrated this. The elderly are very imuch like the ghetto dwellers. They live in a segregated ghetto of their own-too often in a single room furnished apartment, suffering from retirement rot with nothing but time on their hands. At that stage, their problems are largely nonmedical. It is not unrealistic to consider the use of the health core facility as a vehicle for training of the unemployed at all ages, not only as health agents, but as professional assistants of all types. The elderly would benefit greatly from this. They could be trained toward the second job in the pre- or post-retirement years. This would circumvent the destructiveness attendant on their loss of work role as well as permit additional income at a time when they need both very badly. *We need such new careers in all the human services-especially in medicine as -well as other undermanned fields. This, too, involves the principle of improved allocation of resources. Do we really have a severe shortage of professional manpower or are we merely senselessly misusing our highly skilled groups? The proposed model, strategically located geographically, would permit availability to all age, ethnic, race, and economic sectors, which would be far better psychologically than systems requiring further segregation of any one of those groups-which is often demoralizing of itself. Comprehensive health care systems are absolutely essential if vwe are to promote preventive care. We really have no choice. We must concentrate our efforts in the pregeriatric years, or very soon we -will face the prospect of geriatrics virtually absorbing the practice of medicine. SUNMIMARY In summary, then, I am making a plea for more activism and less study; for new cardplayers; for government and/or private encour- agement and facilitation of improved health care delivery models, not only for the geriatric patient, but for all ages; for better coordination of existing programs, rather than addition of new ones; for a con- sortium approach with a clearer definition of roles; and for greater involvement and participation at the actual service level: I have also proposed a new model which, in my experience as a practitioner, as well as a health care programer, seems to have some universality and replicability. I hope this very busy committee will find it possible to examine and consider it. Your critique will be most valuable to me. I could not possibly end this presentation without thanking you for permitting me to come. I expect to learn a great deal. I hope my remarks will offer some contribution to the solution rather than to the problem. Mr. ORIOL. Didn't you say at a conference earlier this year that phy- sicians spent only about 25 percent of their time in direct patient care? Dr. GIORGI. Yes; it has been estimated that physicians spend about 25 to 35 percent of their time in direct patient care. The rest of their time is spent in doing chores that could well be done by others-chores that do not require their highly specialized skills.692 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS DUPLICATION OF EQuIPMENT AND PERSONNEL Another factor in costs and shortages is that of unnecessary dupli- cation. Dr. Littlejohn stated that overhead expenses in a doctor's office is about 50 percent. No wonder. Each doctor's office has a full component of expensive and scarce equipment and personnel which they use only part time. Such equipment and personnel should be used f ull time. The real culprit in exorbitant costs is duplication down the line-from the doctor's office to the hospital and other facilities for institutional care. At this point. I would rather not talk about cost per se-I would prefer to talk about care quantitatively and qualitatively. Improved health for all our people must of necessity prove to be less costly in the end. And that improved care will not be effectuated only through financial quantitative commitment. It must come through commitment to much needed change. It will require heroic measures-but it can and must be done. It will not be easy but it may well be easier than our current antiquated, cumbersome system of senseless duplication, frag- mentation, and almost complete disregard of consumer perspective and dynamic health education. Thank you very much. Mr. ORIOL. Dr. Giorgi, you can be sure that your proposed new model will receive a great deal of attention. I find myself with many ques- tions which we can't go into in detail right now., but we would like to get more discussion on it. Is any work going on at the national center for health service re- search and development along the lines you are recommending? Dr. GIORGI. I will tell you-you know-, the Scheuer amendment with new careers is working on this. They haven't done enough in the health field. I would like to see this applied Mr. ORIOL. Could this be a specific recommendation? Dr. GIORGI. I would like it to be, and you could make it in connec- tion with the aged, teaching them the second job. Mr. ORIOL. Well, some of the questions that -we will throw at you after having read your proposal in detail are: What is this model for? Is this a model for Federal action-to promote development- or is this a model for community action? Our Federal programs, including the development of what you en- vision-or are they contradicting each other, perhaps, in some cases? We will address many questions to you along that line. Dr. GIORGI. Thank you very much. (Subsequent to the hearing, Senator Williams asked the following questions in a letter to Dr. Giorgi:) 1. Your \"Unified Health Care Delivery System\"-which, as you said, would be of special usefulness to the elderly-is of great interest. Have you give any thought as to revisions in existing federal programs-or perhaps suggestions for entirely new programs-that could be helpful for establishment of such a system? Or do you envision development of this system as primarily a matter for private resources, with only supplemental incentives from the federal level? 2. You also suggested that the elderly might serve in useful \"second careers\" as health aides of one kind or another. In what roles could they be especially helpful? 3. Your observation that preventive care for the aged in California is \"in- visible\" leads me to ask for your comments on what kind of services are needed but are not now provided.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 693 4. I am not certain I understand your references to a possible \"black market\"for health services. Do you mean that the onset of a program such as Medi-Cal has increased demand for health services to the extent that Medi-Cal par-ticipants will be willing to pay some kind of premium to give them access to scarce health personnel'? Or did you envision a more general problem? 5. You and other witnesses emphasized the need for health education, and yet I find myself wondering just how such education could reach the general public,especially the elderly. Do you have suggestions for increasing the effectiveness of educational efforts? 6. You began to discuss OEO health programs and indicated that you might have additional thoughts on that subject. Is it possible for you to give us addi- tional discussion for our hearing record? (The following reply was received:) QUESTION NO. 1 My statements regarding development of a Unified Health Care Delivery Sys- tem through private resources were expressed out of desperation. It is obviousthat those institutions which might have been expected to be prime movers inbehalf of unmet needs-namely, government (public health), profession schools, and the medical/dental professional organizations-seem powerless to perform. A conjoint effort on the part of all of these would be ideal. It is long overdue. Each of these seems blocked-perhaps because they refuse to recognize the fact that they are unable to \"go it alone\". They need help from other sectors. The approach is too complex for the health sector alone. A multi and interdisciplinary consortium is necessary. For this reason, I proposed a privately funded Com- munity Health Planning Foundation as a means of providing such a consortium. There is no reason why the same approach cannot be sponsored by government. As a matter of fact, in view of an enlightened public's indignation over the in- adequacies, inequities, and exorbitant costs of health care it may soon become mandatory for government to assume leadership. We already have much evidencethat a very large consumer of services-the labor movement-is becoming quite militant in this direction. The Health Care of a Nation is one of the prime re-sponsibilities of government. In this connection, as things stand at present, gov-ernment- functionally, at least-has been placed in the position of responsibilitywithout authority-extremely untenable to say the least. SWEDISH SYSTEM I would like very much to see a Unified System developed through government sponsorship-primarily along the same lines as the Swedish System developedunder the leadership of Dr. Arthur Engel, former Director/General of the Swedish National Board of Health, so well described in his 1968 Michael M. Davis Lec-ture-Planning and Spontaneity in the Development of the Swedish Health System. This could easily be done without infringement on the one patient/one doctor concept which seems to be the main basic concern of both the providerand recipient of services. However, if government does assume leadership it should take the form ofpromotion of effective planning for service rather than direct ownership, direct operation, or continued funding of educational or institutional groups in isolationfrom service groups. Central to the Unified Health Care Delivery System is the Health Core Facility already described. This is a single access Ambulatory Care Facility either freestanding or hospital based. As such, it lends itself very well to government spon- sorship along the same lines as the Hill-Burton or Hill-Harris concepts. To bemost effective, this would require new legislation and a new program. This leg- islation should be carefully designed to include provision for all the components already mentioned in the description of the Unified Health Care Delivery Sys- tem. I would like to see funding provided to associations of professionals (notjust doctors) preferably on a long term, low interest loan basis, rather than on a matching funds basis. I would also like to see provision made for community participation and Federal public utility regulation as well as a more equitable plan for prepayment either directly or through health insurance fiscal agents. The \"Catchment area\" concept should be maintained to avoid duplication and might even be extended to include \"adoption\" of a contiguous community where a medical vacuum exists. The latter could become a satellite of the central Health694 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Core Facility. Very important, also would be the provision that optimum use be made of existing facilities and programs before new ones are added. In those areas where adequate facilities and programs already exist, funding can be di- rected towards their consolidation and coordination. All of this could be detailed by the framers of the new legislation. While it is important that the legislation be quite specific, it is equally important that it be looked upon as a guideline rather than a blueprint. It should detail only the basic essentials guaranteeing optimum service; optimum use of facilities, equip- ment, and manpower; equitable care to all: and reasonable cost. All this must then be regionally adapted with services individually rendered, family centered, and community oriented. This is by no means \"pie-in-the-sky\". It has already been done in other nations-why not by ours? I feel that only through new legislation can we achieve an overall concept. Continued additions and rebuilding on shaky foundations of old programs which have remained isolated from each other-and have failed miserably-gets us nowhere. Equally ineffective is the senseless addition of new programs addressing themselves to a small part of the larger problem. They only serve to further fragment and to dilute all resources. A new program of this type may not neces- sarily require a great deal of additional funds. Since the keynote is primarily coordination of existing services, it can be partially funded through optimum use of existing funds. It should be noted that organized medicine has already indicated approval of ambulatory care centers. I refer to Dr. Milford Rouse's statement in the November 27th, 1967 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The California Medical Association has also been very interested in \"promoting the art and science of medicine and the betterment of public health\". In Cali- fornia Medicine of May, 1968, it calls for a \"flexible and informed advocacy\" on the part of the medical profession and envisions \"individual physicians and organized medicine as a powerful and effective force for better health and better health care in this Nation\". They are asking for inclusion in planning. I find this very encouraging. ALTERNATrVES FOR GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT If new legislation is not feasible, alternative methods for government involve- ment could include the following. 1. Extension or revision of PL 89-239 (Regional Medical Program) to include implementation of a Unified System. 2. Revision of PL 89-749 (Comprehensive Planning Act) promoting a closer relationship between sections 314C and 314E so that training of planners can be done in the framework of service and involvement of practitioners of all disciplines in designing a Unified System. 3. Revision of the O.E.O. Family Neighborhood Health Center concept towards incorporation into a Unified System. It is far better when services to all groups can be rendered through common facilities. Accessibility can be arranged through strategic location of services as well as by provision of transportation when needed. QUESTION NO. 2 The elderly are too often forced to retire at a time when they are still very capable of function. This is especially true of those who are employed in the \"over manned\" fields. Labor Union regulations also promote such retirement. Too often those regulations are motivated towards making room for new membership. I would like to see us educate and train such retirees towards a \"second job\" in the \"under manned\" fields such as health aides and assistants of all types- both those already existent and new careers. These could include medical aides. laboratory assistants. X-ray technicians, home health aides. nurses' aides. social service aides, health education aides, multipurpose workers (new careers). etc. Aides in education are also desperately needed. I think the retiree should be trained prior to retirement through the mechanism of a sabbatical. The concept of the multiphasic worker is further discussed in answer to ques- tion five. The idea of training for a 'second job\" in the pre-retirement years was described in the paper-The Sabbatical in Industry*-previously submitted to your committee. 'Retained in committee files.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 695 QUESTION NO. 3 As far as I know, there is no provision for periodic health examinations. To my knowledge, such services are not reimbursable under either Titles XVIII or XIX. A program providing periodic multiphasic screening tied to a physician examina- tion would go a long way towards preventive care. It would be even more success- ful if it were performed in the pre-geriatric years. In addition to detecting dis- ease and disruption prior to the irreversible stage. such health examinations might even provide some means for surveillance and circumvention of such abuses as over-testing and excessive visits by providing a general. social, and biochemical reference audit and profile on each patient. It would have been very feasible to make provision for this through Medicare. It is very customary to request health evaluation in conjunction with health insurance. Medicare is mediated through the mechanism of social security which is an insurance plan. Such periodic examinations, including multiphasic screening, can decrease the time required for a complete checkup from about two hours to one-half hour or less. This will help circumvent professional manpower shortages. It has been estimated that, if every person in this country were to have an annual completehealth examination under present methods: it would require about forty-five hours out of each practicing physician's week. Obviously this is not feasible. Decreasing the time to one quarter of the present required time would obviously assist this immeasurably. The type of complete audit permitted through a well designed periodic multi- phasic screening program may even provide a means for determining priorities on professional time. At the very least, this is worth testing and demonstrating. The Health Core Facility Concept provides a vehicle for such testing and demonstration. QUESTION NO. 4 By \"black market\" in medicine, I meant that services will soon be so scarce and the cost so high that only those who can pay \"premium\" fees will be able to secure health care. I also referred to currently existing practices of \"hidden\" additional costs to institutionalized Medicare patients which take the form of such things as extra charges for telephones which are not requested by the patient; and extra charges for family visitor parking equally unsolicited: as well as other abuses recently reported in connection with the California Medi- Cal program. The acceptance of the patient into the facility becomes contingent on such \"tributes\". This and other types of \"under the table\" payment have a definite \"black market\" flavor since they involve illegal practices as well as \"premium\" and \"tribute\" payments. QUESTION NO. 5 Some of us are frequently requested to speak to groups of elderly people. Theyare very avid for information concerning nutrition, medicines, and the more commonly occurring chronic illnesses such as arthritis, cancer. heart disease. stroke, diabetes. etc. There is a striking lack of knowledge as to these as well as to the proper use of health services. We will never have true \"quality care\" until the patient faces his doctor with adequate knowledge as to what is being told to him as well as to his entitlement. Without such knowledge, the elderly- who are constantly being told: \"what do you expect at your age\"-often wait until it's too late to present for care. One of the better ways to provide such health education is through the informed advocacy of properly trained peer groups such as new career multipurpose workers-health ombudsmen. This could be a \"second job\" for retirees. Many years of observing patients in clinics as well as in my own practice have taught me that a great deal of the therapy is in reality done by peer related lay groups. Repeatedly, I have observed them consulting cashiers, attendants. porters. secretaries, etc. after leaving the doctor either for additional information or for clarification of confusing orders given by the professional staff. Multipurpose workers of this type could be used in clinics. They could also visit Homebound Medicare recipients in their homes and could conduct com- munity teaching sessions in schools, churches, clubs, etc. There is little doubtthat they could reduce the need for scarce professional services and for unneces- sary medications-too often given to \"get rid\" of the patient. It has been correctly estimated that about 80 to 85 percent of people presenting to the physician justneed someone to \"talk to\".696 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMIERICANS The Health Care Facility Concept can well be used as a training Laboratory for all types of health career assistant and associate personnel. It can also be used as a vehicle for dynamic health education. The elderly are admirably suited to such careers by reason of their experiences, empathy and their great need to feel useful and wanted. Proper training can orient such multipurpose workers towards the direction of optimum self-sufficiency for their clients. QUESTION NO. 6 My experience with O.E.C. health programs results from very active participa- tion in the design and implementation of the Southeentral Multipurpose Health Services Center; a U.S.C. sponsored, O.E.O. funded Neighborhood Health Center in the community of Watts, Los Angeles. It is very difficult to discuss such health centers purely from the medical care standpoint. They were part of the larger parcel-The War on Poverty. The intent of the Family Neighborhood Health Centers was to make use of health services as a wedge to correction of other inadequacies and inequities experienced by the disadvantaged such as poor education, poor housing, unem- ployment, etc. They promoted a total health concept in its broadest sense which, though admirable, inevitaably resulted in the introduction of numerous vari- ables-each of which posed a threat to existing institutions, resulting in con- stant harassment from many sources, and repeated compromises which were too often paralyzing and disruptive. Like other O.E.O. programs, the Family Neighborhood Health Centers were supposed to reduce the powerlessness of the poor. The impression was that they, rather than the establishment, were to be in command. This became impossible of achievement since the funding of the Health Centers was awarded to the establishment, and quite naturally the disadvantaged equated power with money. The term \"maximal feasible participation\" was never clearly defined which produced an inordinate amount of conflict in the design and operation of so highly teqhnical and complex a structure as a large health center in which areas of competence are of great significance. Consumer perspective and partici- pation is very necessary in all service programs. However, when this became confused with actual operation of the facility, chaos often resulted and threat- ened the proposed partnership. Many problems were also inherent in the need for \"year to year\" funding. There were constant deadlines to meet in the way of reporting and re-budgeting. All of this interfered with smooth operation. Even more significant was the quite ridiculous assumption that professionals would leave either a good job with security or established practices to assume full time work with a program that could not guarantee employment beyond the one year term of the grant. The result was inevitable. Too many of these health centers either employ part time professionals or are understaffed-thus sacrificing the concept of continuity of care. A sense of the temporary was pervasive; certainly not conducive to feel- ings of security or staiblifty. Many of the clinics are free standing. Without guarantee of admission to the hospital, there is always the element of rejection by the hospital admitting physician. Attempts at true coordination with existing services and programs, even those funded by O.E.O., were constantly thwarted due to such things as differing philosophies and criteria for acceptance as well as manpower, budget, and space shortages on the part of other agencies and institutions. All of this greatly interfered with both continuity of care and implementation of the total health concept. The inevitable result was further frustration and distrust on the part of the people who felt betrayed by promises unkept in the failure to achieve the goals of better health, better jobs, and better education. In spite of all this, there is a definite danger of further frustration and dis- trust should these health centers be discontinued. However, before they prolifer- ate further, I would think it mandatory to have a complete evaluation as to their efficiency, per capita operational costs, etc. I do not believe this has been done to date. I do not think that O.E.O. Health Programs-as they are nowv designed- can effect coordination and unification of health care services-both of which are sorely needed. As a matter of fact, should they continue to expand beore proper evaluation, the end result may well be a shift of inequities through further dilution of funds and resources.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 697 At the same time, I wish it clearly understood that I approve of the basicphilosophy of the total health concept, and the War on Poverty, and the use ofhealth care with relation to both. The concepts of consumer perspective andparticipation; health care teams; dynamic health education; peer relatedmultipurpose workers as informed family advocates-all of these are of provenvalue not only to the poor but to all of us. There is no reason w'hy these cannotbe incorporated into a coordinated and Unified System rather than through crea-tion of plans which enforce rigid geographic and economic eligibility standards,and are stll in reality \"medicine for the poor\". We are indebted to O.E.O. for its energetic approach toward promotion ofthese concepts. It is now time to move on to a broader and more complete plan-one which addresses itself to the total problem of better health and health careto all with the least amount of threat to existing institutions. This can be accom-plished if we are mindful of the fact that truly successful planning usuallycarries with it that which is good from the past; is pertinent to the present; andhas some meaning for the future. At this point in time, with relation to health care services, I feel that experi-ence has taught us that the perference of both recipients and providers of servicesleans heavily toward a one to one relationship in connection with the very\"personal\" services. Comprehensiveness, and reasonable cost as well as the otherfactors described can still be achieved through pooling of the less \"personal\"aspects of health care such as clinical tests, other special para-medical and an-cillary services, and the administrative and managerial components-all of whichtraditionally lend themselves much more readily to grouping. Mr. ORIOL. Our next witness is Mr. Cass Alvin, representing thecouncil for health plan alternatives. If Senator Williams were here, he would greet you as a fellowsteelworker. Mr. ALVIN. Yes. Thank you. STATEMENT OF CASS ALVIN, EDUCATION COORDINATOR, UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA Mr. ALVIN. My name is Cass Alvin, and I am representing the Cali- fornia Council for Health Plan Alternatives, which is comprised oftrade unions in California, both AFL and CIO, as well as the inde-pendents and the State and regional bodies. This is a problem of time where I am unable to make a formal presentation on behalf of the council. We will, with your committee's permission, Mr. Chairman, submit the council's views at a later time, and we will continue to do so as we work together, unraveling some of the mysteries of the rising costs of health services, and we will submit from time to time some of the ideas and suggestions we have for improving the efficiency of healthcare services and its quality. I would like to confine my remarks to a few observations. I would like to say first of all that following Dr. Gorgi is not a very easy job. I think she touches just about all the observations that can possibly be made. She is one of the consultants to our council onhealth planning alternatives, and we value her imagination and crea-tivity in this field. The California Council for Health Plan Alternatives grew out of the need of trade unions for a coordinated effort in tackling the problem of how best can we provide our members quality medicalcare at the lowest possible price. Our experience in this field was at first limited. We bargained for a few cents. We went to a vendor, an insurance carrier, who would698 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS indemnify our members to some extent for the cost associated with hospital and surgery. Over the years we have gone back annually to our employers, shook their pockets, stacked more money on the table, enlarging to a small degree the coverage of the insurers' plan, adding new and sometimes questionable benefits only to return again to take more money in lieu of wages, and turning it over in a lump sum premium to an insurance intermediary. HEALTH PLAN ALTERNATIVES Co-INnrrrEE With but few notable exceptions, like the Kaiser plan, that was the only way open to us. And that is all that is open to us presently-that is, until we started our work with California Health Plan Alternatives committee. What we in fact, are doing is what you in Government are doing about the dollars that are going to the health care for the aged. You and we in labor, as the consuming groups apparently are yet unable to make an impression on most of the medical establishment which needs to know the thinking of the consumer. We are the representatives of the people who pay the bill. WTe in labor grow weary of chasing the dog's tail, finding ourselves in this whirl of putting more money into our plans and not making any appreciable headway. We can't get out because as yet there is no alternative for our mem- bers. The prepaid union negotiated medical plans in the State of Cali- fornia amount annually to about a quarter of a billion dollars-this is a lot of money. We are the largest single consumer of health plans in the private sector. We have been trying to get at the root causes of some of the rising costs and looking for standards by which we can improve the quality of medical care. We don't think you can separate quality from the cost. It matters very little to a person who can't afford a medical plan what the quality or costs are. If the cost gets so prohibitive that you can't obtain medical care, then quality is of little value. We think the two have to go together. We think vwe have found, up to now, some alternatives to some of the rising costs. What complicates our problem and complicates the problem of your committee is that it is almost impossible to get avail- able data, or even a rationale for the rising medical and hospital costs from those who have the figures but -who are reluctant to release them. No secret was ever guarded as carefully as the figures behind the fantastic escalation of medical costs-the hospital and doctor costs. I suspect this will continue to be the case until those who pay the bill -the consumers, we in the labor unions and you in government- insist on some kind of an accountability from the purveyors of medical services, and that the data upon which they base their cost assumptions are exposed to public scrutiny.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 699 POSITION OF LABOR UNIONS California labor unions, by now experienced in the inflationaryphase of the State medicare program, are not accepting the recom- mendation by the California Medical Association and the Blue Shieldthat the 60 percentile basis for charges for medical procedures beraised to the 90 percentile level. This proposed change would tend to bring all the medical costsup to the 90 percentile, and would bring about an automatic escalation.If there is any remaining money in the Miedi-Cal program, once thischange is instituted, the surplus would be wiped out and the increasedcosts will have to be made up by going again to the legislature for more money. We were told this was necessary to keep more doctors interested inhandling medicare patients. Incidentally, it was said that there were 18,000 doctors in California involved in the AMedi-Cal practice. Whatasn't stated was how many of those doctors charge fees over and above what is provided under the medicare and the Medi-Cal pro- grams. We in the Council object to this proposal made by the CaliforniaMedical Association. For what use your committee could make ofour testimony, and to all parties concerned in this State, I would liketo submit our thinking on this matter as a matter of record to yourcommittee. You may ask what costs of medical and medicare have to do withthe medical costs and delivery of health care of all others. Our ex-perience in trade union prepaid medical expense plans, convinces usthat it is all a part of the same ball of wax. It cannot be separated.Every movement, every development in the medical care field has a relation to the other. When medicare became operational, for instance, millions of agedpeople, who before could not afford medical services, saw hope andtook their illness to the same establishment that serves all the others,including trade union members who were covered by prepaid medicalplans, and all others in the community deriving health care servicesfrom the same establishment. Something is bound to happen. You start paying more for the sameor even paying more for less. Sometimes you get services you don'tneed, and you pay more for them. We don't think this will stop unlesssomething is done, until we regulate by consumer pressures the pricerates of medical care or until we find alternative ways-some newsystems of delivering medical care not only for the aged but for allthe people.It is like the old ja.r of jam. Unless there is some control over it, anawful lot of well-intentioned people find themselves all covered withthe stuff. This will keep going on as long as this jar continues to berefilled and no controls put over it.I don't say this as a pointed charge against any segment of themedical establishment. We have, as has been earlier indicated, somecooperation from the California Medical Association, and much to thecredit of our committee, I think we are doing what you are doing with700 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS these committee hearings; starting to have a dialog with the medical establishment. We are, for the first time, talking with the people who deliver the medical care services to our people. Talking with intermediaries I think is a waste of time. While we appreciate the insurance companies and other intermediaries-they have got their little playpens. They have taken a lot of health plan negotiators out to lunches, but we just don't think we have had any success with them. We don't think they can effectively change the method of delivery of medical care services or in any way control the price. We think they are really a part of the entire system, and no changes are likely to come from them at all. The economic forces being what they are, I don't think the equation will ever change unless there are consumer pressures. W1rhat we need is more and more competition in this field of medical care. I am a member of the hospital advisory board, and I am appalled at the gross inefficiencies that go into our hospitals. Even the purchas- ing of the necessary paraphernalia for hospitals indicates that there must be some kind of a fungus growing which allows costs to rise without any checks or controls. One example, for instance, we have an employer under contract with our union who makes bicycles. But in addition to making bicycles, he makes wheelchairs. Now, the same kinds of skills-making bicycles-go into making wheelchairs. About the same kind of material goes into a wheelchair as goes into a bicycle, and yet the hospital pays about 10 times as much for a wheelchair as a consumer pays for a well-made bicycle. Actually, the amount of material and labor that go into making bicycles and a wheelchair are almost identical. It seems that no one seems to care about the cost that goes into hos- pitals. No one apparently cares about such items of cost so long as someone else is paying the bills. In the health care business there are not the kinds of pressures we find in the rest of the marketplace. \"PIECEMEAL\" HEALTH PROGRAMS We ought to look at the health of the whole community. We may be exceedingly wasteful by just fashioning our system to serve a particular segment. What we are doing at present is having medicine for the rich, medicine for the poor, for the old, for the young, for the black, for the white, for the rural community, for the urban center. I think we must start thinking about medicine as something to be delivered on a com- munitywide basis, so that -we don't have the segregation problems-we don't have rich people involved in one kind of medical care and the poor in another kind-the black in one, the white in another. It is understandable why this occurs. Many times Government pro- grams come about in a piecemeal fashion, and we all hope that once such programs are started, they will serve as a foot in the door for the rest of the community. We have been doing this, in part, for years, one foot at a time in the door-and I suggest that this is more than just a two-legged problem.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS It is really more even than a centipede. Maybe we should start getting all of the feet at one time. For instance, what we do for the infant and the children in health care will have a lot to do with what they will require as aging citizens or the kind of care they received during their working years. The kinds of health care that we are able to provide people in the middle span of their lives likewise will affect the health of the older citizen. We see today a tragic paradox in the problem of the unemployed. While there are shortages of certain technicians, nurses, and other health service personnel, it seems that in the area of human needs, these human services, there is an unwillingness by the private sector to spend a buck. The public sector is of course afraid of the cost pressure of taxes. So we are left here with people who are able and willing to provide human services, and because there is no proper organization in this area the abilities of these people are not being utilized. My observation is that we are, for instance, willing to spend more money and more time in training the seeing eye dog to lead a blind person around than we are willing to spend on some individual who could take the hand of an older person and provide him the kind of human services required. TEAMSTERS MULTPHASIC SCREENING PROGRAM In the California Health Plan Alternatives Council, we are very much impressed with the successful program of multiphasic screening used by the Teamsters and the other unions in the food processing industry. About 20,000 workers are pressed every year through a mobile system of well-equipped vans. We have evidence of how thousands not only receive annual check- ups without cost, and with minimal inconvenience. A number of peo- ple, because of this early detection, became well, and in many, many cases had their lives saved. There are certainly many ways that such a type of an examination- detection of ailments-can be helpful with the health care of the aging. This idea should be explored further. Not to be in conflict with what was said at this hearing about preventive medicine, I still have to see any sort of a multiphasic screening or any other type of preventive medicine program in the State of California for the aged. It is not enough to say that you ought to have a family doctor. What was learned from the multiphasic screening in the food pro- cessing industry is that about 60 percent of those people don't have a family doctor. The family doctor is a yellow page of a telephone directory. Just telling them they should have a family doctor is not a form of preventive medicine. Certainly everyone should-it is like telling a person, \"You ought to be well and not require medical services.\" Observation indicates that the aged are not really, in many cases, receiving medical care but are housed in places that provide little more than custodial care. Many of these people may be just lonely, and not sick, as Dr. Giorgi indicated. While this is probably prevalent in other age brackets, this 24-798-69-pt. 3-7701702 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS may be peculiar to the aged. It may require new professions and voca- tions, schooled to fill some of the kinds of needs that the aged require, other than just medical care. ELDERLY AS PowER BLoc My last word, if you will permit me-I am talking to a group of Senators-with about 10 percent of our population of 65 or over, I feel confident that some solutions will be found not only in the area of cost of medical care, but also in the quality of medical care. The large number of elderly people is a definite power bloc, and in this day and age when we group people into color power blocs, we call it the aging \"grey power\". And since 65 comes after 21, I need not remind anybody here of the pressures that this power can exert, or what change of direction it can make in our society-even in our medical establishment. The California Health Plan Alternatives Committee wants to use its voice to help in this problem, not only because we are in a sort of symbiotic relationship with other groups wanting to improve our system of health, but also because we are also all aging together. Mr. ORIOL. I would like to thank you very much for that statement. I know you didn't have time in this statement to give a full descrip- tion of what the Council on Health Plan Alternatives is, but we will get that in a letter statement. But basically what this group is doing is making sure that current members of unions-is it limited to union members? Mr. ALVIN. Yes Mr. ORioL (continuing.) Are covered adequately by health plans, and in doing that, you discovered certain things in the delivery of services that you would like to see improved. So that by the time this present group that you are working for now themselves become elderly, why, by having taken care of themselves at an earlier period of time, in a way they are contributing to the resolving of some of these problems concerned with the elderly. Mr. ALVIN. Also, in addition to that, many of our plans now include not only coverage for the active employees, but for the employees upon retirement. We are concerned certainly with our aging population and their health needs. There is another important point on this, and that is that many of our plans provided medical services and health care services to re- tired people. When medicare care came into being, some of our mem- bers were already covered by union negotiated plans. Now who is going to pay the bill? Of course, the employers and unions-just as any other groups-choose to transfer the cost on to the Government, and this has been done in many cases. It has been a saving in many ways to our negotiated plans. Some of these costs to our plans now are borne by medicare. On the other hand, however, we know that putting 10 percent of our population on medicare has an inflationary pressure on existing plans, so that in one way, we have benefited a little costwise but in another way have found the inflationary cost effects of medicare.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 703 Mr. ORIOL. We want to develop that in questions to be addressed tothe committee. You will submit for the record this Memorandum onHealth Plan Alternatives ?* Mr. ALVIN. Yes, I will submit it. Mr. ORIOL. I would like to acknowledge that Congressman AlphonsoBell is in the audience. If he has any time now, and wishes to address.the committee Mr. BELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have nothing to address to,the committee at this time. Thank you. Mr. ORIOL. And now I would like to call Mr. Donald Gormly,.president of the California Association of Nursing Homes, Sanitar-iums, Rest Homes and Homes for the Aged, Inc. I see Mr. Burch of the American Nursing Homes Association. Per-haps you would like to accompany Mr. Gormly. Mr. Gormly, your appearance springs from discussions we had withthe ANHA. I am glad to see you here. Mr. GORMLY. Yes. Additionally I have Mr. Clinton Jones from theCalifornia Nursing Homes Association. We shortened our title. Our official title is Mr. ORIOL. Is it longer than this? Mr. GORAILY. Well, in conversation we call it the California NursingHomes Association. STATEMENT OF DONALD GORMLY, PRESIDENT, CALIFORNIA ASSO- CIATION OF NURSING HOMES, SANITARIUMS, REST HOMES, AND HOMES FOR THE AGED, INC. Mr. GORNELY. Mr. Chairman, members of the special committee, myname is Donald Gormly. I am President of the California NursingHomes Association. I am also a regional vice president of the AmericanNursing Home Association-representing region VIII, the WesternStates-and in that capacity I serve on the executive board of thenational body. On behalf of the California State Association and the AmericanNursing Home Association we wish to extend our appreciation andthanks to Chairman Williams, Senator Moss, Senator Randolph, andother members of the committee for the leadership you have demon-strated and the concern you have expressed for the elderly, and foryour efforts in strengthening the medical care programs for the aged.We wish also to express our appreciation for the cooperation extendedby this committee in the past. We stand ready to continue or cooperation in the effort to achieveour common goal: to make a better life for our senior citizens by pro-viding quality health services to them. Mr. ORIOL. Mr. Gormly, if I may interrupt. You mentioned SenatorMoss-and that is Moss of Utah, and he had hoped to be here today,especially because he is chairman of our Subcommittee on Long TermCare. You can be sure a copy of your statement will be sent to him. *See app. 1, p. 734.704 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Mr. GORMLY. We will appreciate that. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, we as providers of health services in California com- prise an organization of 1,300 private facilities, with approximately 55,000 medical care beds. All are licensed by the State; mostly as nursing and convalescent homes, and some as mental hygiene long term care facilities. Virtually all of these institutions-both proprietary and tax- exempt-currently provide services to patients under the title 19 program, known in this State as Medi-Cal, and to which I shall here- inafter refer. Of equal interest is the fact that over half of these facilities-over 700 in number-are title 18 medicare-certified, thus forming by far the largest State group of extended care facilities-ECF's-in the Nation. In addition, our California membership includes hundreds of resi- dential care homes and institutions-all of them licensed. I mention this group particularly because of its increasing importance and potential as this committee weighs the advisability of defining various levels of aged and needy patient care to meet more exactly the needs of the individual elderly and convalescent ill. I might add that our State association is dedicated first and fore- most to the constant betterment of patient care. As a demonstration of this, a primary requirement of membership for each facility is State licensure, and the meeting of State-set standards of care. Conversely, loss of licensure terminates membership. In the light of our prime interest in the patient, then, I will respond briefly to the suggested question: What has been the effect of the medicare and Medi-Cal programs upon the kind of services provided by our member institutions-and what recommendations do we have for further legislative or policy change? MEDI-CAL AND MEDICARE STANDARDS In general, there seems little doubt that the two programs have re- sulted in higher standards throughout California. In fact, the newly required title 19 Medi-Cal or skilled nursing home standards are nearly approaching Title 18 medicare standards in terms of costs. Our California association has just completed a cross section study of 309 facilities to find there is now only 44 cents difference per patient day between a Medi-Cal skilled nursing home and a free- standing ECF. On the average, then, Medi-Cal standards are catch- ing up costwise with medicare. Mr. ORIOL. May I ask why you so pointedly say \"costwise?\" What other comparisons mi-ht be made? Mr. GOREILY. Welf, the standards of the title 19 program have been elevated, and they have, in fact, come up almost to the medicare standards, and this in effect raised the cost-standardwise they have to- Mr. ORIOL. So that cost follows standards? Mr. GORMLY. Yes, they are going down the same road. The basic reason for this growing similarity is easy to identify: it is the increasing nurse staffing requirement-the major cost item in today's nursing and convalescent home. Nevertheless, the delivery of good quality nursing care in these Medi-Cal institutions constitutesCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 705 government's biggest bargain in health care for the elderly andneedy-at a time when general hospital care costs are soaring towardthe hundred-dollar mark per patient day.Mr. Chairman, despite the foregoing analysis favoring improvedpatient care standards overall, we are confronted with many obstaclesin our efforts to deliver services efficiently and economically.California providers are not unique in this regard because standardsand regulations are promulgated at the Federal level but implementedat the State level-often with inconsistent, rigid, and inflexibleinterpretations. Further, we in California nursing homes live with the necessityof pleasing several governmental masters. Federal HEW sets skillednursing home standards as a title 19 requirement. The State depart-ment of public health has separate licensure standards in many -waysin difference with the Federal program.The department of health care services administers title 19 stand-ards, adding its own inspired regulations and interpretations. Andlast, but by no means least, the State department of finance-uncon-cerned with patient care standards-unilaterally sets the budget.Mr. ORIOL. That department of health care services-that's theState department of health care services; is it?Mr. GORMLY. Yes. These are State agencies I am talking about.Thus our facilities have been and continue to be caught and squeezedbetween demands for higher and higher standards, while denied justrecompense for providing care to our elderly.In the interest of time, Mr. Chairman, we would like to concludewith brief references to three specific problem areas, by way of re-sponding to the question in your opening statement: \"Are presentmedicare and Medi-Cal policies intensifying old problems in the or-ganization of health services or causing entirely new problems?\" SPELL OF ILLNESS Mr. Chairman, the American Nursing Home Association has had alongstanding controversy with the Social Security Administrationconcerning definition of a \"spell of illness\" for purposes of deter-mining covered and noncovered benefits under title 18. I will not takeup the committee's time now, but with your permission submit forthe record excerpts from association testimony before the Senate Fi-nance Committee on H.R. 12080-1967 amendments to the SocialSecurity Act, which discussed this issue in detail.* We feel this is agood example where an existing policy denies the elderly benefitswhich Congress intended them to have. RETROACTIVE DENIAL OF BENEFITS BY INTERMEDIARIES Another area of concern to both nursing homes and the beneficiariesis the retroactive denial of benefits after beneficiaries have been cer-tified for services. This is the result of social security guidelines beinginterpreted by fiscal intermediaries in a manner offering no flexibility.In effect, the intermediary overrides the utilization review commit- *See amp. 1, p. 7.39706 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS tee's decision. Not only is this a form of practicing medicine but it is an injustice to the patient needing medical care and to his family, often unable to pay for services already provided in good faith by the facility, but suddenly \"uncovered services.\" In this connection, I have personally received this reaction from several of the Western State associations making up region VIII of which I am vice president. Their responses to the subject matter before this committee are still coming in. I want to assure you, Mr. Chair- man, that the reports on medicare and title 19 in Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, and Hawaii will be filed with your committee within the specified time limit. Concluding our comments on retroactive denial of benefits, this situation which has continued for almost a year shows hope of clearing up. Some longstanding denials are now being authorized to be paid under instructions issued September 23 by Director Thomas M. Tier- ney of the Bureau of Health Insurance. While we are gratified at this progress, we feel that present policies continue to hamper the programs for the elderly. Mr. ORIOL. Mr. Gormly, if I may interrupt? For one, we will be happy to receive those reports. For another, I see Mr. Mulder is still here, and we are interested in full discussion, so if he has any comments to make at the end of this discussion, perhaps you would care to remain? Mr. GOREMLY. Fine. Perhaps I might elaborate and ad lib a little bit here on this retro- active denial. What has really happened is fthat the care has been pro- vided the patient under title 18, the billing submitted to the fiscal intermediary, and the patient has gone home thinking his bill has been paid, and that he was covered under an insurance program. And then payment was not made for the care going back 6 months. Mr. ORTOL. And it is the individual himself who becomes responsible for ultimate payment? Mr. GORMILY. Well, the recipient of medicare-the beneficiary of medicare-assumes that he has an insurance program covering his ill- ness, and all of a sudden by some decision made by some-not neces- sarily a medical staff- lhe is not covered under the program. Mr. ORIOL. Who is ultimately responsible for paying that bill? Mr. GORMILY. The patient-if he signs a financial responsibility. In other words, if he signs a financial responsibility statement saying he was responsible for his debt, regardless of governmental coverage or any other insurance coverage, then he would be responsible. But trying to go back 6 months and tell a patient, \"I am sorry, your benefits didn't come through\"-maybe the patient died-maybe he has moved. The point is, many times you can't recover the cost. Mr. ORIOL. So the nursing homes are bearing some financial loss be- cause of this? Mr. GORMLY. In Kansas City there were over $300,000 in claims dis- allowed-and arbitrarily disallowed. Mr. ORIOL. And how were those claims paid? Mr. GORmLY. They were not paid. Mr. ORIOL. In other words, the nursing home Mr. GORMLY. They couldn't find the patient.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 707 Mr. ORIOL. They could not collect? We have received reports fromelsewhere on this very problem, and we are very interested in it. Mr. GORMLY. Yes, very well. PROPOSED CHAPTER 9 OF PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL Finally, we would like briefly to mention the difficulties with whichowners of ECF's and skilled nursing homes will be confronted undera proposed draft of chapter 9 of the Provider Reimbusement Manualnow being considered by SSA. We were asked, along with other or-ganizations, to submit comments. Frankly, Mr. Chairman, we find the proposed draft objectionable,and moreover we feel that SSA is asserting authority that Congressdid not intend it to have. As stated in our comments submitted to SSA: Our primary objection * * * is that it is invalid and in violation of Section1801 of the Act. Section 1801 provides in part that \"Nothing in this title shall beconstrued to authorize any Federal officer or employee to exercise any super-vision or control * * * over the compensation of any officer or employee of anyinstitution, agency or person providing health services * * *\" Nothing could beclearer than the fact that the Social Security Administration is attemptingto regulate in an area from which it has been conclusively foreclosed by Congress. Since time is of the essence, Mr. Chairman, we wish only to citethis as another example of legislating by regulations, and/or guide-lines, which will impair the smooth operation of needed programs ofelderly patient care. In concluding, we wish to express our appreciation for this oppor-tunity to present comments on the effects of medicare and Medi-Cal.I would particularly like to put in the record the California Asso-ciation's gratitude for the cooperation and assistance received fromMrs. Mercia Leton Kahn-Regional representative for the WesternStates of the Social Security Administration-in developing title 18'sprogram in ECF's here in the Far West. Similarly, the State Department of Public Health of California,and the Department of Health Care Services have been most helpfuland cooperative, in their acting capacities as arms of the Federal Gov-ermnient on behalf of both the medicare and Medi-Cal programs.To us, our mutual relationships in bettering elderly patient care isa fine example of government and the private sector working togetherin a common cause * * * which is the same noble cause that brings usall here today. Mr. ORIOL. Thank you very much, Mr. Gormly. I might add that we are impressed by the evidence of the veryresponsible position taken by the American Nursing Homes Associa-tion in its statement. The Nursing Homes Association's statement onmatters that are of concern to the Federal Government because of thehigh level of assistance and support it gives. So we really thank you. Do any other members- Mr. GORMLY. If we may have another minute, I would like to givean example of what happens in this \"spell of illness\" thing.Unless you are familiar with it, or unless you prefer me to submitit for the record.708 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Mr. ORIOL. Well, we are getting-we are late-we are not just getting late. It might be better to submit it for the record. A written question that we will submit to you in writing is: How the intermediate care facility requirement under the 1967 amendment is affecting you here in California. In Washington they are very concerned about it, and we want to known how it is affecting you. Mr. GORMLY. We have filed-I believe-objections to the definition as published in the Federal Register, because we feel that intermediate care is a care concept that should encompass from the title 19 standards going down through licensed residential care facilities, because we don't think that the intermediate care patient is a static thing-that he remains in one spot. He will move from slot to slot. Maybe he will require nursing care 2 weeks and then be able to go into a residential care facility providing another type of program. And that is our main difference with the concept of intermediate care as published in the Federal Register. Mr. ORIOL. Thank you. Mr. Mulder, did you have anything you wanted to discuss at this point 2 Mr. MULDER. No. The points that Mr. Gormly discussed were pri- marily points to do with medicare. Mr. 01oL. Thank you. Thank you very much. Mr. GORMLY. Thank you. (Subsequent to the hearing, Senator Williams asked the following questions in a letter to Mr. Gormly:) 1. What are the most common reasons given for retroactive denial of nursing home benefits? We would like to have the reports from individual states for our hearing record. Have any improvements in the situation occurred since Director Tierney's directive of September 23? 2. What will be the likely effects of establishment of the \"Intermediate care\" category in California? Will redefinition of state categories be necessary? (The following reply was received:) 1. The common reason given for retroactive denial of Medicare nursing home benefits in California as well as other states is that the patient is not qualified to receive such services. This declaration made by the fiscal intermediary thus overrules completely the physician's medical decision. Director Tierney's instructions have lately begun to improve the situation. 2. The likely effect of establishing \"Intermediate Care\" in California would be to give official sanction to a continuing deficient level of skilled nursing home care, thru by-passing the higher Title XIX standards already pending implementa- tion in 1969. Pressure from agencies concerned with Medi-Cal costs would tend to result In moving patients \"down\" from Medi-Cal to Intermediate Care: the only practical difference being a reduction in professional nursing coverage from \"around the clock\" to day shift only. Already some 250 small nursing homes are expected to be de-certified from Medi-Cal in 1969 because of this very \"difference,\" i.e.., they cannot meet the higher standards of patient care. There is also considerable question as to how many Medicare and Medi-Cal certified facilities would seek to provide Intermediate Care for the same though transferred-downward patients at a lower reimbursement rate when they must be fully staffed and tooled up to the higher standards. The California State Association's position on Intermediate Care, based upon the H.E.W. guidelines requiring RN and LVN daytime staffing is that \"the quality of patient care would be seriously jeopardized by such a program and accordingly is incompatible with the State Association's standing policy advo- cating higher standards of patient care in nursing homes.\"COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 709 In addition, California possesses several thousand licensed Residential Carefacilities which, under proposed implementation of the Chappie Bill (AB 389-'68 Legislature) appear to offer a more appropriate type of \"Intermediate Care\"through a combination of board-and-room and other special services purchasedand arranged to better fit the needs of public assistance recipients not needingskilled nursing home care. It is possible that this latter approach may additionallyprove more economical to government than Intermediate Care per se. Mr. ORIOL. And now I would like to call Dr. Austin B. Chinn.It is a real pleasure to do so for many reasons. Dr. Chinn is veryhelpful in the discussion and early work on the preventicare bill, andwas the consultant to this subcommittee on the health of the elderlyin the first-in the two hearings that we conducted earlier.It is good to see you again, Doctor. Dr. CHINN. Thank you. Mr. ORIOL. We wanted to make you a \"wrap-up\" witness, Dr. Chinn. STATEMENT OF AUSTIN B. CHINN, M.D., PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AND DIRECTOR, REHABILITATION RESEARCH ANID TRAINING CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA Dr. CHINN. All right. If you will bear with me.The hour is very late, of course. I don't want to take any more timethan is absolutely necessary. What I have to say in attempting to summarize this very full daywould be presumptuous on my part in a full context. However, I canmake a few remarks regarding points which struck me during thehearings as germane to the issues you have.Many aspects of medicare and medicaid have been presented here.Some of them favorable, and some of them critical. To attempt tocomment on all these would be, really, out of order, I think.Dr. Todd commented on the aspects of surveillance which is beingprovided- by organized medicine relative to the medicaid program.And you, of course, have those remarks in the record.Dr. Littlejohn, I think, made some cogent remarks about some ofthe serious effects that medicaid is having upon medical care, partic-ularly in the ghetto areas. He said that actually, health services are leaving the ghetto areas asa result of medicaid. This, I think, is a very serious charge, partic-ularly since the people in the ghetto areas need medical care and healthservices more than people anywhere. We all know that the incidence of disease in the population of de-prived people is infinitely higher than it is in any other group in theUnited States. To witness removal of those health services that doexist seems to me to be a very, very serious thing.Dr. Giorgi gave us a sweeping survey of the entire health situation.I wouldn't really feel it appropriate for me to comment on what shesaid. A couple of things that Dr. Breslow said I would like to mention.He talked about the quality of medical care in this country and theneed for quality control and the influence of medicare and medicaidon quality control. One of his thoughts which I would like to emphasize. has to do withthe remarks he made about preventive health services. In this context,710 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS I think it is accurate to say that there has been in this country, in the past 25 years or more, a vast increase in medical knowledge and skill. The problem has been really to deliver the fruits of this knowledge and skill to the people of the Nation. A factor influencing the delivery of this knowledge is of course the increase in the population, particularly the increase in the very young and the very old. The urbanization of the population has also been an influential factor and has been a direct impediment to the delivery of health services. The shortage of health manpower has been a distinct impediment. There have also been social and economic forces which have im- peded the delivery of these fruits of knowledge and skill to the people. Included among these are attitudes and understanding on the part of people about health services. Distances from health services, particularly when old people had to travel, are involved with trans- portation difficulties, are also problems that are relative to this. The organization of health services and the attitudes of people of the health professions with respect to older people have some- times been impediments to the delivery of services. Poverty, it goes without saying, has been an enormous influence on the delivery of health services. In the stimulation and support of the delivery of care, however, we have the normal humanitarian instincts that exist in the minds of people in this Nation. These civilized and humanitarian instincts have, of course, pre- dominated with respect to most of us and counter the other influences which tend to impede. Also, a promising increase in health plan power and a promising evolution of different kinds of manpower such as the doctor assistant and the nursing assistant, is emerging. i better use of manpower is undoubtedly coming about and there are promising organizational changes, such as the establishment of better institutions as here in California. For example, the Long Beach General Hospital, which is devoted entirely to the care of elderly people is an excellent in- stitution, and that kind of thing, I think, is emerging. We are also having better kinds of health services such as home care, home-health services, and ambulatory services, all of which leads toward the development of better utilization of this knowledge that I was talking about earlier. TaE VoID: INACTION ON PREVENTION But it seems to me, the most important void in all of this-which Dr. Breslow touched upon and also Dr. Giorgi and has been referred many times here today, is the prevention of illness. This, it seems to me, of necessity has to be approached realistically in this country sometime within the near future. Most attention to illness and disease in this Nation has been di- rected to the immediate treatment of the sick-with hospitalization, nursing care, medicare, and such other measures necessary to bring about a cure. Historically, however, the greatest progress in health in the world has been made on the one hand by the primary prevention of disease as the acute infectious diseases-smallpox, typhoid fever, diphtheria,COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 711 and so forth-brought about by immunization, sanitation, andquarantine, and on the other hand the identification of disease in itsearly or presymptomatic stage. Those two principles have influencedthe health of the world more than any other influences that have beenknown since the dawn of mankind.When I talk about the identification of disease in its early orprimary or presymptomatic stage, we have as graphic illustrations ofthis the diseases of tuberculosis and syphilis.Both of these of course are chronic infectious diseases and theircontrol has been largely brought about by their identification whilein a nonsymptomatic stage. The identification of pulmonary tuber-culosis in its earliest stage-where it is only a minor shadow on anX-ray film is in marked contrast to an advanced stage of the disease,with cavitation, and other evidence of widespread disease.The medical contrast between those two situations is graphic beyondbelief as is the contrast in cost of their management.The same thing is true of the other chronic disease that I named,syphilis. The identification of this disease by simple blood test ascontrasted to its symptomatic stage with nervous system or cardio-vascular system involvement is strikingly different.The contrast between management of the chronic infectious diseasesin their early nonsymptomatic stages with their management insymptomatic stages is graphic. There is no reason why the chronic,noninfectious diseases may not fall into similar categories ofmanagement. The same principles of early identification of noninfectious chronicdiseases are as vital and as applicable as the early identification of thechronic infectious diseases. Such diseases as hypertension, coronary artery disease, glaucoma,cancer of the uterine cervix and breast, and mouth, pulmonaryemphysema, and a host of others can all be identified in an earlyor presymptomatic stage. The technology is available, and there isno reason why it cannot be applied. These hearings have been directed toward the principle of cost.It seems to me that if we are thinking of increasing cost of medicalcare, as it presently exists, we can think only in terms of building,increasing numbers of hospital beds, of educating increasing numbersof physicians, nurses, and other professional people and of increas-ing efforts directed to the care of the already sick. We will thus have increasing costs of hospital beds-and theseother services for the sick for t~he foreseeable future. Where do wewind up? The Nation is increasing at the rate of millions of peopleevery decade, and all that we can expect is to increase the number ofbeds and doctors and professional people to take care of them.The cost, on the other hand, of early identification of these diseases,which are filling the hospitals, causing morbidity, and mortality mustbe looked at in comparison. COST \"MINISCULE\" IN RELATION TO BENEFITS I think that the cost of this, though substantial initially in the effortto find the disease, and in the event the disease is found, to move theindividual into the receipt of health care, is minuscule compared tothe management of that same individual months or years later follow-712 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS ing the development of an advanced stage of the disease with the pros- pect of long periods of hospitalization, or other institutionalization, physician services, nursing services, and on and on and on. It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that we are at the point wherein we must face the issue of whether we want to do what we are doing now, or whether we are willing to sponsor the support and development of this type of health service as we did with biomedical research some 25 years ago. I would like to remind you that for all practical purposes, biomedi- cal research was in its infant stages immediately after the Second World War. I think the Cancer Institute had its origin before the war, and maybe the Heart Institute, but the effort was really in its infancy. Out of this has grown a stupendous body of knowledge in 25 years. But it would never have come about if we had sat back and done what we were doing in the late 1930's and early 1940's. Today, we are at the same stage, essentially, with respect to this seg- ment of health services that we were 25 years ago with respect to bio- medical research. I would urge the committee to consider what steps it might take with respect to these humanitarian and the social and economic interests. Thank you. Mr. ORIOL. Doctor, we thank you. I think it is apparent to the few hardy survivors here yet remaining why we asked Dr. Chinn to give us not only testimony but wisdom and a vision of what we hope will be the future. I have many questions, and some of them will find their way to you in the form of the mail, but one question I would like to try out on you now: There has been much discussion today about how you cannot separate health care for the elderly from health care for all. It is regarded as part of the total health system. But in terms of organiza- tion, the attention given to health services for the elderly at the Fed- eral level-is there some advantage to having a unit of government at a very high level devoted to the health care of the elderly? And I say that knowing full well that you are the former chief of the Adult Health and Aging Branch of the Public Health Service, but in view of the rising numbers of the elderly, in view of the increased attention being given to health costs simply because we now have medicare, do we not get similar benefits if we use the kind of quality health services given to the elderly as one way of raising the quality of services for all? Dr. CIITNN. I think it is, as has been said here today, that medicare has not only done a great deal for the older person, but has done a great deal for medicine and medical care in this Nation as a whole. HEALTH PROBLEMS OF OLDER PEOPLE As you well know, the health problems of older people are quan- titatively infinitely greater than they are for any other age group. Qualitatively, one might argue about whether they are different, but quantitatively they are different, and there are many more complexi- ties relative to these health problems. I don't consider physical health problems alone: I am also talking about social health problems and mental health problems. All of these things interdigitate with respect to the influence of one area upon another.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 713 It seems to me that quantitatively if we are looking for the greatest health problems that exist in the Nation, one can profitably look to- ward the elderly population. If we can solve these problems or can come even close to solving them, or develop mechanisms for solving them- then this cannot help but have a large impact on the rest of the population. I would be the first to say that the health problems of elderly peo- ple-whether they be physical, mental, or social-do not necessarily begin when they are 65-when an individual gets to be 65. They begin in younger years, certainly, in the fifth and sixth decades of life, or maybe even in the third or fourth decades. Therefore, the problems as we know them in elderly people are qualitatively not peculiar to older people but there are more of them. I would endorse emphatically the fact that if one can focus down upon them, the impact of this upon the health of the Nation as a whole would certainly be profound. Mr. ORIoL. Another question I wanted to raise: The Kaiser Permanente-or Kaiser Foundation health multiphasic screening program has been mentioned here quite often today. I think it is important for the record that we note that the persons receiving this screening are members of a prepaid group health plan. When we talk of widespread multiphasic health screening, possibly along the lines suggested by the Preventicare-or more specifically along the lines that are now at work in three or four pilot health screening programs, which were initiated, I believe, while you were with the Public Health Service-with all those, you are dealing with a group that is not organized into a prepaid package. How can you hope to get widespread participation? What are the difficulties here? PuBnrc ACCEPTANCE oF PREVENTIcAnE Dr. CHINN. Well, I don't think that all of the difficulties are known. And this is, I think, one of the reasons that the four prototypes that you mentioned, which are now in operation in communities, will serve to disclose a great many of the problems that are inherent in an open- ended community program. The lack of close physician participation and the lack of proper understanding of many people who would be coming to such a screening operation present real problems. Factors about the delivery of the information and the followup and utilization of the information-all of these factors, I think, are un- known. However, I would say this: It took a great many years, many centuries, as a matter of fact, before the value of hospitals came to be recognized as something other than \"death houses.\"Prior to and including the 17th century, and indeed into the 18th century, one didn't go to a hospital to get well, one went to die. And it took 150 to 200 years before people learned to go to hospitals to get well. Formerly it wasn't recognized as a place to help the sick individual; it was a place to which to remove the dying person from society and hide him away. This is an exaggerated statement, of course, but it seems to me thatwhat we are talking about here today may require a long period of acceptance. But once it has been shown to the public that the identifi- cation of disease before it is symptomatic has proven its value, we won't have more trouble with public acceptance.714 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS As it stands now, the public hardly accepts any preventive health measures. People won't stop smoking-people won't stop overeating- people won't stop drinking excessively-so when one says this thing will soon be clasped to the breast of the general public, it is sheer 'nonsense. But the fact of the matter is that there never has been any health measure that I know of, which has been accepted, nor should it be until it has been proved to be of value. I think this is essentially where we are today. Mr. ORIOL. It was said earlier today that it is the same old card- players around the same old table in the terms of people or groups of people involved in our health effort. Do you think old cardplayers can learn new tricks? Do you feel the same sort of concern that was expressed earlier? Dr. CIIINN. I do not necessarily; I am old, and am still learning new tricks. I see no reason to think that everybody else can't. I think that the health professions are on the verge of learning new tricks. I would like to say a word about the ferment that is going on in medical education today. Medical educators are aware of this card table and these tricks-old tricks. They are doing something, really, very intensively about it. There is an enormous amount of activity going on toward the revision of medical curriculums, revising educa- tional programs to fit into and to be in accord with the tempo of the times. And I think that all these educators are not necessarily young. Some of them are rather advanced in years-such as myself. So I think they can learn new tricks. I think there is a climate here today that has no parallel since the Flexner report of 1912. CHANGES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION I think that the whole system of medical education is about to under- go a radical revision and to try new approaches to what it is supposed to be doing. What kind of man or woman is supposed to be turned out of a med- ical school? What are they going to do after they leave medical school? Mr. ORIOL. You mentioned the Flexner report just then, and that set the stage beautifully for this question: Within recent months an attempt was made to establish a presi- dentially appointed Commission-we will call it Health Maintenance and Disease Prevention-the idea being on that high level, much as the Commission that produced the heart, stroke, and cancer legisla- tion-this Commission produced a report so comprehensive, so over- whelming, that it would set the stage for every kind of action you described in terms of disease prevention. Do you think that this Commission is a good way to begin, or would you rather see an action program begun to make the point dramatic cally, or do you think it might be a combination of both? Dr. CE[NN. I think it should be a combination of both. I don't see how you can really have one without the other. The Commission study would be worthless unless it could be im- plemented-whatever its recommendations were.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 715 At the same time, I think you have isolated islands of activitygoing on without a national image. It will also take decades to getthis idea across to the public.I think that the two in concert would be the proper answer to this,and I would endorse it enthusiastically. Mr. ORIOL. Do you have any questions? Well, I would like to thank you, Dr. Chinn, especially for yourcontribution as well as all the other witnesses, in absentia, for a reallygood record which will give the subcommittee much to work within the months ahead. I would also like to correct an outstanding deficiency of the dayby introducing Mr. Shalon Ralph, the professional member of thecommittee. This is his first hearing. Mr. Ralph was retired until he joined the committee recently.I also wish to introduce to you Mrs. Slinkard, our chief clerk.And once again, thanks to all. (Whereupon, at 5 :15 p.m., the subcommittee adjourned, subject tothe call of the Chair.)APPENDIXES APPENDIX 1 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR EXHIBITS FROM WITNESSES ITEM 1: EXHIBITS RELATED TO STATEMENT OF DR. MALCOLM C. TODD,* PRESIDENT, CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION EXHIBIT A. CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION-CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION PROCEDURES FOR REVIEW OF EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION OF HOSPITAL SERVICES (Adopted by Office of Health Care Services, June 12, 1968)Afm To provide Medi-Cal with a system of safeguards in the utilization of hos-pital services; and to assist hospitals to maintain and strengthen standards of care. Need Providers of health services have a responsibility for assuring that the pub-lic interest is being served in the delivery of hospital services for personscovered by the Medi-Cal program. Quality is the most important component to effective hospital service. Stand-ards of quality can be best judged by professional peers, functioning expresslyto review patterns of hospital practice. Methods In cooperation with the California Hospital Association and the CaliforniaMedical Association and under the provisions of their agreements as the con-tracting carriers with the State of California, Hospital Service of Californiaand Hospital Service of Southern California will organize and implement thefollowing procedures for reviewing irregular patterns of practices by hospitalsparticipating in the Medi-Cal program: 1. Screening for irregularity In the conduct of its customary and routine procedures, provider claims forservice are reviewed by the contracting carrier for conformity to prevailingstandards of practice and Medi-Cal regulations. This work is performed by staffwith proven skills for discerning presumptive irregularity. All questionableclaims are referred to a special unit of the contracting carrier's organizationwhere specially-trained staff-carry out further analyses. 2. Detecting irregularity When there is reasonable question about the justification of a series of claims,contracting carrier staff collects information needed for clarification. If, afterthis further evaluation which frequently involves field data collection and directcontact with the provider, questions about suspect patterns are not satisfied,the provider institution is ,placed under special review. A record of the provider'spattern of practices is developed. Should the record reasonably convince thecontracting carrier about provider irregularity and subsequent efforts with theprovider fail to correct detected patterns, the contracting carrier, with notice See statement, -P. 446. 717 24-798-69-pt. 8-8718 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS to the Office of Health Care Services, shall ask for the establishment of a peerpanel to review the problem. S. Referring for peer review (a) Panel designation.-Upon request from the contracting carrier, the desig-nated officer of the California Hospital Association and the designated officer ofthe California Medical Association will appoint appropriate persons from amongtheir respective memberships who agree to function as peer review panelists. Each panel shall consist of at least two hospital administrators and two phy-sicians with a chairman designated by mutual agreement of the respective desig-nated officers. Panel members will serve without compensation but shall receivefrom the contracting carriers reasonable reimbursement for travel and living ex-penses. The contracting carrier will serve as staff and attend all meetings of thepanel. (b) Referral to committee.-The contracting carrier shall make a written re-port to the panel, informing them of the nature of the matter to be considered,summary of data collected, and history of efforts to resolve issues presented. Atthe time of referral, the contracting carrier shall advise the panel members thattheir findings and recommendations will be reported to the Office of Health CareServices. One of the primary aims in activating a peer review panel is to counselproviders on ways for correcting patterns and irregularities and for improvingtheir services and economic practices, regardless of sources of payment. (c) Yotice of hearing.-The provider shall be given written notice of anymeeting at which the peer review panel will receive evidence on the matter sub-mitted. This notice shall be given by the panel no less than 10 days prior tosuch hearing. The notice shall state the nature of the matter under submission.If particular cases are to be discussed, the provider shall be furnished informa-tion needed for identification. If the matter under submission involves a patternof conduct or if it is impractical to list specific cases, the provider shall begiven information sufficient to enable him to identify the period involved and thenature of any procedures in question. The contracting carrier will provide thepanel with the facts in support of any alleged irregularities. (d) Attendance by the provider.-The provider shall be entitled to attend anypanel meeting while evidence regarding him is received. The provider shallhave the right to see any documentary material received by the panel. The pro-vider shall be accorded adequate opportunity to present evidence on his own be-half, or to rebut any evidence offered against him, or to offer any explanationto the panel. The provider shall have the right to be accompanied by counsel butcounsel shall not be entitled to participate in any hearing unless the chairmanor a majority of the panel determines that his participation would be of assist-ance to the panel. These hearings shall be informal and the rules of court- room evidence do not apply. Failure of the provider, without reasonable excuse, to attend scheduled meetings shall not preclude the panel from carrying out itsproceedings. (e) Written record.-A summary record shall be prepared in any case wherethe panel recommends action limiting or denying future or continued participa-tion in the Medi-Cal program, including recommendations for imposition ofrequirements. In such cases, the record shall: (1) Indicate the date of any hearings and the persons In attendance; (2) Contain or summarize all testimony; (3) Include all documentary evidence received; (4) Describe any other evidence received; (5) Contain *the findings and recommendations of the panel, indicatingthe vote on each finding and recommendation; (6) Include copies of notices to the provider. (f) Findings.-In such cases, the panel shall make specific findings on thoseissues which have clear and convincing proof in support of any recommendationmade. Causes for suspension are enumerated in Medi-Cal Regulations, Sec. 51455(b) of Title 22, California Administrative Code, and the findings muststate which provision or provisions thereof have been violated by the provider.Insofar as is practical, reference should be made to specific testimony or otherevidence supporting each finding. All actions of the panel shall be by vote ofthe majority. (g) Recommnendation8.-The panel shall make a written recommendationas to action to be taken. In any case where the recommendation would Imposeconditions on future payments or participation, the panel shall Indicate howand when the recommendation should be Implemented.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 719 (h) Notice of decision.-The provider shall be mailed a copy of the panel'sfindings and recommendations upon issuance, and he shall be advised in writingas to appeal. (i) Rehearing.-The chairman or a majority of the panel may grant a rehear-ing when it appears that the provider offers substantial new evidence which hecould not reasonably have offered at the hearing, or when it appears that thepanel has acted in error. (j) Report to the Office of Health Care Services.-It will be the responsibilityof the contracting carrier to forward the record of the panel, including findingsand recommendations, to the Office of Health Care Services and to CaliforniaBlue Shield. The Office of Health Care Services will initiate appropriate action,with appropriate notification to the provider. The chairman of the panel or amember designated by the chairman will be available and will be present andparticipate in any hearings conducted by the Office of Health Care Services. Evaluation of the system After a year's experience, *the California Hospital Association and the Cali-fornia Medical Association, working closely with the Office of Health CareServices, will examine the effectiveness of the peer review method and reporttheir conclusion to the Secretary of Human Relations for the State of California. EXHIBIT B. THE INTERMEDIARY FUNCTIONING OF THE TITLE 19 PROGRAM INCALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT TO INSTITUTIONAL CARE HISTORICAL sAcKGROUND When the U.S. Congress enacted legislation creating Medicare, it declaredits intent to take full advantage of the experience of private organizations tofulfill the program's goals. Thus, Medicare adopted methods-such as calculating benefits in terms ofdays of care; paying for service through cost reimbursement and involvingproviders of health care services in the professional review and control ofquantity and quality of care-all of which were pioneered originally by BlueCross-the country's largest prepayment system.The California Legislature in passage of A.B.5, December 17, 1965, to set upMedi-Cal under Title 19 (Medicaid), also turned to the private sector. BlueCross in both Northern and Southern California and California Blue Shieldwere selected for their respective responsibilities as fiscal intermediaries. Theselection was made on February 19, 1966, just nine days before the effective dateof Medi-Cal, March 1, 1966.The knowledge and experience of these three private, nonprofit corporations,in professional health benefits management, their available facilities and theirtrained personnel were primary factors in getting the program underway inthe short time from notification of selection to \"start-up\" time. EARLY PROBLEMs The short lead-time made it difficult for the State Government to adequatelydescribe the Medi-Cal requirements in advance to the providers or the public.As Medi-Cal began, many administrative details had not been worked out. In theearly weeks there were often clarifications, interpretations and actual changesin regulations. All such changes were communicated, interpreted, and fed intothe system by Blue Cross on a day-to-day basis. A FOSTERING RELATIONSHIP A major factor in the ability of the fiscal intermediaries to perform has beenthe excellent guidance and cooperative support given by the Department ofHealth Care Services of the California Health and Welfare Agency. The pro-gram's success might have been considerably diminished without the capableassistance provided by this agency of the California Government with itsobvious awareness of the affected public's health care needs.Medi-Cal is in fact an excellent example of how well such a program canoperate when policy guidelines are laid down by a government agency andcarried out operationally by a private organization. It is a prime example of720 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS government and the private sector of our society working together in the public interest. BLUE CROSS GOALS It may help here to outline the Blue Cross goals in its fiscal intermediary role under title 19. These are: 1. To handle, process and pay claims and to pay them on the same basis as in all other sectors of Blue Cross operations; 2. To interpret correctly and carry-out governmental objectives to -the satisfaction of both the government and the contracting parties; 3. To recognize problems and areas of potential problems in providing services and to communicate such knowledge to the government as needed. This, of course, requires Blue Cross to represent two parties-the providers- hospitals, nursing homes, extended care facilities, rehabilitation centers, home health agencies, and others-which offer the institutional services, and the government, which provides the benefits to the ultimate recipient, the public. 4. To assist the providers of the service-the institutions concerned- to operate in an optimal manner in all specific and collateral services rendered. 5. Finally, in the administration of the program, to make Blue Cross responsive in seeing that the public's right to good health is recognized and respected. These goals are consistent with the services Blue Cross provides to the public and to the institutions with which it works. They are also consistent with Blue Cross' major corporate goal, which is to provide all segments of the population with the means of obtaining the highest quality of medical care in the most effective and economical manner with continued dedication to the preservation of the voluntary health care system. WHAT BLUE .CROSS PROVIDES The State Government was able to take maximum advantage of Blue Cross' capabilities and unique services. These include: 1. Experience in private, prepaid health care programs, particularly in those providing service benefits; 2. Existing facilities with related equipment and trained personnel; 3. Experience in cost-related reimbursement programs; 4. Long-established relations with providers of covered services; 5. Experience with the coordination needed for the requirements of both Medi-Cal and Medicare; 6. Long history of cooperation with Blue Shield (physician prepayment agency similar to Blue Cross' role in providing prepaid hospital care); 7. Control mechanisms, i.e. fiscal claims 'and utilization of review proce- dures and systems. Blue Cross helps to safeguard the tax dollars of the public. It does this in the course of its normal procedures in its review and audit activities. There are two broad categories of this activity: The first is preventive and is covered by carefully detailed individual billing instructions with on-the-scene visits to smooth out eligibility and processing problems and also various group educational programs, institutes and seminars. The second could be called correctional, i.e., the creation of safeguards against abuse and follow-up regarding appropriateness of activities in connection with the Medi-Cal program, through audits and utilization reviews. These two categories of activity are carried out by the seventy-six Blue Cross field people who routinely and regularly visit all hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and other providers. These are trained representatives who are specialists in professional relations utilization review and reimbursement. Their primary purpose is to help the facilities concerned comply with the operational requirements of Medi-Cal. It is clear. however, that in the process of doing this they create a network of communications and a clearing-house for interpretation and cross-reference which helps prevent and/or correct potential abuses under Title 19. There are 566 acute care facilities, 1,215 nursing homes, and 122 'home health agencies and free-standing clinics, for a total of 1,903 providers in California. These are furnished information regarding the Medi-Cal program through Blue Cross bulletins, workshops, routine and special visits, provider visits to the inter-COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 721 mediaries' office, telephone communications, individual letters, and participation by the intermediaries in regional and State provider association meetings. Since the inception of Mfedi-Cal, March 1, 1966, Blue Cross has an increasingly intensive utilization review and audit program to safeguard against abuses while at the same time assuring that eligible recipients receive optimal health care. BLUE CROSS-MIEDI-CAL'S \"CLEARING1OUSE\" Medi-Cal is a vast program as the later charts on performance show. In sup- port of Medi-Cal, Blue Cross acts-as does Blue Shield in its particular field- as a \"clearinghouse\" in behalf of the State of California to: 1. Receive bills for services rendered to eligible people, determine com- pliance with regulations Sand approve for payment those bills that meet the requirements of law and regulation, including those that apply to the appropriateness of costs and charges. 2. Maintain all necessary records and furnish the State all necessary information and reports. 3. Provide liaison and coordination with providers and groups, organiza- tions, committees representing them, or other interested parties. 4. Apply safeguards against unnecessary utilization, abuse and fraud. REI-MBURSEMENT Blue Cross' experience in cost-related-reimbur-sement is unequalled. Blue Cross has a staff of accountants trained in hospital accounting fully qualified to review financial statements, determine allowable cost and apply a reimbursement formula. Since the State initially adopted a formula similar to the one Blue Cross of Southern California uses, Blue Cross was able to provide an existing staff of experts. Understandably, confusion could develop if a single provider, for example, was subject to audit by Blue Cross for its business; by another Medicare inter- mediary for Medicare claims; and 'by a state agency for Medi-Cal. As it is, in most instances, a single audit suffices. The hospital can supply its cost figures to Blue Cross, and Blue Cross can determine payment for all. RELATIONS WITH PROVIDERS An important advantage of Blue Cross' administration of the Medi-Cal program is its long-term favorable relationship to hospitals. Actually, the hospitals, along with the general public, have a voice in the policy and operations of Blue Cross through board membership. Blue Cross is sponsored and supported by hospitals; Blue Cross works closely with recognized hospital organizations; the contractual relationship between hospitals and Blue Cross is yet another bond between the providers of institutional care and the fiscal intermediary in the Medical pro- gram. The hospitals and the general public are accustomed to working with Blue Cross. Evidence of provider preference for Blue Cross can be found in the fact that 92% of all Medicare participating hospitals in California selected Blue Cross as intermediary under that program. So did 60% of extended care facilities and almost all home health agencies. While selection by provider is not permitted under Medi-Cal, it can be assumed that there would be essentially the same ratioof preference for Blue Cross. This provider rapport works to the advantage of the Medi-Cal program inother ways. Blue Cross field representatives, who regularly visit hospitals andother providers, help train personnel in administrative practices involving Medi- Cal. They also serve to answer questions and solve problems that might arise, in advance. Hospitals prefer to work with Blue Cross, rather than directly with govern- ment. Blue Cross understands hospital problems and manages an equitable bal- ance of provider and state interests in administering Medi-Cal. COORDINATION BETWEEN MEDI-CAL AND MEDICARE Many Californians are covered by both Medicare and Medi-Cal. In such cases, the provider-where Blue Cross is the intermediary-may submit one claim on the Medicare form and refer to coverage under Medi-Cal. The Medicare claim722 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS form is processed and amounts payable under both programs are determined.Payment is thus made by the same organization but from separate funds. These dual claims currrently run almost 40,000 per month. Since in the greatmajority of cases Blue Cross administers both programs, coordination is easily accomplished, and speedily. Were another organization to administer Medi-Cal, delays and most probably confusion might develop in coordinating the benefits payable under the two programs. COOPERATION WITr BLUE SHIELD AND OTHER INTERMEDIARIES Blue Cross enjoys cordial working relationships with Blue Shield and other intermediaries. As an example of how this Is helpful to Medi-Cal (and Medicare) administra- tion, both Blue Shield and insurance companies request information abouthospital care through Blue Cross. This system reduces the number of people who approach hospitals to review confidential medical records. It is customary for hospital personnel who know Blue Cross personnel to allow them ready access to necessary information. CONTROL MECHANISMS Blue Cross processes claims professionally-that is, with an eye to services which could be inconsistent with the diagnosis and charges not in line with similar hospitals. This same service is performed for Medi-Cal. The system requires trained personnel and cooperation from the providers. The procedure 1. Claims are reviewed for benefits or exclusions, for medical necessity and for appropriate charges; 2. Claims requiring medical evaluation are sent to the Medical Audit & Review Section; 3. This section, staffed by experienced medical auditors, reviews the claim. It is approved and returned for processing and payment, or Is referred for further check; 4. When indicated, an investigator is sent to the facility to obtain copies of patient records. These records are reviewed by a physician who is a Blue Cross medical advisor in instances where a physician's judgment concerning the medical aspects is required; 5. A claim, rejected for medical reasons, is returned to the provider with an explanation by the physician; 6. Should a questionable pattern of care develop, the facility's claims are audited. The provider is invited to discuss questionable claims. If a problem is still not solved, the provider meets with the Peer Committee of the California Hospital Association for final examination and resolution. The Professional Relations Department also has responsibility for Blue Cross' activities in utilization review. As required under Medicare, utilization review is being installed in most hospitals to apply to all patients. In this sensitive area, Blue Cross' professional assistance and counsel is readily accepted because of its long experience and close relationship with providers. SUMMfARY To summarize-since March 1, 1966, Blue Cross has worked with 1,903 pro- viders, and paid 4,010,945 claims, totalling $730,367,036. Over the past 'thirty months, significant improvements in performance have been achieved through the informational, utilization review and audit procedures and collateral educational and support operations. Medi-Cal has come through its early problems of changes in regulations and policies, the complexities and resultant delays in determining eligibilities and the cross-relation with Medicare in determining eligibility and usage under that program. In its intermediary role between the providers and eligible beneficiaries and under the fostering policy guidance of the Department of Health Care Services, Blue Cross has seen the program become an efficient contributor to the health care of the people of California. Blue Cross welcomes the projected plan for systems analysis of administration of Medi-Cal and will join the Department of Social Welfare, the Department ofCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 723 Health Care Services, and all other interested institutions and departmentsin working for its success.

DUDLEY,* ASSISTANT REGIONAL DIRECTOR, WESTERN REGIONAL OFFICE, NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE EXHIBIT A. LETTER TO DIRECTOR OF HUMAN RELATIONs AGENCY, STATE OF CALIFORNIA MAY 6, 1968. DEAR MR. WILLIAMS: Recently many of the Negro Professionals offering services to Medi-Cal recipients have brought to our attention two extreme hard- ships being imposed upon them by the slowness of services given by the Blue Shield Company. Upon discussing this with the Los Angeles office of Blue Shield it was suggested that their services would be greatly improved if two innovative changes were made, these are: (1) Establishment of a Southern California Computer Center to process this region's claims; (2) Adoption, state wide, of the San Bernardino Plan, which involves each recipient having 5 eligibility cards being given to them each month for use by practitioners to enable the elimination, in time, of the processing of eligibility by Blue Shield. As these two innovations are feasible, we would strongly urge the adoption of same. Blue Shield states, that, as of today, they are processing January and February applications for payment which indicates a hardship on the practitioners. It was most rewarding having an opportunity to talk with you personally during lunch at the Human Relations Commission Luncheon meeting in Sacramento last week. Sincerely, JUANITA CARROLL DUDLEYu, Assistant Regional Director, Health and Welfare. EXHIBIT B. NEwSPAPER ARTICLE CONCERNING REPORT ON MEDI-CAL PROGRAM BY CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE* LYNCH CHARGES MEDI-CAL FRAUD SACRAMENTO.-Nursing homes, drugstores and other parts of the medical es- tablishment are robbing the state's Medi-Cal program of at least $8 million and probably more every year, Atty. Gen. Thomas C. Lynch has charged. His Department of Justice said a nine-month investigation into abuses of the $800 million program showed Medi-Cal was riddled with kickbacks, phony claims, \"overserviced\" patients and other \"illegal and unethical activities.\" A 75-page report charged that physicians, dentists, druggists, optometrists, hospitals, nursing homes and others paid with Medi-Cal funds cheated the tax- payers out of about 1 per cent of the program's budget. *See statement, p. 666.**See full report, app. 4, pp. 812-836.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 725 Lynch's chief deputy, Charles O'Brien, told a news conference that the tempta- tion to abuse Medi-Cal was made easier by a vast bureaucracy operated by both the state and its fiscal intermediaries, Blue Cross and Blue Shield. The report identified no bilkers and called for no indictments. O'Brien said the attorney general could not prosecute because records were too inadequate to make a case. \"The best prosecutor in the world would be hard-pressed to use these records,\" he said. State human relations secretary Spencer Williams demanded that specific cases of fraud be identified and prosecuted. O'Brien acknowledged that while there might have been some deliberate \"over- utilization\" by medi-care recipients, nearly all the abuses were by the medical profession. \"One of the worst ironies in the world is that when we are talking about law and order and increasing penalties for liquor store holdups, that striped tie, but- toned-down crimes goes unpunished,\" he said. About 1.5 million poor Californians receive free medical care under the pro- gram, financed by state, federal and local governments. Blue Cross and Blue Shield funnel the money from the state and the medical suppliers. But O'Brien charged \"the private sector has not handled it (Medi-Cal funds) the way the private sector handles its own funds.\" He said the intermediaries were paid on a cost-plus basis \"so there is no incentive for improvement.\" He also asserted the state had no effective enforcement program \"to discover, investigate and defer\" frauders. Professional and other organizations criticized the report as \"generalized\" and \"vague.\" They demanded proof of such claims as: Druggists charge the state three times as much for the same medication as they charge the public. Some nursing homes require \"under the table\" payments from patients to secure admission while others accept kickbacks from vendors in exchange for business. Doctors, dentists, optometrists and other professional falsified claims for treatment that was never performed or for treatment that was unnecessary. In one case, an optometrist sought state authorization for an expensive pair of sunglasses for a blind patient. Some nursing homes pocketed for their own use state funds for incidental patient expenses. O'Brien said the Justice Department is investigating the possibility that organized crime had infiltrated the nursing home business, but that evidence so far has not indicated it is extensive. Williams said the state has not and \"will not tolerate fraudulent misuse of Medi-Cal funds by those who receive or provide services.\" He said he requested a meeting with Lynch's staff, \"to secure specific cases of fraud and abuse which were uncovered.\" He added, 'we will continue to insist on prosecution in any case where there is evidence of wrongdoing.\" EXHIBIT C. LETTER FROM ROBEET H. WEST, VETERANS AFFAIRS COORDINATOR, TO ADVISORY BOARD MEMBERS JUNE 8, 1968. DEAR VETERANS AFFAIRS ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER: On Tuesday, June 18, Senate Bill 1263, sponsored by Urban League Veterans Affairs, will be heard before the Education Committee in Sacramento. This bill is an effort to recognize the college equivalency of armed forces technical training and service. Specifically, this bill, introduced by Mervyn Dymally, will allow 15 semester units for each year in the service as a medical technologist or laboratory technician up to 60 units or equiv- alent to two years of college work. This college credit will encourage veterans to take advantage of GI Bill educa- tion and earn their degrees as medical technologists. Another beneficial feature of this legislation is to alleviate the shortage of trained medical technologists presently plaguing the world of medicine.726 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Senate Bill 1263 is a real breakthrough of the archaic bonds in our educational system. This recognition of armed services education is long overdue and can be a pilot legislation for federal efforts in this vital area. This effort to solve the joint problems of veteran unemployment and unmet medical needs is but one of the enterprising, innovational ventures of your Urban League. Please call me with any constructive comments on the subject of this bill. I might add that the outlook is extremely optimistic-at this time there is no opposition. Sincerely, RICHARD H. WEST, Veterans Affairs Coordinator. ExHIBIT D. LEGISLATION INTRODUCED, CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE, DESIGNED To PRO- VIDE AN EDUCATIONAL EQUIVALENCE TO VETERANS WITH CERTAIN KINDS OF TRAIN- ING; SENATE BILL 1263 CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE, SENATE COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL WELFARE, Sacramento, Calif., June 5, 1968. Mr. RICHARD WEST, Urban League, Los Angeles, Calif. DEAR DICK: As you are aware, I have introduced legislation in the current legislative session which is designed to provide an educational equivalence to veterans with certain kinds of training. Specifically, the measure is Senate Bill 1263, and it pertains to veterans who have had training and experience as clinical technicians in the armed forces of the United States. We believe this legislation is in line with the recent efforts called for by Presi-dent Johnson to assist veterans in the transition from the military to the civilian sector of life. Further, we are sure that the valuable and worthwhile experience these men have gained could be of immeasurable worth to the needs of the com- munities of our state. In view of these factors, I am willing to devote the full resources of my office to seek the passage of Senate Bill 1263. Any assistance you can provide towardthat end will be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, MERVYN M. DYMALLY. [Enclosure] SENATE BILL NO. 1263 * CHAPTER - An act to amend Section 1261 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to clinical laboratory technology.

PROPOSAL FOR A COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANNING FOUNDATION I. THE NEED For a very long time in Medicine, we know much better than we do. Thegap between technology and its clinical application becomes ever wider in spiteof a very generous National budget. Our great potential for comprehensive careIs dissipated through duplication and lack of coordination. Addition of numerousisolated, poorly thought out programs, have only served to escalate costs and addto the chaos and ferment. What is needed is a new health care delivery model, which makes optimum useof what is already there, through coordination and unification, and simultane-ously promotes dynamic health education towards improved health practicesand proper use of health care services. Advanced medical science has succeeded in the virtual eradication of a hardcore of disease predominantly responsive to antimicrobial therapy and surgical *See statement. p. 6S6.728 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS extirpation. What is left are the degenerative, neoplastic, metabolic, and emo-tional disruptions-all very possibly linked in causation-for which there are no cures. Thus mortality figures improve, while morbidity increases. The inseparability of man from his genetic inheritance and his total environ-ment; and the need to treat all if we are to produce optimum function and totalhealth-is becoming increasingly mandatory as the diseases of stress become more and more predominant. Total health planning of this order, requires a degree of technologic com- petence, not within the scope of an isolated medical sector, trained mainly In the biologic. It requires a broad scoped multi and interdisciplinary-consortiumapproach. An enlightened public-recipient of health care services-demands change. Harried providers of services are ready for it. Large consumers such as labor- management, government and industry threaten outright planning, ownership,and direct rendering of services. The Congress has mandated change and has recommended regional adaptation and partnership planning. The time was never so propitious. There is a great need to define and relegate the role of all involvedand concerned if we are to plan most effectively. Figure I depicts a suggested relegation of roles: FIGURE I.-Sponsorship-Relegation of roles PHASES SPONSORSHIP Planning by (interdisciplinary con- Philanthropy (or Government) : asortium) health care planning foundation.Demonstration-Innovation ---------- Government (Public health), other pub- lic and private health agencies.Implementation --------------------- Association of Practitioners in consul- tation with Health Care Planning In- stitute.

Continuing support ------------- Individual and large consumers: Self- paid and/or health insurance. Research and education-------------- Government (public health): Philan- thropy, schools. HI. THE PURPOSE It is proposed that the consortium approach to planning be implementedthrough a non-profit Community Health Planning Foundation, sponsored by philanthropy. There is much precedent for this. Historically, the most significant changes in medicine have been promoted by institutions outside the existing structure. Striking examples are the Flexner report of 1910-1911, supported by the Carnegie Foundation, and the sweeping innovations in education and re- search, influenced by that report as well as the Rockefeller Foundation. This is particularly necessary at this point in time, as it becomes increasingly obvious that the current policy makers seem unable or unwilling to take the initiative. Restrictions imposed on government public health units, force them, for the most part, into consultative and fiscal roles. The rigidity of the academic world and its poor motivation towards outright community service, have perpetuated its interest predominantly in scientific research and education. Organized medicine seems unable to overcome the inertia of \"tradition.\" Philanthropy seems to be the only vehicle flexible and financially strong enough to undertake this gigantic and much needed task. It is unimpeded by conflict of interests. It can attract the best minds in the country-those with broad scoped knowledge, experience, and creativity whose feet are on the ground, but not in cement. III. THE FOUNDATION AT WORK The Foundation will have a three pronged approach-service, research, andeducation-all very closely interrelated.

Closely related to all institutions-Communi ty (\"cottage\") Hos-pitals; extended and domiciliary care facilities and programs; MedicalCenter; and education and research. The principle is that of r'enderingfrequently used services locally and less frequently used, more highlyspecialized and technologic services, through centers-treating the \"rightpatient in the right place at the right time\" with free and prompttransfer. Alternative, improved health care delivery models-regionally adapted-willcomprise the laboratory for all components. The model ito Fbe demonstrated first isa Biomedical Complex, centering around the Health Core Facility Concept. Itis described briefly in the Appendix and its accompanying Figures. This modelhas been chosen because it seems to have a significant measure of universality andreplicability. It permits demonstration, research, and education in the frameworkof service where they rightfully belong if we are to avoid a continued wideninggap between them. Each Health Core Facility will serve about 100,000 people,which is numerically very significant.Figure II indicates the proposed areas of major concern to be addressed. Thefactor of sheer numbers-the population explosion-demands a systems engineer-ing approach. The highly successful attack against man's formerly predominantenemy-the world of microbes-has shifted emphasis to the physical and chemicalworld around him-the atmosphere of pollution, crowding, noise and competitionfor status and recognition. There is a great need to apply the same type of scientific excellence, so suc-cessful against infective and communicable disease, to a study of the edidemiologyof our current major offenders-degenerative, metabolic, neoplastic andemotional disruptions. A wider laboratory must be created-one involving the greater mass of ourpeople and the more common pathology-if we are to effectively study, combatand prevent the more frequently occurring diseases rather than just the rare andthe exotic. Medical Care is only one factor in the broad gamut involved in Com-prehensive and Total Health Care. It can, however, lend itself very well as anopening wedge to all the others.Centralized computer analysis, data storage and retrieval, and optimum use oflaboratory procedures, may well eventually provide us with information permit-ting determination of priorities for professional time as well as guidelines forprediction of disease-valuable tools towards circumvention of manpowershortages and true prevention and prompt restoration to function.730 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS The close interrelationship of the component parts of the Biomedical Com- plex, permits analysis of the patient from diagnosis to therapy. One of the areas to be explored can include the assembly of consultant expertise in the various medical specialities and sub-specialties, towards the goal of determining the minimal requirements from diagnosis -to therapy relative to the more com- mon illnesses (at least 85%). This will serve to insure optimum prevention, treatment and quality of care. It will also be a valuable instrument in deter- mining \"reasonable costs\" for those illnesses, and can be used as guidelines for reimbursement through prepaid government and other health insurance programs. Another area of interest will be the creation of a branching type question- naire, permitting complete data gathering simulating physician history taking. This can then be done either by non-professional, personnel or by automated devices-freeing the physician's time considerably, simultaneously permitting a better and more sensible allocation of labor resources. The Biomedical Complex can become a very valuable field laboratory for edu- cation at all levels, and for creation of new careers designed towards use of non-professionals to perform those parts of the daily tasks now done repeatedly by professionals-not requiring their skills. This is also a very important means of improved allocation of manpower resources. Other projects will undoubtedly be undertaken as the need for them becomes apparent. The table of Organization for the Foundation will be decided upon as soon as possible. It should be kept in mind however, that since Medical Care is only a part of the entire gamut of Total Health Care Services, the medical sector should not predominate. Indeed, since the main emphasis will be on improved allocation of resources and the effect of man's genetic and physical environment on his total wellbeing, the non-medical expertise sector must play a very- prominent role, at least equal to that of the medical sector. Continued education of the staff on an inter and intra-departmental basis is essential. A Board of Directors will assist the staff in policy making and program plan- ning. Their participation must be meaningful and not merely tokenism. Publications of findings will be as frequent as feasible in order to disseminate information as well as to promote the institution of similar programs by others. The Foundation will be non-profit. However, within these limits, it can still apply for grant awards, and can charge consultation fees whenever feasible. IV. RELATIONSHIP OF PROGRAMS TO EXISTING SERVICES AND INSTITUTIONS Every attempt should be made to prevent duplication. Services will be added only when those existing in the community are inadequate or inefficient. Every effort will be directed towards meaningful affiliation with existing facilities and programs. It is proposed that the Foundation be free standing, in order to circumvent the rigidity which is too often associated with the academic world. Preferably, the relationship with professional schools and other institutions, will be through affiliation of its staff, rather than of the Foundation. V. ADVANTAGES There is little doubt that well organized, broad scoped planning of this type, will be of great benefit to both consumers and providers of services. The general public will benefit through improved, quality oriented services. Large consumers such as labor-management, industry, and Government, will benefit greatly through improved quality and lowered costs. The Foundation can serve as a valuable resource to these large consumer groups, as well as to indigent groups in deprived areas, and others such as Geriatric Residence plans, who are con- stantly in need of consultation for health care planning and who currently have no one to turn to. As usual, there may well be some who will feel economically threatened. How- ever, these should be very few, since the proposed plan preserves the concepts of \"one patient/one doctor,\" and free enterprise. Preliminary discussions indi- cate acceptance and approval of the medical sector, including professional schools, private practitioners, organized medicine and labor-management. The planned approach is not disruptive. It carries with it the better components of the past, is pertinent to the present, and has meaning for the future.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 731 VI.

There should be carefuldocumentation of the process as well as content of the data related to service,education and research. VII. FUNDING A sizable basic permanent fund will have to be maintained if we are to attractthe best people. Additional funds will come from consultation fees and grantawards. The Foundation will maintain a non-profit status throughout, but willserve profit as well as non-profit groups. Some thought should be given to starting with \"seeding\" on planning fundsrequired to complete Phase I, in order to establish a larger and more permanentbudget. VIII. CONCLUSION As far as we know, there is no precedent for a Health Care Planning Founda-tion such as we envision. If such an institute were formed, it could set a precedentfor establishing innovative health care delivery models and new associativeand assistive health careers, designed towards improved quality and loweredcosts of care, through circumvention of the duplication, fragmentation, short-ages, and inequities which currently exist. In reality, it might well precipitatea much needed clinical revolution, counterpart of the scientific revolution pro-moted by the Flexner report of 1910-1911. As justification, we need only remember that we are at least fifty years behindin our health care dejivery system, as pointed out by the renowned Dr. WilliamWelch in 1926, when he bemoaned the widening gap between scientific advancesand their clinical application. There has really been no major change since Dr.Flexner's monumental work in 1911. His expectations that quality care wouldbe a natural concommitant of scientific and educational excellence, have not beenfulfilled. It is hoped that philanthropy will again supply the resources and become theunifying force towards implementation of a scientific and systematic approachto the rapidly deteriorating Health Care of our Nation, and thus preserve itsheritage for excellence and humanism. ExHIIBIT B. A UNIFIED HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM [Excerpted from address by, Dr. Giorgi to the Southern California Hospital Council] IX. APPENDIX A true challenge, to an effective, acceptable Health Care Delivery Model is topreserve the very important concept of \"one patient-one doctor\", simultaneouslypermitting comprehensiveness and quality care at reasonable cost. For successfulcare, there must be a personal \"managing\" physician who sees the patient732 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS through each door. No matter how many consultants he uses-no matter how many ancillary and paramedical services he orders, the ultimate responsibility, continuity, and final decision rest with him. His services can be greatly augmented by collaboration with a multidiscipline coordinating and expediting team, freeing him for that part of his work which requires his more highly specialized skills. MEDICAL COSTS Contrary to popular notion, those \"bad\" doctors are responsible for only about one-quarter of the total costs. This, in spite of the fact that their services are. the most frequently used by far. I do not intend this as a defense of physicians. Certainly, all costs, including doctors' fees need to be evaluated. However, it is far better that costs for so highly personalized services be improved by means of better use of professional time as wvell as by reduction of overhead resulting from sub-optimal use and duplication of personnel and equipment in each physician's office. It is also obvious that, if reduction in costs is to ibe significant, it must be concentrated around the larger segment of that cost, the remaining 75%. Here, too, duplication and sub-optimal use are very significant factors-but here, they lend themselves much more readily to pooling and the concurrent savings resulting therefrom. Hospital costs are the most astronomical of all (over 30%) and are becoming increasingly worse. The unexplained wide cost variations in hospitals of the same category certainly 'bear scrutiny. According to a report of the President's National Advisory Commission on Health Manpower-these differences are as high as .100%. There is also a need to more clearly define the role of all insti- tutions-the community hospital, the medical center, and the extended care facility. Not every hospital should be doing everything. The more frequently required, more common services should be community based and should be rendered through the 'smaller community hospitals, referred to under the Swedish system as the cottage hospital. The less frequently used services requiring high order skills, and highly specialized personnel and equipment should be avail- able through the medical centers which should serve the megalopolis rather than just the smaller community. Chronic care should be delegated to extended care facilities and special out-of-institution programs. Too often all three are combined in one institution contributing to duplication and under utilization. Most important of all, the best way to reduce institutional costs is to keep people out of them. Ambulatory care, diagnostic and special treatment centers would help immeasurably towards this end as would also health insurance plans permitting reimbursement for such services. It is common knowledge that high on the list of causes of hospital abuse are the doctors' use of the institution as his workshop and the senseless insurance allowances for in-hos- pital diagnostic services disallowed on an out-of-hospital basis. The basic idea is that of pooling and centralization of the expensive and less frequently used services for economy and availability, and decentralization of the less expensive and more frequently used services for accessibility and personalization. This can be effected by relating the physician to a single access ambulatory care diagnostic and special treatment center which makes available to his patient all the services contained in the hospital, exclusive of the sick bed or in-hospital observation, through the writing of a simple order just as he does in the hospital. Such a center can also supply other services including managerial, administrative, secretarial, and referral. Direct patient care serv- ices will be coordinated and mediated through the Health Care Team which will also be responsible for utilization review and quality surveillance. A dy- namic health education program aimed at improved health practices as well as optimum and proper utilization of services will undoubtedly affect quality of care as well as reduce costs. This type of system avoids the pitfalls of large group practice which too often becomes depersonalized as the patient identifies with a clinic rather than a doctor. It combines the best features of solo and group practice. The mainstream con- cept must also be maintained. The recently conceived \"neighborhood clinics\" for the poor tend to perpetuate the concept of \"separate but equal\". This too should be avoided. FAMILY HEALTH AGENTS A very important part of the team will be the family health agents-a new health career, a medical ombudsman. These agents are properly trained and educated, peer related groups who will act as informed advocates of the family unit. They constitute an activist group who also serve as expediters of services.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 733 It is conceded by most medical care experts that about 85% of people present-ing at a physician's office are not biologically ill but are troubled. This is a verysignificant group, constituting a great drain on all services and economy. Of this85%, it is estimated that about 150% need true psychiatric care. The remaining70%,o often just need someone to talk to. The family health agent can provide thetype of informed advocacy required to help them.In reality, they take over many of the functions previously performed by theold family doctor whose great bid to fame was that he took time to listen andknew the whole family. The plain fact is that he knew that family because helived in the neighborhood and he had time to listen because health care was farless complex. I do not agree with those who advocate his return. The cost wouldbe too great. It would involve the tremendous loss involved in depriving patientsof the great value of specialization. Listening and understanding family problemscan very effectively be undertaken by peer related non-professionals who areoften more trusted by patients. These agents will keep the professional informedof family problems he might otherwise never be aware of. HEALTH CARE TEAM Referrals to community hospitals, chronic care units, special programs, medi-cal centers, and public and private agencies can be coordinated through the HealthCare Team. Mobile Health Core Facility Units for sparsely populated areas arealso very feasible. Education, training and research can also be conducted butcare must be taken to exclude these costs from patient care costs. Teaching inthe community hospital should be confined to personnel in final stages of trainingwho will act as paid apprentices, thus increasing available manpower as well asproviding improved emergency care.The Health Care Team and Family Agent Concepts are innovative and theireffectiveness in circumventing manpower shortages, abuse of facilities and equip-ment, and improving quality of care should be demonstrated at first throughgovernment grant awards.There must be free transfer between all components of the system which inreality becomes a BIOMEDICAL COMPLEX. This is a functionally unifiedcomplex and not necessarily geographically unified.It is very realistic to expect that such a system will permit the physician tosupervise the care of more than twice as many patients as he does under thepresent systems, thus not only circumventing shortages but also lowering costs.Pooling of services, optimum utilization of all components, coordination, andteam quality surveillance should improve quality and lower costs. Thus it mightbe possible to continue the fee for service concept and still maintain reasonablecosts. Certainly, this plan is the more popular with providers of serivees andeven to the recipients who often object to prepayment for services they maynever use. The fee for service plan has undoubted value in the form of incentivesto the provider and circumvention of abuse by the recipient. An all inclusiveprepaid plan can produce a situation whereby the well finance the frequentlyand chronically ill which is certainly undesirable. Another possibility is physi-cian fee for service with prepayment for all other services. Whatever plan isadopted, effective safeguards over quantity and quality of care are exertedthrough the Health Care Team. Also, if associations of physicians have a vestedinterest in the Health Core Facility, it is obvious they will protect its optimumutilization and operation. PATIENT PREFERENCES There is a great need to study patient preferences. This has never been doneto my knowledge. We never seek their perspectives-which is a bad mistake.We always assume that what we think is good for them is what they want.I wonder if prepayment is such a good idea in a country such as ours, where apay-as-you-go policy-free enterprise-is so cherished. I wonder too, if stressingthe need for prepayment-in case illness strikes-does not in reality orient ourpeople towards illness rather than health. Too often, I have seen patients viewtheir health insurance as a precious passport to the hospital. Is it then healthinsurance or sick insurance?Perhaps a combination, providing prepayment for catastrophic and frequentor prolonged illness with reasonable exemption for family per year is moredesirable. The type of payment is far from decided. There are so many individualpreferences that flexibility is certainly necessary. 24-T7s-69-pt. 3-9734 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS The real challenge is to insure availability of quality oriented care to all, no matter which reimbursement system is applied. Decreased cost, effected through pooling, coordination and optimum use of facilities, equipment and manpower. could just as readily be applied to the fee for service plan as it could to prepaid plans. This would have the added incentive of circumventing abuse by both con- sumers and providers, as well as insuring that consumers will for the most part, pay only for services rendered to them. Prepayment could then be applied only to long-term and catastrophic illness. This would adequately protect families from such events, and could be secured at a more reasonable rate. Such a system would very likely be more acceptable to all involved than is the present multi- faceted and complicated health insurance and other prepaid plan systems, which too often succeed only in subsidizing the medical industry, the insurance omni- panies and the prepaid groups, causing further inflation of health care costs.

To: California Council for Health Plan Alternatives: members of the Council and Advisory Committee Members; California Labor Federation: Thomas Pitts, Mike Peevey; Central Labor Councils, Metropolitan Areas: Other union officials and health care specialists concerned about the MediCal Program. From: Bruce Poyer, member, Health Review and Program Council. Re: September 25th meeting of the Council. (Note: Copies of this report are being sent to California Health Welfare Department officials, other HRPC members. CMlNA officials, and administrators of major negotiated health programs in California. Comments or suggestions (or criticisms) on any matter raised herein will be appreciated.) The key agenda item for September 25, which was on the advance agenda. was: \"Presentation of California Blue Shield method of determining reasonable charges for physicians' services on the basis of profiles.\" Spokesmen for CBS, the fiscal intermediary, gave a thorough and detailed explanation of the entire, complex, profile business, and described their procedures in processing MediCal claims, in keeping track of physicians' fees, and in reviewing questionable costs and practices. The agenda item which was not described in advance, and which related only indirectly to the CBS appearance, was the California Medical Association's re- quest, appearance, and argument for higher fees to be paid to doctors for services performed under MediCal. In contrast to the detailed procedural description presented by CBS, the CMA spokesmen gave no data and developed no economic rationale to support their argument for higher fees. They relied primarily on the simple threat that continuation of present limits on fees would soon cause California physicians to be unwilling to participate in the MediCal program. The present formula sets maximum physician fees at the 60th percentile of the level of physicians' charges in effect January 1, 1967. Physicians' charges are de- termined by procedures, as defined in the CMA Relative Value Studies, and by different areas of the state. Price control \"at the 60th percentile\" means that at a particular price for a particular procedure in a particular area, over 6S0% of all claims for that procedure in that area are at or below that price. The present maximum fees under MediCal are presumably set at the 60th percentile of prices charged January 1, 1967.' *See Statement, p. 697. 'There is some question about where the maximum fees are actually set. The f ollowing is from the legislative analysts report on Governor Reagan's budget request of last Noveil- ber, with particular reference to the appropriation requested for physicians' fees under the MediCal program: \"It is difficult to understand the meaning of all of these assumed program limitations. We have never been able to obtain a clear explanation of the reported rollback of physicians fees to January 1, 1967, and the related application of the sixtieth percentile maximum fee. This Is because the actual administration of the fee system has been by contract with California Physicians' Service. We do not believe that in fact physicians fees are being approved at the level of those fees which were charged by Individual physicians at Janu- ary 1, 1967, and if this is the case. then all assumptions as to Increases in physicians charges should be reexamined to see how far physicians have in fact been able to increase fees since January 1, 1967, and what this means as to increases for the next few years.\"COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 735 The CMA proposal was to move this \"percentile control\" to the 90th percentileof current charges, rather than charges in effect January 1, 1967, and to redefinethe interpretation of the percentile control point. Under the redefinition, for aprocedure like an office visit or a tonsillectomy, the maximum fee MediCal wouldpay for a particular area would be (a) that fee which is at the 90th percentileof all claims under California Blue Shield plans in that area for that procedure(this is the \"area profile,\" as used previously) ; or (b) that fee which is at the90th percentile of all fees charged by all the doctors in that area for that pro-cedure (this is the \"individual physicians' fee profile,\" now to be introduced).Whichever fee is higher, (a) or (b), would prevail as the maximum fee thatcould be charged to a MediMal patient. In no case would the maximnum fee everbe below the 90th percentile on both profiles. In some cases, if the (a) profileestablished a price higher than the (b) profile, or vice versa, the actual controlpoint could fall as high as the 98th percentile on both profiles.2 In discussion of the CMA proposal, the following points were raised:(1) The State Department of Health and Welfare estimates the cost of therevision requested by CMA to be \"in the neighborhood\" of 5 to 7 million a year.This would be over and above the 5% increase in physicians' fees which was already budgeted in appropriations for this fiscal year. Questions raised at theSeptember 25 meeting established that the 5-7 million estimate is obviously 2In a paper describing the mechanics of its full service program, California Blue Shield has itself given the most concise explanation of the development of its \"profiles.\" \"From an 'area profile' of charges, with the 'top of the range' established by means of a conversion factor applicable to broad bands of service reflected in the Relative Value Studies, the evolution has been to 'procedure profiles by area.' The latter establishes a range of charges for each procedure (service). Thus, a charge is screened against a pro- cedure profile to establish that it is customary for that specific service in the geographic area. \"Now in its final state of development is the 'Individual Physician Charge History.' This is a refinement from an 'area profile by type of service' to an individual physician's usual charge history for a specific procedure (service). Thus. a charge is screened, first, against the physician's charge history to determine that it is his usual charge, then it is screened against the area range of charges to verify that it is within the customary range of charges for a similar service, and, therefore, considered 'reasonable.' In the same paper, CBS also gave a better illustration than it gave to the HRPC of how the two profiles would be put together in the determination of \"Top of the Range Example 1: Procedure 1234 Cumulative CumulativeNumber of percent of Number of percent of Physician's charge history physicians physicians 75.00 ---------------------------------------9 100. 0 34 100. 0 *Top of the Range. Example 2: Procedure 2345 Cumulative CumulativeNumber of percent of Number of percent of Physician's charge history physicians physicians claims claims $75.00 ------------------------------------18 10. 5 49 5. 6 $85.00 ------------ ----- -- 47 38. 0 193 27.5 $100.00- 71.9 257 56.6 $110.00- 3 100.0 12 'Top of the Range. In Example 1, at $45-90.2 percent of the claims were included. However, only 85.3 per cent of the physi- cians were included. Therefore, to establish the range to include at least 90 per cent of physicians, the next charge of $50 was selected as the top of the range. This represented the charges of 93.4 per cent of the physicians and 94.3 per cent of the claims.In Example 2, at $110-92.4 per cent of the physicians were included. However, only 86.5 per cent of the claims were included. Therefore, to establish the range of at least 90 per cent of the claims, the next charge of $120 was selected as the top of the range. This represented the charges of 98.2 per cent of the physicians and 9Q.0 per cent of the claims.736 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS very loose. No data was submitted to support the estimate, nor did it appear that any reliable data was available. The control point on physicians' fees was moved back from the 90th to the 60th percentile, in September, 1967. The Office of Health Care Services later (May, 1968, reestimates) determined that this reduced expenditures for physi- cians' services by 10 million in fiscal 1967-1968. and by a projected 12 million for fiscal 1968-1969. The financial impact of the proposed upwa-rd revision would be greater than the impact of the last downward revision, for two reasons: (a) there would no longer be a freeze on fees at their January 1, 1967 level, and fees are obviously much higher now; (b) the use of the individual profile system permits maximum fees beyond the old 90th percentile maximum level. (2) California Blue Shield the fiscal intermediary, indicates that complete \"top of the range\" fee data, by areas, using both the individual physicians' profiles and the area profiles, is available only from January 1, 1968. This means, in effect, that CBS either does not have, or will not disclose, any \"base data\" that can be used to determine what usual and customary fee charges were in the various areas, except data as of January 1, 1968. Nearly two years of inflationary impact of the MediCal and Medicare programs is therefore now to be built into the January 1, 1968 determination of \"top of the range\" (or 90th percentile plus). Probably, that will be the only data available as a bench mark for future determinations of how fast fee levels are rising. The intent of the MediCal law was and is that physicians' fee levels prevail- ing in various community areas were to determine what MediCal paid for similar services to recipients. However, the \"bench marks\" on what is happening to fees in the various areas are continually pushed forward in time-by the physicians-who are the fiscal intermediaries. Thus, what is being measured is usual and customary community practice, plus all of the inflationary impact of the MediCal and Medicare programs. In other words, in my opinion, the program is being used to advance the fee levels that are considered to be \"usual and customary,\" which in turn results in advancing the program's fee levels. It is a very nice situation for any pro- vider of service to be in, especially if the provider is also the fiscal intermediary, and is therefore in charge of all the data. (3) The representatives of the medical profession quoted data to indicate an over-all increase in the \"California Physican Fee Index\" of about 4% a year for the past five years or so. They did not bother to produce any of the data they quoted. Their figures are probably from the Socio Economic Report of the Bureau of Research and Planning of the OMA. The March 1968 issue of this report shows the O.MA physician fee index at 123.9, using June 1962 as base of 100.0. This would be a 4.34% increase per year over the 5\u00bd2 year period. However, the 512year period used in this computation includes only 1 year and 9 months under MediCal, and 3 years and 9 months when we did not have MediCal or Medicare. Use of this period spreads most of the inflationary impact of the government programs over a longer period of time prior to the advent of the programs. The same COMLA data, using December 1964 as base, shows a 14% increase in physicians' fees to December 1967, or 4.7% a year. This 3 year period is short to establish a trend, but it sets a base period 1 year and 3 months before the government programs started, and it covers 1 year and 9 months of their opera- tion. It thus provides more realistic barometer of what is happening now. U.S. Department of Labor data on physicians fees in San Francisco and Los Angeles (from the BLS Cost of Living determinations) was also quoted at the September 25th meeting. This data is regularly discredited by the CMA. as being statistically unreliable. However, in the 3 year period December 1964- December 1967, BLS shows virtually the same change in physicians' fees in Los Angeles and San Francisco, as that which is recorded in the CMA data. BLS shows a 4.9% increase per year over the 3 years. CMA shows a 4.7% change each year over the 3 year period. The basic similarity of BLS data describing the 3 year period is important not only because CMA discredits their data, but even more because BUIS shows an index of physicians' fees (for Los Angeles and San Francisco) for June, 1968. CMA is silent on that subject, at least in its public disclosures. BLS shows a remarkable jump of 11% in physicians' fees in Los Angeles and San Francisco in the six month period December 1967 to June 1968. That single jump is big enough to bring the annual rate of change in the BLS series up to 7.8% over the total 31/2 year period, December 1964 (base) to June, 1968. CMA data, or that which is released publically, does not yet cover this period Decem-COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 737 ber 1967 to June, 1965. CMIA representatives at the September 25 meeting re-fused to comment on the data reported by BLS, except to say they consider itstatistically unreliable, and prefer to use their own data. Clearly, whether sta-tistical reliability is involved or not, their own data is much better for theirpublic relations.3 (4) Of course, there is a great deal more data to indicate that physicians inCalifornia are not suffering too much from inadequate fees, and some of it wasalso quoted at the September 25 meeting. However, the data on fees and the finepoints about its interpretation obscures a more important question: why shoulda \"control point\" on maximum fees be set at the top of the usual and customaryrange (or at the 90th percentile or higher), rather than at some mid point in therange (such as the 60th percentile or lower)? The chief GMA spokesman wasasked to comment on the following quote which summarizes this whole issue(from the report of the Governor's Survey on Efficiency and Cost Control):\"Many of the physicians who charge the higher fees practice in geographicalareas where there are few Medi-Cal patients. Therefore, if some of the physi-cians, by reason of fees charged, find the program unacceptable and discontinuetheir services, it would not result in any major loss to the program.. Further,the processing costs being incurred in handling claims with fees above thenormal range do not appear to be justifiable.\" The CMA spokesman commented only that all doctors should participate, andthat fee limits should not be set so that some doctors are \"cut out of theprogram.\" There was no information from the Department of Health Care Servicesas to whether all of MediCal's needs for physicians could be met with maximumfees set at any particular percentile level. Presumably, the program has beengetting all the physicians services required with the control point at the60th percentile. According to OMA, the physicians with higher prices areperforming the necessary services, billing at the higher levels, and then com-plaining when their claims are reduced by MediCal to the maximum levels whichexisted under the 60th percentile control. The doctors, of course, have completefreedom to refer the Medi-Cal patient (or have the administration refer him)to any physician who would accept the existing maximum. Therefore the rele-vant question really is: are there enough physicians charging the lower feesto meet all MediCal needs? I have no data to suggest an answer. CBS and CMIA may have such data, butif so, they probably prefer not to discuss it. It does not appear to me that theAdministration is even interested in raising the basic questions, let alone demanding the data to answer them. They appear to respond only to the threatthat the doctors \"may not choose to participate\" in the program if fees are notadjusted upward, and they appear unwilling to ask: how many would notparticipate? at what control points? where do they practice? how many Medi- Cal patients do they have? what are they charging? would their nonparticipation be a major loss to the program? or a net gain to the program? 3 The statistical reliability question Is not actually an argument. C'MA priees morephysicians' procedures than BLS, although the BLS sample of procedures is a good one.All of CMA's pricing is done in California. while BLS prices in San Francisco and LosAngeles and in 54 other cities in the U.S. BLS does not publish separate physicians' feeindexes by separate cities, since its pricing procedure is designed to produce a nationalindex. However. the data for San Francisco and Los Angeles is available on request.The BLS pricing procedure relies primarily on trained field representatives who gatherdata In personal interviews (giving more statistical reliability). It is my understandingthat the CiTA procedure relies primarily on mail questionnaires (which have considerablyless statistical reliability).The medical care component in the BLS's Consumer Price Index (of which physician'sfees are a part) was previously criticized for failing to measure quality improvementsadequately. To correct this, a linking procedure was developed and Is now used to factorout price increases based on a new or different quality. The linking procedure is nowcriticized as a factor tending to understate the actual amount of medical care priceincreases measured by the BLS.Research on BLS pricing of medical care components (primarily by Anne Scitovsky)has also established that pricing individual items and services results in a lowver indexthan pricing the total illness. The \"total illness\" approach takes account of a numberof factors not considered by either CMA or BLS. including the introduction of morecomplicated and costly types of treatment. (See Social Security Bulletin, July 1967, p. 15,for appropriate citations.)The fine points about statistical procedure should not obscure the fact that CMfA andBLS data show virtually the same price changes for the period December 1964 throughDecember 1967. which is the only period that can be used for comparison. On the basisof this similarity. there is every reason to believe that the CMA index for June 1968,when It becomes publically available, will show an increase of much the same magnitudeas that already shown by the BLS In its physician fee indexes for San Francisco andLos Angeles-an Incredible 11% Increase in fees In the six month period.738 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS CONCLUSION 1. The HRPC recommended to the Health and Welfare Department that the January 1, 1967 freeze should be lifted, that the percentile control point should be moved from the 60th to the 90th, and that the individual physicians' fee history should be added as a criterion in the definition of the 90th percentile. The HRPC recommended moving right now to this new definition, but also rec- ommended placing a 5% limit on the amount of fee increases that would occur under the new definition in each of the two years folloying its adoption. In this recommendation, the 5% is not a limit on the amount of fee increase that will occur immediately if the new definition is adopted. (I was the only non-govern- mental consumer or public representative present, and mine was the only dis- senting vote. It should be noted that the Council did not have an adequate ex- planation of what its vote meant. It should also be noted that HRPC recom- mends only, and the Administration is not obliged to follow its recommendations.) 2. It is still impossible to tell how big an increase in physicians' fees would result if this recommendation is carried out. There was no indication of how many claims have been denied because they were higher than the 60th percentile of charges in effect January 1, 1967. The CMIA argued that \"a majority of all claims\"' now comes in higher than the control point allows, but they don't back up this assertion with any data whatever. If it is true, there obviouslywould be a big jump in fees immediately. And it will obviously be bigger than the 10-12 million a year previously estimated on the basis of last year's reduc-tion in maximum fees permitted. On the other hand, there is no way of knowing whether the January 1, 1967 \"freeze\" in fee levels was ever actually enforced (see footnote 1, which casts some doubt). If it was not enforced. then a good bit of what the doctors asked for is already being paid to them, and the recommendation of the HRPC wouldsimply legitimize present practice. In that case, there would not be such a big jump immediately. The Department of Health Care Services itself had no meaningful analysis of the impact of the increase, either in gross cost terms or on the question of theavailablity of program services at different levels of controlled prices. Fur-ther, there was no analysis of what services might not be available to recipients as a result of a considerable increase in the amount of resources now to be allo- cated to physiicans for their particular services. (This is not surprising any more-the recipients and their health care problems always seem to be left out ofHRPC deliberations.) My guess is that the increase will be sizable. but the only thing I have to basethis on is the hard push the CMIA is apparently making to get the increase estab-lished. Their attitude at the September 2.5 meeting seemed to be that their pro- gram was going through regardless of the fact that relevant data was not supplied to support it. and rezardless of what arguments might be made in the HRPC. In short, it has all the earmarks of the old steam roller. The best guess is that it will cost plenty, and that MediCal has only begun to pay the increase. a. Whatever amounts are involved in additional MediCal expenditures forphysicians' fees, it is obvious that there will be an immediate impact on all other physicians fees under all other programs. Administrators of m-jor negotiatedplans should advise collective bargaining representatives accordingly. The law is written so that MediCal should pay on the basis of usual and customary feeexperience outside the MediCal program. But if the HRPC recommendation Is carried. collective bargaining representatives can expect to negotiate in- creased fees for the doctors on the basis of immediae repercussions from the MT~edflal program-or face the unnalatable alternative of cutting back the benefit levels of their negotiated programs. It would be extremely useful if organized labor, as the largest consumerrepresentative in the state. could supply orranized. consitent. and comproben- sive data on the coverage. costs, and utilization of their programs, to throwlight on the many obscurities of the MediCal program. I believe that if anyonebut the doctors' own oranization now handled the responsibility of fiscal inter- mediary for the MediCal program (including the state of California), therewould be much more data available on sensitive questions like Ooetors' foes,and there would be much less possibility of conflict of interest in the gathering,handlinu. reporting. and analyzing of all health care data involved in the Medi- Cal program.Is it possible. even at this late date. to introduce some coordination in thekinds of data handling procedures used in the administration of organizedCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER ANERICANS 739 labor's negotiated programs? There certainly appears to be good and sufficient reason now for some of organized labor's top policy people to start meeting with some of the administrators of the important plans to see what can be done. 4. There will be many further problems with the addition of the \"individual physician fee profile\" as a criterion in the determination of the percentile control point. The problems will continue whether a final control point is located at the i0top of the range\" (or at the 90th percentile plus), or somewhere around the middle of the range, or even at the bottom of the range. It is my understanding that to date Blue Shield has been using its own pro- grains to represent the \"usual and customary\" universe. Their programs un- doubtedly constitute a very broad sample-perhaps the broadest that could be found in California. But if the reliance is on Blue Shield programs alone to establish what is usual and customary, then a vast amount of other. non-Blue Shield \"usual and customary\" experience is left out of the calculation. Have labor's negotiated programs ever been asked to give CBS or the state any in- formation on their physician charge profiles? Probably not, and the whole main- stream of medical practice under negotiated health care programs has probably been left out of the determination, to date, of what usual and customary ac- tually is. Presumably, the use of an individual physician fee profile as a criterion in determining the maximum fee level for MediCal claims, will bring into consi- deration that \"other, non-Blue Shield\" experience. It will also bring into consi- deration a host of new problems in gathering and interpreting data on physician's fees. To mention only one such problem, the fiscal intermediary will have to keep track of the entire range of each individual physician's fees for each procedure, as charged to all kinds of different, non-govermental, group and individual purchasers. Presumably, this information will be gathered from all physicians who participate in the MediCal program by mail questionnaire. Of course. the respondents will know, when they get the questionnaire, that their answers are going into the determination of the price MediCal will pay for similar services rendered to recipients. What kind of ojectivity, either in the gathering or in the interpretation of the fee data, will be possible in this situation? At every turn, the MediCal program is still confronted with the need for ob- jective data and information, which is still not being supplied to the program. At every turn, the program is still getting answers to its problems which are primarily in terms of the special interests of the providers of services. ITEM 5: EXHIBIT RELATED TO STATEMENT OF MR.

EXCERPTS FROM ASSOCIATION TESTIMONY BEFORE SENATE FINANCE COM-MITTEE ON H.R. 120S0-1967 AMENDMENTS TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT STATEMENT OF DAVID R. MOSHER, REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT, AMERICAN NURSING HOME ASSOCIATION Mr. Chairman and Members of this committee, my name is David R. Mosher and I appear on behalf of the American Nursing Home Association. I am a nursing home administrator and the owner of two nursing homes certified as Extended Care Facilities in St. Petersburg, Florida. Nursing homes are playing a major role in the operation of both the Title XVIII (Medicare) and Title XIX (Medicaid) programs. The role of the nursing home in both of these programs. we are convinced, will be expanded to even greater limits in the months and years ahead. I say this because nursing homes, whether certified as Extended Care Facili- ties under Medicare, or operating as skilled nursing homes under Title XIX, provide a tremendous cost-saving service for government. Those certified as ECFs are, saving the Social Security Administration, the Federal Treasury and ultimately the American taxpayer, tens of millions of dollars. 'See statement, p. 703.740 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS We do not know if some of these Rules and Regulations issued as StateAgency Letters and Letters to Fiscal Intermediaries without regard to theFederal Administration Procedures Act and without publication of them in theFederal Register were first presented to Health Insurance Benefits Advisory Council, for we are not privy to the minutes of HIBAC. On the other hand, we do know, that many of them have been issued without prior consultation withnational organizations as provided for under the Social Security Amendments of 1965 (P.L. 89-97). Let me cite a few examples: Spell of illness Directing your attention to the definition of a \"spell of illness\" presently proposed by HEW in State Agency Letter No. 65. This letter will affect stateTitle XIX programs by increasing the costs thereto both to the individual statesand to the Federal Government while working a hardship upon the patient. In Section 1861(a), \"spell of illness\" is defined as commencing with the firstday a patient enters a hospital, uses his hospital and extended care benefits, andending 60 consecutive days thereafter on which he is neither an inpatient in ahospital or an extended care facility. EXTENDED CARE FACILITY An \"extended care facility\" for the purposes of \"spell of illness\" is defined inSection 1861(j) (10) as a facility \"which is primarily engaged in providing to inpatients (a) skilled nursing care and related services for patients whorequire medical or nursing care or (b) rehabilitation services for the rehabilita-tion of injured, disabled or sick persons.\" Congress specifically defined an \"extended care facility\" for the purposes of \"spell of illness.\" Now Social Security Administration has radically altered Congress' definition. The Social Security Administration defines \"extended care facility\" so as toprolong a \"spell of illness\" as a facility which is in charge of a licensed prac- tical nurse (who need not be a graduate of a state approved school) withaides, orderlies or attendants on the other two shifts. Such a facility fails inthe essential element that it 'be primarily engaged in skilled nursing care and services for patients who require medical or nursing care. State Agency Letter No. 65 adds a great deal of confusion to the health care field. More important, however, are the results which follow. This definition denies our aged peoplemedical benefits Congress intended them to have. THREE EXAMPLES Let's take 3 examples. Patient A who is 75 years of age and living in a custo- dial home. He can get around, but he needs someone to be certain to see that heeats his meals and takes his medicine. Patient A has a severe heart attack. He goes to the hospital for 90 days. He is then transferred to an \"Extended CareFacility\" for 100 day's. He then goes back to the custodial home where he haslived for the past two years. He can never again become eligible for Medicare benefits under Letter No. 65 because there is S hours a day of \"nursing service\"available. Two years later he falls and breaks his leg. Under Letter No. 65. he can obtainno medicare benefits because this residential care home is defined as an ECF or skilled nursing home because it has an LPN as a charge nurse. The travesty lies in the fact that this residential rare home is considered by SSA to be an ECF solely for the purpose of not breaking this \"spell of illness.\" SSA would nevercertify this residential care home as an ECF or as a skilled nursing home forparticipation in Title XVIII or Title XIX programs. In those instances. SSA would judge this residential care home to be below the standards requiredof a facility for it to be certified as an ECF or a skilled nursing home. Patient B is 68 and 'lives in his own home. He is not well but is able to takecare of himself. He has a serious heart attack. He is in the hospital for 90 days. He goes to an \"extended care facility\" where he remains for 100 days. There-after he is transferred to a nursing home where he remains for 60 days. He then goes home and 10 days thereafter he falls and breaks his leg. He is noteligible for Medicare. Patient C is 70 years of age. He has a serious heart attack. He goes to ahospital for 90 days and is then transferred to an \"extended care facility\" for 100 days. He then goes home and during the next 60 days he exhausts his 100COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 741 home health care visits under Part A. On his 61st day he falls and breaks hisleg. He is eligible for Medicare benefits.Patient C is eligible for Medicare because he had such resources that afterbeing discharged from an extended care facility, he could be taken to his ownhome. He could receive 100 home health care visits and his new \"spell of ill-ness\" would start 60 days from the date that he was discharged from the ECF.In other words, an individual is not required to have a 60 days \"spell of health.\"State Agency Letter No. 65 makes one's Medicare benefits turn on his stationin life or on the circumstances under which he is living at the time that heenters the hospital. The individual who needs Medicare benefits the most is deniedthem. In each of these three instances we have a new illness but because of thetechnical misinterpretation placed on the word \"extended care facility\" bySSA two of these elderly people have what amounts to a cancellable healthinsurance policy where it seems certain that Congress did not intend such acatastrophe to happen. Our objections to Letter 65 are threefold. First, it nullifies the definitions ofCongress and causes undue hardships to those who need medical care most.Second, it defines a \"facility primarily engaged in skilled nursing care\" as onethat is not rendering skilled nursing care. We have fought for over 10 years toraise standards of professional care which SSA now downgrades. Third, itmakes \"spell of illness\" turn in part on one's station in life. We thought Medi-care did away with any kind of a means test.\"Spell of illness\" should be defined in terms of a new medical illness. Accord-ingly, we suggest that Section 1861 (a) (2) on \"spell of illness\" be amendedto read as follows (amendment is italic):\"(2) ending with the close of the first period of 60 consecutive days there-after on each of which he is neither an inpatient of a hospital nor an in-patient of an extended care facility, under Title XVIII for the same medicalillness.\"APPENDIX 2 LETTERS AND STATEMENTS FROM INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS ITEM 1: STATEMENT FROM MARK BERKE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AND DR. I{ARRY WEINSTEIN, DIRECTOR OF MEDICAL EDUCATION; MOUNT ZION HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL CENTER ExHIBIT A. STATEMENT OF THE U.S. SENATE SPECIAL COmMITTEE ON AGIN\\G The practices which have the- greatest potential for reducing the cost ofmedical care also have the greatest potential -for improving the quality of care.The cost reduction can be achieved by utilizing the least costly facility orservice appropriate to the patient's need (and by preventing illness or theadvance of illness or by providing --restorative services which enable thepatient to be served by a less costly facility).The improvement in quality of care stems from developing the full con-stellation of facilities necessary to supply appropriate care* at lower cost.The over-utilization of high cost facilities such as the acute hospital repre-sents not only wasted dollars but poor care because of the inappropriatenessof the facility for the patient's need.Efforts to reduce the number of individuals in need of expensive serviceshave, been advocated by many and we do not wish to be trite by joining sanc-timoniously in such advocacy. Nevertheless, there is no broad-based, con-sistent, effective program of prevention and early diagnosis for [the aged inthis country and such programs must be established to serve the ends of lowercost and higher quality. Facilities which must be available in addition to the acute hospital include:Intensive Rehabilitation Unit.Extended Care Facility. Long Term Care Facility: Nursing Homes. Homes for Aged.. Coordinated Home Care. Individual Home Services: i.e., Nurse, Physical Therapist, Medical Doctor,etc. Day Centers: Outpatient Department. Private Office. Substitute Homes.Multi-disciplined patient care planning teams must be involved early afterhospital admission in order to shorten hospital stays and choose the appropriatealternative to hospitalization. Such teams can also participate in planning whichprevents hospitalization. The greater the success we have in using appropriate alternatives to hospital-ization, the more the cost of care per patient day in the acute hospital must go up,since only the sickest patients requiring the most service and use of the mostelaborate \"hardware\" will be served in such institutions.Ultimately, then, we must arrive at a true assessment of health costs in termsof total community expenditure per 1,000 persons over age 65. Of the two costsinvolved, the one expressed by the per diem rate in the hospital must go up. Ouronly hope there is to stabilize the rise, i.e. to diminish the speed of rise. The othercost expressed as communal cost can go down by coordinated community effort.The community can make certain that its dollars are effectively spent and that itgets more for its money through avoidance of unnecessary duplication and ofover-utilization of expensive services and facilities. 743744 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS ADDITIONAL COMMENTS 1. Medicaid should switch to reimbursement on a cost basis because the current negotiated basis is leading to provision of inadequate levels of care. 2. Incentives to reduction in cost are difficult to devise because we have not found ways of measuring our product. 3. The intermittent services of a homemaker or home health aide for as little as 8-12 hours per week may keep an older person out of a hospital or a long-term care facility. Therefore, in establishing the criteria for eligibility for such \"covered\" services, the term \"custodial\" should be discarded. Eligibility should be based upon the existence of an active medical care program for the aged person. In all instances, such services should be provided if, in the opinion of a competent professional, they will enable the person to avoid institutionalization and remain with safety at home. 4. The great success enjoyed In upgrading the quality of care in acute hospitals through the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals should be extended to Long Term Care Facilities including Homes for the Aged. Licensure is not enough. 5. The barriers to the establishment of meaningful relationships between proprietary and non-profit institutions are almost insurmountable. After several years of trying, we have not been able to establish any relationship beyond a relatively unimportant transfer agreement. Great support should, therefore, be given hospitals for the development of their own geographically proximate Extended Care and Long Term Care Facilities. ITEM 2: LETTER FROM PHILIP E. BROWN, CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR, CALIFORNIA CHIROPRACTIC ASSOCIATION HEALTH SERVICE FOUN- DATIONOCTOBER 17, 1968. DEAR SENATOR WILLIAMS: In compliance with your request, we are submitting pertinent information which we believe has a direct bearing upon the purpose of the investigation of the United States Senate Special Committee On Aging of which you are a member. Unfortunately, we were not given any time on your program to present facts relating to costs for the care of the elderly when ad- ministered by doctors of chiropractic. In depth statistics compiled by Dr. H. G. Higley, who iq head of the Department of Research and Statistics for the American Chiropractic Association reveal some interesting facts. Dr. Higley is a qualified statistician and his conclusions can be buttressed by data which he has compiled. The most pertinent information. which we feel would have a direct bearing upon your search for lower costs in health care of the aged comes directly from the statistics compiled during a two year period (July, 1962-June, 1964) of treatment of patients under the Public Assistance Medical Care Program in California.

Please keep in mind that the bulk of the conditions being treated were musculo-skeletal problems, which are treated by all the hearing professions. Consequently, the difference in cost as noted above, would be predicated primarily on a difference in approach to therapy.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 745 The California Chiropractic Association has been dedicated for many years to providing the highest quality health care to the public, while at the same time curbing spiraling costs. Toward that end, we have instituted educational sym- posia and local review committees which have been most effective and beneficial to the public and profession alike. We would welcome an opportunity to appear before your august body, or to submit further information if it should be desired. Very truly yours, PHILIP E. BROWN, D. C., Chief Administrator, CCA-HSF. ITEM 3: LETTER AND STATEMENT FROM JOSEPH W. EHRENEICH, DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS November 11, 1968. * * * * * * * DEAR SENATOR WILLIAMS: A point which is major, in my opinion, but which does not emerge clearly is that the health care problems of the elderly are but a reflection of a bigger underlying problem. This is the fact that our health care system is so structured that its prices must continue to rise inordinately, while its amenities continue to decrease. Physicians are in a position to set their fees almost by whim; as a group, because of increasing demand for their services and a small increase in the supply of physicians, they enjoy a protected monopolistic position. This is enhanced each year by the relatively small number of annual graduates from medical schools. There are now fewer practising physicians per 1000 people than there were in 1950. The other major source of health care costs- hospitals-are similarly insensitive to consumer economic needs. Operating largely on a cost reimbursable basis and as non-profit institutions, they have no real incentives to effect major, radical economies. Put another way, the health care industry is basically non-competitive and accordingly, lacks the normal business incentive to keep its costs and its prices as low as possible. To introduce the benefits of competition into the industry, major institutional change is necessary. I have elaborated on this theme in a presentation to the 1967 National Conference on Private Health Insurance, at copy of which is attached. In this presentation a number of possible changes are described. The economic impacts of what might be called-non-market oriented biases- in the health care system are particularly severe upon the many elderly who have to live on relatively fixed incomes. With a high incidence of expensive acute and chronic ailments. with other living costs rising regularly, with their other special costs, the rapidly rising prices that they must pay for health care becomes a most severe burden. Certainly Medicare and Medicaid help tremendously, enabling many of the elderly to obtain care heretofore impossible for them. For the individual, these plans make the personal cost in most cases. However, for society as a whole, the total cost must rise for two reasons. First, more people with more care simply means more dollars spent for health care; and, of course, these extra dollars come from society. Second, the resultant increased demand puts additional upward pressures upon medical fees and hospital prices. Since these upward pressures are not being relieved by concomitant supply increases, prices will tend to rise. You also asked me to comment upon deficiencies in the organization of health services for the elderly, and about the relationship of federal programs to the broad scale development of prepaid medical centers. I believe the organizational deficiencies have been well noted in the Hearings. T am not an expert in this field and I have nothing but personal prejudices to add. I would like to stress the danger however, of not considering such deficiencies in the context of larger wholes: namely; the organizational deficiencies of health care generally: and, for -another, in the context of' the elderly person's total social and psychological health. It is in this later regard that so many nursing homes and extended care facilities seem to fail completely. As for government participation, my personal view is that it would be far better for the so-called third parties, or for labor-management groups to take the lead in developing the new institutional arrangements that are needed if incentives746 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS for efficiency and low prices are to be effective. However, the federal government eah play a significant role in bringing appropriate people together from these groups and working with them to start-such activities. The government has done this successfully in the'past and I hope it can again for this important social problem. For the immediate future and some time to come, however, the government is in the best position to alleviate the health care problems of the elderly. Cer- tainly something more needs to be done about substandard Medicaid plans, about high drug costs to the elderly, about better enforcement to avoid abuse by the vendors of medical care (note attached clipping from November 8, 1968 L.A. Times), about the problem of chronic illness care. Medicare represents a big step forward for acute health problems; the costs of chronic illness still represent a most formidable threat. An area in which the'federal government can improve its activities in order to help alleviate the health care problems of the elderly as well as other health care problems relates to its research grants procedures. Under the current sys- tem, millions of dollars are being spent on various studies of health care orga- nization and delivery. However, because of procedures followed, most funded studies tend to be very specific and actually prevent the investigator from doing the sort of broad study and general casting about that is essential for the crea- tion of new breakthroughs. Thus, while many specific, narrow studies of health care and of the elderly exist, no really comprehensive scientific view nor tested set of recommendations exist. Largely because of the grants procedures, the information we have on the health policy question is fragmented, full of gaps and generally inadequate. This deficiency is not the fault of the researchers, or the research organizations, but rather stems directly from the philosophy and practice of the research grant system. Yours sincerely, JOSEPH W. E11RENREICH3. [Enclosure] EXHIBIT A. CREATING COMPETITION IN THE HEALTH-CARE INDUSTRY: SOME REFLEC- TIONS ON POSSIBLE IMPACTS OF MAJOR GROUP PURCHASERS ON COSTS AND QUALITY OF HEALTH <ARE Among the thousands of studies prepared in recent years on the health-care industry in the United States. there are virtually none concerning the potential effects of major group purchasers upon the system. This is strange, in that all the other participants in the industry have been reported upon in exhaustive detail. The providers of care, the so-called third parties, and the governments have been studied both in general terms and in great detail. However, the major group purchasers -the single largest source of the funds that flow into the system-have received scant attention. Accordingly, I was most pleased when the Department of Health. Education, and Welfare asked me to prepare a background paper for the National Con- ference on Private Health Insurance on the question of how management and labor might act to restrain the soaring prices of health services while their quality was. at least, maintained. The Medical Care Price Index, based on 1957 to 1959 as 100, was 122.3 in 1965, 127.7 in 1966, and up to 135.7 by May of this year. In the last twelve months alone, it has risen almost .7'2 percent. It is always stimulating to be connected with a pioneering effort, and that is what this paper is. It is not designed to be comprehensive, or convincing, or in any way conclusive. It is rather designed to expand understanding, to present some possibly new views, and to be a basis for discussion, argument, and dia- logue. From these and from the refinement and extension of this work, it is hoped that some advances in our nation's capacity to cope with the problems of the health-care market may ultimately result. While, as usual, the author of this paper must take full blame for all errors and inanities. I have been uniquely fortunate in the advice I have had. Not wanting the paper to be limited by my own ideas 'and prejudices, I invited dis- tinguished Los Angeles representatives of management and labor to discussion meetings in which many of the thoughts herein presented were developed. As a measure of the tremendous interest and concern with which such people view the health-price problem, it is noteworthy that of thirteen people invited, eleven attended or sent alternates. The twelfth, a union executive, had to cancel 'at the last minute because of a strike problem; the thirteenth, an insurance-company official, could not attend because of a death in his family.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 747 We were most privileged to be able to draw upon the experience and thoughts of the following men, although none of them should be considered as necessarily endorsing this report: Cass D. Alvin, Education Coordinatot, United Steelworkers of America; Wallace 3.. Andrews, Consultant, Merchants: and Manufacturers Association; Charles Boren, Executive Vice President, Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers, Inc.; John Despol, Representative, United Steelworkers of America; Anthony M. Frank, President, State Mutual Savings and Loan Association; Caniel Johnston, Daniel Johnston-and Associates; Harold Klein, Administrator, Food, Health and Welfare Fund, Retail Clerks Union; Irvin P. Mazzei, President, Los Angeles County Federation of Labor; Lawrence A. Peifer, Labor Relations Associate, Ford Employers Council, Inc.; and Harry Winston. Manager, Industrial Relations Branch, Lockheed-California Company. Particular appreciation is due Dean Robert Dockson and Professor Donald E. Yett for their constructive suggestions; to Max Fine of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare for his sage advice and help; and to Robert Sigmond for his incisive comments. The literature abounds with history, data, and proposals about the problems of health-care costs and their quality-what the problems are, their causes, and their remedies. Excellent materials are available, particularly the books Bar- gaining for Health by Munts,1Health Plans and Collective Bargaining, by Gar- barino,2How to Get the Most out of Medical and Hospital Beneftt Plans, by Brecher.' Tilove's article \"Pensions, Health and Welfare Plans\",' and the many splendid papers prepared for June's National Conference on Medical Costs.5It cannot really be useful to restate these or even to add more of the same. However, there is a dearth of material regarding the roles that management and/or labor-the major group-health-care purchasers-play or can plan in these problem areas. There are some materials describing and analyzing what they are doing in health, but, except for some material in the book by Brecher and Brecher, one looks in vain for any analysis of group purchasers' interests and attitudes toward health care, their role perception, their options for action and policies, or their view of where their responsibilities begin and end. Accordingly, it is the purpose of this paper to try to conceptualize and cate- gorize how the major group purchasers do and can influence the costs and quality of health care. This paper will then attempt to suggest deficiencies in the ability of the current institutional organization to solve the big problems and to indicate possible revision which might make it more effective. Many of the ideas that have been expressed over the years for expanding the supply of health-care providers, for reducing demand, or for introducing controls over the noncompetitive aspects of the industry have been ineffective, in my opinion, for two interrelated reasons. First, the ideas were just that-ideas. They might be considered as interesting hypotheses, based largely upon faith or judgment or prejudice. Many have plausible rationales, but, fraught as they are with implications for disruption of the accustomed ways and for acrimony with established institutions, they do not have an adequately hard, factual basis for activation. Plausibility is not enough. There is always difficulty, and rightfully so. in changing major social policies or programs without strong evidence that the changes will, in fact, have the desired results. The related reason that the ideas have had tough sledding is that, in addition to lacking a firm intellectual basis, they have lacked the support of any significant power group. The providers of medical care have generally opposed significant changes through their organized associations, the third parties have been relatively passive and divided, and the individual consumers-the actual payors of the rising health costs-are unorganized and not fully cognizant of what has been happening to them. Management and labor, working together In some instances and separately in others, have been the largest organized payors of health costs, either through payment of premiums or through direct payments to health-care providers.

Now, there are thousands of differ-ent plans. It is estimated that two-thirds of the civilian population of the countryare covered by a health plan purchased by or through a management and/orlabor group. Yet the effects of these on restraining general health-care costsare probably quite negligible. When management and labor reach agreement in their negotiations abouthealth care, then they may bargain with third parties for the best buy. But theythen are bargaining with the wrong group. The bargaining, at some point, hasto be with the providers of health care. The ability of our free-enterprise systemto regulate economic forces through competition needs, among others, threeconditions to enable it to work: there has to be a mechanism for dialogue betweenthe buyers and the sellers for bargaining to occur, there has to be knowledge onthe part of the buyers, and there must be alternatives so that each side hasbargaining power. As I see it, these do not exist to any adequate extent. For this,as well as other reasons, management and labor, despite their thousands of in-dividual plans, have failed, together or separately, to correct the conditions thathave led to the soaring costs. Since management and labor, as the major purchasers of group coverages, arethe natural choice to act for the consumer as a power force in opposition to thevendors' force, and since they do have economic as well as humanitarian motivesfor obtaining the best medical care for their people at reasonable cost, it seemsappropriate to consider how they might be a more effective force in the health-care market. This is a particularly urgent task, because what choices are there?Who else will represent the consumer-the immediate victim of the cost spiraling?Ultimately, of course, the entire economic system is the victim. If managementand labor fail this challenge, if third parties do not radically revise their orien-tations, the Federal Government may have to step in as the consumers' represent-ative. There is no other group existent that can exert the types of pressures thatare necessary if health prices are to be restrained. Consequently, this paper will focus on the roles that major group purchasersmight plan in regard to this national problem. It is based on several premises:first, that health-care prices will continue to rise inordinately unless somethingnew happens; second, that when they rise, management and labor will becomeincreasingly concerned and will examine the problem more deeply and becomemore knowledgeable and sophisticated; third, that when they do so they willmove toward constraining measures such as those that follow. Analysis of theirpossible actions is built on two simple models of the market as it exists:MIodel A (a three-segment model, in which the major group purchasers buy cov-erage from a third party, who in turn pays the vendors) MHajor group purchasers: Third parties: Hospitals. Physicians. Drugs. Other. Alodel B (a tvo-segment model in which the first parties deal directly with thesecond parties): Major group purchasers: Hospitals. Physicians. Drugs. Other. In the following section, this paper considers each of these models to explorethe different strategies they afford the major group purchasers. In the final por-tion, there are some suggestions regarding the implementation of these strategiesand ideas through institutional modifications in the health industry and throughexperimental research. IMPACTS INVOLVING THIRD PARTIES-MODEL A One pattern of involvement of group purchasers in the task of controllinghealth-care costs and maintaining quality is through the third parties, whoso often serve as intermediaries between the purchasers and providers of healthcare. Despite the fact that the third parties are themselves victims of increasingprices, and despite their occasionally serious losses due to unexpectedly highCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 749 claim experience and their own frustration at their inability to contain thehealth-cost inflation, third parties remain the immediate point of contact of mostgroup purchasers with the health-care system. This seems particularly curious.On the one hand, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans are closely affiliatedhistorically and In terms of curreht board memberships with the principal ven-dors-physicians and hospitals; and the private insurance companies are main-ly in the business of Fisk control. Neither group has, in the past, considered thesustained, hard-nosed pursuit of lower costs as one of its prime functions. Thisis not to say that they have been indifferent, but rather that they have not seentheir role as one of vigorous bargaining with vendors on the consumers' behalf.On the other hand, their group-purchaser clients, which include some of the mostrational, sophisticated, and economically powerful organizations in the country,have diffused their bargaining power in the health area by turning this matterover to the third parties. As the principal payors of hospital and physician bills, the private insurancecompanies and the Blues have frequently been criticized for not exercising moreof an influence in controlling health costs. Some insurance companies and someBlue Cross and Blue Shield plans, in some ways, have tried to keep costs down.Careful review of claims for surgical fees, follow-up discussions with physicianswhose charges were considerably out of line and with local medical societies,direct and indirect involvement with hospital boards of directors have all beentried by some companies. The effects are not measurable, but obviously havenot been adequate. Several Blue Cross plans have tried to stimulate efficienciesin hospital operations through incentive provisions in proposed reimbursementformulas and through suasive processes. Hospitals have, by and large, success-fully resisted these attempts. Blue Shield plans have been somewhat moreeffective in helping to establish pre-set medical fees for lower-income subscribers.However, once this is said, it is clear that still more needs to be done. M-oreactive programs of restraint on the part of individual third-party organizationswould be very costly, and their success would be uncertain even in the short run.In the longer run, if a few such organizations were to initiate a program ofrestraint, their extra costs and possibly worsened relations with the medicalprofession and with hospitals would soon put them in a competitively untenableposition. This is in the sense that if a few companies were to charge a priceadequate to cover their costs, their customers would shift to other companies.It does not follow that if all the third parties acted together the same resultwould occur. But stimulation by an outside consumer force might lead to agreater willingness on their part to incur these economic and political costs.An expansion on this thought appears later.What, then, can major group purchasers do to control the costs and qualityof medical care through third parties? From the viewpoint of the public, mostof whom pay for their health care through these third parties; the price ofcare consists of two sets of costs: the internal costs (including any profits)of the financial intermediaries and the prices charged by the providers of healthcare. It seems to me that the major group purchasers can, in the three-segmentmodel. influence costs in both these areas through impacts on products specifi-cations, by consumer education, through influence on third-party administrativecosts, and directly on medical and hospital prices. Product specifications It has been pointed out by many observers that socially noneconomic healthservices are often provided or prescribed because it is advantageous for anindividual patient. One commonly mentioned example is the utilization of hos-pital facilities for simple procedures that can be done in an office or a con-valescent home, solely because the former are covered by a hospitalization policywhile the latter are not. It has also been pointed out that the huge variety ofhealth plans that are available makes it impossible for most purchasers toevaluate plans comparatively because of differences in coverages. levels of bene-fits, and claim-payment policies. It seems to me that major group purchaserscan do something about each of these.Comprchensiveness of p&odvcts.-Group purchasers can push for plans thatare more comprehensive (I differ from those who say that completely com-prehensive prepaid plans are needed now. Such plans-at this time-wouldlead to abrupt increases in the demand for additional services and. with thewell-known shortages in the supply of health resources, further price increases).More comprehensiveness is needed to avoid the common misallocations of scarceresources occasioned by today's usual restrictions. There are, admittedly, risks24-798-69-pt. 3-10750 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS of abuse in any steps of this type, but how can progress be made without risk, and how can management policies be formulated to- reduce these risks until actual experience is obtained? Standardization of products.-Group purchasers can take more initiative in developing specifications of what they want, in detail, in a prepaid health plan, be it of an indemnity or service type. Some large groups have been con- spicuously successful in doing this, usually because of union pressures,. exercised through the collective-bargaining process. The Steelworkers, Auto Workers, and Mline Workers have used this approach on a national basis for almost two decades; the Clothing Workers for even longer. Some local collective-bargaining units also have initiated similar programs. But, in general, the group purchaser still relies upon the third parties for development of package plans and for proposals. Group purchasers, in so doing, invite confusion'and nonrationality because they cannot usually make knowledgeable cost-benefit analyses of. the different proposals. It would be much simpler to specify what is wanted and then to obtain bids from several third parties. This would tend to force the third parties to compete on economic grounds, with all the concomitant pres- sures. for cost control and more efficiency. A big obstacle to this approach occurs, however, in the many cases in which the collective-bargaining procedures that lead to the group purchase result in an agreement on health-coverage expenditures rather than on types and levels of benefits. or in an agreement to give the coverage to a specified third party. (The Steelworkers' one-time. preference for having Blue Cross and Blue Shield provided their health insurance is an example of the latter.) In either of these situations, the advantages of competitive bidding are lost. Accordingly, it would be well for labor and management to bargain for health benefits rather than for the amount of money to go into this fringe benefit. I realize this is a much-. debated subject and that many arguments can be made for labor-management agreements on health-premium dollars rather than benefit levels, but I suggest that in the interest of injecting the advantages of free competition into at least part of the health industry, emphasis should first be on benefits. Obviously, it would be completely unrealistic to bargain on benefits without some con- sideration of the price levels involved, but this is a solvable problem, since the number of consulting actuarial firms can be expected to increase to provide this service as it is needed. Consumer education It would be of little avail for sophisticated group purchasers and third parties to develop economic approaches to health care if the consumer remained naive about them. If the consumer does not recognize the value of patronizing accredited hospitals or, most important, does not realize that he is affected by the rising costs of health care even if he does not get ill, and even if his employer pays the entire health-care premium, then. in the long run, group purchasers will continue to face an uphill battle in trying to reduce costs and maintain quality. The economics and sociology of health care are quite complicated. In our demo- cratic society, public awareness and the resultant support or protest ultimately come to be reflected in private and public policies. For these to be sound, the public' awareness must hopefully be based on fact. In our case, the develop- ment and acceptance of policies to control costs will benefit from broader con- sumer understanding. The group purchasers-union and management-can help accomplish this by programs to teach the consumer such things as how much health care costs. who is paying for it, why there are certain restrictions in coverages that are necessary, alternatives that may have been possible and why they were not taken, the consequences to costs of claim abuses, the pros and cons of group practice and solo practice among physicians, the proper role of paramedical personnel, and the proper role of extended-care facilities other than hospitals. Factors that are generally considered in attempts to increase the efficiency of an institutional system include the possibilities of effecting more economies of scale, of effecting economies through division of labor, of building in automatic restraints of cost escalations or inefficiences, and of shifting some fuctions to lower-cost alternatives. Persuasive cases can be made for how these sugges- tions will help realize these possibilities, not only as they apply to the insurance carriers but also as they apply to the providers of health care themselves.COSTS OF 'HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 751 Third-party management policies As large-scale customers deciding on the expenditure of hundreds of millionsof dollars for health insurance each year, the major group purchasers can havea great deal of influence on the management policies of third-party Intermedi-aries. They have had, in many instances, but an area of potential influence inwhich little has been done is that of the relationship between the third partiesand the providers of medical care-sphere Y Provd ergroup ---- Thir partie-of carepurchasers Applications of influence have been primarily in sphere X. In the section thatfollows, the X sphere will be commented upon, but it is also suggested that sphereY offers significant opportunities for group purchasers.Third-party costs (sphere X).-Conceivably, the group purchasers could radi-cally affect third parties' operations. Over the years, they have been instru-mental in, among other things, stimulating dramatic reductions in retentionrates. According to Louis S. Reed, in 1948, private health insurance organizations(including Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans, insurance companies, and independentplans such as community-consumer programs and employer-employee-union pro-grams) retained 29.7 percent of subscription or premium income. In 1964, thecomparable figure was 12.8 percent. Included in these figures are the retentionrates for individual as well as group coverages, and the differences are interest-ing. In insurance companies, the retention rates on individual policies decreasedfrom 62 percent to 45 percent between 1948 and 1964, or more than a fourth.During the same period, the group insurance rates dropped from 30 percent to5 percent. or almost three-quarters .It is impossible to attribute any specific share of this dramatic reduction tothe direct influence of the group purchasers, because.other factors also were atplay, but it seems clear that they have been responsible for a significant portion.Major group purchasers can go further in stimulating additional reductionsin the operating and marketing costs of third parties. They can do this in a gen-eralized fashion through an emphasis on more comprehensive plans and morestandardized packages, as mentioned earlier. Similarly, a better-informed em-ployee body will tend to enable third parties to operate with lower costs throughfewer abuses and more individual-consumer bargaining with vendors. Morespecifically, and in addition, sample screening of claims by major group purchas-ers to nip abusers and, abuses in the bud, periodic claim reports and analyses,efforts directed toward reducing the hundreds of different claim-reporting formsso that providers could routinize their completion, and other similar steps wouldhave some, although probably relatively minor, effects on costs. A more importantstep would be to rationalize the commissions paid for group business. UnderState laws based upon antidiscriminatory concepts, a commission has to be paidby insurance companies for group business. Accordingly, despite the fact thatsalaried employees frequently do all the necessary work, a commission expensemust be incurred. Some individuals frequently reap handsome rewards for doingvirtually nothing. Group purchasers would seem to have an opportunity to helpeliminate this economically unnecessary requirement by aggressive action at theState legislative level.Furthermore, the whole question of an indemnity system of insurance issomething for group purchasers to consider. There.is a large body of informedopinion that believes that, in Raymond Munts' words, \"indemnity insurance ispart of the problem rather than part of the solution\".' For this reason. manypurchasers have sought service-benefit coverages, and indemnity-type carriershave shifted some coverages-hospital room charges and major medical prov-isions, for instance-into a service basis. Consequently, if further investigationproves that an indemnity system of coverage does, in fact, tend to promotehigher factor prices and does not deter inferior care, then it would seem reason- eLouis S. Reed, \"Private Health Insurance: Coverage and Financial Experience, 1965,\"Social Security Bulletin XXLX (November 1966), 12.7 Munts, op. cit., D. 129.752 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS able for the major group purchasers to use their power to do away with such plans. In this connection, an interesting collaborative idea is being explored by a number of life insurance companies and the Harvard Medical School. Through an exchange of technical assistance and guidance, the insurance carriers and the School are looking toward ways whereby, in the Boston area, the groups of in- sureds will have the choice of obtaining service benefits from a division of the Medical School. Similiar explorations are now current with other carriers and will certainy be watched closely by other health insurers as well as by hospital administrators and the medical fraternity. Factor prices (sphere Y).-The curious structure so often found whereby strong group purchasers turn over their buying power to third parties, who in turn are less than effective in controlling either vendor prices or the quality of care, has been remarked upon previously. When the third party expends the group purchasers' funds for health care, what are his responsibilities? What should they be? These are questions which need to be asked and seriously con- sidered, but which are not within the scope of this paper. Our question is, can group purchasers influence third parties to exercise more vigor in their vendor relationships? It seems to me the answer to this has to be Yes, of course, large purchasers can wield great influence with sellers. However, there are three elements to this: one, the purchasers must act with unified purposes; two, the third parties must reorient their thinking to accept the control activity as one of their primary roles; and, three, the third parties must develop and implement appropriate policies. In the final section. on sug- gestions, this theme will be expanded. IMPACTS DIRECTLY ON PROVIDERS-MODEL B Up to now, this paper has consisted of reflections on how major group pur- chasers might exercise their considerable influence in stimulating third parties to control costs and prices. Now we turn to consideration of how this influence might be brought to bear directly upon health-care prices-how group purchasers can affect the charges made by the providers of health care. Direct operation of health-care organizations There are two strategies that major group purchasers could, and have pursued: one, the direct approach, in which they would support their own facilities, paying salaries to the nonmedical staff and reimbursing the medical staff on some negotiated basis rather than the usual, unilaterally established fee for service. Examples of successful ventures of this sort are the Southern Pacific Em- ployees Hospital Association, the Kaiser Plan, the United Mine Workers' pro- gram, and the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union health centers. These programs are each quite different in scope and approach, but are similar in giving their sponsor more administrative control over the costs and quality of health care. This, in turn, is reflected in lower costs and prices. This is not an easy way to proceed, as evidenced by the rough sailing in one way or another that each plan has had. The hostility of organized medicine. the lack of awarness or appreciation of the individuals in the plans, the conflicting objectives of union politics, comprehensive care, individuals' wants, and adequate funding have all been problems. Yet the fact remains that, through these pro- grams, expenses were constrained, quality care could be sought, and the de- fenders of the status quo could be shaken and induced to reexamine their position. They were, to some extent, influenced to be competitive either through price-increase restrictions or through the development of new, countering insti- tutions. An interesting one that developed to counter expansion of the Kaiser Plan is the San Joaquin Foundation for Medical Care, which was established by the San Joaquin County Medical Society in California to provide care at predetermined fees, using third-party mechanisms. Prepayment medical centers.-Given the high interest in health care among many giant unions and many giant business firms, it is conceivable that, if other methods failed to control costs, then these groups could combine to create a national chain of prepayment group-practice centers with hospital, convalescent- home, and nursing-home affiliates. If these centers were open to the community, they would certainly provide a potent competitive force in the marketplace-one that existing providers could not ignore in setting their fees. Self-insurance indemnity programs.-It may seem a natural corollary to this \"do it yourself\" approach for major group purchasers to expand their self- insurance indemnity programs. Self-insurance, combined with purchased stop-lossCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 753 coverage for extraordinarily high claim experience, would seem a likely way to reduce the prices of health care. Potential savings on a private carrier's market- ing costs, the mandatory commissions, contingent reserves, possibly, and the State premium taxes have been estimated by the the Food Employers Council of Southern California at about ten percent. Quite a few employers and union groups have moved in this direction. It is not clear to me, however, that these savings are permanent or that theycompensate in the long run for lost opportunities to achieve economies of scale through specialization of function. There is also a problem, in self-insured group plans, concerning the people leaving the group. With a private carrier, they can ordinarily convert their group certificates into an individual policy, but the self-insured plans usually cannot do this. Accordingly, I wonder under whatconditions a self-insured indemnity plan is really more effective; I could not find any defintive analysis of this question. This seems a worthy subject forfurther study, with results that would be useful to both major group purchasers and to private carriers. The health-insurance industry, perhaps more now than ever in the past, is competing in a market where the ground rules and even, to some extent, the name of the game are rapidly changing. Union pressures for service-type benefits, new health-care alternatives and combinations of alternatives, Medicare and Medicaid, shifting medical attitudes, Federal concern about costs, and the as yet unknown effects of the Comprehensive Helath Planning and Public Health Amendments of 1966 (Public Law 89-T49) make the role of the private carriera particularly difficult one and call for new adaptions and philosophies. Management-labor coalition An alternative strategy open to management-labor groups, besides actually operating health-care organizations, is the indirect one whereby the potential power of major group purchasers to establish their own health-care organiza- tions is assembled and focused in some suitable organization and maintained as a deterrent to capricious increases in prices and careless administrative praetices. A point that cannnot be overlooked in any consideration of how major group purchasers can affect providers directly is the fact that, to some extent, major group purchasers run the private hospitals. The boards of directors of these hospitals are largely composed of businessmen, with an increasing number ofunion leaders joining them. What often seems to be needed, however, is more recognition by these men of the intermingling nature of their two roles. SUlMMARY AND SUGGESTIONS Up to this point, this paper has briefly discussed various ideas that major group purchasers might employ to restrain increases in health-care costs and encourage quality care. Actually, of course, these are more than ideas; most. ifnot all of them, are being practiced by one or more major group purchasers. Yet prices continue to soar. Does this mean that the strategies are nonvalid? No, I don't believe so. Prob- ably, without them, prices would have gone even higher. It does seem to indi- cate that a more massive, vigorous application of the strategies is needed to counteract the basic cause of the extraordinary inflation we are experiencing in the health field. The fragmented, partial applications that we have are not enough. Some stronger force is necessary to negotiate effectively with the providers in the health field. It seems likely that unless some such force develops, the Gov- ernment will initiate some control devices. It has become a generally accepted function of Government to concern itself with policies to control general infla- tion; it is simple to expand this perspective to include such a special problem as that of health care. Reading and reflecting on these issues as summarized in the preceding pages have brought me tentatively to the following beliefs:First. the rising prices of health care stem. to a large extent, from the non- competitive markets ifi which physicians and hospitals operate. This is reflected in the physician's almost unilateral control of his fees and in the hospitals' ability to operate with little regard to economic rationality. Second, unlike other markets, the bargaining power of the ultimate health- care consumer and his opportunity to shift from higher-priced sellers to more economical ones are very limited.754 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Third, if the healthful effects of a competitive market are to be introduced inthe medical marketplace, a continuing countervailing force that does not now exist will be needed. Fourth, hospitals are unlikely, of their own volition, to relinquish some of their socially disfunctional high levels of autonomy and independence.Fifth, the labor and/or management groups have one of the biggest stakes inthe game, but have been sitting relatively quietly for a long time. As prices con-tinue to go up and as the Government focuses increasingly on the problem. this group will be increasingly heard from in one or more of the ways described above. Sixth, there is no shortage of ideas about what should be done. There is, how-ever, a shortage of well-tested ideas and, most important, there is a shortage ofideas of how to get change started, how to get the ideas implemented. These beliefs, in turn, lead me to the following conclusions: Fundamentally, there is a need for reinstitutionalizing the health-care industry to place the phy- sicians and the hospitals in a posture vis-a-vis the consumer that is more typical of buyers and sellers in other markets. As prices continue to rise, stronger pressures will build toward change. While this paper has concentrated on possible actions by labor and/or management, it is obvious that the sparkplug role may be taken anywhere in the system-by thevendors, by the third parties, by the Government. But, based on current trends and present orientations, the major group purchasers may well emerge as the major stimulant toward change. Possible approaches to a competitive environnent What form will this change take? It is hard to say, of course. The situation is complex, and there are many social and political considerations. In this paper we have already mentioned several possibilities. The following discussion con- cerns these and additional possibilities: Broad-scale development of prepayment medical centers.-Imagine the effect on the organization of health care and on costs if. in each urban area, there wereprepayment community health centers, similar to the Kaiser Plan, available as an alternative to the public. Other hospitals, independent physicians, and drug suppliers would be faced with adequate, but not overwhelming, competition.Massive self-insurance indemnity programs.-The expansion. by major group purchasers, of their self-insurance indemnity programs is not a likely occurrence:among the major unions, at least, there is a strong preference for nonindemnity- type coverages. Management-labor coalitions.-Regional coalitions of management and/orlabor could bargain and negotiate directly with the vendors of health care. stimu- late effectiveness in community health planning groups, institute improved claim- control systems, and in general assume the role of the consumers' representative. There is reason to believe that this type of coalition may be more than a dream.Recently, the California Health Plans Alternatives Committee was established by the Teamsters, Steelworkers. Carpenters, and Longshoremen in the State forthis very purpose. It plans to invite members of industry shortly. There are sev- eral interesting elements to be observed. First, despite the fact that each of these unions already has advanced health plans. they still feel the need for a moreforceful combination. Second, despite differences in philosophy, values, and payrates, and despite continuing jurisdictional disputes, the unions can cooperate with each other on common problems. Third, despite geographical differences in their organizations and differing relationships with their national unions, these unions can overcome problems of regional autonomy when necessary. Much of industry is no less concerned about the problem than is labor. It would seem, therefore, that, if a catalytic agent could be found that would bring themajor labor and management groups together, it might be possible to form re- gional combinations that would be large enough to be effective. A variation of this would be a regional coalition of management, labor, and Government to accomplish these purposes. In some areas, Government may be needed as the sparkplug to get things going. This may be the eventual shape of the comprehensive regional planning activities created under the Comprehensive Health Planning and Public Health Amendments of 1966. Private-conmpany operation of medical facilities-A new private company, pat- terned after the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in State-by-State organization and after the Communications Satellite Corporation in ownershiparrangements, could operate the nation's voluntary, nonreligious hospitals and extended-care facilities on a for-profit basis. Owned by public shareholders, with prices and quality regulated by State agencies. such a company would provide the overall planning, direction, and control that are now lacking among hospitals.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 755 With the additional stimulation of the profit motive, and of a size to permit economies of scale and command top-grade management, such a company should be expected to: 1) Remove duplication and fill in gaps of service 2) Eliminate or convert noneconomic hospital plants 3) Purchase centrally 4) Create specialized centers for health care as needed 5) Engage in continuous research and development, leading to improved tech- nologies and new economies of management 6) Find ways to reduce hospital construction costs 7) Find better ways to serve professional staffs-physicians, researchers, dentists 8) In general, operate on a rational, coherent, cost-effective basis. This company would not be granted a monopoly. Anyone could establish a for- profit hospital. Thus, a competitive element and additional stimulus to efficient management would exist. Establishment of such a company would be fraught with difficulties and un- answered questions. How Would hospitals be induced to join? How would physicians be treated? How would proprietary hospitals fit into the system? Can urgent human health needs be handled in a way that is compatible with profit maximization? Can costs really be restrained if there is a guaranteed maximum- profit rate? These 'are a few of the serious questions that need discussion and exploration.'The difficulties'may be more apparent than real, and the potential advantages of this system may be sufficient to justify such further exploration.Third partics as agents of major group purchasers.-Less drastic, and simpler in some ways to accomplish, would be a new relationship between major pur- chasers'and third parties. It is doubtful that major purchasers are anxious to undertake radical new roles and responsibilities. Third parties, too, would cer- ,tainly not be enthusiastic about their doing so. This suggests that there is sub- stantial room for a revision of roles wherein the third parties-principally the lines and the private carriers-would explore new approaches together with management-labor groups. This, in itself, is not new; what is suggested is that it be done with a new \"psychological set\". The third parties would regard them- selves as-the. agents of the major group purchasers rather than merely as financial conduits. They would. -as agents, develop new bargaining relationships with the vendors of care; negotiate contracts with them; encourage competitive buying behAviour by consumers; if warranted, move into service benefits: insist on more effective regional hospital planning; and actually be the countervailing force. TDie need for evaluation In reflecting upon the health-care-cost problem, I have been struck by the lack of conclusive data that can be used for decision-making. In this regard, many people have pointed to the need to experiment with the many ideas that have been promulgated. Actually, experiments of a noncontrolled sort are already in process all over our country. This paper has only briefly touched on a few of these: there are many more. We should think of these as experiments. and we should organize efforts to document what each is doing. to ascertain results, and to evalu- ate the experiences. It is too bad that such noble ideas as Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, the San Joaquin Foundation for Mledical Care. the program for hospital planning in Allegheny County, Kennicott Coppers' health program in Utah. the food industry's program in Los Angeles. and on and on. are not sys- tematically studied by economists and management specialists so that the needed les-ons could be learned. With the Medicare program coming up for review by Congress within the next twelve months. it would seem in order to undertake an impartial. scholarly study. adequately staffed and funded, to evaluate its effects on health costs and develop recommendations for ameliorating the negative ones. It seems clear that the effects so far have been massive. To the extent that people who would otherwise not have received care did expand the demand, this is good. But any negative effects also need to be identified and evaluated with a view toward their elimina- tion or reduction. Conclusion I believe that those who argue for allowing the consumer a substantial number of health-care choices are correct. Tastes and values differ and these differences should be respected. There are no villains responsible for the soaring costs. What we have are responses to the forces of supply and demand, operating in a unique economic756 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS marketplace. What we therefore should seek to do is reduce the differences in this market through improvements in its organization and productivity. The sounder social programs are those that evolve because they are right forthe time and place rather than those that are superimposed extraneously. Ordinarily, the best way to create a competitive-market environment where one does not exist is by eliminating the barriers to competition. In the case at hand, however, I have been unable to find or think of any practicable way to put hos- pitals in a competitive framework, or to set physicians to competing with their associates. Through regional health planning, it is possible to effect some significant economies among hospitals. But it is doubtful to me that such.an approach is a substitute for the sort of buyer-seller price-and quality negotiating that is the essence of a competitive system. Accordingly. I suggest in this paper that new, countervailing power arrange- ments be considered and, if deemed worthy, stimulated and nurtured. Through these, the effective, competitive conditions can be developed that are necessary, in my opinion, if health-care prices are to become market-responsive. Several ideas of what these countervailing power arrangements might be have been presented. The one that seems the best for all, in my opinion. is that in which third parties adopt a new role-that of \"agent\" for the major group purchasers. In this role. the third parties would maintain their functions of risk control and health-care-money transfer, but in addition would act as negotiators and bar- gainers with the providers of health care. This would entail major changes in their product, their methods or procedure, and their perception of themselves. As we look to the future, it seems inevitable that some, if not all, of the participants in the health-care model will have to change their viewpoints andbehavior. Current positions are incompatible with our societal and economic valnes, and now the winds of change are blowing. Some will be actors, and some. reactors. It is difficult to say which group will be which; but certainly the third parties' group would seem from many viewpoints the best candidate for leadership if it can organize. If it doesn't, the task will devolve upon management and labor, or upon the Government. ITEM 4: LETTER AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLE FROM MARION 1. FOLSOM. HEALTH COUNCIL OF 3IONROE COUNTY, ROCHESTER. N.Y. Oc~roDEu 16, 1968. DEAR SE.NATOR KENNEDY: The concise summary that appeared in the Democrat and Chronicle of a local study has some relevance to the Congress. I believe. It points to the fact that we need many more facilities and services which will keep persons independent. Specifically we need, as a community, a system of patient evaluation to prevent unnecessary placements in general hospitals. state mental hospitals, and nursing homes. If we are to stop misplacing these elderly people, we. in Monroe County, would require roughly 2.000 apartment units with sup- portive services, and 2.500 congregate living facilities. Hopefully, we will be able to move on these problems under the Comprehensive Health Planning Act of 1966 (89-749) and the 1967 Partnership for Health Amendments. I hope there will be opportunity for consultation among the locali- ties. the State. and the Federal government on local-State priorities and action. William J. Curran. Professor of Health Law.

[Enclosure]COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 757 [From the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, Sept. 23. 1968] MONROE CRITICALLY SHORT ON AGED CARE (By Don Byington) A community study group said yesterday that 41 per cent of the elderly peoplein Monroe County who need health care are \"either receiving no care or thewrong type of care.\"It said, for instance, that there are 5,000 persons in the county who are senile-but that most homes for the aged and nursing homes have a policy against ad-mitting these people.The group, headed by Marion B. Folsom, former secretary of health educationand welfare, was composed of leaders in the health field and was generallyself-critical. It put the blame for the current situation on two factors:An \"unsystematic and piecemeal growth of care facilities and service.\"A change in emphasis by existing institutions, with resulting gaps.The five-year study noted that homes for the aged have tended -to become nurs-ing homes and that there is now a scarcity of \"custodial care\" facilities for olderindividuals who cannot get along by themselves but who do not need all of thehealth services of a nursing home. It said that about 20 per cent of the people now in nursing homes fall intothis category. They could just as well be in some type of \"congregate livingfacility\"-if such a facility were available.The five-year study of health care for the 61,832 persons in the county over65 was supported by the Ford Foundation. It was conducted by the Universityof Rochester's department of preventive medicine and community health, theHealth Council of Monroe County and the Council of Social Agencies.A report by the group also said:For every elderly person receiving public health nursing service at home,there were four others judged to need it. but not getting it.Between one-half and two-thirds of older patients were judged to be\"misplaced\" in terms of the kinds of health facilities and services they werereceiving. There is a need to include mental health services at all levels of care forthe aged, as more than half of those in need of care have some kind of mentalimpairment. That \"sheer chance,\" such as the action of an ambulance driver, an emer-gency department attendant, or an admitting clerk, can decide the kind ofcare an elderly person ultimately receives.These \"temporary misplacements,\" awaiting openings in the appropriate facil-ity, have a way of becoming permanent misplacements. ITEMI 5,: LETTER FROMN JAY W. FRIEDMNAN. D.D.S., ASSOCIATE RESEARCHER, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. LOS ANGELES JANUARY 14, 1969.* p * * p , - DEAR SENATOR WILLIANIS: The main problems confronting our population withrespect to dental care are the shortage of personnel and allocated funds, the laelk oforganized programs for the direct provision of care, and the absence of qualitativestandards and administrative controls. These problems apply across the board forall segments of the population. There is little prospect for their resolution in thenear future without massive governmental assistance. This assistance will not beforthcoming until the federal government establishes dental health as a majorpriority among its goals. With these '\"givens\" in mind, I shall comment on yourquestions. 1. \"W\"hat, if any, Medicare coverage should there be for dental care?\" Com-plete dental care should be included along with medical care. Dentistry is.after all, a specialty of medicine. The separation of dentistry from medicine is758 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS arbitrary but one cannot arbitrarily separate the oral cavity from the human body. 2. \"What advantages and/or disadvantages do you see with regard to coverage of dental care under Medicare?\" The major advantage is, of course, the com- pulsory allocation of funds for this specific purpose to assist the aged in receiv- ing a needed health service they might not otherwise be able to afford. W hen these programs are attempted on a voluntary basis, there is always the risk of 'adverse selection\" of participants. But unless well-defined standards are es- tablished and adequate administrative controls applied, the surge in demand for dental care can endanger the fiscal soundness of the entire health care pro- gram, as happened recently in New York State's MNedicaid. The main problem here is to overcome the dental society's traditional opposition to responsible controls-both qualitative and economic. In this latter respect. governmental programs should be based on fixred-fee scheduleds rather than the \"usual and customary\" fees currently advocated by the dental society. 3. \"What, if any, Federal legislation on dental problems and opportunities of the elderly would you recommend?\" I tend to feel that the need is not for special legislation directed towards the elderly but rather for the population as a whole. The dental problems afflicting the aged do not differ substantially from those of younger persons. If we were to decide. nonetheless, that programs were to be established for the elderly. then I would like to see the establishment of federally sponsored health centers for the aged based on the principles of group practice and including a dental component. Though not specifically related to the dental problems of the aged, the anachronism of state dental licensing should be elim- inated in favor of national licensure to allow dentists greater mobility. Some parts of the country attract more elderly persons. They therefore have greater need for dentists who should not be hampered in their movement by protectionist policies of state professional organizations. 4. \"What. if any. Federal programs to preveit dental difficulties in old age would you recommend?\" Dental difficulties of the aged have their origins in youth. The major preventive achievement in dentistry is fluoridation of public water supplies. Federal legislation should be developed to require fluoridation of all public water supplies to reduce the incidence of dental decay. This single pro- cednre would be more effective and less costly than any programs of repairing teeth once the damage is done. Since the major problems of the aged are related to tooth-loss, it is the prevention of premature tooth loss that is most important. GROUP VERSUS PRIVATE DENTAL PRACTICE 5. \"What. if any. legislative or administrative actions by the Federal govern- ment would you recommend to stimulate and encourage greater use of dental auxiliaries?\" Again. we need to eliminate the archaic state restrictive controls by developing rational national enabling legislation to permit more sophisticated use of dental auxiliaries. The main concern is that the average private. solo practitioner may himself not be sophisticated enough or trustworthy enough to pass on the economic advantages of auxiliaries to the consumer. Mdore important, however. is that greater controls are necessary to assure quality. But it is ex- tremely difficult to exercise controls over solo practitioners. Also private solo practice i4 very inefficient. In a detailed study of a group dental practice in Los Angeles I have found the group practice to be 50 to 90 percent more efficient than the average private dentists. I feel it is extremely important that the Federal government assist in the organization and financing of group dental practices no only for its economic advantages but also for its potential of greater produc- tion of services. i.e.. more care for more people. These groups could be even more productive if they were allowed to expand the functions of auxiliary personnel. A very important area for investigation is the training and utilization of dental hygienists. These persons. mainly women, are in the main grossly over- trained for the services they provide. This field should be opened up to men as well ns women. There is need for a large number of lesser skilled persons to do routine prophylaxis (cleaning) and for more highly trained dental hygienists who would really be periodontal therapists. The Federal government should actively promnte developments along these lines. 6. \"Is there a shortage of dental auxiliary personnel, and, if so, what Federal action would you recommend to cure this shortage?\" I have already commented on some aspects of this question. Given adequate numbers and utilization of auxiliaries it is possible that there are almost as many dentists as are required.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 759 At any rate, regardless of whether there are enough dentists or not, there is avast shortage of certain types of auxiliaries-mainly dental hygienists or theirequivalent. We have approximately 100,000 active dentists in the United Statesbut only 8.000 dental hygienists. We probably need as many hygienists as dentistssince prophylaxis is one of the most important preventive procedures. For exam-ple, past age 35 most teeth are lost from pyorrhea which has its origins for themost part from tartar deposits on the teeth. Therefore, preventive oral hygienicprocedures are directly related to the ultimate dental health of the aged, providedthey are begun early in life and continued periodically.There is also a shortage of skilled dental technicians. This would become worsewith the expansion of prepaid group practices, especially if technicians were tobe employed on the staffs. Currently, most training of dental technicians is bycommercial firms, vocational schools, and apprenticeship. I would like to seeFederal support given to the development of dental technician training schoolsin university dental schools so that dental technicians and dental students canlearn to work together from the beginning of their careers.But again, all of these suggestions are based upon a higher degree of organiza-tion of health care services, mainly through development of group practices.Training of more personnel will be wasted if there do not exist organizationscapable of employing them. Solo practice is too inefficient to employ the varietyand numbers of auxiliary personnel that are necessary to maximize productiveefficiency. MEDICAL AND DENTAL NEEDS OF ELDERLY 7. \"How well do you think Medicaid (Title XIX) is serving the dental needsof the elderly, and what, if any, recommendations would you have for makingthis program more responsive to the dental needs of this age group?\" Medicaidis not serving very well for the simple reason that the majority of eligible per-sons fail to utilize the programs. In California, for example, probably not morethan 15 percent of eligibles seek dental care in any one year, and California hasone of the best programs in the nation. Those that seek care do not necessarilyreceive the best care since preventive services often are valued lower (re: fees)than prosthetic services such as dentures. Dentists can make three or four timesas much per hour on dentures as compared with filling and cleaning of teeth!Another problem relating to elderly persons eligible for Medicaid is the mal-distribution of dentists. Dentists tend to locate in the middle class areas, not theurban ghettos where most of the aged poor reside. Therefore, programs shouldbe developed to bring dentists to these areas. The best way would be for thestate and/or federal government to establish group practice programs in theseareas. The key to the success of these programs is good administration. Un-fortunately, there appears to be a dearth of good dental administrators in thiscountry. We urgently need training programs developed in schools of publichealth in dental care administration. These programs require Federal financingsince the universities do not have the funds to support them locally. S. \"To what extent do you believe that failure or inability to receive properdental care results in medical conditions covered by Medicare. thus forcingMedicare expenditures by the government and individual which could havebeen prevented?\" Not much. I am enclosing the complete paper on \"Dentistry inthe Geriatric Patient: Mutilation by Consensus\" which expressed my views onthis matter quite completely. (The article brought to your attention was ab-stracted from this paper). I am not satisfied with these brief responses. But your questions were so com-prehensive that anything less than a dissertation with background and support-ing data for the opinions expressed would be unsatisfactory. Nonetheless, I hopeyou will find these remarks for some interest and value. Needless to say, I wouldbe glad to offer assistance (and opinions) in the future since we share commonconcern for the well-being of our compatriots-old and young together.Sincerely, JAY W.

Friedman, D.D.S., M.P.H.) Approximately 50% of Americans have lost all their teeth by age 65. Mlore than two-thirds are totally edentulous by age 75.' It is obvious that dental care for the geriatric patient is overwhelmingly characterized by the extraction of his teeth. This massive destruction of the mouth is not the result of an insidious, un- preventable disease process of aging. Rather, it is the result of little concern by the public for the preservation of teeth, and the regressive social character of the dental profession which has the technical knowledge but has failed to develop the manpower necessary to apply it on a universal scale. To be sure, there are degenerative processes of the oral mechanism with aging. But these processes can be modified to such an extent that the vast majority of the popula- tion could retain teeth throughout life. The degenerative dental condition of the geriatric patient generally is a product of cumulative neglect which begins in childhood and progresses to a state of partial and then total edentulatism (Fig. 1). But neglect is not a simple function of disinterest or negativism, although both these attitudes are present to an alarming degree. It is also a function of relative social, economic. and health values. Little social stigma is attached to loss of teeth even though we have advanced beyond the stage where it is viewed as a \"coming of age.\" Eco- nomically, dental care is relatively low on the priority of expenditures. The simple fact is that the United States is a commodity culture in which the ac- quisition and consumption of manufactured goods are conditioned needs taking precedence over what are considered nonessential health care services. Although dental neglect inevitably leads to pain and infection which require treatment. the loss of teeth either singly or totally does not represent a significant health hazard. Conditions leading to the loss of teeth may be hazardous to health, but once the teeth are lost the person is nearly the same physiologically. However. there may be serious social and psychological hazards which have untoward effects on the person's well-being. To place these remarks in perspective. the function of the dentition. the diseases that ravage it. and the knowledge and techniques that are known to preserve it are reviewed.2 Function of the dentition The most obvious function of teeth is the mastication of food in preparation for digestion. Incisors are designed for tearing and cutting up food and molars for shredding and grinding it prior to swallow-ing. Saliva lubricates the food bolus and supplies enzymes which begin the digestive process in the mouth. Prior to forks and knives, this process undoubtedly was of great importance. But with the development of processed foods and the emphasis on the soft texture of cooked foods the physiologic importance of mastication has declined. Edefntu- lous persons do not necessarily suffer from an inability to masticate foods properly. Prehistorically, human teeth also functioned as weapons of aggression and defense as they do presently among the lowver animals. However. man has subsequently developed more efficient weapons Teeth also are sexual symbols as evidenced by their implied virility in the advertising media. Loss of teeth can be equated with loss of virility which is certainly an important psychologi- cal factor in the process of aging. Therefore, the geriatric patient may accent the loss of his teeth, but want them replaced with an esthetically attractive artificial denture. Teeth also are important in speech. Many sounds are de- pendent upon the position of the tongue and lips against the dentition. Yet it is apparent that edentulous patients are not at a loss for words, so this function also should not be overemphasized. In short, teeth have their functions but they are not essential to the longevity of the species in the modern world. It would be a grievous error. however, to view the dentition as a dispensable vestige with little more significance than the appendix. * Reprinted from Geriatrics. Vol. 23. pp. 98-107. August 1968.

PU.Sa4.822 Diseases of the dentition Although many systemic diseases manifest symptoms in the oral cavity, thescience and art of dentistry is mainly concerned with diseases of the dentition,foremost of which are dental caries and pyorrhea. Dental. caries occurs com-monly in children with the eruption of the primary molars. It continuesthroughout life and is the greatest cause of tooth loss up to age 35.3 Periodontaldisturbances also occur early in life, mainly as gingivitis. But gingivitis inchildhood and early adolescence usually is without clinical significance. Withthe increased deposition on teeth of calivary calculus that occurs during lateadolescence and continues throughout life, the gingiva become irritated anderoded. If the calculus is not removed periodically, irreversible degenerativechanges in the periodontium-gingival and bony tissues and the periodontalattachment-may occur which lead to loosening and eventual loss of the teeth. I Pelton. W. J., Pennell, E. EI., and Druzina, A.: Tooth morbidity experience of adults.J. Amer. dent. Ass. 49 :439, 1954.762 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS This process-pyorrhea-is the greatest cause of tooth loss after the third decade of life.4Most pyorrhea is produced by the physical presence of calculus. It is therefore preventable by early and periodic removal of calculus. Another form of pyorrhea, periodontosis, appears to be unrelated to calculus deposits. It is characterized by rapid dissolution of the dental alveolar bone, the cause of which is unknown, in contrast to the slow progress of calculus-induced pyorrhea. Fortunately, periodontosis is a relatively uncommon dental disease. Many other diseases of the hard and soft tissues of the mouth, including cysts and carcinomas, affect the teeth and other oral structures.5Functional conditions such as malocclusion, temperomandibular joint disturbances, and pernicious habits involving the tongue, lips, and swallowing process may require corrective dental treatment. Also, traumatic injuries and fractures of the jaws come under the purview of the dental profession. Systemic diseases such as blood dyscrasias, diabetes, and epilepsy under Dilantin\u00ae therapy commonly cause inflammation and hypertrophy of the periodontal tissues. Avitaminosis, a frequent occurrence in the aged. may be associated with cheilosis. Also, individuals suffering from vitamin deficiencies as well as those who have recently completed antibiotic therapy may be more susceptible to acute and chronic monilial infections. Localized diseases of the periodontium, such as trench mouth and dental abscesses, may produce general- ized systemic infection which is characterized by fever and, if untreated, septi- cemia. Dental extractions or even gingival curettage-cleaning transient bacteremias which can cause subacute bacterial endocarditis in those patients with a history of heart damage due to rheumatic fever. While some dental diseases occur more commonly at different ages in life, few can be considered age-specific. However, physiological and functional changes occur with aging that may affect the course and the success of dental treatment. The oral mucosal lining tends to become thinner and less resilient and thereby more susceptible to pressure ulceration from artificial dentures. Salivary flow may decrease, causing dryness of the mouth which makes denture retention more difficult. The enamel of teeth may be worn off the occlusal and buccal surfaces, creating sensitivities and greater susceptibility to dental caries. The temperoman- dibular joint is subject to wear, especially the articulating disc. Also, decrease in vertical dimension, the distance separating the mandible from the maxilla, occurs with loss or excessive wear of teeth. The resultant change in the articulation of the mandible may be accompanied by temperomandibular joint pain and, in extreme cases, impairment of hearing. When teeth are lost, the alveolar bone forming the supporting ridges for dentures is gradually resorbed. Thus the elderly patient's jaws frequently present flat ridges that are inadequate for the stabilization of artificial dentures. Of particular interest to physicians caring for geriatric patients is the \"theory of focal infection\" as it pertains to the teeth. A few decades ago it was not uncommon to have physicians and dentists recommend the removal of suspicious teeth in the hope of curing rheumatism and arthritis. But it has long since been demonstrated that asymptomatic teeth, including those that are nonvital or have been devitalized by root canal therapy, do not serve as foci of infection. Therefore, teeth should only be removed for sound dental reasons and not on the presumptive hope that cures for systemic diseases will be effected.8 Prevention and treatment The most common dental diseases of caries and pyorrhea cannot be entirely prevented. However, the incidence of dental caries can be reduced by 60% through the fluoridation of public water supplies.9A further decrease can be effected by the reduction in the consumption of refined carbohydrates'mUnfor- 'Peridontal Disease in Adults.

Lippincott, 1958.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 763 tunately the food industry caters to the \"sweet tooth\" of the populace as well as playing a determining role through advertising in the development of dietaryhabits. Although the modern diet may be nutritionally adequate, from the dental viewpoint it is too soft to provide proper stimulation of the gingival tissues during mastication and serves as a feeding ground for the complex bacterial and chemical decay process. Nonetheless, dental caries can be effectively treated by the removal of the areas of decay and the restoration of the teeth with fillings and crowns. Teeth need seldom be lost due to this disease. Pyorrhea is also largely preventable, as mentioned, through the semiannual orannual removal of calculus deposits on the teeth. Relatively sophisticated tech- niques have also been developed for the preservation of teeth that have already experienced loss of supporting alveolar bone. But as yet, there is no public health method comparable to fluoridation for the prevention of pyorrhea. Dental prophylaxis must therefore be carried on throughout the life of the individual. Some problems of dentures Given proper periodic dental care, there is little reason for the geriatric patient to lose his teeth. Yet, in the United States perhaps only 10% of the population receives adequate care.\" For example, in any one year it Is estimated that only 40% of the population visits the dentist at least once, most likely for the removal of teeth. Half the population by age 65 has or needs artificial dentures. But far from having solved the problem, the average denture patient has a sore mouth, dissatisfaction with his chewing capacity, and the fear that his teeth will come loose at embarrassing moments. Many elderly patients have given up chewing with their dentures and use them only for appearance in social situations. Al- though temporary stability may be obtained by use of denture adhesives, it is very short-lived and denture wearers find these powders and pastes literally distasteful. It is debatable if there is such a thing as a well-fitting denture. although max- illary dentures are more easily retained and provide considerably more satisfac-tion than mandibular dentures. The reason is that both dentures \"float\" in the mouth during function, and the mouth is in constant movement even during sleep. Nevertheless, there are definite criteria for the proper fit of dentures, such as the maximum area of the base support that the tissues and musculature can tolerate, the correct centric relationship of the opposing dentures. and the propervertical dimension. Even though these criteria are met, the success of dentures is still dependent upon the individual's adaptive capacity. Generally, the youngerthe patient. the more successful the adaptation. The subjective element is so great that even poorly fitting dentures can be worn successfully by some individ- uals, whereas many have the greatest difficulty with dentures that satisfy all known functional requirements. As the patient ages, it is important that radical changes not be introduced by the dentist simply to satisfy the textbook criteria. This error most frequently occurs when an elderly patient decides to have a new set of dentures because the teeth are cracked or the denture base looks unattractive, although he is other- wise satisfied with the fit of his ten- or twenty-year-old plates. In these cases thepatient's separation of maxilla and mandible has decreased. He has what dentists call a \"closed bite.\" It may be the result of an original error in which the arti- ficial teeth were too short or the alveolar ridges may have been resorbed under the dentures. Proper vertical dimension is itself an arbitrary concept which mayvary as much as five millimeters without violating the principles of sound denture construction. The over-enthusiastic dentist may decide to restore thegeriatric patient to a 35-year-old level of vertical dimension to improve his profile and make his teeth show more. While this procedure is most likely indicated for the 50- or 60-year-old patient, it is hazardous for the very elderly who have accommodated successfully to the gradual closing of their bites. Ill-fitting dentures can represent hazards other than occasional sores andgeneralized dissatisfaction. In particular, constant irritation of the oral mucosa can produce cancerous lesions. These lesions occur most commonly along the periphery of the dentures. In the early stages they cannot be distinguished from pressure sores. However, if the ulcerations persist beyond ten days or two weeksafter mechanical relief or adjustment of the denture, biopsy examination is indi- \"This is based on the fact that \"only one-tenth of the population accounted for abouttwo-thirds of all dental visits.\" (Blue Cross Reports. Dental expenditures. utilization. andprepayment. Sept.-Oct. 1963) But whether the consumption of the bulk of dental servicesreally Implies \"adequate\" care must remain moot until adequacy Is defined and measured.764 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS cated. With or without sores or dissatisfaction, most dentures require rebasing or replacement about every five years to readapt them to changes in the support- ing tissues caused by alveolar resorption. It is generally believed that less alveolar resorption occurs under well-fitting dentures. Alternate choices For the most part, the upper dentures are easily constructed and well tolerated by patients. When there are only a few sound maxillary teeth left few dentists would hesitate to recommend a complete denture. Such is not the case for mandib- ular dentures. In contrast to the board, relatively immobile maxilla which pro- vides a wide base of support for denture stability and retention, the mandible forms a narrow horseshoe shape. In addition, the peripheral mucobuccal fold of the mandible is far more active as a consequence of the greater mobility of the mandible. The lower lip, the tongue, and the sublingual musculature are in vigor- ous motion during speech and swallowing. The effect of these actions is to unseat the lower denture. For this reason, mandibular teeth should be maintained as long as possible to provide anchors of retention for partial dentures. Even if there are only two cuspids remaining they should be retained rather than re- moved for a complete lower denture. The reason for citing the cuspids is that they tend to be least susceptible to pyorrhea by virtue of their long, strong roots, and are more likely to be present in the geriatric patient. In this brief review of the major dental problems of the aged, mention of fixed bridges has been omitted. Certainly, fixed bridges are indicated for the replace- ment of natural teeth wherever possible. When too many teeth have been lost or the cost of fixed restorations is prohibitive, partial dentures should be con- structed. Full dentures are a last resort, and are the consequence of oral failure.\" When the cost may run into thousands of dollars, alternative treatment plans rather than full dentures are frequently little more than exercises in fantasy. Localcs of treatment-the private office and the hospital The preceding discussion is intended to provide a broad background of common conditions that are applicable to the population at any age and to indicate that the main geriadontic problems result not from aging but from neglect. Responsi- bility for this neglect falls upon the public which readily accedes to its conse- quences. But it must be shared also by the dental profession which has in the past opposed the development of auxiliary manpower and methods of financing care to meet the needs of the population. Only within the.last few years has the profession seriously addressed itself to this problem of auxiliaries, although the level of experimentation is often ludicrous in light of known accomplishments elsewhere.\"3Thus, the vast majority of the population arrives at old age with the complete destruction of its natural dentition despite the fact that the dental profession has the scientific knowledge and technological ability to avoid it. A revolution in our social values is required to overcome this mutilation by consensus. Meanwhile, there are some practical considerations that are of special concern for the dental care of the geriatric patient. Foremost of these is his state of ambu- lation. Dental care is most effectively performed in a well-equipped office. The responsibility of the physician is to ensure that his patients seek and receive necessary dental care, especially with regard to elimination of present and poten- tial oral infections. The relatively well ambulatory patient is easily referred to a private dentist, provided he can afford treatment. The nonambulatory patient presents a special problem. Since many of these patients have been, will be, or are hospitalized, they should receive needed care before being discharged from the hospital. Therefore, every hospital should have completely equipped and staffed dental facilities.14All patients should be required to have a dental ex- amination and necessary treatment should be provided before discharge to those who are unlikely to receive it afterwards because of anticipated immobility. For the geriatric patient, the treatment most likely needed is removal of infected teeth. It would be easier and safer to perform this minor surgery in a hospital rather than to await an acute toothache or infection in a nursing home that lacks adequate facilities.15Also, the hospital concentrates patients, thereby making best 12 Friedman.

Programs have been developed for the provision of carein nursing homes and the patient's home.\"\" 17 I consider them inordinately waste- ful of dental manpower which is already in short supply.For dental care to be incorporated into hospital practice the physician mustpay more than lip service to the concept of treating the whole patient ratherthan the admitting diagnosis. Many hospital staffs govern themselves accord-ing to the by-laws of the medical and dental staff. But even in those hospitalsthat have rather highly developed medical staff organizations, dental participa-tion is most often limited to oral surgeons with the consequent emphasis on maxillofacial and interoral surgery rather than preventive and restorative dentistry. More recently, a number of hospitals have instituted well-equippeddental facilities for restorative treatment of patients under general anesthesia, especially those suffering from cerebral palsy and similar disabilities. However, only a few of the larger governmental hospitals such as those operated by the Veterans Administration include normal dental care in the total medical care program. In these hospitals newly admitted patients are screened by dentists and care is provided where it is deemed supportive of the general medical con- dition. For example, a long-term diabetic patient may receive dental treatment whereas a short-stay patient with a limb fracture may not. For this approach to be effective, general dental practitioners and prosthodontists must be present on the hospital staff and directly involved in diagnosis and treatment. The manpower problem Concerning the larger issue of dental manpower and especially the creationand expansion of duties of auxiliaries, the medical profession's passive attitude toward dentistry requires alteration. Dentistry is, after all, a specialty of medi- cine. What is true of medicine generally therefore is applicable to dentistry. As a corollary, the orthopedist is not expected to construct and fit prosthetic appliances or to personally train the patient in their use. Put another way, state medical practice acts do not specifically prohibit medical technicians from look- ing at, much less touching, patients. Yet, that is the status of dental practice legislation in this country. The law specifically prohibits dental techniciansand assistants from taking impressions and fitting dentures. Laboratory tech- nicians are even prohibited from taking the shade of the patient's natural teeth in order to match the color of prosthetic appliances, a process that requires visual but hardly physical contact. In order to remove tartar and stains fromthe exposed surfaces of the teeth, one must be either a licensed dentist or hygienist. There are historical reasons for these restrictions, but abuses of the past do not necessarily form a rational basis for present practices. Certainlyit is not proposed that inadequately trained or unlicensed individuals be allowed to practice dentistry, rather that more rational practices be adopted in accordwith present needs. Given adequate organization and surveillance controls, lesser trained auxiliaries can perform many dental tasks without jeopardy to the public. Indeed, this has been the experience of medical practice and there is no reason why it should not be applied to the practice of dentistry. Without this application there is absolutely no possibility of preventing the destruction ofthe natural dentition with or without the consensus of the public. As stated previously, the American dental profession no longer opposes the expansion of the role of auxiliaries as such. It is even engaged in experiments todetermine the feasible parameters of this expansion. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are being expended to discover if dental assistants can take study impres- sions as well as dentists or place amalgam in prepared cavities.\" Many elements of the profession consider these experiments audacious if not outrageous, whereas others cite them as indicative of a progressive posture. However, these experi- ments are little more than simple demonstrations of the obvious, which has been known for nearly half a century. To be specific, New Zealand has been training school dental nurses since the 1920s.'9These nurses are trained in a two-year course to perform fillings, extractions, and other procedures for children. They work independently in dental operatories located in public schools. Parentheti- 10 Douglas, B. L.: Dental care for the special patient (handicapped-chronically ill-aged.) Practical Dent.

Thus, New Zealand's school dental nurse program has not advanced internally much beyond its original de- sign. But it has demonstrated that lesser trained auxiliaries can effectively per- form many dental procedures far more sophisticated than those presently under consideration in the United States. Other countries are responding to the dental needs of their populations by adopting the New Zealand approach.20While most of these countries are desig- nated as underdeveloped such as Ceylon, Singapore, Malaya, Thailand. Indonesia, and Ghana, it is also being adopted in more advanced nations such as Great Britain and Canada. However, by dental standards, all nations are underdevel- oped and it is only a matter of time before the New Zealand pattern is adopted universally. Concerning the major needs of the geriatric population, such as den- tures, Canada already has legalized denturists who are specially trained and licensed technicians. The future What do these developments portend for the future of dental practice? With the expansion of the numbers and duties of auxiliaries, dentists will be relieved of the vast bulk of simple mechanical procedures that presently consume most of their time. They will be able to devote themselves to the practice of dental medi- cine. Problems of growth and development of the oral structures will receive greater attention, resulting in more preventive and interceptive treatment. Oral and maxillofacial surgery, advanced periodontal therapy, and orthodontics will most certainly remain the prerogatives of the dentist. Prosthodontics will be more concerned with the correction of oral clefts, traumatic injuries, and defects caused by cancer than with the construction of dentures for edentulous persons. As a consequence of these developments, more dentists will practice in hospitals. Also, more group practice clinics will be developed which employ auxiliaries to perform the simpler tasks under the direction and surveillance of fully qualified dentists. In view of these prognostications, it is possible that the current concern over the shortage of dentists is misplaced. What may be needed is not more dentists per unit of population but more and better trained dental auxiliaries. Otherwise we must place our hope in the discovery of immunization against dental decay and pyorrhea, or else consign the majority of the population to the eventuality of edentulism. Though hope springs eternal, the stuff of progress is pragmatism. ITEM 6: STATEMENT OF SEYMOUR E. HARRIS, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO October 28, 1968. In reply to Senator Williams invitation, I comment on some aspects of the health problems of the aged. MEDICARE Of course Medicare greatly improves and extends health services for the old. The net effect of Medicare is to pour several billion dollars into the pool of medi- cal resources available to the old. In 1968, thru OASDHI (health insurance for the aged) $4\u00bd/2 billion in benefits were received. (S.S.B., September, 1968, p. 3). Before the introduction of Medicare, the old accounted for about 9 per cent of the population and considerably more than 9 per cent of medical costs; but also obtained considerably less than the medical needs of this age group. Should, for example, $5 billion additional be made available to the old, then total medical resources for this age group might well double. DRAIN OF HOSPITALS Unfortunately the net gain to the elderly is much less than might be suggested by the additional funds thus being made available under Medicare. One reason for this result is the diversion of part of the additional funds to the hospitals which use medicare as a means of improving their financial position. The disposi- tion now is to increase charges for the elderly and thus reduce the excess of hospital costs over charges. The additional resources thus obtained by the hos- 20 Grayland, E.: The Colombo plan brings dental health to Asia's children. CAL Magazine 29 : 8, 1967.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 767 pitals reduce the net gains of the elderly. Medicare has in part become an insti-tution for making hospitals financially viable. T'he availability of several billions additional per year also tends to increasecosts of operating hospitals and thus cuts gains of the elderly. With hospital costsrising by about 15 per cent a year, the recovery of additional costs is facilitatedby payments under Medicare. But the new resources made available also tendsto make possible large rises in pay of hospital workers. The Somers in their recent book on \"Medicare and the Hospitals\" have raiseda vital question. Hospitals are guaranteed recovery of costs. With such guaran-tees and with no other restraints, are not costs likely to rise at an unacceptablerate? Indeed, the major reason for the current rise in hospital costs may well bethe low pay of the past which is not easily tolerated in a full employment econ-omy. But surely the inflow of medicare cash facilitates the rise in pay of hospitalhelp. The new resources, however, do not merely facilitate increases in payscale; they also assure a greater supply of labor for the hospital and hence tothat extent facilitates improved service. Without the increase of funds and theaccompanying rise of pay scales, the hospitals would be confronted with seriousshortages of labor in a full employment economy.Doctors and other health personnel necessarily profit from the increased cashthus being injected into the system. The large rise of income for physicians post-medicare is explained to a considerable extent by the billions being poured intomedicare. The physicians' incomes rise as with slow response of supply of doctorsto rising demand, incomes automatically rise. On top of that many physiciansseek higher rate of pay by pushing for direct reimbursement by patients ratherthan obtaining compensation thru the intermediary of the hospital. Hence withthe inflow of medicare dollars, the struggle between hospitals and physicians fora greater share of the medical dollar is intensified. DOCTORS' COMPENSATION In the discussion of recent advances in medical costs, there is some dispositionto adhere to the position that medicare has not improved the economic status ofthe doctors.' I do not subscribe to this interpretation. The rise of costs for service of physi-cians has recently been much greater than in the premedicare period. Senator Robert Kennedy commented thus on the costs of doctors' services pre-and post-medicare: 2 \"There have been some studies made in the State. I don't want to take toomuch time, we have a lot of witnesses, but here is an article from Watertown which shows that an office call before the passage of this legislation was $3;afterwards it was $6.50; a home call, $4; afterwards $8; special service, initialvisit, $7.50; after the passage of the bill, it was $20.\" This excess is not by any means explained merely by the general inflationarytrends. Nor am I convinced by the argument that costs of physicians' servicesrecently have not risen more than the costs of services generally relevant especially for the younger population. The crucial point is that billions of addi-tional funds are being channelled into the medical stream. Doctors' incomeaccounts for about one quarter of the total medical income. In view of thisfact and the large rise of costs per doctors' services, and of physicians' incomeand the inelastic supply of doctors, the only conclusion I can draw is thatmedicare has indeed raised costs of physicians' services, and the income ofphysicians. That Medicare operates through fee for services is also unfortunate. Thismethod of payment induces excessive services. The costs are compounded be-cause of the absence of adequate quality control. Another inflationary factor derives from the opposition of doctors to assign-ments. By refusing assignment (fees based on current practice) the doctorcan impose much higher fees and with the patient recovering only part fromthe government. DENTISTRY Improved economic status has accrued not only to physicians and hospitalpersonnel. Medicare has especially been effective in stimulating services previ-ously greatly under-supplied. One significant area has been dentistry. The pro- 1 Senate Hearings, Costs and Delivery of Health Services to Americans, 1968, pp. 37T-71. 2 Costs and Delivery of Health Services to Older Americans, Hearings, Subcommitteeon Aging of U.S. Senate, p. 371.768 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS vision of medicare dollars has helped correct the deficiencies of dental services. One result has been very large rises of dental incomes, with incomes of a dentist in some instances rising to about $100,000. (The difficulties of covering dental services under insurance accounted to some extent for the under-provision- ing of this type of service.) THE RELEVANCE OF INSURANCE Older citizens have gained less from medicare than may be assumed from the amounts received for medicare because the increased availability of insurance in itself tends to waste resources. The insured tend to consume service not needed just because they are insured. I hold this position though Mr. James Brindle, head of the Health Insurance Plan of N.Y.C., found no increase in services in response to additional insurance. The tendency is to consume more whether needed or not, just because insurance becomes available. The purveyors of medical services, moreover, also contribute to wastage as they increase charges to patients who are insured. They are more disposed to raise fees when insur- ance increasingly carries the burdens. PRESSURE ON RESOURCES In the period during which medicare was under discussion, the fear was fre- quently expressed that the introduction of Medicare would result in serious pressures on medical services and especially shortages of hospital space. So far it seems that the concern was excessive. Despite Medicare, despite medic- aid which also inserted large additional funds into medicine and despite the unusual prosperity, the pressure on limited facilities brought no serious bottle- necks. The explanation of this outcome so far, lies in the increased use of nursing homes-though far from a satisfactory expansion in this area-the large excess capacity available before Medicare, and the improved planning of hospital use made possible by Hill-Burton and Medicare: \"During the first year of operation, the older people of the nation received from 12-20 per cent more inpatient hos- pital services than in previous years; and they received these services without the over-crowding of facilities which some people had predicted.\" 3 But it is well to note that further extension of medical services-e.g. more services and extensions of medicare to younger age groups and further growth of insurance-all of these together may well raise demand vis a vis supply to an uncomfortable level. Any special measures to improve medical services to minor- ity groups would further increase pressures. The net balance between supply and demand will depend on a number of other factors. In the last few years medical outlays have been rising by about $4 billion a year, or around 8 per cent. A major part of this increase is explicable by the rise of prices. But this rise of prices is not exactly independent of the rising de- mand for medical services. COMPETITION FOR FUNDS The adequacy of medical services will also depend on the developments in the economy and other (related) segments. Thus educational outlays (also roughly $50 billion a year) are also increasing at about $4 billion a year. Competition for construction, for tax dollars and services are significant in these two areas. Should the unusual prosperity of the last 8 years continue, then excess capacity of plant and personnel will be at a minimum and additional demands for services will be reflected more in rising prices than in rising supplies. THE RELEVANCE OF VIETNAM Much will depend also on Vietnam. Should the war end, it is estimated by the top authorities in Washington that from $10 to $30 billion additional would be available for welfare outlays-the exact amount depends on what would be done with the (say) $15 billion saved in military and $15 billion out of additional taxes as incomes rise. It is conceivable that with $15 billion available $5 billion would go for improving our cities, $5 billion for anti-poverty programs and $5 billion for welfare inclusive of medicine and education. It is clear that pressures on medical markets would intensify, the larger the peace dividend, and the less spent on other welfare programs. | 1st Annual Report of Medicare, 1968, p. 7.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 769 TIHE RELEVANCE OF THE NEGATIVE INCOME TAX On the assumption that substantial expenditures will be made on behalf ofthe minority groups, we should examine the effects on the medical segment ofour economy. There is increasing support for an anti-poverty program, whichwould be based on a negative income tax-i.e. guaranteeing all families a $3,000income. It has been estimated that the cost would be $900 per capita, or about$200 billion. This is clearly out. But a subsidy to the roughly 10 million familieswith income below the poverty line would cost from $7-$49 billion.4 For our problem, the significant point would be that recourse to a negativeincome tax, that is payments to the poor to get their income up to a minimumlevel, might well have the result of reducing outlays for medicine. The negativeincome tax generally suggests that the poor would get cash and they would deter-mine how to spend it. Would not the result then be less spending by govern-ment on medicine, housing, etc. and more by the poor on television, sports, cloth-ing, furniture, etc.? MORE DOCTORS OR IMPROVED ORGANIZATION? In the New York hearings on Costs and Delivery of Health Services to OlderAmericans, the official witnesses leaned towards an explanation of requiredtherapy that stressed especially improved organization, e.g. neighborhood healthcenters, rather than an increase in the supply of doctors. These experts doubtedthat it would be possible to entice doctors to move into the low income areas.They are concerned at the large proportion of the population in slum areas notserviced by doctors. Doctors prefer to practice in the high income areas. In theirview, greater production of doctors would not yield a flow of doctors to the poorneighborhoods. The New York experts seemed to argue that the inducement ofgroup practice and salary payments would attract and has attached able youngdoctors. I find it a little difficult to accept this though surely there is some point atwhich the supply of doctors in the affluent areas becomes so large that thedoctors will begin to desert the affluent areas. But it seems to me, we are farfrom this state now. Indeed, the income of doctors is already less in such citiesas New York and Boston than in middle-sized towns. But this is explained inpart by the penchant to practice where standards are high, research facilitiesgood and cultural activities are attractive.The Senators who seemed skeptical of the approach of Dr. H. Brown andothers seemed to lean towards emphasizing the need of increased output of doc-tors rather than improved organization supported by some New York officials.I lean towards the views of the Senators. MINORITY GROUPS, FINANCING MEDICAL EDUCATION An indication of the rising needs of minority groups is given by the HealthService Administration of New York City.'\"Our projections are based on 4,000,000 New Yorkers being Medicaid eligible.While projections indicate no increase in New York City's population over thenext 15 or 20 years, these same projections indicate a continuance of trendsprominent between 1950 and 1960, to wit: an increase in the population of in-dividuals over 65 by 35%, an increase in the population under 15 by 13%, adecrease in the white population by 12%, an increase in the Puerto Rican popula-tion by 149% and an increase in the non-white population by 48%. While continuedincreases in these statistics might not be as great as in the previous decade, itseems fair to assume that New York City will have enough of a shift in thesepopulation groups to offset any changes in Medicaid eligibility which may bepassed by the Congress.\" It is generally agreed that a shortage of physicians prevails and even if in-creased use were made of sub-professionals. One expert would increase the output of physicians from 9,000 to 20,000. Hewould have the Federal Government finance the entire costs of $5.000 per phy-sician to the School, $4,000 for upkeep of the student, and the additional con- 'Tobin, Pechman and Mieszkowski, 18 a Negative Income Tam, Practical? 1967. These are rough figures, with the estimated cost related to size of basic allowance, and the tax imposed on recipient on income beyond basic amount, and also savings on welfare programs. I Op. Cit., p. 375.770 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS .struction costs. The total costs over a 10 year period would be about $5 billion. He would finance the upkeep of the student because now students predominately come from high income groups.' Though I am sympathetic with the general position, I find it difficult to accept this additional burden on the Federal budget at the present time. The case would be stronger in the post-Vietnam era. But even then one may raise the following issues. Why subsidize the medical student to this extent and not introduce similar programs for scientists and teachers who are equally scarce? The case is especially weak for the future physician because the income of the practising physician is now $30,000 to $40,000 a year. Would it not be more equitable to finance the future doctors by a loan program? The physician would then finance it by paying a percentage of his life time income depending upon the amounts borrowed during his training period. So long as incomes are high the doctor will pay proportionately more. This program could easily be integrated with a loan program for all college students and financed over the life time of the students. In this manner, society will finance part of the cost of training in that as incomes rise as a result of inflation or rising productivity, the financial burden on the doctor will be reduced and society's contribution will be increased. Should doctors' income rise as much as incomes of all members of the labor market-doctor's income have been going up more rapidly-then in 50 years we might expect doctors' income to rise to about $300,000 a year. Such a loan program would enable all students of quality to get a medical edu- cation, to choose any school where he is acceptable, and he would finance his education over his active life instead of being burdened exclusively during his years of training. ADEQUACY OF MEDICARE Medicare of course marks a great advance: in funds going into medicare; in providing additional help to the group that needed it most-the aged; in accepting the principle that compulsory health insurance for a large segment of the population. But there are still many reservations. Under Medicare, benefits are still restricted in the payment of doctors' bills. Expert estimate coverage-once allowance is made for corridors, co-insurance, exclusion of dental and other benefits-at only about 50 per cent of doctors' services. Moreover, the doctors seek to avoid assignments, which means higher charges to the patient, and are frequently criticized for charging in excess of usual charges. To get an in- crease, a requirement of Blue Shield of New York is that the rise apply to all patients, not merely those covered under Medicare. Much unhappiness also prevails because the doctor is compensated on the basis of fees for services thus increasing the difficulties of those (notably hospitals and group plans) where payment is on a capitation basis. Yet something can be said for the limited coverage and benefits. Had coverage been complete, the pressure on resources would have been much greater, and prices risen even more than they have. Moreover, under these more generous conditions, the pressure for universal compulsory insurance would have increased greatly. Ultimately the country is likely to accept com- pulsory insurance. But there is something to be said for experimentation on a restricted basis at first and also for the avoidance of another inflationary pressure in the midst of general inflationary trends. Medical shortages and bottlenecks have contributed much to the inflation of the last few years. The contributions to inflation comes from Medicaid, and private insurance as well as Medicare. The price of medical services and especially of hospital services has especially soared. But we should observe that in some areas, the quality of service on the introduction of new and costly procedures raise prices. In part these increases may be described as non-inflationary. That is to say, the quality of services has improved-an offset to higher prices. 6 Dr. Cherkasky pointed out that 50 percent of physicians come from those in the top 12% of income levels.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 771 ITEM 7: LETTER FROM DAVID LITTAUER, M.D., EXECUTIVE DIREC- TOR, CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER, LOS ANGELES, CALIF. NOVEMBER 18, 1968. DEAR SENATOR WILLIAMS: In 1965, before Medicare was available, the Cali- fornia State Department of Public Health studied all admissions for a 6-monthperiod to 35 home health agencies in California. The Bureau of Chronic Diseases has furnished me with the following evaluation of the replies: \"One question on the discharge form asked the private physician. \"Afterobserving this patient in a program of home nursing care would you please answer the following question: If home nursing care had not been available would you have had to: Send the patient to the hospital? Send (or keep) thepatient in a nursing home?\" (For patients referred from a hospital the questionwas: \"Would a longer hospital stay been required?\") A majority of the physi-cians did not see these two choices as alternatives but physicians did indicatethat one out of every five patients would have had to be in a hospital if homenursing services had not been available. One out of every six patients would have been sent to a nursing home. So for over one third of the patients (35.9percent) a much more expensive form of care would have been imperative if these services had not been available to the private physician. \"There was considerable variation in alternate care needed depending uponthe diagnostic condition which brought the patient under care. For example, 35 percent of the cancer patients would have had to be hospitalized and another 14percent would have had to go to a nursing home. Twenty-six percent of thestroke patients would have been sent to nursing homes while an additionalfifteen percent would have been in hospitals. An entirely different picture appears for patients with arthritis where 20 percent would have been sent to nursinghomes and for only 6 percent would a hospital have been the alternative. \"This study was conducted before home health services were made availableunder Medicare and many physicians were not aware of this type of service. Itseems reasonable to assume that early referral of patients was not always made.For example, agencies with liaison nurses in hospitals or some other similararrangements had a much higher percent of their admissions made directly froma hospital. Nine agencies had at least 30 percent of their admissions made di-rectly from a hospital while ten agencies had less than 10 percent of their admis-sions referred directly. Obviously, with a good referral system cases can be evaluated early and sent home as soon as feasible. Home nursing services wouldthen be substituted for more expensive hospital care.\" In 1961 I was project director of a comparative study of 15 home care pro-grams, using the coordinated (comprehensive) home care program of the JewishHospital of Saint Louis, where I was then executive director, as the base. Theanswers to several of the questions posed in your letter are found in the reportof this study, which was published as Monograph #9, Hospital Monograph Series, by American Hospital Association, Chicago, publication no. G164. A copyof this monograph is enclosed. The evaluation of benefits to patients is as validtoday as it was then. I refer you particularly to the Critique (pp. 65-70), whichI hope your staff will extract as a part of my comments as needed.In September, 1967, the Division of Medical Care Administration of the Health Services and Mental Health Administration of the U.S. Public Health Serviceheld an invitational conference on Home Health Agencies after one year of Medicare. I had the privilege of participating in this conference and of col-laborating in the preparation of the final report: \"Home Health Agencies After One Year of Medicare\", published in mid-1968. (Since I have only one copy ofthe report in my possession, I cannot send it, but I am sure copies are availableon application to the appropriate office of the Public Health Service). It was the consensus of the conference group that ways must be found to bringhome health services into the main stream of community health for patients ofall ages and economic levels; home health services should be made a part ofvoluntary individual and group health insurance plans as well as of governmentprograms. Home health services should be included by State and community772 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS planning agencies under the provisions of P.L. 89-749 (Comprehensive Health Services) and P.L. 89-239 (Regional Medical Programs). Both rural and urban areas need networks of home health agencies capable of furnishing comprehensive services. The recommendations of this conference include: Formation of a national organization for Home Health Services to facili- tate continuing communication on a group basis among State agencies, pro- viders of service, fiscal intermediaries and community leaders with the Fed- eral agencies. (In California we recently organized the first state association, California Association of Home Health Agencies, of which I have the honor to be the first President). Representatives of the medical profession should be invited to suggest ways in which physicians can be involved in planning and administering home health agencies. The Social Security Administration should provide analyses of informa- tion that is accumulating regarding kinds of services being used by various types of patients. Task Forces should recommend solutions to specific short-range and long- range problems. The Public Health Service and the Social Security Administration should study home health services on a continuing basis as an appropriate health entity within the health service system. I hope the above.comments will be helpful to the deliberations of the Special Committee on Aging. If I can be of further assistance, please let me know. Sincerely yours, DAVID LITTAUER, M.D.. Executive Director. ITEM 5: QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY THE CHAIRMAN TO DR. GEORGE B. MARKLE, IV. DIPLOMATE OF THE AMERICAN BOARD OF SURGERY 1. What, if any, action by the Federal government would you recommend to reduce the number of unnecessary tests and examinations, thus saving money for both its medical care programs and for their beneficiaries? 2. Is any governmental action on this problem possible without interfering with and overriding the exercise of private medical discretion? 3. Your article seems to infer that utilization review procedures have thus far been ineffective to prevent unnecessary tests and examinations. Is that a valid conclusion? If so, why do you believe utilization review has been ineffective? Can anything be done to make utilization review more effective to prevent unneces- sary procedures? 4. To what extent do you believe the ordering of unnecessary tests and examina- tions is caused by fears of malpractice suits? 'What, if any, solution do you be- lieve there is to this problem? 5. Your article in Medical Economics points out that some physicians defend a liberal policy in ordering tests and examinations on the grounds that they have some value in early detection and prevention of unrelated conditions. To the ex- tent that unnecessary tests cannot be eliminated, what, if anything, do you think can be done so enhance the preventive value of such procedures? (The following reply -was received:) NOVEMBER R, 1968. DEAR SENATOR SMATHERS: W\"here I stand-on the front line of medical care in a moderate sized community-I can give your committee a perspective that will be different from the one you get from medical school deans and big medical cen- ter authorities. These men see all the complicated cases and the rare difficult cases, and really don't appreciate that the great bulk of medical problems are really quite ordinary and can be handled by ordinary means by ordinary doctors on the community level. If doctors would seek to be practical, eve would cut costs considerably. The article you refer to in Medical Economics Sept. 30. was published in slightly changed form in Hospital Physician in June 2S. As I don't have reprints on the former, I enclose a reprint of the letter.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 773 To answer some of your questions:1. The Federal Government probably shouldn t try to rule on the necessity forspecific tests. Conditions vary too widely, and what is necessary or unnecessary istoo controversial in many cases. For example. in some areas, a routine V.D.R.L.(test for Syphilis) is a good thing from a public health point of view. There maybe no more reason to do such a test, however, on a patient admitted with a brokenarm than there would be to do one on any other group, whether in the hospitalor on applying for a drivers license. Generally these routine tests are made obliga-tory by the hospital rules and by the record and utilization committees. Un-doubtedly they are often good, but I would like the attending doctor to decide ifthere is advantage in them, not just as a routine.2 and 3. Too often the value of a particular test or Xray is of such an indi-vidualized consideration that even a utilization committee might argue overit indefinitely. Thus, you can't make hard and fast laws. I suggest that Federalhospitals might be encouraged to drop most of their mandatory routines so thatindividual doctors may omit tests, etc., that have no bearing on the problem.Examples of this are mentioned in my article. On the other hand, use of testswhich might expedite diagnosis and treatment should certainly be permitted solong as they are pertinent and not done just to display the erudition of the doctor.or for simple curiosity. Under research conditions, of course, a lot of tests aredone, not to benefit the patient, but to enhance medical knowledge-this is aspecial situation. 4. A lot of tests and Xrays are ordered more to protect the doctor and thehospital than for the benefit of the patient. Fear of malpractice is behind per-haps half of the Xrays we take in cases of trauma. A doctor by oversight in acareer of 50 years of caring for sprained ankles. for example, can lose in courtmore money than he ever earned in that field. Loss of one life might cost himmore than he earned in a life time of saving lives. It makes one inclined tolimit his practice to safe and sure procedures and even then, to cover himselfin every way possible by documenting everything with Xrays and tests. I haveheard suggestions that malpractice be handled something like compensationcases. The patient, too, could share some of the risk.A related influence towards excessive testing is the trend toward big medicalcenter care. A big medical center is expected to never make a mistake and so theytend to test everything. A private doctor can Xray or test just what he is lookingfor, and then if results are negative, he can call the patient back for anothertest or two. The clinic can't easily do this if the patient lives at a distance fromthat city: hence the tendency to give a battery of tests and Xrays all at once,some of which would be unnecessary if the results of the first few were known atthe time. Both the malpractice threat and the \"have to be perfect\" concept are the re-sult of the rising expectations of the public as well as rising standards amongus doctors. This is good in a way, but fear of overlooking something does defi-nitely increase the use of unnecessary (as far as the patient is concerned) testsand Xrays. .5 As for using tests and Xrays for public health reasons or as preventativemeasures, the restriction is mostly economic. If 200 million Americans hadannual physical exams, Xrays and basic laboratory tests, a lot of good wouldresult, but obviously the cost would be enormous. Medicare couldn't provideroutine complete exams for its millions of elderly without tremendous changesin its financing. There are not enough doctors to do all this anyway. Even if itwere possible. we wouldn't eliminate all disease-probably we would be doinggood in only 10 or 20%. One of the big problems, usually not mentioned in articleson medical planning is that over 50% of patient visits are more concerned withemotionally caused conditions than purely physical ones. I don't see how morefrequent physical exams or tests can help that problem.We can help to educate the public in when to see a doctor and what they cando to prevent illness themselves. The American Cancer's Society's 7 warningsignals of cancer is a very good approach as to the former. I have written abook \"How to Stay Healthy All Your Life\", published by Frederick Fell Inc.,New York, which can help in both these respects. This sort of book could cutdown doctor-patient visits perhaps 20%. Probably 75% of ill health is preventable.I have asked my publisher to send you a complimentary copy. It is not the usualhealth book, and is quite readable.774 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS There are now some ways to do a lot of this testing less expensively. Machines which larger laboratories can afford can now automatically do a dozen different tests on one blood sample that are quite reasonable, and so, even if you are not interested in half of the results, the total cost is fairly cheap. For a long time some hospitals have had miniature X-ray machines that take small films of the chest (a common requirement) as a screening procedure. The use of mobile, free chest X-ray units is standard in some communities, using this inexpensive method, and is a good thing. The biggest variable in medical costs is up to the individual doctor; how he manages each case. I have illustrated this in another article published in Medical Economics, Aug. 5, 1968, \"Spare the Purse and Please the Patient\", a reprint of which I enclose. The savings our profession could manage, if we were all as cost conscious as I am, are enormous, certainly hundreds of millions a year. However, I don't see how you could legislate that certain cases must be done as outpa- tients and others as inpatients, or whether or not to use general anethesia, etc. All we can do here is preach and teach. Some doctors don't have facilities for minor office surgery and some are not confident enough to do anything outside of the hospital atmosphere. Some just weren't trained to do things simply. Again malpractice threats influence some unduly. I think your committee would be interested in a third article published in Medical Economics Sept. 3, 1968, \"The Case for Small Town Specialism\". Re- gional health planners are talking about sending more and more medical cases to big city centers or clinics and de-emuphasizing community care. I refute that concept as being economically catastrophic and medically undesirable. This article describes the problems and how a community hospital really can give excellent care for all but the rare or unusual cases. I am sorry that I am not in a position to supply your committee with mean- ingful statistics. I suspect you have enough of them already. All I can supply is the philosophy of the practicing doctor on the front line of medicine. As I say, spokesmen for medicine are mostly from medical schools or big centers and their view lacks total perspective. My articles and my book may, I hope, give you a different slant. Please feel free to contact me at any time. I am very concerned about the cost of medicine and would be glad to help your committee in any way I can. Sincerely yours, G. B. MARKLE, M.D. [Enclosures] ExHIBIT A: SHOULD HOSPITALS REQUIRE So MANY TESTS? [From Medical Economics. Sept. 30, 1968] Definitely not, says this doctor, who contends that too many hos- pitals are routinely ordering medically unnecessary tests and exami- ations. By reducing the number of such unnecessary tests, he argues, physicians can help to cut the cost of medical care. (By George B. Markle IV, M.D.) Everyone is complaining about the sharp rise in health-care costs these days, but finding ways to reduce those costs is no easy matter. \"Rising costs aren't our responsibility,\" physicians are likely to say. True, most higher costs are due to higher hospital bills, but we physicians do have a lot to say about those bills. I'm not talking about reducing bills by cutting down on unnecessary admis- sions and shortening hospital stays. We're all aware of such important ways of saving the medical dollar, and we're probably doing about as much as we can in that direction. But I don't believe we're doing enough about doing away with med- ically unnecessary examinations and tests when we must admit our patients to hospitals. My hospital's record committee, for example, has just returned some charts to me because physical examinations weren't complete. One chart was that of a young man who had suffered second-degree burns of his back and arms when a can of gasoline exploded. Although the burns were limited, I still hospitalized him for a couple of days to give him open-air-exposure treatment. He'd no other com- plaints, and he told me that he'd been in good health. In fact, he needed only a bit of nursing care and a bed where I could watch him. But the hospital insistedthat he have a complete blood count, a urinalysis, a chest X-ray, and a V.D.R.L. These tests, like the complete physical that I'd omitted were strict hospital policy.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 775 Another patient had two toes crushed by a mine car. He needed bed rest, withelevation of his leg, frequent medication for pain, and observation for possibleinfection or gangrene. Though hospitalization was indicated, I saw no need fora complete examination, since he didn't require a general anesthetic. I didn't do arectal exam, and I ordered no lab work. Of course, the work was done anyway-and I was the recipient of a little billet-doux from the record committee.In a third instance, a little boy fell off a horse and suffered a supracondylar frac-ture that I reduced under a general anethetic and immobilized in plaster. Theboy's mother gave me a negative past history and a negative history for any of hiscurrent problems. So I checked his throat, heart, and lungs, and went to work. Iadmitted him to the hospital because of possible pain, possible ischemia of thearm, and to elevate the arm for a day or two under observation. Since I wrote nolengthy history, I got back the chart with snide remarks to the effect that it hadn'tbeen completed. The lab work, to top things off, had been finished about an hourbefore the boy was discharged, and the lab report was sent to the record roomfor the greater glory of the record committee and the Joint Commission onAccreditation of Hospitals. How often does this sort of thing occur in your hospital? Daily, I'd guess. Thinkof the unnecessary cost to the patient for tests that aren't likely to benefit him!And what about the doctor's time? You can't do a thorough systemic review, pastmedical history, social history, followed up by a complete physical examinationin much less than 30 or 40 minutes. Of course, I'm talking about only the isolatedinjury or the simple complaint. If the patient seems to have other ailments or ifthe diagnosis is obscure in any way, then the execution of a good history andphysical is obviously indicated, and routine lab work plus the needed specific testsand X-rays becomes justified. Granted, we did all these tests and physical exams as a matter of routinewhen we were attending medical school. But, as part of our training, they weredesigned to benefit us as much as the patient.What about annual physical exams? I'm all for them. Suppose that, in the ab-sence of any medical indications for a lot of work-up, the hospitalized patientasks for a complete examination and is willing to pay for it. The doctor incharge should certainly agree to it. He can do the examination either then orlater in his office if that is more convenient. But what if-as sometimes hap-pens-the patient expects his hospital insurance or Medicare to pay for theexam? Health insurers and Medicare don't ordinarily pay for routine annualphysicals, yet in some cases they're unwittingly paying for this extra work whenit isn't medically indicated-all in the name of the record committee, the tradi-tion, and the holy accreditation commission.Many doctors and hospital administrators, I expect, will charge me with advo-cating sloppy medicine. They'll use statistics showing that in some communitiesthe routine V.D.R.L. or other serology tests do pick up an occasional unsuspectedcase of syphilis and that some hospitals do find a few cases of active tuberculosisby routine X-rays. A heart murmur in a child may be picked up, and sometimesthis is a good thing to know, and sometimes not. During physical exams, I some-times find an unsuspected hernia, though the patient would probably have foundit himself soon enough. Well, I'll concede that routine testing has some merit-but only for certaintypes of patients. For example, those with a history of promiscuity probablyshould have a V.D.R.L. whenever you can catch them. Others, particularly heavycigarette smokers, should have chest X-rays often. Elderly people, since they'remore prone to various ills, should be given regular physicals. Last month, for in-stance, I discovered breast cancer in an elderly woman who had been admittedto the hospital for phlebitis.What it boils down to is that all medicine, at best, is a compromise betweenthe ideal and the practical. Ideally, we could pick up more diseases by giving peo-ple physical exams throughout the year. But, practically, we can't advocatethat kind of medicine. If we did an upper G.I. series on all adults annually, wecould find an occasional stomach cancer. But we don't because the yield is toolow to justify the cost of such exams. And how many doctors regularly have sig-moidoscopies done on themselves? Some physicians are just as guilty as hospitals are in overtesting. Ratherthan aim for individual tests, the diagnostician often resorts to a shotgun ap-proach in the hope that some diagnosis will fall in his lap. Testing has become amatter of blindly following routine. Yet any doctor should be able to determinewhen a patient needs a physical exam and specific tests. By using this more selec-776 COSTS OF HEALTH- SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS tive system, we may miss an occasional item of importance, but with the present routine we sometimes do so, anyway. We don't have to follow this routine. When we must hospitalize a patient, we should weigh our reasons for doing so-and resist the hospital's battery-of-tests policy. If the diagnosis is uncertain or if we're suspicious, we should explain to the patient why we must investigate further-and then go ahead and do so. In testing, we ought to be guided by the golden rule, paraphrased thus: Do unto your patient as you would have him do unto you. TOO MUICH TESTING? THE PROS AND CONS At least one physician agrees with the idea that Dr. George B. Markle proposes in the accompanying article. Reduce the expense of a patient's hospitalization by discarding some routine tests and examinations. William A. Nolen, a general surgeon in Litchfield, Minn., would go a step further and eliminate routine lab work entirely. The physician and the patient, says Dr. Nolen, benefit most from lab work that's ordered for a specific purpose. But when it's done routinely, as is often the case, the attending physician probably doesn't even check the report. What if the hospital is strongly opposed to the elimination of this fixed procedure? Then, he says, each doctor could at least determine if his patient needed such tests, instead of making them a necessity by virtue of hospital law. \"Sometimes, in an attempt to prevent an extremely rare disaster,\" Dr. Nolen continues, \"hospitals adopt policies-either voluntarily or because accreditation boards compel them to do so-that aren't statistically valid. Such policies, once they've become routine, are blindly continued and rarely if ever questioned by those who use them. In fact, once adopted, it's almost impossible to modify them. and the tired 'We've always done it this way' comment is usually given as an explanation for their continuance.\" With medical expenses at an all-time high and with medical personnel in short supply, Dr. Nolen concludes, \"it's high time doctors refused to accept such an explanation as adequate for the continuance of illogical and expensive routines.\" A number of other physicians who read a prepublication draft of surgeon Markle's article disagree with his recommendation to do away with routine hos- pital tests. Dr. Charles U. Letourneau, a hospital consultant in Chicago, calls it \"not very good advice. I hope I never fall into his hands !\" Says Forrest P. White, a pediatrician in Norfolk, Va.: \"Dr. MaIrkle has a bone to pick with a record committee that is simply trying to get him to practice good, modern medicine. As a record committee chairman, I can't go along with the examples of 'un- necessary' testing that he cites. As I see it, there's absolutely no excuse for any physician not doing a complete basic testing and physical exam on each of those patients.\" This need for complete care of the patient is emphasized by internist Walter E. O'Donnell of Gloucester, Mass., who writes: \"Dr. Markle apparently feels that his responsibility in the case of the patient with the two crushed toes begins and ends right there. The rest of the patient doesn't seem to come in for much atten- tion unless there's something grossly wrong. Actually, the tests Dr. Markle de- scribes as 'costly and unnecessary' include the simple blood, urine, and chest X-ray package, the actual cost of which is less than $25 and has long since been accepted as a reasonable minimum by most physicians and hospitals.\" Another internist, Alfred P. Ingegno of New York City, points out that \"certain routine tests have been found advisable from bitter experience, and the bitterest experience comes from sloppy routines all too common on surgical services. A minimum of a decent history and physical. plus urine, blood count, blood sugar, and chest X-ray are certainly needed to prevent carefree major surgery on, say, a decompensated diabetic. If only we could get our surgeons to understand the need for such reports! Do they think that 'routine' evaluation of the bloodelotting status in a T. & A. patient is a frivolous procedure? Instances of uncontrolled bleeding after such omissions in the past may give them pause. \"Such 'routine' tests,\" Dr. Ingegno continues, \"are easily done by the staff that's usually available in any well-run hospital. These tests can give valuable information, and their cost is reasonable. I suspect that the major problem is the other way around: not enough indicated tests by attending physicians who as- sume too much.\" The value of low-cost testing is stressed by Irving M. Levitas, director of re- habilitation medicine at Hackensack (N.J.) Hospital. \"When tests are inex- pensive, as they are in mass screening,\" he says, \"they're worth what they cost for case findings. At 10 cents a test, why not have them?\"COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 777 Mass health screening is seen as a solution to the problem by Richard C. Bates,an internist in Lansing, Mich. \"The answer to Dr. Markel's dilemma probablylies in the computerized exam,\" Dr. Bates writes. \"When each citizen goesthrough such a routine yearly, the need for all these expensive hospital testbatteries will largely disappear. But until that time, I think the Joint Com-mission is wise to use the hospital admission as a means to insure a fairlythorough going-over for everyone who is considered sick enough to be hos-pitalized.\" One needless hospital expense that Dr. Markle overlooked, according to CurtisD. Benton, Jr., an ophthalmologist in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is the routinepathology report. \"All surgical specimens,\" Dr. Benton says \"must be sent to thepathologist, who charges $3 to $10 to report that the penny the attending physi-cian removed from a child's throat is 'a coin.' We have to send the pathologistcataracts, foreskins, bullets, and all sorts of obvious foreign bodies. This costsmoney. \"But there's one point that Dr. Markle doesn't mention,\" Dr. Benton con- cludes. \"When certain tests and procedures are considered routine and standardand a physician fails to do them, he won't have a leg to stand on should a lawsuitfollow and the case go to court. Most physicians are willing to go along withsome 'unnecessary tests' for our patients because we can't accept the legal risks of not doing so.\" ExHIBIT B: SPARE THE PURSE AND PLEASE THE PATIENT [From Medical Economics, Aug. 5,1968] Why not do minor operations in your off.ce, instead of a hospital? Use a local, rather than a general anesthetic when it's safe? Givepatients drugs from your sample drawer? The author does theseand other things to help his patients beat the high cost of medical care. (By George B. Markle IV, M.D.) The high cost of medical care today is, like the weather, something thateverybody talks about but nobody does much about-except politicians andbureaucrats busily preparing new rules and restrictions for hospitals, the drugindustry, and the medical profession. I think we doctors had better do somethingabout it-soon. Sure, many of us do make some effort to spare our patients'pocketbooks, but too often we overlook the little ways to same them needlessexpense. Some of the suggestions I'm about to pass along will save only a few dollars.But to many .of our patients, $3 represents the income from one, two, or eventhree hours of work. It may never occur to the affluent doctor that so small asum is worth saving. But it means a lot to a low-income worker, and a doctor'sthoughtlessness can easily multiply the patient's cash outlay manyfold.Let me give you an example. Jim Martinez, a laborer who supports a wifeand four children on the $2 an hour he earns when he has work, came to the office of a colleague one day with a painful abscess in his axilla.' The surgeon,recognizing the need of incision and drainage, admitted him to the local hospitaland scheduled him for surgery the next morning under a general anesthetic.Following hospital policy, he got a routine c.b.c., urinalysis, V.D.R.L., and chestX-ray. That evening the surgeon did a fairly thorough physical exam and dic-tated his findings. The anesthetist talked with him and ordered the usual pre-opmedications. An orderly shaved his axilla and half his thorax and arm.Next morning he was taken to the operating room and anesthetized. The O.R.aide donned sterile gloves, carefully draped off the area with sterile towels, andprepped the axilla, taking about 10 minutes of anesthetic time. Then the doctor,scrubbed and gowned, draped the wound. This required four more sterile towels, a half sheet or two. and a full-sized laparotomy drape. The O.R. nurse hadopened up enough instruments for an appendectomy and the circulating nursewas prepared to supply more. Then came the moment of truth! The doctor stuck a scalpel into the bulgingmass, drained out an ounce of pus, took a culture, and stuffed in a bit of gauze.The anesthetic time was 15 minutes; the operative time one minute. A dressingwas applied and the patient taken to the recovery room and thence to his room.He had a little pain before dismissal and was given a tablet. He was dischargedwith a prescription for $8 worth of an antibiotic. I Armpit.778 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS The surgeon sent Jim a bill for $50-an amount the doctor felt was quite reasonable. Because Jim had no health insurance, the doctor hadn't charged for the first office call nor for the two postoperative visits, and he'd done a history and physical, not to mention the bother of scheduling surgery and going out to the hospital to do it. Jim's bill from the hospital was $140, which the administrator assured him was very reasonable when broken down: routine lab, $13; culture and sensi- O.R. fee, $35. There was a $2 charge for the recovery room. By an odd coincidence, Jim's cousin, Pedro, came to me not long after with an identical abscess in the axilla. I quickly shaved the area, wiped it with alcohol and Merthiolate, and with a very fine needle infiltrated a little 2 per cent procaine. Then, without gowns, gloves, or drapes, I made the same sort of incision and tucked in some gauze with a hemostat. I gave him an injection of long-acting penicillin and half a dozen capsules for pain. I had him return once, and after that he dressed the wound himself a few times-and got well. Pedro's total bidl was $15, against $198 for cousin Jim! It took me only a few minutes, against an hour or two for Jim's doctor. Timewise, I was the better paid, and Pedro was 20 hours ahead of cousin Jim. Thus, No. 1 on my list of ways to save patients money is to do in the office those procedures that can easily bc donie there. Some insecure doctors, I know, insist on hospitalization not for the patient's sake but for their own. They're afraid they might need help in an emergency or become the target of a malpractice suit if anything should go wrong. But it's amazing what you can safely do with a modest little setup. A manual such as \"Surgery of the Ambulatory Patient,\" by L. Kraeer Ferguson (J. B. Lippincott Company), will open your eyes to numerous possibilities. I know many doctors who give pulmonary or other therapies in their offices: many urologists do cystoscopies. You can probably think of more. My second suggestion is, of course, to use a local rather than a general anes- thetic whenever this can readily and safely be done. This not only permits sur- gery in the office, but it will save money and time when the patient needs to be hospitalized. For example, I do ganglion cysts under local in most cases, some- times in the office and sometimes for a hospital outpatient, who is then charged only the O.R. fee. I find that, with a little premedication. all but the most nervous patients can tolerate an arm tourniquet for the half-hour it takes. I've reduced a great many Colles' fractures 2 under local, with or without pre- medication. This is especially convenient when the patient has recently eaten and I don't want to have to return to the hospital several hours later. And, of course, with rare exceptions, local anesthetics are safer than general anes- thetics are. In addition to office and hospital savings, we can materially lighten our pa- tients' expenses at the drugstore. We tend to forget how drug bills can add up, since we habitually douse our own families' minor illnesses out of the sample drawer. Woe to anyone in my family who comes down with a condition that isn't treatable from my sample collection. I just won't allow it! Seriously, though, that sample drawer can serve a good purpose. Perhaps your patient has a temporary diarrhea, a bit of a cold, or a little muscle spasm. You surely have some samples that will get him by. If you do some office procedure or minor surgery that will be painful for a day or two, you can find a few analgesic pills to give him. You might even keep a bottle of them on hand just for such small but frequent demands; there are several good analgesics that don't require nar- cotic accountability. For my very poor patients, I keep and dispense vitamins and iron, too. It costs me almost nothing, and it pleases the patients no end. If a poor patient must continue on a medicine for a long time, why not call his pharmacist and arrange for the patient to get a large supply for just a bit above the wholesale price? This is only one of many good reasons for getting to know your local pharmacists. Most of the pharmacists I know are glad to help in this way-or in other ways they themselves may suggest-for needy cases. Another way we can make the patient's medical dollar go further is to use oral medications instead of injections whenever possible. Most menopausal women get along quite satisfactorily with oral estrogens or stilbestrol instead of injections, and aren't daily oral vitamins really better than a weekly injection? One old doctor I know says, \"Yes, but shots keep the patient coming in regularly, so I can follow him better.\" I happen to know that such patients rarely get past his nurse, who gives practically all those routine shots. 2 Colles' fractures are the common type of wrist fractures of one or both bones.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 779 We also add to medical costs when we don't give our patients credit for or-dinary common sense. Most of them have it, and we can save them money byletting them take some responsibility for their own care. After I've dressed an un-complicated wound a time or two, for example, I let the patient dress it himselfwith only an occasional check by me. I simply tell him that if it should get red or drain, or in any other way look or feel as if it's not progressing well, I'll be glad to see him.If your patient needs some physiotherapy, he may be able to do at least a partof it at home if you or a therapist will show him how. Most doctors have diabetic patients check their own urine, thus saving a lot of visits. Instead of waiting forsuch vague signs as fever blisters or a dry mouth, most patients can learn totake their temperatures so they'll know if they need to see you for a respiratory infection or other condition. Many doctors help chronic patients take some re-sponsibility for their care by giving them appropriate pamphlets or by recom- mending books. One overburdened G.P. has found he can save much of his owntime and his patients' money by preparing and distributing brochures containing his standard instructions on a topic like \"Your Child and You.\" We can save more money for our patients by avoiding \"nuisance\" consultations. I know some specialists who, when treating a fracture, for instance, won't treat the same patient simultaneously for a common cold. Some surgeons won't treata catheter cystitis but will call in a urologist who has better things to do. A little myalgia doesn't require an orthopedist, nor a little anxiety a psychiatrist. When you call in another specialist you put him on the spot. You've made an issue of the problem, and he feels he has to be thorough. So the patient's little sniffle willcost him at least $10, and sometimes a lot more. It shouldn't be beneath our dig-nity to treat the simplest things, even if we don't treat them ordinarily. It's a way to show concern for the patient and his pocketbook, and I've found it's appreciated. When you do refer to a consultant, be sure to tell him whether the patient haslimited means. Since the consultant presumably hopes for more referrals from you, he may be spurred to effect some of the economies I've mentioned and willtry to keep his own fees modest. Remember that time is money, for both you and your patient. If he needs hos-pitalization, make it as brief as possible. Do what work-up you can while he's an outpatient, and get him out of bed and out of the hospital as soon as it's safe. Then get him back to work. Loss of income from not working may be a bigger financial blow to him than the medical costs. Furthermore, mental as well as physical rehabilitation is usually faster when the patient is back trying to leada normal life. Oversolicitous delay can make a patient a semi-invalid for months. Those are just some of the ways I've found to cut medical costs. No doubt you can think of many more. They're not likely to hurt your income because, as I've shown in some examples, your productivity will increase. And who knows, such savings may enable-or even inspire-some otherwise nonpaying patients to pay your fees. ExnIBIT C: MORE WAYS To SAVE YOUR PATIENTS' MONEY [From Medical Economics, Aug. 5, 19681 Among the physicians who read and commented on the preceding article before publication were three MEDICAL ECONOMICS contributing editors. They vol- unteered some cost-cutting tricks of their own. Richard C. Bates, internist in Lansing, Mich., is down on medical tubes. He writes: \"Avoidance of tubes of all sorts-I.V., nasal oxygen, and catheters- not only permits the patient more freedom and comfort, but it cuts costs. I'd guess that over half the cases with such tubes that I see are being treated unnecessarily. When a patient is dehydrated and able to take oral fluids but won't. I give him a teaspoon of salt out of the shaker. For each teaspoon ofsalt he takes, he'll crave two glasses of water, which win give him the equivalent of 500 cc. of normal saline I.V. Taken intravenously, that would cost him $5.', Forrest P. White, pediatrician in Norfolk, Va., writes: \"When I prescribe clubfoot shoes and a Denis Browne splint for an infant, I have the motherbring the whole apparatus to me when the baby has outgrown it. She's usually glad to sell it for about 60 per cent of what she paid. So when the next baby with the same condition and shoe size comes in, I offer the used shoes780 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS and brace to that mother. If she accepts, she writes out a check to the first mother, and we mail it. The transaction never goes through our books; I'm just an unpaid middleman. Both mothers are happy-the first because she got some of her money back, the second because she got something she needed at a substantial discount. And when her time comes, she'll probably be able to sell the apparatus for 60 per cent of what she paid for it.\" Curtis D. Benton Jr., ophthalmologist and pediatric otolaryngologist in Fort Lauderdale, also passes along certain temporary appliances from patient to patient, such as plastic shields to wear after eye surgery. But Dr. Benton's chief cost-cutting enthusiasm is for reducing the time that his younger patients spend in the hospital for T. & As. \"Last year.\" he writes, \"my surgical patients were spared the expense and inconvenience of 300 unnecessary days-or more pre- cisely, nights-in hospital beds. Most hospitals have regulations requiring pa- tients scheduled for elective surgery to be admitted the night before their opera- tion. But the period of hosptialization for T. & A.'s on children under 14 in this community has been cut to just 24 hours. \"We've been able to accomplish this by pre-admission preparation. When surgery is scheduled, the history and physical are done in the office. All neces- sary lab work is done in the hospital O.P.D. the day before the operation. Pre-op and post-up orders, plus the typed examination results, are in the hands of the admitting clerk when the child arrives at 6 A.M., with empty stomach and eyes wider than his mother's. Johnny goes straight to the children's ward, gets his sedative shot, and is on the operating table by 7:30 A.M., before he has the time to start thinking and sprout nervous second thoughts. \"I haven't yet convinced the hospital authorities that the same procedure would work just as well with adults. But my 300 younger patients last year were saved about $10,000 in hospital costs by not spending an unnecessary and probably sleepless night in the hospital awaiting surgery the following ITEM 9: MATERIAL SUBMITTED BY DR. RUSSELL B. ROTH, VICE- SPEAKER, HOUSE OF DELEGATES, AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIA- TION ExHmrr A.: THE PHYSICIAN AS A GUARDIAN OF HEALTH CARE COSTS (By Russell B. Roth, M.D.) The concept of the physician as a guardian of anything other than the health and immediate best interests of his patient is, I believe, a relatively modern development. Certainly in those less turbulent Oslerian days at the turn of the century there were at best only minimal and incidental ways in which the physician was called upon to dilute his concern for his patients with con- sideration for the community, for hospitals, for third party payors, for gov- ernment, or for the tax-paying public. Times have clearly changed. Janus, the God of gates and doorways, needed only two faces-for looking in and looking out. The physician today, in his role of guardian, needs to be more Hydra-headed in order to keep primary focus on his patient, while casting a wary eye on the hospital to be sure it is not over-utilized, on the insurance company to be sure it is not over-charged, on the community to be sure it is well serviced, and on Medicare and the rest of the tax-financed programs to be sure they are not abused. Nonetheless, it is the thesis of my presentation that the competent, ethical physician is indeed the only able guardian of the public interest in the area of consumer expenditure for medical care. As an aside, I should note that, despite my published title, I do -not intend to deal with Health Care Costs, since, in the language of the economist \"cost\" is overwhelmingly a matter of the price-tag on labor, materials, supplies, utilities-elements generally apart from the in- fluence or control of physicians. The area of physician concern, quite obviously, is that in which he influences expenditures by or on behalf of his patient for the goods and services of the Medical Care Industry. It is important to recognize that the guardianship to be exercised by physicians is one dealing chiefly with specific services involved in individual cases. It is concerned with professional medical decision making. Is it necessary to hospi- talize this patient? Do we need extensive laboratory and X-ray studies? How about private-duty special nursing care? What medications will do the job? IsCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 781 surgery indicated? These are the decisions that translate into dollars-into manydollars per case, and these are decisions which can be made only by physicians.Beyond this, of course, the physician has full responsibility for his own clients,and we will come back to this in due course, since it is a highly publicized issueat this point in history. The preponderant share of the medical care dollar, how-ever, is not paid to the physician-it is paid for the goods and services which herecommends. It follows that this is the area of greater economic significance. Inthe $4.6 billion spent for Medicare in 1967, only 25% went for Part B paymentsto physicians. It is worth contemplating for a few moments the track record of governmentas a guardian of the public pocket book. The chief and overwhelming distinctionof government at the Federal level has been its unbridled enthusiasm for spend-ing. For example, since 1961 the Gross National Product has increased 49%.During this time consumer spending increased 46%lo and Business spending 47%,but government spending went up 63%, and if one considers only non-militaryspending it went up 77%. The appropriations of Congress and of most Statelegislatures scarcely bear testimony to a philosophy of frugality. It is govern-ment which in effect has written the blank check for Medical Care and must lookto someone else to fill in the amount. It is in large part this abundance of gov-ernmental dollars chasing after scarce services that has created the problem.In *the field of direct patient care government has long operated the world'slargest hospital-medical-surgical program, in the Veterans Administration. Manykind things have been said about V.A. Hospitals, the quality of care, and therole they have come to play in teaching and research, but these compliments havenot included any citations for economy and efficiency. Quite to the contrary therehave been many allegations that when the government has been in completecontrol average patient stays for comparable illnesses are distinctly longer thanin community general hospitals, that physician productivity is substantially lessin terms of patients per doctor and in physician working hours per week. TlheV.A. Hospital System can be compared to a vast closed panel group practiceplan, with prepayment of a sort. I have not heard that anyone has seriouslychampioned the fiscal feasibility of extending this type of care to the entirepopulation. One could cite other evidence of the fact that government has not pioneeredin economy in medical care, but in addition government, through its democraticprocesses too often stands as a threat to quality of care as well. Perhaps youhave seen the news stories about the Commissioner of Health in CattaraugusCounty, New York, who resigned his position rather than to certify paymentsfor Chiropractic services under Medicaid. I am delighted to report that he isnow heading a Health Department in Pennsylvania, and I believe he is doinga great deal more to promote quality of health care than has the New YorkState Legislature, in foisting payment for chiropractic on the public.Government could, of course, impose controls of various sorts. The popularone at the moment, called for by the AFL-CIO, and assorted legislators and colum-nists, is for the establishment of fixed fee schedules. This of course addressesitself to the lesser part of the problem, since it does not touch utilization-onlyphysicians fees. Presumably several investigations of the matter of physiciansfees are to be conducted by Congress, or under its auspices, and it is my per-sonal opinion that this should not be upsetting to any physicians who are charg-ing reasonably and fairly by existing professional standards. It is surely notthe policy of the profession or its organized societies to uphold the right of theindividual physician to charge unconscionably or immoderately. One would hopethat any 'investigation\" on this score would, in addition to documenting abuses,study carefully the opportunities for their elimination. If it is appropriate toinvestigate the financial dealings of Senators and Congressmen I would concedethat it is all right to check up on physicians. It should be remembered that themedical profession itself has made considerable progress in the development ofreview committees, grievance committees, and the like. There must also be apreservation of perspective, since in respect to Medicare at least-the elimina-tion of a full 7% increase in physicians fees, which constitute less than 25%of the program expenditures, would amount to a 1&3/4 percent saving, overall.Ill considered, punitive efforts to fix prices-a position generally abhorred bygovernment in respect to most business-could be productive of unintended andunhappy results. I would submit that, compared to the capacities of the medicalprofession itself, government is ill equipped to remedy the difficulties.The situation in respect to third party payors, or consumer groups, as guard-ians of public expenditures for health care, is quite different from that of 24-798-69-pt. 3-12782 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS government. Underwriters have obviously had a sincere interest in safeguarding their own funds. None of them could survive the sort of deficit operation which is a way of life in government. But among all of the voluntary prepayment plans, the prepaid closed panel group practices and the private insurance com- panies no alternative to physician review has ever been found. It is quite true that claims review is becoming automated and sophisticated to the extent that machines pick out cases which depart from a programmed range of acceptability, but the actual evaluation of the case and the charges depends upon physician judgment. This brings us back to my initial allegation that physicians are the only quali- fied guardians of the public interest in the realm of expenditures for direct patient care. It remains to consider the extent to which they are being helped or hindered in so functioning, and to discuss ways in which they may function more effectively. UTILIZATION RELATED TO EXPENDITURES Utilization of hospital facilities and services, for example, is directly related to expenditures. But this is not a simple straight line relationship. That is to say, a reduction in use does not bring about a corresponding reduction in cost. The simple illustration is the hospital room. The most expensive item in the hospital is the unoccupied room. The cost of maintaining it in large part con- tinues, without off-setting revenue. If a zealous utilization review committee should somehow decrease hospital occupancy to the 50% level for any significant period of time what would happen to the per diem cost? It would go up-not down. The most efficient, most economical form of hospital operation is that which uses its facilities and its personnel at close to tolerance levels. Without the application of a great deal of wisdom, the coalescent wisdom of the medical staff and the hospital administration, there may be great imbalances, to the disadvantage of the patient. Hospitals, per se, function poorly as conservators of the public dollar. In order to judge the propriety of charges for goods or services it is necessary to know what the charge is, as well as the cost on which it is based. For this rea- son I feel that the flight from fee-for-service is progress in the wrong direction. How is it possible to judge the equity of a hospital charge which becomes un- identifiable with an overall per diem rate. How can one pass on the reasonable- ness of a fee which is never established as a charge against a pre-paid premium or as a credit toward the physician's salary? To abandon fee-for-service, as is currently championed by so many critics of medicine, seems to me to be forsaking the only real opportunity to identify and isolate the opportunities for economy, and 'to equate the price tag to the value of the item purchased. By this I imply that it is being made increasingly difficult for anyone-physicians included-to appraise the value of goods and services when the charges are submerged and lose their individual identities. In this connection it may be of interest to report to you a small study which I have just made in my own 500 bed community general hospital. If. as I have postulated, the physician has this important role of guardian in respect to patient expenditures, how familiar is he with the prices charged to his patients in the hospital? I listed 20 of the more common things ordered by physicians in our hospital-items such as a blood sugar, a chest X-ray, a special duty private nurse, and the like. I asked 17 physicians to fill in what they thought each item cost the patient. 12 were practicing physicians with many hospital patients. 5 were resi- dents in training, responsible for much of the ordering. The pattern became clear, and I didn't feel that I needed to add a lot more people in order to establish statis- tical validity. Doctors don't know very-accurately what charges are made. The spread per item varied from 150% to 600%. 29% of the answers were correct, or close enough to count as correct. 31% of the guesses were high. 40% were low. Residents were a bit wilder than the attending men. All this, I believe, simply points up an important opportunity for improvement. I believe any business man would seek deliverance from a buyer who didn't know the price of what he bought. You have been hearing much about group practice and especially about the notion that pre-paid closed panel group practice may conserve dollars. I regard this as undocumented, especially where quality as well as quantity requires con- sideration. No one, I believe, has suggested that any type of practice arrangement converts an inadequate physician into an adequate one. I don't recall who first said it, but I would agree that one thing worse than an incompetent physician would be a group of incompetent physicians. Our quest is not for bargain-base-COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 783 ment medicine, but for competent medical care, fairly given and fairly com- pensated. In this quest there is still great room for innovation, experimentationand improvement. There is still much virtue in our non-system of care as against the rigidity of systems as devised by the British, the Germans, the Swedes and the others. It is naive of our government to think that the heart of the matter is how the doctor is paid, or how the patient pays.If the common denominator is the ethical competent well-motivated physician- almost any system will work well. If not, it seems impossible to devise a system which can't be beat. This is the quandry enveloping those who discredit the medi- cal profession. They have-no happy alternative to turn to.Frankly, I believe that those who downgrade the medical profession, who dimi- nish its status and who undermine its authority are self-defeatists. To the degreethat estrangements have developed between government and medicine, betweenlabor and medicine, between hospitals and doctors, there are tragedies of our time. It has indeed progressed to the point where a substantial number of physi- cians sincerely wish to have nothing to do with government subsidized programs of care. How much better off would we be if there were constructive cooperative attacks upon our problems of financing and the delivery of services by all parties involved. I believe the medical profession needs the understanding, the support,and the effective assistance of all interested parties to do the job that only it can do. And when that support and assistance is preferred I believe the medical profession should accept it. TPwo Canadian physicians, in writing a book called \"Medicine and the State\" which analyzes in depth the principal government-operated care plans-England, Germany, Russia and the like, reach what I regard as a significant, a highly important conclusion. They state it this way \"In the field of health care it doesappear that once personal responsibility is removed, collective selfishness re- places the restraints of the individual experience. Experience suggests that in-dividual morality declines as public responsibility increases\". For patients and physicians alike we should consider the need to strengthen the sense of personal responsibility and to fortify the restraints of the individual conscience. The professional association, in this country, has done much to potentiate the efforts of individual physicians, not only in pursuit of scientific excellence, but in the exercise of civic responsibility. Therefore all professional associations of physicians should dedicate a share of their efforts in this direction, but the one instrument best suited for the purpose is the County Medical Society- accessible to the full complement of ethical competent physicians, each belong- ing to a vigorous progressive State Association, and all integrated in to the American Medical Association. Despite the abundance of brickbats aimed at the AMA, largely because of its conservatism and its resistance to government interventions and controls, it has generally been recognized as a major force for good in the advancement of scientific medicine, physician education, and the development of quality controls. The track record of the medical profession in respect to self discipline and the imposition of high standards is most encourag- ing. The admission requirements for medical school are self-imposed and they have been so high as to occasion howls of anguish. It was the profession itself, through the AMA that acted importantly in the elimination of medical diploma mills. All of the specialty societies and certifying Boards have been voluntary developments. The evolution of tissue committees, medical audits, and restric- tions of privileges in hospitals have been developed by the profession itself, as have the mechanisms and organizations for accreditation of hospitals and other medical facilities. Insurance claims review committees and grievance or media- tion committees are inventions and developments by physicians and their medical associations. That these self-imposed controls are less than perfect is not sur- prising. That there is room for improvement is obvious. But this is working machinery and these are functioning programs. The bright hope lies in perfecting what we have. CONCLUSIONS Now I should like to try to pull these observations together in order to draw some useful conclusions. 1. Much of the expenditure of public and private funds under the general head- ing of medical service is outside the range of direct patient care and is beyond the immediate influence of the practicing physician. These elements relate to expenditures for research, education, capital construction, operation of institu- tional facilities, and the like. They need to be identified and financed as such.784 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 2. Expenditures by, or in behalf of individual patients for direct patient care are greatly influenced by physicians, and there is a great opportunity to improve physician awareness and exercise of responsibility in this respect. 3. Despite extensive efforts on the part of medical societies to encourage medical schools to include instruction in medical-economic understanding and responsibility little has been accomplished in the schools of this country, and virtually nothing has been or can be accomplished in the foreign schools which train so many of our physicians. 4. Opportunity exists for medical economic orientation at the interne and resident level, and this may present an excellent place for cooperation between hospital training programs and local medical societies. 5. Since the physician alone is in position to make decisions in the individ- ual case as to reasonable alternatives in expenditure for diagnostic and thera- peutic services, other interested parties should aid and abet the physician in the exercise of this decision-making responsibility. 6. Individual physicians can best be oriented and assisted by their own pro- fessional associations, which are already responsible for most of the progress in the area of utilization review, claims review and other efforts to contain expenditures for medical care. 7. Government, labor, industry, third party payors, and consumer groups should lend their support and assistance to medical societies in constructive approaches to the problem. 8. Physicians and their associations should be receptive to any genuine help which may be proferred. 9. The physicians who have remained aloof from organized medicine and the AMA should be vigorously encouraged to become participants in active programs to increase physician responsibility. They should be encouraged by their schools, their employers, their hospitals, and perhaps even by their patients. 10. Irrational. divisive bickerings by all interested agencies and organizations should be set aside in favor of cooperative assault on a massive problem. ExHIBIT B: MEDICAL CARE COST CONTROL [From the AMA News, Apr. S. 1968] ONLY M.D.'s CAN CONTROL CARE COSTS, PANEL TOLD Organized medicine, through a concerted effort by state and county medical societies, is \"potentially the greatest ally\" of the public in controlling expendi- tures for medical services, participants at the second national American Medical Association Congress on the Socio-Economics of Health Care were told. Russell B. Roth, MD, Erie, Pa., vice-speaker of the AMA House of Delegates, said, \"Vast programs of financing medical care must be supervised, must be audited, must be equated to need, and must be protected against abuse.\" Government \"III-Equipped\" Government, considered by some to be the answer to the problem, could impose controls, he said, but compared to the medical profession, it is \"ill equipped to remedy the difficulties. \"It is government which in effect has written the blank check for medical care and must look to someone else to fill in the amount,\" Dr. Roth said. \"It is in large part this abundance of governmental dollars chasing after scarce services that has created the problem.\" Despite efforts of third party payors and voluntary prepayment plans, no alternative to physician review has ever been found, he said. \"It is quite true that claims review is becoming automated and sophisticated to the extent that machines pick out cases which depart from a programmed range of acceptability, but the actual evaluation of the case and the charges de- pends upon physician judgment,\" Dr. Roth pointed out. Areas of Need Proper utilization of hospital facilities and services, fee-for-service payment, and quality of care are areas in which the physician can function more effectively and help to identify and contain expenditures, he said. Critics of the medical profession, including labor-management, and government, are \"self-defeatists,\" Dr. Roth emphasized. \"I believe the medical profession needs the understanding, the support, and the effective assistance of all interested parties to do the job that only it canCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 785 (1o,\" he said. \"And when that support and assistance is proferred. I believethe medical profession should accept it.\" Dr. Roth made the following suggestions in regard to the future role oforganized medicine as \"guardian\" of the consumer's interest in expenditures formedical care: Identification of public and private expenditures for medical service whichdiffer from elements relating to direct patient care, to improve physician aware-ness. Identification of public and private expenditures for medical servicewhich differ from elements relating to direct patient care, to improvephysician awareness. Instruct medical societies to encourage medical schools to include medical-economic understanding and responsibility in their curriculums, especiallyat the intern and resident level.

ALEXANDER SIMON, DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO MEDI- CAL CENTER Probably few countries have begun to face the full implications of the agingpopulation for health and welfare services. Our experiences with Medicare andMedicaid have only suggested the variety and magnitude of the problems pre-sented by a program directed at providing even minimal health services to anincreasingly larger group of elderly persons in our population. The incidenceand prevalence of mental disorders in this group is high, and comprehensivehealth services for them should include continuity of care from preventionthrough screening. outpatient and hospital treatment, and aftercare, and shouldcover medical, psychiatric, and social and supportive services. Although in mostcases specific methods for the prevention of mental illness and for the treatmentof many mental disorders in the elderly are not yet possible, at least the severityof disorder may be ameliorated by symptomatic treatment, its personal andsocial consequence can be mitigated, and the care and treatment made availablecan be humane. I am not well acquainted with the details of costs related to the delivery ofhealth services in general, 'but I should like to emphasize the need for closeliaison and coordination among all agencies, health care personnel, and servicesworking in this field. The problems associated with prevention, treatment, andrehabilitation of the geriatric mentally ill not only are enormous and compli-cated by lack of knowledge, but also are inextricably tangled. Coordination ofefforts is necessary from screening and the identification of persons with prob-lems through treatment and aftercare and the provision of supportive services.Screening, for example, is useless if services for referral are not available orare not located where they are easy to reach or if transportation and assistanceto get there are not available. Screening programs that see patients at times ofpsychosocial crisis have shown the wide variety of resources needed: generalhospitals, psychiatric units in general hospitals, public and private mental hos-pitals, medical and psychiatric office care and home visits, psychiatric outpatientclinics, nursing and boarding homes, family care homes, old age homes, andhomemaker services, visiting nurses, \"Meals on Wheels,\" and other services tomake it possible for some elderly patients to remain at home. But who is toassume responsibility for continuity of care and for the necessary flow ofinformation from one facility or caretaker to another?Government at all levels, as well as the community as a whole, must be con-cerned with the availability, quality, and delivery of these services. Communitystudies have found moderate or severe psychiatric impairment in approximately20 per cent of elderly persons living in the community. Yet, only one and a halfto two per cent of the patients seen in outpatient psychiatric clinics are agedsixty-five or over. In addition, office psychiatric care of the elderly has dis-786 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS criminatory limitations on cost, in contrast to other types of medical care. Well over three hundred thousand persons aged sixty-five and over with mental dis- orders were resident in long-stay facilities in the United States in 1963. About half of these were in state and county mental hospitals and the other half in nursing homes, geriatric hospitals, homes for the aged, and related facilities. The figure for the mentally ill in nursing homes and such facilities is undoubtedly a minimum one and has considerably increased since the advent of Medicare. ALTERNATIVE PLACEMENTS DIsCLOsES PROBLEMS The present trend to make use of alternative placements for those elderly mentally ill who traditionally have been committed to state mental hospitals has brought to attention some serious problems. Nursing and boarding homes are in increasing use both for the initial placement of patients and for the transfer of aged patients already in state hospitals. But standards of care pro- vided in these facilities must be raised, and this means increased costs. Ade- quate licensing and review procedures for each type of facility, relating to per- sonnel requirements as well as to physical plant facilities, are imperative. There must be better coordination of licensing agencies. Some homes now are licensed by the Department of Social Welfare, some by the Department of -Mental Hy- giene, and some by the Department of Public Health, and some unification and clarification of licensing procedures clearly is required. The most crying need is for social workers to deal with families and rehabilitation workers to inaugu- rate and carry out activity programs in the various types of home. The need for training programs and the upgrading of salaries and experience is especially obvious in relation to nursing personnel-nurses and nursing aides- who care for the elderly. There is a rapid turnover of nursing personnel, largely because of poor pay. and a continuing scarcity of adequately trained and ex- perienced aides. Training courses might well be made part of licensing require- ments. Operators of boarding and family care homes greatly need training courses, and psychiatric consultative services should be made available to them and their use encouraged. The psychiatric profession must become increasingly involved. At present. psychiatrists are not adequately trained or experienced in working with the elderly mentally ill, and they are not called upon often enough by those who operate and staff these facilities. Not only are the geriatric mentally ill being placed initially in alternative facilities rather than in state mental hospitals. but patients already in these hospitals-some for many years-are being transferred out in increasing num- bers. Most of these are placed in nursing home or family care settings. although some are able to return to the community. Careful evaluation and screening for appropriate placement are essential. as are continuing social work and medical and psychiatric supervision, if such programs are to be successful. In summary, the need for health services for the elderly is great, and the nature of the problems of this age group is such that only a truly comprehensive health program can adequately meet their needs. Coordination of the efforts of all resources and personnel is essential if services are to be made available and easily accessible to the large group of elderly persons who are in many cases in really desperate need of help. ExHIBIT A: QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY THE CHAIRMAN TO DR. ALEXANDER SIMON. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANcIscO MEDICAL CENTER 1. What has been your experience with the use of outpatient mental health services to the elderly? What reception has it received from the elderly? 2. What is the current status of the geriatric screening unit in San Francisco? W'hat has the record of this unit been in reducing the number of admissions to mental institutions? 3. What are the missing links in the current range of mental health services generally available to the elderly? What changes in Federal policy or legislation may be needed to close such links? 4. You may remember that, at the Subcommittee hearing in the Bronx, New York. that Dr. Israel Zwerling described problems related to the release of geriatric patients from mental institutions when they were unprepared for re- introduction into society?

DEAR SENATOR WILLIAMS: I am glad to reply to your request for comments onsome questions relating to the costs and delivery of health services to older Americans. Probably few countries have begun to face the full implications ofthe aging population for health and welfare services. Our experience with Medi-care and Medicaid have only suggested the variety and magnitude of the prob- lems presented by a program directed at providing even minimal health servicesto an increasingly larger group of elderly persons in our population. The inci-dence and prevalence of mental disorders in this group is high, and comprehen-sive health services should include continuity of care from prevention throughscreening, outpatient and hospital treatment. and aftercare, and should covermedical, psychiatric, and social and supportive services. Although in most cases specific methods for the prevention of mental illness and for the treatment ofmany mental disorders of the elderly are not yet possible, at least the severityof disorder may be ameliorated by symptomatic treatment, its personal andsocial consequences can be mitigated, and humane treatment and care can bemade available.I am not well acquainted with the details of costs related to the delivery ofhealth services in general, but I should like to emphasize the need for closeliaison and coordination among all agencies, health care personnel, and servicesworking in this field. The problems associated with prevention, treatment. andrehabilitation of the geriatric mentally ill not only are enormous and compli-cated by lack of knowledge, but also are inextricably tangled. Coordination ofefforts is necessary from screening and the identification of persons with problemsthrough treatment and aftercare and the provision of supportive services. Screen-ing, for example, is useless if services for referral are not available or are locatedwhere they are not easy to reach or if transportation and assistance to get thereare not available. Screening programs that see patients at times of psychosocial crisis have shownthe wvide variety of resources needed: general hospitals, psychiatric units in gen-eral hospitals. public and private mental hospitals, medical and psychiatric officecare and home visits, psychiatric outpatient clinics. nursing and boarding homes,family care homes, old age homes. and homemaker services, visiting nurses.\"Meals on Wheels,\" and other services to make it possible for some elderlypatients to remain at home. But someone must assume responsibility for con-tinuity of care and for the necessary fiow of information from one facility orcaretaker to another. The elderly person needs a \"representative\" to look out forhis interests and to assist him in obtaining needed care. Especially pressing arethe need for outpatient psychiatric services and the need to remove variousrestrictions on psychiatric care in contrast to general medical care. NUMBER OF ELDERLY MENTALLY ILL Government at all levels, as well as the community as a whole. is vitally con-cerned with the availability, quality, and delivery of services to the elderly.Community studies have found moderate or severe psychiatric impairment inapproximately 20 per cent of elderly persons living in the community.' Wellover three hundred thousand persons aged sixty-five and over with mental dis-orders were resident in long-stay facilities in the United States in 1963, about halfof them in state and county mental hospitals and the other half in nursing homes.geriatric hospitals, homes for the aged, and related facilities.2The figure for thenumber of mentally ill in nursing homes and related facilities undoubtedly is aminimum one and has increased considerably since the implementation ofMedicare. The present trend to make use of alternative placements for those elderlymentally ill who traditionally have been committed to state mental hospitals hasbrought to attention some serious problems. Nursing and boarding homes are inincreasing use both for the initial placement of patients and for the transfer ofalready hospitalized aged patients.

Unification and clarification of licensing procedures are required. The most pressing need is for social workers to deal with families and for rehabilitation workers to inaugurate and carry out activity programs in the various types of home. As to the need for psychiatric outpatient services for the aged, the National Institute for Mental Health has been collecting and publishing data on the num- bers and characteristics of patients receiving services in outpatient psychiatric clinics since 1954. The clinic population has been weighted heavily with children under eighteen and adults in the 1S-44 year age groups, with relatively small proportions in the age groups 45-64 and 65+. Persons aged sixty-five and over constituted only 2 per cent of the total admissions to outpatient clinics in 1965. In contrast, persons in this age group constituted 29 per cent of all first admis- sions to public mental hospitals for the same year.' Although psychiatric clinics claim not to discriminate against particular groups, there does seem to be a de facto discrimination against geriatric patients. A survey of admissions to the Outpatient Department of the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute for the year July, 1963, through June, 1964, showed that slightly less than 2 percent of these admissions were of persons over the age of sixty. Subsequent conversations with professionals involved in the private and public sectors of social services, with psychiatrists in private practice, and with non-psychiatric physicians in private practice suggested, however, that there was a large need for outpatient services for people in the older age groups. Our feeling was that if the public could be informed of a special clinic that had a particular interest in the psychologic disorders of the aged, there would be substantial utilization of the clinic's services. Such a program might also provide social agencies with consultative services regarding difficult client problems and a psychiatrist who could make house calls on clients who, for physical or psy- chologic reasons, could not go outside their homes for help. TRAIXING FOR CARE OF ELDERLY MENTALLY ILL The need for training programs and the upgrading of salaries and experience is especially obvious in relation to nursing personnel-nurses and nursing aides- who care for the elderly. There is a rapid turnover of nursing personnel, largely because of poor pay, and a continuing scarcity of adequately trained and expe- rienced aides. Training courses might well be made part of licensing require- inents. Operators of boarding and family care homes greatly need training courses, and psychiatric consultative services should be made available to them and their use encouraged. The psychiatric profession must become increasingly involved; at present. psychiatrists are not adequately trained and experienced in working with the elderly mentally ill, and they are not called upon often enough by those who operate and staff these facilities. Not only are the geriatric mentally ill being placed initially in other facilities than state mental hospitals, but patients -already in these hospitals-some for many years-are being transferred out in increasing numbers. Most of these are placed in nursing home or family care settings, although some are able to return to the community. Careful evaluation and screening for appropriate placement are essential, as are continuing social work and medical and psychiatric super- vision, if such transfer programs are to be successful. GERIATRIC OUTPATIENT PROGRAM In the summer of 1967, with support from a grant by the State Administra- tion on Aging, The Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute Outpatient De- partment began a Geriatric Outpatient Program. A press release was sent to the San Francisco daily newspapers, and one of the papers printed an extensive interview with the coordinator of the program. In addition, there was a radio interview on a popular noontime program. Representatives of many agencies dealing with the elderly population were invited to meet with the staff of the project to discuss its work and the kinds of involvement the agencies would like to encourage. As a result of these conferences, a psychiatrist was added to the staff to work as a consultant with the social agencies and to see patients for them, either individually or in groups, and also to conduct evaluations and treatment of homebound patients referred by the agencies. a Kramer, et al., ibid.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 789 Within four days after the initial publicity in the newspapers, the project re- ceived 60 telephone calls. These were taken by the project social worker, who evaluated the urgency of the need and tried to have the most pressing cases seen first. Other requests were placed on a waiting list, and these applicants received letters from the Project Coordinator saying they would be called as soon as time became available. Patients who were accepted were evaluated by a trainee (who might be a psychiatric resident, social work student, medical student, or post-master nursing student) and then were discussed at an interdisciplinary staff meeting. The patient then was assigned for appropriate psychothrapy and received medication and other somatic therapy when indicated. The Inpatient Services of the Institute were available for those patients needing hospitalization. During the first ten months of operation, the admissions of persons aged sixty and over to the Outpatient Department rose from slightly less than 2 per cent to 13.5 per cent of all patients admitted. Sixty-six geriatric patients were ad- mitted for outpatient psychotherapy following evaluation of 162 requests. Half of the patients seen came for five or more visits. Seven required hospitaliza- tion at the time of the first interview. Most of the patients seen were diagnosed as having depressive reactions. Our experience shows that when a psychiatric clinic expresses interest in their problems, older people will avail themselves of outpatient services to a degree more closely approximating their representation in the general population than is generally the case. Age does not preclude a meaningful psychotherapeutic intervention. A valuable side-result was obtained with respect to the attitude of trainees involved in the program. Although most trainees came onto the Geriatric Out- patient Program team with the usual negative bias against the treatment of older patients, during the course of their experience they generally changed their attitude and became, if not positively oriented toward the treatment of these patients, at least less professionally nihilistic. In San Francisco prior to 1963, approximately two-thirds of the patients over age sixty who were admitted to the San Francisco General Hospital psychiatric observation wards each year subsequently were committed to state mental hos- pitals. A geriatric screening unit established by the California Department of Mental Hygiene in association with the hospital in 1963 has made a remarkably successful effort to locate and utilize alternate placement facilities in the com- munity for these elderly patients for whom commitment would otherwise be sought. A summary of the activities of this program, written by Miss Mary Lou Clark, Director of the Geriatric Screening Unit, is attached.* In summary, the need for health services for the elderly is great, and the problems of this group are such that only a truly comprehensive health program can meet its needs. All levels of psychiatric care certainly need upgrading, from the long-term care of patients who grow old in the hospital to brief outpatient services. Coordination of the efforts of all resources and personnel is essential if adequate services are to be made easily accessible to the large group of elderly persons who are in many cases in really desperate need of help. Sincerely, ALEXANDER SiMoN, M.D. ITEM 11: LETTER FROM DONALD L. SPENCE, PH. D., STAFF SOCIOLO- GIST, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SAN FRANCISCO MEDICAL CENTER November 27, 1968. DEAR SENATOR SMATRERS: I am extremely sorry for the delay in responding to your inquiry of September 27. Dr. Feigenbaum and I have discussed your letter at some length, however, and feel that we do have some recommendations concerning the problem of medical student attitudes toward the geriatric patient. Dr. Freigenbaum directs an outpatient program in geriatric psychiatry. His experience indicates that when students or trainees are exposed to this program their original negative attitudes are generally changed to a more positive stance with regard to the treatability of older people. This suggests two factors in the shaping of attitudes toward older patients. First, that some exposure to older patients is essential in any training program where the intent is to influence attitudes. But, probably more important in terms of the nature of the attitudes formed is the type of exposure. For a student to see an older patient properly *Retained In committee files.790 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS diagnosed and placed in a treatment program designed for his care is a far cry from what most of them see when in their training they are exposed to the \"old peoples ward\" in some public general hospital or to a hospital for chronic illness. What this means is that early in their medical education, students should be instructed in the problems of gerontology in all its medical aspects. Later in their training when they are exposed to a variety of elderly patient situations, they will have the conceptual framework to understand how these situations fit into a broader picture. To accomplish this will require the training of persons to carry out this instruction. It will also be necessary to convince medical schools that this type of instruction is worthy of a significant place in an already over- burdened curriculum. Ideally, this instruction should be taught in conjunction with existing courses in appropriate medical specialties. This. would require the re-orientation of the same individuals and professionals who are currently per- petuating the negative stereotypes. The problem, therefore, becomes one of the best strategy to produce the desired change in an ongoing, self-perpetuating situation. Some change is already occurring. For example, there is a subcommittee of the Gerontological Society on training of medical students with respect to geri- atrics. This subcommittee is currently headed, I believe, by Dr. Alfred H. Law- ton of St. Petersburg, Florida. Also, the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education had geriatric psychiatry as the content for one of its recent training sessions for psychiatrist teachers of practicing physicians. Another such program is now in the formative stages and is due to start in May or June of this year. The Committee on Aging and the American Psychiatric Association has made recommendations concerning the teaching of geriatric psychiatry for both medical students and residents in training. And. the very fact that your sub- committee exists and is concerned with the problem suggests the direction of change. Maintaining the impetus for change should be a primary objective. Publicity, money, and programs are what is needed. Publicity in the right places is difficult to develop. For example, our article as published w-as rejected as inappropriate for the Journal of Medical Education. As for funding, you are undoubtedly aware that appropriations for training and research were cut this past year. And, in terms of operational programs, it is important to implement those which are the most appropriate to meet current needs. Your committee, is in a position to influence all three of these strategies. Enclosed you will find a copy of our article as wvell as a background paper on the problem.' If we can be of service in any way please let us know. Respectfully, D. L. SPENCE. Ph. D.. Staff Sociologist. ITEM 12: LETTER FROMI DR. HAROLD RICHTER STARK, LITTLEROCK, CALIFORNIA NNOVEMBER 22, 1968. DEAR SENATOR WmLLIAMS: I was happy to see an article by you in the November Geriatric Times regarding your work and interest in geriatrics. As you may note from my letterhead (F.A.G.S.) I am a specialist in geriatrics. Over a period of 20 years, I have attended many people in the old age bracket both in private practice and in various convalescent hospitals in southern California. I recently had a heart attack and am recuperating at the present time in one such hospital, so I have had an opportunity now to observe as a practicing physi- cian and as a patient some of the great problems of geriatric care in such hospitals. Inasmuch as the Government is paying for much of this care in such institu- tions, I wonder if you would mind if I made a few comments which I hope may help you in the governmental phase of this work. When a patient is placed in such an institution, it appears he is placed there for one of two reasons, or possibly both: that he has a health problem which may be minor or major and such placement is for the convenience of the doctor. Or it may be because the family feels unable to care for the patient and wishes to be unloaded of the burden. It is obvious to me, and to you as well I am sure, that most of these convales- cent hospitals are run by private individuals with the idea of profit in mind. Con- sequently, there are certain prerequisites for the management and for the patient. I Retained In committee files.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 791 It appears to me that the patient being placed in such an institution, if he is ill,should have the best of medical care, nursing care, food and general supervision.I am convinced that in the present 'status of medicare that this is not alwaysthe case. Most doctors, in the first place, are allowed only one monthly visit perpatient and are not particularly interested in geriatrics professionally. Suchinstitutions become a dumping ground for those who are terminally ill, or a placewhere they can be cared for outside of the family. The medical care, from the standpoint of the physician, is only partially suceess-ful. Communication with the doctor is difficult. Illnesses or medical emergenciesare left to the discretion of the nursing staff or telephone conversations. I havepersonally noted that most of these difficulties may occur at night and the doctorsare not available for consultation. This places a responsibility on the judgment of the nursing staff. Most of thisstaff consists of licensed vocational nurses and medical aides-with the emphasison the medical aides whose pay schedule is the minimum. Thus, only certain typesof individuals can be procured to do this work and the nursing staff in generalhai no special preparation in the field of geriatrics. They know very little aboutthe psychology and actual care of the older person, who is becoming greater innumbers each year. It is my belief that these nurses and aides should be specially trained in coursesin geriatrics and geriatric medicine. It is my personal belief, after observing themedical emergencies in such an institution which can occur in great numbers inone evening, that every convalescent hospital or nursing home of any size what- soever should have a resident physician whose duties are to make medical roundsevery morning and evening and to take care of any emergencies that arise duringthe night. It is my belief that such patients referred to a convalescent hospital byindividual doctors should be placed under the care of such a resident physician sothat the referring doctor no longer has any responsibility. I feel that. if this is done, a higher quality of medical care can be establishedby each institution and that the Government of the United States vill receivemore for its money than at the present time under the present circumstances. Also,a program for our older people could be developed to which America could pointwith pride. This resident physician could train the geriatric staff, supervise the diet, makejudgment regarding the further disposition of the case at hand, possibly providefor occupational therapy and the necessary psychological counseling for theseolder people. The problem that presents itself, however, is that most of these nursing homesare built by private organizations with profit in mind and it would probably beimpossible for them to afford the services of such a resident physician. It may be that there should be a Government subsidy and some sort of financialarrangement made with the Government of the United States to finance this.You will note in the enclosed article* a survey made of the University of Cali-fornia Medical Center at San Francisco showing what the attitude of the youngphysician is in the field of geriatrics. I feel that very few physicians are inter-ested sufficiently in the older patient, or that they do not have the proper timeto devote to them, which constitutes an extremely grave problem, in my mind.Thank you for your interest in the geriatric patient and in geriatrics. I hopethat you will continue this great interest and perhaps solve this problem some-how; possibly, with a Government subsidy of hospitals or whatever is necessaryto guarantee these older people the best of everything in the remaining years oftheir life. Very sincerely, 1X. R. STARK, M.D. ITEM 13: STATEMENT OF BOYD THOMPSON, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY, STOCKTON, CALIF. The San Joaquin Foundation for Medical Care is an incorporated body undersponsorship of the San Joaquin County Medical Society. The specific and primarypurposes for which this corporation is formed are to promote, develop, andencourage the distribution of medical services by its members to the people of SanJoaquin and adjacent counties at a cost reasonable to both patient and physician;to preserve unto its members, the medical profession at large, and public, free- *Retalned In committee files.792 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS dom of choice of both physician and patient; to guard and preserve the physician-patient relationship and its innumerable benefits; to protect the public health;to work and study in cooperation with the insurance industry and serviceplans that provide for periodic and realistic budgeting for medical care and towork with all segments of the community to develop best possible ways offinancing and providing medical care. The San Joaquin Foundation was established in 1954 and is now responsibledirectly or through insurance companies for insurance for half the populationof the 5 counties it serves. The Foundation concept has spread to include 31counties in California and is established in some counties of 7 other states.The majority of the physicians of the San Joaquin Foundation for MedicalCare take pride in the fact that their Medical Society is sponsoring through itseconomic arm, programs that give to their patients comprehensive medical carewith predictable costs at premiums that are under controlled devices. They areparticularly pleased by the fact that, due to the administrative relationships be-tween the Foundation for Medical Care and the insurance companies, govern-mental agencies and others that purchase Foundation programs, it has beenpossible to improve the coverage for medical services, and allow for compre-hensive coverage of all needed medical care services. By this we mean the in-clusion of such important items as care of infants from birth to assure protec-tion against the catastrophe of birth anomalies; the coverage of patients whoare critically ill and need physician attendance over many hours; consultiveservices for all types of problems; the ease in which new modalities, such as theintensive care unit and cardiac unit, can be covered under our programs.A few of the physicians are unhappy about our program in that they chafeunder the strict quality control and fee control mechanisms. These physicians,for the most part, are in the minority and probably will be with us for a longperiod of time. This technique has spread to other areas and in the areas to which it hasspread, the physicians have welcomed it because it gave them a device withwhich they could compete with other administrative modalities whose aim wasthe destruction of the traditional physician-patient relationship. In areas of lesssophistication where the insurance mechanism has not been developed to anygreat amount, this technique would be completely impalpable. It is necessary forconflict for this technique to develop because it takes conflict to bring awarenessas to the problems and possible solutions to the problems by the medical pro-fession. Preventive measures are encouraged under the Foundation programs, andearly diagnosis is more easily arrived at because of the increased freedom ofusing x-ray and laboratory devices on an out-patient basis. The financial barrierof seeking care is removed in that the patient is aware of the cost factors in-volved prior to seeking his medical care and most, if not all, is covered by hisprepaid program. Other ingredients in the improvement of preventive measuresis seen in the fact that as physicians become involved in delivery systems ofmedical care they also become involved with areas of need and take steps tocorrect this need. SAVINGS IN PUBLIC FuINDS Does it result in savings of public funds? The answer to this question is anunqualified \"yes\". This can be proven through the work done in the San JoaquinFoundation as well as by the Foundation for Medical Care in Kern and Fresnocounties in California. In the brief time that these three counties have been involved in experiments relating to Title XVIII and Title XIX of Public Law S9-97, considerable savings have been documented without a decrease in thequality of care and, as a matter of fact, with the increase in the quality. The utilization control and medical audit features of the program are accept-able to most of the physicians who participate in the program for the simple rea-son that they know, in general, medical audit is being carried out which doesnot affect them personally. The 10% of physicians whose claims are chronicallyin medical audit, obviously, are unhappy about the program and their un-happiness perhaps attests to the thoroughness of the audit. WVe have been asked if we have encountered any federal or state statutes.regulations, or administrative policies which unnecessarily impede or incon-venience our organization in rendering medical services. To some degree theanswer would have to be yes. State statutes are restrictive in developing methodsof payment that vary from participating and nonparticipating physicians. Theyalso are restrictive in that any program that is carried out under our strict medi-cal audit in San Joaquin County must also be payable in areas where the auditCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 793 is not so strict. This has increased costs in certain instances and caused prob-lems in reviewing out of area claims. Our local programs could be more inclusiveif protective devices could be developed to increase co-insurance deductiblefeatures for out of area coverage.Second, at the present time, there is no way where the Foundation can involveitself in reimbursing hospitals in that State statutes require that this be doneon an insured basis and for this reason funds must be available to cover allcontingencies. If change in the Law were made we could develop similar servicecontracts with hospitals and allow, perhaps, for more comprehensive coveragein hospitals. ITEM 14: LETTER FROM DON VIAL, CHAIRMAlN, CENTER FOR LABORRESEARCH AND EDUCATION, INSTITUTE FOR INDUSTRIAL RELA-TIONS, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY November 22, 1968.* * * * * *D:\" SENATOR WILLIAMS: First, I am enclosing a copy of a speech by EinarMohn, Chairman of the California Council for Health Plan Alternatives, whichwas delivered before a recent convention of the California Hospital Association.Since I helped develop the address, I think it may be useful in responding toyour questions. As the speech indicates, the real crisis in health care is that while we are spend-ing some 6% of GNP for health services, millions of Americans are still effec-tively removed from the essential services required to maintain good health. Thegovernment programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, have failed to relievethe crisis because they are primarily concerned with removing the financial bar-rier between the individual and so-called \"mainstream health services\" withoutadequately attacking the problem of organizing health care services to make themmore effective. In this sense, these programs are like the negotiated programswhich tend to increase demand beyond the present capacity of our health re-sources as they are presently organized and used. If the federal government is tomake good on the promise of Medicare and Medicaid to bring more individualsinto the mainstream of health care, then it must find ways of encouraging thereorganization of health services so that delivery systems are developed to over-come the kind of problems both underprivileged and many blue collar workersface in obtaining quality medical care. QUASI PUBLIc HEALTH CENTERS In the administration of Medicare, I would urge the federal government notonly to encourage better organization of health services, but to actually sponsornew delivery systems in major metropolitan areas through the creation of quasi-public health centers so that realistic bench marks may be established for reim-bursing the providers of health care services. In electric power generation, wehave tried to keep alive the public power bench mark. In health care in Cali-fornia, we are moving in the opposite direction. MediCal has encouraged the con-version of county hospitals into community hospitals without the developmentof any new public delivery systems that can be used for bench mark purposes.We seem to be bent upon placing ourselves completely at the mercy of the provid-ers, and what they determine to be \"customary and usual charges.\"In other words, I do not see any way of coming to grips with cost and qualityproblems in a framework that ignores the basic health care organizational issues.Mr. Mohn's address to the CHA places emphasis on the need for hospitals them-selves to do something about keeping people well by taking a direct hand infostering new ways of organizing outpatient services. I agree with him that hos-pitals must assume some of the responsibility for the over-use of hospital facili-ties when such over-use results from the failure of the community and healthplans to make outpatient care accessable on a timely basis.In this regard, the federal government should consider the extent to whichhospitals and other health facilities are cooperating in implementing the federalcomprehensive health planning law. In reimbursing health facilities for servicesrendered through Medicare and Medicaid, no allowances should be made fordepreciation of facilities and equipment unless individual health facilities are infact planning to provide services needed by the community and coordinatingtheir plans through the comprehensive health planning mechanism of their com-munity. Mr. Mohn supports this view point in his CHA address.794 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICE FOR ELDERLY Finally, I would like to comment on the idea of providing preventive health services for the elderly. Of course, many of their health problems stem from the fact that they failed to receive preventive services when they were younger. The provision of such services may in fact be too late for many of them to suffer from chronic diseases that could have been prevented. Nevertheless, for those who's health can still be protected, I would suggest that the federal government establish a differential reimbursement rate for health facilities and physicians who participate in the establishment and operation of a community health screen- ing facility for those covered by Medicare and Medicaid. This may be difficult to do, but I think it is worth the effort. Such a health screening facility should not only provide regular multiphasic health examinations for the aged, but should include a wide range of health education services designed to reach into the com- munity and to help integrate medical care services that are now covered so that they may be used to preserve health. There is a great difference in my mind between adding health care screening on the one hand as another item on the medical \"smorgasbord,\" and on the other, as a service that is organized to inte- grate for individuals the health services that are available to them in the com- munity. I have serious reservations about multiphasic testing unless it is based on the integrated approach. I offer these thoughts for what they may be worth, and regret that I have not bad the time to prepare a statement for submission into the record. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to submit these comments. Sincerely, DoN VIAL, ChLairnman. EXHIBIT A: SPEECH BY EINAR MIOHN, CHAIRMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR HEALTH PLAN ALTERNATIVES, TO THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION INTRODUCTORY REMARKS Today, in this age of crises, we find it difficult to talk about health care without referring to a crisis in connection with skyrocketing medical costs. The statistics, indeed, are of crisis proportions. During the two year period, June 1966 to June 1968, when the general Consumer Price Index was rising by an inflationary 7%, the medical care index of the BLS rose 14%, twice as fast, and the index of hospital daily service charges rose 37%. over 5 times faster than the general Consumer Price Index. The projections for the future which we have heard many times are even gloomier ... Yet, we would be making a tragic mistake were we to focus only on costs, for this extraordinary rate of cost inflation in health care is merely a symptom of the real crisis. The real crisis in health care is that while we are spending some $50 billion a year for health services in America (about 6%o of GNP), millions of Americans are still effectively removed from the essential services required to maintain good health. In a more immediate sense, the real crisis is that the billions being poured into the mainstream of health care to reach these millions are actually feeding the inflationary fires and providing very little in the way of incentives to finding more effective ways of organizing and delivering health services. This, then, is the real crises-the sluggishness and unresponsiveness of our health care system to unmet needs, regardless of how much money we manage to pump into it. We know this crisis only too well in the labor movement. We are up to our ears in it. For years we have been \"sweating out\" of our employers, in lieu of wage increases, ever-larger amounts of money to purchase health care benefits for our members and their families through third party, group-purchases, arrangements. For years we have been pouring this money (now about $700 million annually in California) into the so-called mainstream and in the process, we have contributed more to the rate of health care inflation than to the improvement of the benefit structures of our programs. More importantly, quality considerations have consistently eluded us, and we have spent our dollars over the years without affecting a more efficient use of medical resources or better ways of organizing and delivering services to maintain the health of our members.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 795 We have worked primarily through third-party intermediaries to come to gripswith our mounting problems-and they have failed us. We are now prepared toabandon them, if necessary. As we told the CHA committee that met with us recently -to discuss our prob-lems, the Council for Health Plan Alternatives seeks a fundamental reorganiza-tion of health care. Our object is to pool the collective bargaining power of amillion and three-quarters organized workers in the state to insure the greatestreturn for our health dollar, to secure an effective voice for the consumer inproviding and planning for health, and to establish the machinery for monitoringthe cost and quality of health care services and preventing abuse.In order to accomplish these far-reaching objectives, we have made the deci-sion to become active participants in solving the problems in planning andorganizing health care services. We have taken the steps necessary, as in thecase of the CHP and the CMA, to establish direct lines of communications withthe providers of health care services, rather than continuing to rely primarilyon insurance companies and other vendors to act as our intermediaries. At thesame time, we are not closing the door to constructive help from the insurancecompanies or other vendors. We are under no delusion that the job we have cut out for ourselves is going tobe easy to accomplish. For example, economists are prone to tell us, in connectionwith the current run-away inflation in health care, that we are bucking a classicalsituation where the demand for health services is running way ahead of thesupply of resources needed to meet the demand. Inflation, we are told, is in-evitable under these circumstances, and will continue until the supply sidecatches up with demand. We wish it were possible to be even this optimistic. The prospects of supplycatching up with demand doesn't even appear on the horizon at this time. Weare in a sellers market in the health industry, and it's going to continue thatway for a long time for some obvious reasons, the main one being that thehealth industry appears to be well sheltered from the pressures of demand touse resources in short supply more efficiently and effectively, while more resourcesare being developed. We do not see these classical economic pressures at work.In connection with hospitals specifically, we are inclined to believe, until provenfalse, what the Somers' pointed out in their book Medicare and the Hospitals:\"In no other realm of economic life today are payments guaranteed for coststhat are neither controlled by competition nor regulated by public authority, andin which no incentive for economy can be discerned.\" (Somers and Somers,Medicare and the Hospitals. 1967, p. 192.)Negotiated programs have also taken a great deal of the risk out of collec-tions for hospitals, and for doctors and other providers as well. Doctors are un-doubtedly even more immune from incentives to economy than hospitals. PROBLEMS FACED BY PRovIDERs In a very real sense it can be said that the economic chips are on the side ofthe providers. But the Council knows things really aren't quite that bright onthe provider's side either. The Government isn't adding its billions to the pur-chasing power stream for health care without attempting to exercise some re-sponsibility to protect consumers from the forces working against them. And, asindicated, it is the intent of CCHPA, as an organization of group purchasers, todevelop all the bargaining power it can pull together for the purpose of develop-ing a direct buyer-seller relationship with providers of health services. Like thegovernment, we have become very interested not only in removing financialbarriers, but also in making sure that when negotiated dollars are spent, maxi-mum pressure is exerted on providers to utilize resources as efficiently as pos-sible, and to organize them so that our members obtain the right health serviceat the right time in the right place. We are going to try to use our dollars to getthe quality we are paying for and to develop health care delivery systems thatwill maintain health as well as treat the sick. That is the thrust of governmentpolicy these days; it is our main thrust also.The exercise of \"power\" these days has become something of a scare word,even though it is the basis of economic action in our free society. We use it inthe sense that the Council is seeking to exercise power that goes with \"con-sumer sovereignty\" in our economy-the sovereignty that too often falls preyto producers and providers of goods and services. Just how much consumer powerit will be necessary for the Council to attempt to muster will depend on the796 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS response we receive to our pleas for help from the providers. We would much prefer to work with you on our mutual problems, rather than in opposition to policies and practices which we believe no longer have any validity. Let me therefore explain how our Council members look at some of the re- sponsibilities of hospitals. COMING TO GRIPS WITH HOSPITAL COST AND QUALITY ISSUES The staggering increase in hospital costs experiences over the long run, and the acceleration of the increases since Medicare and MediCal, is an urgent mat- ter that group purchasers who are responsive to their members cannot ignore. Out-of-pocket costs of covered members are going up as fast as the value of hos- pital benefits declines. Yet we know what costs cannot be discussed in a vacuum without relating them to quality considerations, advancements in the health and uedical sciences, and related technological changes. CCHPA is not looking for \"bargain basement\" health services. That is why we have asked CHA to make all the facts available that will help to explain the sharp rise in hospital charges since Medicare. In this connection we know wages alone could not begin to explain increases of the magnitude experienced. In fact, we have no tolerance whatsoever for the viewpoint that singles out rising labor costs in hospitals as the chief culprit. Apart fromn what appears to be the case that hospital charges are going up faster than unit labor costs, it should be recognized that labor costs are in fact going up in hospitals because they should be going up. It is intolerable to think that a nation spending $50 billion a year on health care should require, at the same time, a public subsidy from low-income hospital workers through the acceptance of substandard wages and conditions. From the viewpoint of thinking consumers, substandard wages and conditions are incompatible with the high quality of services demanded by consumers. It's that simple to us. Hospitals can't score any public relations points by blam- ing low-income hospital workers and other underpaid persons, while ignoring a host of other considerations relating to the way services are planned and orga- nized-considerations that vitally affect what the consumer is getting for his money. What is important to the consumer in connection with hospital labor costs is how hospital administrators respond to the new set of economic considera- tions which come into play as labor costs go up. In a sellers market, like the one that exists for providers of health care services, the easiest and most irresponsible thing to do is simply pass the increases on to consumers. It would be considerably more responsible, although more troublesome, to explore ways of making offsetting 'adjustments, as for example: -by introducing more efficient administrative practices. -by introducing labor saving measures and finding ways of organizing work so that professionals and paramedical personnel are regularly employed at their highest skill levels, consistent with quality considerations. -by abandoning under-utilized, high cost services which can be provided just as effectively and more efficiently in the community through other facilities. To the extent that hospitals take the easier path of charging what the traffic will bear, while simultaneously denying consumers full access to financial data and information on how costs are allocated for rate setting purposes, they are simply helping to build a case against themselves for regulation as public utilities. It would be wise policy for hospitals to recognize that the days are limited in the future when they will be able to increase rates without being fully accountable to the public. Whether or not it comes through public utility regulations, group purchasers will increasingly demand accountability. These observations are not intended to imply that we cannot see the inevita- bility of some substantial cost increases in the future, apart from the questions of wage costs. The Council can appreciate the fact that hospitals have histori- cally been institutions for those who are seriously ill, and the fact that the cost of medical care has gone up as medical knowledge has advanced and as treatment procedures in hospitals have become more elaborate. It does not follow, however, that hospitals are now powerless to do anything about rising labor costs associated with medical progress. As I have already indicated, CCHPA is also concerned about hospital costs in the context in which hospital services are organized in the community to meet the health needs of the community. Our over-riding concerns are (1) that hospital facilities and services of highest quality be available to all persons;COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 797 (2) that they be organized so that they are readily accessible to all persons:(3) that they be made available and accessible without wasteful duplicationand undesirable proliferation of services; and (4) that hospital facilities andservices be provided in balance with other health facilities and services to meetthe total health needs of the population.In short, CCHPA looks at hospitals costs in relation to how hospital servicesare organized in the community and how hospitals are used in the community.We see no hope for keeping hospital costs in check outside of a framework foreffective planning of hospital and related facilities and services at the localand regional levels. Hospitals must not only accept the necessity of planning;they must actively participate in the voluntary planning process to help makeit fully effective. Health planning is essentially a local and regional respon-sibility that simply cannot be passed upward to higher levels of governmentor community organization. Planning at the local level must be compatible.in its values and in its planning criteria, with planning at higher levels ofcommunity organization all the way up to the federal government.Today. we know that the experience with voluntary health facilities and serv-ices planning in California has been very uneven and that it leaves *a greatdeal to be desired. Much of the hospital planning has hardly gotten beyond the\"bricks and mortar\" stage. Well defined planning criteria are largely nonexistent.Wasteful duplication of facilities, equipment, and services is not the rare excep-tion-it is still a common occurrence. More importantly, much of the hospitalplanning is going forward without adequate consideration being given to plan-ning for other health facilities and services, such as extended care facilities,home health services, diagnostic centers and other out-patient services.Hospitals have a special responsibility, not to try to dominate health facilitiesand services planning, but to participate in it and to put an end to costly dupli-cation and undesirable proliferation of services wherever they exist. Too oftendecisions on expansion, renovation, the purchase of expensive equipment, andthe addition of new services are made not on the basis of community needs-the availability, the accessability and the quality of the facilities and servicesto 'be provided-but on the basis of convenience to doctors who practice in thehospital and on the 'basis of their desire to have everything available to themin the hospital regardless of utilization experience or availability of serviceselsewhere in the community. Too often, also, hospitals have a tendency to wanteverything other hospitals have in the way of facilities, equipment and services,regardless of whether the community needs them.Voluntary planning must stop this kind of wasteful and senseless competition.The inevitable rise in hospital costs related to advances in medical knowledgeand the use of more complicated procedures is enough to be borne 'by consumers,without the toleration of wasteful practices. Voluntary planning, if is is to beeffective in controlling costs, must make hospitals truly responsive to commu-nity needs, and at the same time strengthen the hand of hospitals so that theymay withstand those pressures of doctors which may run contrary to commu-nity needs in the planning and development of hospital facilities and services.It follows that this can be achieved only if informed consumers are effectivelyinvolved in the planning process and become the domiant voice in the directionof the voluntary planning process.CCHIPA should be able to count on hospitals to take the lead among providersin developing the consumer role in the planning process. In recent years, we havecome a long way in our acceptance of consumer participation. We have prog-ressed from no representation to token representation, and now to the require-ment that consumers be in the majority on all health planning bodies. Thismajority, however, too often functions -as a facade for continued dominationof the planning process 'by providers. We must find ways of moving beyond thisfacade. In our effort to strengthen the concept of voluntary planning for hospital andrelated facilities and services, we must give special attention to breaking downthe barriers that separate large groups of consumers from effective participationin the planning process, particularly in regard to the participation of minorityand disadvantaged groups whose unmet health needs should 'be given high pri-ority in the planning process. CCIIPA urges your support in this effort.We do not delude ourselves that the development of active consumer interestin the planning process can be achieved without a great exercise of responsi-bility on the part of consumers themselves and those who represent them asgroup purchasers, including organized labor. Apathy is not our only problem 24-798-69-pt 3-13798 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Our foremost problem is overcoming ignorance concerning the planning process and its vital importance to cost and quality problems of interests to labor and other consumers. Because of the importance of consumer participation, the state, our universities, and providers should make a special effort to develop educational programs which will help all consumers involved in the planning process to identify health planning issues and problems as they relate to the total health needs of the population, especially the unmet needs of the under- privileged. PLANNING REQUIRES BROAD BASE We have learned many additional lessons from our experience with health fa- cilities and services planning in California during this decade. One of the most important is that the voluntary planning process cannot move forward unless existing facilities assume responsibility for planning their own future in refer- ence to the health needs of the community. We have come to accept planning as a process-not some kind of master plan-a process which starts with how facilities perceive their roles in the community in which they are located. It is at this level that local and regional planning agencies can help existing facilities evaluate community needs and adapt their planning to those needs. without the duplication and proliferation of services and facilities that push up costs to the consumer. The essence of such planning is not alone that it be done, but that the plans themselves should be made public through local and regional planning agencies along with all the supporting information used in developing them. Without this kind of planning and full disclosure of information, it is virtually impossible for consumers who sit on planning agencies to give direction to the planning process so that steps may be taken to take care of community needs that are unaccounted for in the planning of existing facilities. One of the major responsibilities of the consumer in the planning process is not only to encourage innovations among existing facilities and to experiment with new ways of providing health services more effectively, but to make sure innovation and experimentation is stimulated in the community when the plans of existing facilities fall short of community needs or fail to come to grips with the problems encountered by consumers in obtaining quality health care. In keeping with these expressed views, our Council members agree with the recommendation adopted recently by the State Hospital and Related Health Facilities and Services Planning Committee (the so-called \"543\" Committee) in its report to the state legislature. The recommendation, in part, reads as follows: \"In cooperation with regional and local health facilities and services planning groups, each health facility in California should develop both a current and a 5-year program for capital expenditure, for replacement, modernization, and expansion. Such programs should be kept up to date and on file with the local and regional planning agencies, through the development of continuing cooper- ative relationships between the facilities and the planning agencies. They should include a statement of the facility's responsibility to the community in at least the following areas: the people to be served; the area to be covered; the services to be provided; the facility's relationship with other facilities; and the timing and costs of implementing the program.\" To repeat, it is crucial that these programs and all the information developed to support them be handled as public information. This means specifically that they should be available not only to 'the planners, but to the public at large, especially anyone initiating new facilities and those contemplating expenditures for the replacement, modernization and expansion of other health facilities and services. We share the view that voluntarism seems to work best when government provides a few financial incentives in support of the process. In this connection the \"543\" Committee has suggested that in the administration of MediCal, the State Health and Welfare Agency should not include in its reimbursement form- ula for costs any allowance for depreciation to facilities that do not cooperate with regional and local planning agencies in the development and disclosure of their plans. We heartily agree with this viewpoint. But the Council would go further and suggest that facilities unwilling to assume their planning responsibil- ities toward the public, and unwilling to stand behind their planning with health planning groups, should not be allowed to participate in health care programs financed by the public. Labor organizations and other group purchasers wouldCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 799 do well to follow this lead in their payments to health facilities involved intheir programs. Some might argue that planning under these circumstances is hardly volun-tary. It all depends upon how one looks at the concept of voluntarism in thekind of system we have developed in this country to defer the cost of healthservices. Private group purchasers and government programs have becomethe collection and disbursement agencies for the bulk of the population. Thosefacilities that want to go it alone ought to be willing to go it alone all the way.For the fact of the matter remains that even under the most favorable planningcircumstances, the cost of hospitalization can impose an unncessarily heavyburden on group purchase programs when hospitals are misused.A number of studies have uncovered a disturbing amount of unnecessary utili-zation of hospitals under health care programs. To the consumer, the escalationof costs that results from over utilization of expensive facilities is no less a factorin the deterioration of the medical dollar that the rising costs of hospitaland pesonal health services as such. In fact, the cost of over-utilization is per-haps more disturbing than other forms of medical inflation because it suggeststhat there may be something very wrong with the balance of benefits in healthcare programs. It would be unfair, of course, to place all the blame on hospitals when unneces-sary utilization occurs. After all, it is the doctor who controls admissions andwho orders the services and determines the length of stays. He is the personwho must assume final responsibility through the functioning of hospital reviewcommittees. Yet, organized labor and other group purchasers cannot escape their share ofthe responsibility. Negotiated programs, like most voluntary health plans, empha-size hospital care at the expense of grossly inferior coverage of outpatient serv-ices. This imbalance in benefit structures distorts patterns of utilization of healthservices and undoubtedly lies behind a great deal of misuse or overuse of hos-pitals. Labor knows this, and is seeking the assistance of providers to correctthe imbalance. At the same time, however, we cannot overlook the misuse of hospitals thatoccurs because of the unavailability in the community of other facilities andservices that could be used just as effectively, or more effectively, to take care ofthe patient's needs at a lower cost. Mry reference is to the person whose stay in the hospital is stretched out, forexample, because quality extended care facilities are not readily available; tothe patient who winds up in a hospital because he does not have access to goodhome health services; and to others who find it difficult to obtain diagnosticservices in the community without being hospitalized. To the extent that this occurs, we must turn again to the hospitals, the doctorsand others involved in the health planning process for relief. There no longer isany room for buck-passing, for the day of providing for hospital-based servicesin splendid isolation from all other facilities and services needed in the com-munity is rapidly drawing to a close. The sheer magnitude of our growing healthneeds, and the pressures being exerted on existing health resources, make intol-erable the waste associated with this kind of fragmented planning.All of us-individual consumers, providers, vendors, and group purchasers-must come to grips with the basic issues confronting us concerning the organi-zation of health services. Are we interested only in caring for the sick, or arewe primarily interested in maintaining health?-Or shouldn't we be interestedin both? Hospitals have operated primairly as institutions for healing the sick. Doesit follow that they should only be interested in doing a good job for people whoget sick and need hospitalization, or should they be equally interested in keepingpeople well and out of hospitals? There can be no choice for group purchasers of health care services. Organizedlabor is interested in both. We seek your assistance along with other providersto do both better. FOCUIS ON HEALTH As a matter of national policy, the focus today in the health care field is cur-rently on the development of comprehensive systems for delivering health serv-ices and maintaining health. Furthermore. planning for facilities and servicesunder federal comprehensive planning is recognized only within the context oftotal health needs. Health facilities and services planning, in fact, must now be800 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS effectively related to planning for personal health servicesn manpowver develop- .ment, and environmental health. We hope hospital groups will accept this as a challenge to break new ground in the provision of services to the community. As recommended by the State \"543\" Committee, special attention needs to be given \"to the development of new systems for delivering health services, especially to meet the needs of the under- privileged and those whose life styles are not compatible with the manner in which health services are currently organized and delivered.\" Those of us involved in the work of the Council, as representatives of group purchasers of health services, would welcome the opportunity to develop new group service plans in cooperation with hospitals and others interested in expand- ing their out-patient services. We simply cannot ignore our 15 years of experi- ence with negotiated programs, which has taught us that money alone does not assure good health care. We have learned the hard way that medical inflation, in part, is the product of irresponsibility of group purchasers who dump millions of dollars into the so-called mainstream without demanding a voice in how medi- cal resources are used and organized. While our dollars have fed the inflationary tires. they have done preciously little to stimulate more efficient use of resources. We have bargained hard to remove the financial barriers to good medical care for the sick, but in the process we have largely forgotten about the needs of our members to stay healthy. Even more seriously, we have contributed to the growth and entrenchment of a system of delivering health services that is not only plagued by rigidities, but is basically incompatible with the level of health edu- cation and life styles for many in our population. I am not only talking about the underprivileged for whom the promise of main- stream health care becomes a mockery without developing new medical delivery systems that penetrate their environment and the socio-economic problems that confront them in our urban society. I am also talking about many of our union members and their families in the so-called middle class of America who also have difficulty in using the prevailing delivery system, even when we try to remove the financial barriers. It is true that in the development of our groups programs, we have talked a great deal about experimentation. In practice. however, we have done very little to make effective alternative programs available to our members and to others in the population who have become all but medically disenfranchised in a health-care sense. A burning desire to change our ways lies behind the formation and the work of the Council. In a very real sense, the Council is the spontaneous product of years of frustration in dealing with vendors and other special interests whom we have allowed to engulf our islands of health plans and to decimate our bar- gaining power and ability to effect change-the necessary change that today can no longer be held back. With the new focus on health, brought about by Medicare, the development of state and regional medical programs, and the requirement of comprehensive plan- ning under federal law, we believe that the time for action is now. We have served notice on the vendors that while we cannot do without health facilities and the professionals who provide health services through them, we can do without the vendors. We are therefore turning today more directly to the providers to deal with the staggering problems confronting group purchasers of health services. Our surface focus may appear to be simply on controlling costs, but our real interest is on controlling costs by finding more effective ways of providing health services for people. The experimentation we desire may be more expen- sive when measured only in terms of providing medical care for the sick, but not in terms of maintaining health, which is our ultimate objective. If hospitals today are prepared to take a fresh look at health maintenance problems, then we invite those interested to work cooperatively with the Council and interested doctors so that together we may begin some serious experimenta- tion with new ways of relating the use of in-patient facilities to the development of out-patient services to lessen the need for hospitalization and help keep people well Immediately, the idea of hospital-linked out-patient clinics and neighbor- hood health centers comes to mind, based on the development of comprehensive prepaid group practice arrangements. We are very much interested in this ap- proach, but we do not want to rule out experimentation with entirely new ways of bringing both solo and group practices into contact with out-patient servicesCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 801 that are specifically organized and designed to break down utilization barriers,to increase the level of health awareness, to provide for early detection of disease,and to promote more meaningful doctor-patient relationships on a continuingbasis. Some doctors, of course, may view such experimentation as a threat to solopractice arrangements, but it is too late to placate those who fear the eom-petition of group practice arrangements. Group practice is every bit as profes-sional as solo practice, and we know that quality can be good or bad in both. Weare not out to destroy solo practice. Our goal is to provide a full range of alterna-tives available to group purchasers and to individual consumers, including alter-natives that reach the individual who is clearly unable for any number of reasonsto use the existing system effectively. To those who still fear the Council's motives, we invite them to help us buildinto everything we do quality standards that are beyond reproach and beyondanything in operation today in the mainstream of health care.In concluding, some of you may be wondering-why hospitals? Why shouldthey be singled out to give special attention to the organization and provisionof out-patient services? There is really no answer, except that hospitals tradi-tionally have been the focus of medical care as it is practiced in this country.Doctors are brought together through hospitals at the most esteemed level ofmedical practice. Operating through their hospital committees, doctors have sethigh standards of performance for themselves while they are practicing in hos-pitals-standards which have no counterpart in their solo out-patient practiceof medicine. If hospitals can bring the best out of doctors when they are practicing in theirinstitutions, then it is logical that hospitals should try to help bring the best outof them when they are providing health services outside the hospital, especiallysince the quality, scope and organization of out-patient services are vital factorsaffecting hospital admissions. In any event, it appears to us that hospitals are slowly evolving into healthcenters, which we believe they should have been all along. It remains to be seenwho will rise to the challenge and who will sit back; who will help to builda healthier state and nation, and who will try to hold onto those delivery sys-tems and organizational concepts that are rapidly losing their viability andvalidity for increasing numbers in our society. We both have our work cut outfor us. ITEM 1.5: LETTER FROM PAUL D. WARD. EXECCUTIVE DIRECTOR,CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE ON REGIONAL MEDICAL PROGRAMS, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIF. October 15, 1968. DEAR SENATOR Wn.LIA-MS: Your Subcommittee has already received extensivetestimony relative to the problems our elderly population encounters in obtaininghealth care. The hearings in California undoubtedly will reinforce testimonyalready received. but probably will produce no problems which have not alreadybeen brought out. Before dealing with specifics in regard to Regional MedicalPrograms, I would like to discuss briefly the major areas already brought beforeyour Subcommittee. HEALTH MANPOWER The severe present and predicted future shortages of health professionals,particularly physicians, nurses, and dentists have created problems in obtainingmedical care for all age groups. In fact, it is possible that the incentive feestructures of Medicare and Medicaid have increased the provision of servicesfor the elderly in some communities to the point that good medical care, andparticularly preventive medical services, for the younger age groups has dimin-ished in availability. It is obvious that expanded or new governmental programsto pay for services rendered will not increase the capacity of the schools ofmedicine, nursing and dentistry. In fact, conversely, they may make it morerewarding for able instructors to stay out of teaching. Hence, it is imperativeas coverage or benefits expand in governmental or insurance third party pay-ment programs that equal emphasis be given to creation of additional educa-tional facilities and incentives which will lead competent professionals to enterthe teaching fields.802 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS ALLIED HEALTH PERSONNEL There has been wide discussion in the health field of developing new \"sub- professional\" or \"allied health\" personnel, or expanding the legitimate functions of lower level professionals in order to lessen the work load on physicians, nurses and others who are in short supply. In California recent joint agreements be- tween the medical, nursing and hospital organizations as well as changes in the state law have expanded the legitimate functions of RNs and LVNs. While such actions are undoubtedly helpful in some instances, they do nothing to add to the absolute numbers of health care personnel available-they merely push some of the work down the line and create acute manpower problems at lower levels. The only solution to the manpower problem is more training for more persons at all levels. Every resource should be utilized: teacher incentives, subsidized facilities, scholarships, loans, and outright subsidy of trainees. The health professions must be made available to qualified and interested applicants from all levels of our society, not merely to those qualified applicants who can afford the hight cost of such training. PAYMENT FOR SERVICES Mulch testimony has been presented to your subcommittee regarding the methods of payment for services, particularly through Medicare and Medicaid. The use of the fee-for-service approach. especially the physician profile, has been seriously attacked as provided for unbridled escalation of fees and incentives for over-utilization. It has also been described as deleterious to the development of group practice. Without doubt, the unscrupulous provider can profit unfairly under this-but he will find a way to do so under any system. He can gradually increase his fees and he can have patients return again and again for unnecessary visits. I feel a note is indicated here to attempt once again to put to rest the mis- information that was widely publicized about the California Medi-Cal pro- gram. that 1200 physicians averaged over $70,000 each during the first year. The figure of 1200 represented that number of \"vendor codes.\" most of these. in turn. representing physician groups. In one instance it was a group of 123 physicians. Investigation of those few solo practitioners who received large amounts of money revealed, in most instances, that the payments were justified. These were high volume doctors who worked long hours six and seven days a week in ghetto areas and who represented virtually the only medical services available to the residents. While the fee-for-service system undoubtedly has its drawbacks and oppor- tunities for abuse, one must consider the alternatives and their potential dis- advantages. It is obvious from the testimony presented to the subcommittee that a clinic type approach with salaried physicians would not be very popular with anyone. Both professionals and elderly individuals testified about the long wait- ing periods and excessive travel requirements involved in clinic medicine. Yet there was some indication that a few preferred clinics and in some areas these were the only places care could be obtained. The other alternative is the \"capitation\" method of payment. This means just what it says. a payment \"per head\" on a fiat monthly or annual basis for pro- viding all necessary professional services for a predetermined group of people. It provides a guaranteed income for the doctor regardless of how many or how few services he must provide. This method is not as foreign to American medi- cine or the American people as one might think. For years it has been a common method of providing well-child care in the private practice of pediatrics for the first two or three years of life. It is of course. the basis of the HIP, Kaiser and Ross Loos program as well as a number of other smaller family group practice plans. It is being developed on a private basis in some places through such organizations as American Medical Services in Los Angeles. If properly used, the capitation method is a stimulus to the practice of pre- ventive care-it is of obvious financial advantage to keep the patient well, and to discover disease in its early and less costly stages, than to wait until the patient is seriously ill. Conversely, there is a danger of under-utilization, a p ossible tendency to not see the patient often enough. Regrettably, the only conclusion one can read from this is that any method will require either external or internal review until the system adjusts to the new demands. The other disadvantage, if it is such, of the capitation method is the possi- ble violation of the principle of \"free choice\" of provider, which was written into the 1967 amendments to Title XIX. Obviously, the method gives a competi-COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 803 tive advantage to group practice, as more comprehensive services, it is argued. can be offered at presumably lower rates per person. Perhaps some objective conclusions in the organization of medical services, which are not in evidence now, should be a goal of government programs of health care for the aging. The overall patterns of care will not change rapidly but at least the change that is encouraged should be based on fact since no single type of organization fits all situations. The dilemma is to be able to encourage new approaches with- out isolating the individuals concerned from high quality care or making care so difficult to obtain that for all practicable purposes it does not exist. DISTRIRUTION OF HEALTH SERVICES The availability of medical care both for the elderly and the young in our population varies widely according to economic, cultural and ethnic character- istics of the patient population. Your subcommittee has heard much testimony on the diminishing numbers of physicians, dentists and others in the ghetto areas of our cities, taking place simultaneously with increases in the population and crowding of these areas. One attack on this problem is the dispersal of population through low-cost housing and urban development programs. and through long range changes in social acceptance of these groups outside the ghetto. These important, and in fact imperative, changes will be a long time in realization. In the meantime steps must be taken to bring services to these areas. No amount of increase in total health manpower will help if some trained pro- fessionals do not locate in the areas of need. Every possible known and innovative method should be explored and tested in an effort to increase available services in these areas. Obviously, in spite of the widely publicized \"opportunities to get rich\" through Medicare and Medicaid, the financial incentives of these programs have not proved sufficient to reverse the trend of professionals to move out. Perhaps these programs have encouraged outward movement as a physician or dentist can now meet his income expectations in better neighborhoods without working as hard. We are watching the West Oakland experiment under U.S.P.H.S. auspices with great interest as it represents one way of attempting to solve this problem. The Regional Medical Program, as you are aware, is not designed to increase the total amount of health services available. It must work with existing resources and without disturbing existing patterns of delivery of health care. RMP can (and to date largely has been designed to) increase the level of health care through increasing the availability of specialized medical services. However, in a limited manpower market, such efforts must necessarily be at the expense of basic health services. It was the quite obvious intent of Congress that RIMP should not endeavor to create a whole new system of health care. In fact, perhaps the restrictions placed upon facilities and basic health care education make it virtually impossible for RMP to contribute materially to overall quantity of health care available. From the standpoint of quality, RMP certainly is designed to effect improve- ments in the care of those persons afflicted with one of the categorical diseases or in imminent danger of becoming so afflicted. As indicated above, however, since we are \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\" we could end up reducing the quality of general health care available for the population as a whole. A cadre of highly trained physicians and nurses staffing a coronary care unit on a ratio of three professionals to one patient can well mean a shortage of personnel in the medical and surgical services of the same hospital. RMP needs to be tied more closely to other programs, not just in health but in general socio-economic developments. Our relationships with Comprehensive Health Planning are loose at best and nonexistent in many areas. yet the two programs which share so many common goals should be moving in close coordina- tion. I fear there is fault on both sides of this problem. RMP has drifted too much into control by medical schools or medical center officials and CHP too much into the hands of facilities-oriented planners. Both seem to function under the same basic philosophy. i.e., if they do their job well (increased and improved teaching or increased and improved buildings and equipment) more and better patient services will infallibly result. This is not necessarily true. Most patient care is still given by physicians in their private offices who are too busy to spend much time on postgraduate education. A few RMP projects, such as the Roseville Pilot Program in California. are attempting to get at this problem, but the bulk of the programs are still specialized training for specialists and are hospital or medical school based. Perhaps RMP's greatest contribution eventually will come through the stimula- tion and support of preventive medical services. It is here that the greatest hopeS04 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS lies for a healthier, happier population, future economies, and a partial solution to the manpower problem. The developers of the objectives for RMP in Cali- fornia have put great stress on multiphasic screening. Since it is a practical impossibility for every citizen to receive an annual physical examination by a physician, multiphasic screening must be extended in coverage and expanded in comprehensiveness for the discovery of early disease or, even better, precursor signs or symptoms. To date, in California, RMP has not financed multiphasic programs of significant comprehensiveness. One small project of limited scope is a part of the Roseville program. However, it is my feeling that multiphasic screening, broad in scope and coverage, along with other preventive medical pro- grams has great promise and should be a prime RMP objective. Finally, there has come to my attention the enclosed clipping from the San Francisco Chronicle describing the Hunters Point-Bayview Community Health Service. It brings to mind another subject which has received little attention until recently, that is the inability to understand, and therefore to effectively utilize. existing systems of medical care on the part of the elderly and culturally deprived citizens of our nation. Under the \"mainstream\" and \"free choice\" concepts of the public medical care programs of Medicare and 3Medicaid, government employ- ees have been strickly prohibited from directing, or advising beneficiaries. to seek appropriate sources of care for their problems. These programs have been bill- paying mechanisms only. The result has been hapless shopping around, referral and counter referral, outright solicitation on the part of some questionable providers, some provision of unnecessary services, significant waste of valuable professional time, and often deleterious fragmentation of care for many persons. This San Francisco experiment is an attempt to provide what has just recently appeared in the jargon of health as a \"patient advocate\" or \"health ombudsman.\" Plans for the Northeast Medcial Center in San Francisco's Chinatown are being developed very much along the lines of the Hunters Point project, but are in a far more embryonic stage. A decision has not yet been made, for example, whether funding should be sought through DHEW or OEO channels. The main intent of the center, once in operation, will be to find and encourage individuals of all ages who are not now properly cared for in the basically Chinese and Italian population of the area to see doctors reguarly and, in the fashionable phrase, get them back in \"the mainstream of medicine.\" RMP is currently developing many programs to provide superlative care for the seriously ill person. However, the first line of defense against serious illness and disability rests on the capability of the system to provide elementary general health services. It is there, when the patient presents himself for rela- tively less significant problems, that the first elevated blood pressure can be detected, that cigarette smoking habits can be noted and discussed, or that early increased blood or urine sugar levels can be found. Hence, it appears to me that programs such as Hunter's Point in San Francisco have as much implication for RMP as the highly skilled services of a speech therapist working with a man who has had his larynx removed. If a full scale attack is to be mounted on heart disease, cancer and stroke, people must be assisted in utilizing appropri- ately the first line medical services already available. This has been a somewhat lengthy reply to your letter. If I had to reduce it to one statement I think I would say that the elderly are only one segment of complex of groups in our population that are medically underprivileged and that a great deal more vision has to be exercised in a total attack on the health care problems of our entire population than that shown to date, progressive and visionary as it has been. Sincerely, PAUL D. WARD, Executive Director. [Enclosures]. EXHIBIT A: ARTICLE Fromc THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE, \"SPREADING THE MEDICAL WORD IN HUNTERS POINT' [From the San Francisco Chronicle, Oct. 9, 196S] SPREADING THE MEDICAL WORD IN HUNTERS POINT (By David Pernman, science correspondent) Somewhere out in the Hunters Point-Bayview part of town there's an old man. handicapped by a stroke, who sits in his room alone-more a psychological cripple than a physical one.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 805 There are kids out there with decaying teeth-not because their parents don'tcare, but because they are too unsophisticated to know where to find dental help.Infants are being born prematurely to malnourished mothers-not becausefood is so scarce, but because the pathway to adequate prenatal medical careand diet instruction is an unfamiliar one. The fact that public funds exist topay the bills may even be unknown. Attack These are the sorts of problems that will be attacked from now on by a newfederally financed program designed to change the basic life-style-and with it the health-of thousands of low-income families. The program, which begins this month, is called the Hunters Point-BayviewCommunity Health Service. It is armed with a $705,000 grant from the PublicHealth Service, and it is projected to continue for the next five years at a totalcost of $5 million. Details of the project were discussed yesterday by Dr. Arthur H. Coleman,its director, at a press conference at the service's new headquarters at 5815Third street. Impediments As Dr. Coleman noted, the problem for people in the project area is not thatmedical care is poor-it's excellent, in fact. But far too many potential patients-particularly black patients-have profound psychological and social impedi-ments to seeking care at all. So the new community service will not actually provide medical treatment.Rather. it will deploy four health teams of public health nurses, social workersand \"social health technicians\" to encourage families to use private medical anddental offices in the traditional \"free choice\" manner of more affluent families. Job Where patients are eligible for Medi-Cal or Medicare or welfare services, thehealth teams will show them how to qualify. The health teams also will offerpsychological help and nutrition instruction. In many cases the communityservice will help pay bills that aren't covered by insurance or Medi-Cal. Of interest to the Public Health Service will be an evaluation of the programyear by year. For it actually represents a major departure from other medicalprojects in low-income areas. In San Francisco. for example, the Poverty Program is now financing a Mis-sion Neighborhood Health Center, where salaried physicians actually providecomprehensive care in a full-fledged medical facility. Dual \"It is our feeling,\" said Dr. Coleman, \"that the neighborhood center or clinicis a dual system of medical care-a special center for poor people. We hope toshow that we can provide first-class care for our patients through the same kindof private medicine that all other sections of the population receive.\" EXHIBIT 1: RELATIONSHIP OF THE HEALTH POWER STRUCTURE TO REGIONAL AGCTrIITIES (By Paul D. Ward, delivered at RAIP Coordinators' Conference, Arlington. Va., Sept. 30, 1968) When I accepted this assignment to speak to you on this subject. I did so withsome trepidation. To many of my associates in this program the need to acknowl-edge the existence of \"pressure groups.\" \"power blocks,\" \"special interest groups,\"or whatever you may desire to call them is in itself a deplorable factor. Onesometimes gets the feeling that those who do engage in the art of obtainingconsensus from various pressure groups for any given goal are indeed practicingsome form of Satanism. It is like being the father of Rosemary's baby withoutever having known Rosemary. The only solace I take in all of this is to notethat when the connotation of evil is applied to any grouping, it is always theother man's organization that is evil. We only belong to good groups to protectourselves from the advances of those other groups. Anyone who admits seeingsome good in the vast majority of the groups. and who tries to mold portions oftheir efforts together in order to obtain a working consensus in which progresstoward a given goal can be made, becomes contaminated with the \"other man's\"evil. Further, to openly admit that you are a broker in pressure groups is to admit806 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS that you are a member of none-in effect isolated--and sitting as if naked atop a beehive, not knowing whether you're about to be seduced by the queen bee or attacked by her suitors. That is why there is some danger, at least to me, in this topic of discussion, \"and I must add I feel must as Lincoln must have felt as he was being ridden out of a small southern town on a rail after the Emancipa- tion Proclamation: \"If it wasn't for the honor of it all, I'd just as soon walk.\" To those of you who would practice the art of obtaining consensus and keep quiet about it, there is little danger. In fact, at times it can be quite rewarding if you can find a way to silently give yourself credit for that which has been accomplished in the names of others. I fear, however, that like all voluntary collective efforts in the social field, observable progress toward a given humane goal is all, and should be all, the reward we should expect. The legislative frame- work, the Congressional committee imperatives and the guidelines offer a unique opportunity to determine on a broad national scale whether or not the compo- nents of the health power structure can work together voluntarily for the general good of the public. It may not be virgin territory upon which we are treading, but at least it is wild enough to make life interesting. LEGAL MANDATES What are the specific mandates set forth by the law and Congress that we are obligated to observe insofar as the health power structure is concerned? It seems to me that there are at least three main postulations that we must be aware of. The first is the wording of the law itself. Sec. 903 states that grants under this section may be made only if the advisory group includes \"practicing physicians, hospital administrators, representatives from appropriate medical societies, vol- untary health agencies and representatives of other organizations.\" Secondly, Sec. 904 which covers operational grants states that they may be made only if \"recommended by the advisory group\" as described in Sec. 903. This type of language gave virtually unique recognition in the legislation itself to the re- gional health power structure. This recognition in effect took the form of the right to veto. Thirdly, Congress went even further in its subsequent reports on the program. It used the term \"voluntary partnership\" when referring to research centers, practicing physicians and community hospitals, indicating a co-equal status. Hearings this year brought out the very deep concern on the part of Congress that components of the health power structure may not be involved uniformly in all regions to the degree Congress intended. Some sentiment on the part of the national health power structure tended to support this position although it was pointed out that the problems were sporadic in nature. At this point in time, Congress seems determined that there be a co-equal in- volvement of components of the health power structure, not only in the design of the program but in its operational surveillance as well. How does one determine what constitutes the health power structure? In this case the law is unusually clear. It identifies medical center officials, hospital administrators, practicing physicians, representatives from \"appropriate\" medi- cal societies, \"appropriate\" voluntary health agencies, and other organizations, institutions and agencies concerned with activities in WNIP plus informed public members. The statute uses key modifiers, in effect, to identify the power structure that legally must be involved in the decision making processes of the program. Unlike the typical legislation which establishes citizens advisory committees, this act specifies that certain specific kinds of representatives must, not may. be included on the advisory committee. It generally follows that at least Congress looked upon these classifications as the primary power structure involved. From a practical point of view there may be others, but they are not legally specified. As an example, at least one governor unofficially proclaimed his state a region and apparently his remarks carried some weight. At least one state legislature caused a shotgun marriage between RIMP and Community Health Planning and seemingly those involved took note of this act. Whether the mar- riage has been consummated only the principals can attest. Although these extra-legal forces are important, time does not permit their discussion here except to mention the fact that eventually we will have to deal with public health power blocks such as those interested in O.E.O. facilities, model cities programs, Medi-Care and Medicaid, Crippled Children programs, health planning councils and Community Health Planning, among others.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 807 INTENT OF CONGRESS Some interesting conclusions can be drawn from the unique language used by Congress to establish RMP. First, the program was described as a \"part-nership\" implying an equal role in the decision making process by the partnersinvolved. The only mechanism provided in the act for exercising this role wasthe advisory group which must advise on and approve the actions of the region.Later, Congress used the term \"oversee.\" Secondly, the term \"medical center official\" was used in place of a 'repre-sentative of medical centers.\" An official is one with the authority to commithis organization or institution to a given course of action.Thirdly, it spoke specifically of \"hospital administrators,\" not representatives of hospitals. This again implied a specific level of authority and function withinthe hospital world. If further implies that this person or persons would havethe authority to speak for others in his category.Fourthly, the act specifies both \"practicing physicians\" and representatives of \"appropriate medical societies.\" The modifier \"practicing\" would simply dif-ferentiate this physician from those who might be in administrative or other ca-pacities. But the modifier \"appropriate\" would seem to have more specific con-notations. From the legislative history we must assume that this was to be aperson with the authority to speak for organized medicine in the region. Evenwithout the benefit of the legislative history, \"appropriate\" logically would referto the organization that historically has had the greatest policy impact on medi-cal practice, the most significant legal impact, and geographically covers thearea concerned. In the vast majority of the cases, \"appropriate\" could only meanthe state medical society. There are situations when in multi-state regions morethan one state society must be represented and there is at least one instance inwhich the state society may be described as slightly bifurcated but there can belittle doubt as to the general appropriateness of state societies.Fifthly, the same modifier, \"appropriate,\" is used to describe voluntary healthagency representatives, as members of the legal advisory group. Again, thestructure, function, and coverage of each voluntary health agency would deter-mine the appropriateness-that is, whether it should be the statewide organiza-tion that is involved, or some other level. But, from a practical point of view, it would seem that RMIP would wantto associate itself with the voluntary health agencies at the point in the agency'sstructure where the major policy decisions are made. This point differs to some extent among the voluntary agencies from state to state. It is evidentthat to take full advantage of the relationship with the voluntary agency,RMP has to be plugged in at the decision making point, the point at whichnew programs are designed, objectives set, data accumulated and stored, fi-nancial determinations made and general organizational policy established andexecuted. In most cases, this appears to be the state-wide organization. Not to involve the voluntary associations at the policy making point will result in much dupli-cative effort and the lack of ability to fully utilize all of their existing re-sources on a coordinated basis. More important, perhaps, is the difficulty inobtaining a definite commitment for support of RMP objectives if this rela-tionship does not exist at the policy making and management level. Agree-ment on issues without the authority to commit support, funds or resourcesis as worthless as pursuing the vote of citizens of Washington, D.C. for aVirginia election. Even though representatives may be chosen from the \"appropriate\" body-that is, chosen from the level within organized medicine, the hospital associa-tion and the voluntary health agencies where the vital decisions are made andthe policy is set-there is more that must be done if progress is to be made.It amounts to giving the partners a sense of confidence that their role in theprogram will not be subverted. This is especially difficult because the relation-ships that have existed in the past between these partners have been extremelylimited and even then. some were viewed with suspicion. Some times those of us who live with the programs tend to forget that amassive amount of planning activity has been thrust upon the health lead-ership. This activity seldom is based on long established, firm relationships;thus, there is bound to be some uncertainty. This uncertainty requires a pro-fuse amount of reassurance and reconciliation to keep the new partnership in-808 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS tact. Let us recognize that this partnership is voluntary, something even less secure than a commonlaw marriage, and until there are abundant children in the form of successful operational projects, it may be hard to keep the faith. ROLE OF REGIONAL COORDINATOR Because of this, I believe it is the Regional Coordinator's role to know intimately the decision making mechanisms of the health power groups pri- marily involved in his region. Not only must he understand the mechan- ics of their decision process, but he has to have a fairly good knowledge of the people involved and what causes them to take the positions that they do. He has to have some assurances that the representatives of the various pow- er groups have the authority to speak for the decision making apparatus with- in their own organization. He has to have some assurance that the power group's organizational framework will back up their representative in con- troversial matters. If the representative's authority is limited, as it is al- most certain to be, the Coordinator should know these limits and compensate for them. The Coordinator is further obligated to back up the representative with his own group by personally providing information and assurances to the de- cision making bodies within the representative's group on matters of controversy. In most cases, this will mean routine appearances before the executive coun- cils of the state hospital association, the state medical society, the various voluntary health organizations and medical center groups. It means, above all, that he has to be prepared to negotiate differences in as amicable an environ- ment as passion will allow. There are other problems within the health power structure that face the more complex region. Although they may not directly affect each of us. at least to the same degree, they nevertheless may have a very profound effect upon the reaction that Congress has to the program. To date, Congress has indicated an unusually favorable reaction, but this reaction could reverse itself if these prob- lems are not dealt with propertly and soon. In my own self defense, I have not mentioned California, and I do not intend to, but let me quote from an article written by a man for whom I have the greatest respect, George James. M.D., Dean of Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, New York. It appeared in \"New York Medicine,\" April 1968. I quote without his permission: REGIONAL MIEDICAL PROGRAMS \"What problems are associated with Regional MIedical Programs and how is New York City going about resolving them? New York City has a particularly difficult problem. Those of you have been associated with the review process of the heart, stroke and cancer program in Washington have noticed that it is very easy for a state with a single state medical school, a single state health depart- ment. and relatively few really vital agencies to organize for a regional program. This is true for some of our Midwestern states where the entire process is very simple with a single state governor, a single state legislature. a single state health department. a single state university with most of the doctors in 'the state being alumni of the state university. All of this makes for a very simple arrangement. \"'In New York City we have seven medical schools; we have a large number of additional sophisticated agencies and institutions. This makes for quite a bit of trouble. It creates major problems for intercommunication among groups which have not been notable for their ability to communicate before. Now, in addition to this. New York City has very great needs, and they are very visible needs. If there are any of you who feel incapable of adequately recognizing these needs, there are at least three dozen agencies in the state that will be very happy to point them out. There is great citizen demand for services.\" Dr. James stated the problem of the complex community clearly and briefly. It is not as easy to isolate, understand describe the decision making process in the areas where the most people are, where the most voters are, where the most Congressmen come from. This poses a far greater problem than most of us realize if you stop to think where the mass of our health problems exist and who votes the dollars in support of the program. As Coordinators and as individuals interested in the health of this nation, we face our greatest challenge during the next two years. We are faced with mar- shalling the health resources of the metropolitan areas which contain our mostCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 809 complex problems in terms of relationships. We have to seek a greater under-standing on the part of all the health power structure that this program, whichall of the leadership seems to prefer, may be significantly modified if momentumis not gained in the highly complex urban areas.At this point in the program if a speaker raises problems, he ought to have somepat solutions to them. Frankly, I do not, except to say that we should proceedas we have been, with more of our energies focused on the urban problems. Weshould not lose sight of the fact that although there have been problems of rela-tionships, they have been relatively minor compared to other programs of thismagnitude and especially programs as unique in approach as this one.It does seem to me that in facing these problems the main challenge to theCoordinators over the next few months will be to maintain the integrity of theprogram. If the partnership concept is lost-that is, if it becomes predominatelya medical society program or a hospital program or a medical center program inplace of a balanced program between the partners-then its lustre and innova-tiveness will be lost. We can develop models and pilot projects until we are inun-dated with the reports involved, but they won't mean a thing unless they areaccepted by the total health manpower through their involvement from theground up. Obviously, there is a price to be paid for involvement, enlarged staffsfor the schools, easier access to continued learning for the professional person,and improved service facilities for the institutions. The test will be the amountof dividends that are paid to the people in terms of better health care.

ITEM 16: QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY THE CHAIRMAN TO CASPAR W. WEINBERGER, DIRECTOR OF FINANCE, STATE OF CALIFORNIA, SACRAMENTO, CALIF. 1. The American Medical Association News of August 2S, 1968, carried a story indicating that the cost of Medi-Cal for the past fiscal year was $20S.1 million, about one-third less than originally predicted. Is this a correct statement? May the Subcommittee have a statement on the reasons for this reduction in antici- pated cost? Answer.-The correct figure for the State of California General Fund estimated cost of Medi-Cal for the fiscal year 1967-1968, as approved by the Legislature in May, 1968, was $232.7 million. This was a reduction in the original estimate of the cost, which was $305 million. This estimate ($305 million) was revised in December of 1967 to $274 million. Reasons for the decline in cost were a decline in utilization of certain services, specifically including dentistry, and the effect of more strict utilization controls imposed as a means of trying to reduce the total cost of the program. The medically needy caseload also showed a slower rate of increase during the second year of operation of the program than had been anticipated based on first-year utilization. 2. How many persons past 65 have been served by the Medi-Cal program since it was established? What kind of treatment have they received? Do you have estimates of average costs for the elderly as compared to other age groups? Answoer.-The total number of persons 65 and over who were eligible for Medi-Cal benefits was 410,900. Based upon an expanded one per cent (1%) sampling of Medi-Cal recipients for the fiscal year 1966-1967, we believe that 337,000, or 82.5 per cent of this number, received some benefits from Medi-Cal during that fiscal year. The categories \"Physicians\" and \"Drugs\" constituted the largest type of treatment received. Of this 65 and older group, almost 10 per cent received nursing home services each month. Unfortunately, our average cost per eligible for those people 65 years and older cannot be used to com- pare utilization and costs between other age groups, because our data do not include Medicare services and costs.APPENDIX 3 REPORT ON MEDI-CAL PROGRAM, BY CALIFORNIA DE- PARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND RESPONSE BY NURSING HOME, ASSOCIATION ITEM 1: LETTER FROM CHARLES A. O'BRIEN, CHIEF DEPUTY AT- TORNEY GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, STATE OF CALI- FORNIA; TO SENATOR HARRISON A. WILLIAMS, JR., CHAIRMAN, SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING, U.S. SENATE DEcEmBER 12, 1968. DEAR SENATOR WILLIAMS: Our office reported that mninimally eight milliondollars is being bilked annually from the Medi-Cal Program by medical prac-titioners. A copy of the report supporting our findings is attached for inclusionin your transcript. As we indicated in our report, we believe that such cheating seriously injuresboth the program and the public. Since the release of our report, we have learnedthat similar problems are occurring in other states. One official told us that wecould remove the cover from our report, replace it with the name of his state,and re-issue it with no other changes. Our investigation found that Medi-Cal abuses have a particular impact interms of nursing homes and long-term case facilities. Medicare provides greaterreimbursement to nursing homes than Medi-Cal. Therefore, the potential fortransferring a nursing home patient from Medi-Cal to Medicare may determinethe patient's admittance to a nursing home. Special arrangements between hos-pitals and nursing homes exist solely for the purpose of maximizing govern-ment payments to nursing homes. We also found nursing homes requiring under-the-table payments before admitting patients. A major problem is the. sheer \"bigness\" of the program. Efforts to managethe program through the Blue Shield office in San Francisco and the Blue Crossoffices in Los Angeles and Oakland have obviously created enormous difficultieswhich are thoroughly discussed in our report. Special consideration should begiven to localizing the administration of this program. Smaller regional admin-istrative units might reduce the management of the program to a scale whichmay be encompassed by the mind of man. At the present time, Blue Shieldreceives 80,000 claims a day at its main office in San Francisco. This obviouslypresents a burden which even the most advanced computer cannot handle interms of both processing the claims and effectively weeding out frauds.Aside from conquering the immensity of the program through some effort atlocalization, another broader concept may also be seen in the problems which wehave uncovered. A major contributor to these problems was the pressure on theState of California to take advantage of the funds made available by the federalgovernment through Title Nineteen. Better coordination between local govern-ments, the state and the federal government would certainly have resulted in abetter program. As we note in our report, peril accompanies prosperity whenfederal funding rushes the states into adopting hastily conceived programs.We emphasize in our report that none of our comments are intended to dero-gate the Medi-Cal Program. We consider it essential. Our sole goal is to improvethis program. We hope that this report will aid you in your efforts. We will behappy to supply any further information which you may require. Sincerely, CHARLES A. O'BRIEN, Chief Deputy Attorney General.

Memorandum to: Herbert Davis, Deputy Attorney General, Los Angeles. From: Charles A. O'Brien, Chief Deputy Attorney General. Subject: Medi-Cal investigation. This office continues to receive information concerning widespread abuses of the state's Medi-Cal Program. These alleged abuses include fraud, kickbacks, inflated charges and double-billing by persons providing services under the program. We have held two meetings in San Francisco to explore this problem and have concluded that it merits investigation. Since the bulk of the Medi-Cal expendi- tures are in Southern California, any investigation should properly be directed from the Los Angeles office. It is assigned to you, as head of our Health Plan Registration Unit. In conducting this investigation, our aim should be to improve-not to impede-this program. Medi-Cal is an essential state program, which is allegedly being hampered by fraud and mismanagement. Our primary effort should be to determine the extent of fraud-if any-and the possible remedies, either through criminal prosecution or administrative action. We should also be pre- pared to make recommendations to improve the management of the program, if our investigation discloses areas requiring improvement. CHARLES A. 07BRIEX. Chief Deputy Attorney General. 7Novemnber 6, 196S. Memorandum to: Charles A. O'Brien, Chief Deputy Attorney General. From: Office of the Attorney General, Herbert Davis, Los Angeles. Subject: Report of MNedi-Cal investigation. INTRODUCTION On February 5, 1968, the Attorney General ordered an investigation of the California Medical Assistance Program (Medi-Cal). The investigation was based upon information received in this office from numerous persons which indicated extensive fraudulent activities and other abuses by persons participating in the Medi-Cal Program. The Medi-Cal Program commenced on March 1, 1966. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1967, Medi-Cal paid approximately $600,000,000 to 70,000 vendors who provided services to 1.5 million persons eligible to receive benefits under the program. It is estimated that Medi-Cal will spend around $800,000,000 in the current fiscal year. Of the money spent under the Mledi-Cal Program, approximately fifty per cent is paid by the federal government with the state and counties contributing the remainder of such funds. Our investigation indicates that illegal and unethical activities of persons providing services under Medi-Cal are siphoning millions of dollars annually from the program. Poor administration of the program has contributed to further needless expenditure of money by Medi-Cal. The vast scope of the program precludes any precise estimate of the total amount of funds paid out due to poor administration of the program, outright fraudulent activities and the excessive providing of services. Our investigation leads us to conclude that six to eight million dollars annually is being drained from the program by illegal and unethical activities of various professionals involved in Medi-Cal. This would not include funds paid out in error and as a result of faulty administration. The primary abuses of the program involve submission of false claims, kick- backs, and overservicing. In February 1967, Governor Reagan appointed a Task Force to review the ad- ministration of the Medi-Cal Program. This committee recommended changes which would allegedly save Medi-Cal $90,000,000 annually. The Office of Health Care Services, which administers Medi-Cal, estimates a total of 2.5 million dollars in overpayments have been made to individual practi- tioners since the inception of the program. For -the fiscal year ending June 30, 1968, vendors voluntarily returned 1.5 million dollars in overpayments. Thousands of dollars in overpayments are still voluntarily being returned each month.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 813 In addition to the violations of the laws and regulations of Medi-Cal by the vendors, the investigation disclosed that an effective enforcement program to dis- cover, investigate and deter such activities does not ezist.The complex nature of Medi-Cal and the large numbers of participants-bothvendors and recipients of health care services-prohibited a thorough investiga-tion by the Department of Justice into the conduct of each individual vendorsuspected of engaging in unlawful or unethical activities. The investigation wastherefore conducted primarily to determine the nature of abuses being engaged inunder the program. This report does not attempt a complete \"white paper\" on the Medi-Cal Pro-gram. It does attempt to identify the problems and supply new guidelines-espe- cially in the area of enforcement-which will result in savings for the taxpayers by curtailing the current amount of abuse.In preparing this report we recognized the problems confronted by Health CareServices in administering a program which was hastily conceived and imple-mented. The necessary planning and research needed for the effective operation of the worthy goal of the Medi-Cal Program unfortunately did not accompanythe initial enactment of the program. This is certainly not the fault of Health Care Services. There is a lesson here for both the state and federal governments. The enact-ment of federal legislation which requires immediate response from the states totake advantage of federal funding is laden with peril, as well as with token pros-perity. Unprepared and without sufficient analysis, the states are rushed intoformulating programs which are both essential and ill-considered. There should be an effort by both federal and state governments to transform such programsinto more meaningful and fruitful cooperative actions. SUMMABY OF RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Establish an Effective Investigating Unit. 2. Improve Procedures to Expedite Suspension Proceedings. 3. Publicize Existence and Actions of Investigating Unit. 4. Establish Liaison with Professional Licensing Boards. 5. Improve Communication Between Organizations Participating in the Admin-istration of the Program. 6. New Regulations. 7. Review Procedure of Processing Claims. S. Improve Use of Computers. 9. Review Claims on a Local Basis. 10. Post Examination of Claims. 11. Controlling the Cost of Drugs. 12. Scope of Benefits. 13. Third Party Liability. 14. Purchase of Appliances. THE INVESTIGATION I. Background Aledi-Cal became effective on March 1, 1966. The program was placed under the supervision of the Health and Welfare Agency which established the Office of Health Care Services (ICS) to administer the program.Prior to 'Medi-Cal's enactment, the State of California provided health care services to indigents through a variety of different programs known as PublicAssistance Medical Care and Medical Assistance to the Aged. These programs were administered by the various counties in the state. Administration of theseprograms involved determining eligibility of recipients, authorizing vendors to provide health care services and receiving, reviewing and processing claims ofvendors for payment. (Some counties contracted with California Physicians' Service to assist them in administering the program.) Professional consultantswere used by the counties to assist in reviewing claims and to authorize requests to provide services. Medi-Cal was passed in response to Title 19 of the Social Security Law whichprovided that the federal government would share on a 50-50 basis in the cost ofCalifornians new program including services then being financed entirely by thestate or county. This permitted the unification of all major governmental healthcare systems which provided care for the indigents into a single system financed by the state, counties and federal government. 24-798-69-pt. 3-14814 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS The state contracted with California Physicians' Service (Blue Shield) and Hospital Service of California and Hospital Service of Southern California (Blue Cross) to act as fiscal intermediary agents. As a result of these contracts the processing of claims for payment was largely shifted from the counties to Blue Shield and Blue Cross, although county consultants were still retained to grant requests for prior authorization. Blue Shield is responsible for processing claims of individual vendors (e.g., physicians, dentists, etc.). All claims are processed by Blue Shield in their San Francisco office. Blue Cross is responsible for processing claims of institutional vendors (e.g., nursing homes, hospitals, etc.). Claims in Northern California are processed in Oakland. Claims in Southern California are processed in Los Angeles. II. Vendor 4 buses The investigation revealed that vendors are engaging in unlawful activities and are also bilking the program by providing excessive services to beneficiaries. (1) Unlawful Activities.-The methods by which vendors participating in Medi-Cal engage in unlawful activities can be classified into two main categories: Submission of false claims and kickbacks. (a) Submission of false claims.-This occurs when vendors request payment for services which they have never rendered or falsify information on claims (e.g., knowingly request excessive reimbursement). The submission of a false claim for payment is a felony. (Penal Code section 72.) The acceptance of pay- ment upon a false claim would also constitute the crime of theft. (b) Kickbacks.-Vendors violate Medi-Cal regulations when they agree to give or accept kickbacks-money or other forms of unearned consideration-in return for the opportunity to provide services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries. Such activity is a ground for suspension from the program. Depending upon the type of vendor it might also be grounds for a criminal prosecution or disciplinary action against his license. (2) Overservicing.-While some vendors have cheated Medi-Cal by engaging in unlawful activities, others have taken advantage of the program by providing excessive and unnecessary services for the primary purpose of obtaining greater reimbursement under the program. Overservicing is grounds for suspending a vendor from participating in the Medi-Cal Program. Discussed herein are various types of abuses by vendors which were found to be prevalent under the program. In describing these abuses we recognize that they may in fact be engaged in by only a small number of providers. Neverthe- less, the extent to which they do occur and the millions of dollars drained from the program by such activities merit their exposure to the public and to appro- priate public agencies. A. Nursing Homes There are approximately 1,000 nursing homes licensed by the State of Califor- nia. This class of vendors receives approximately $140,000,000 a year for provid- ing services under the Medi-Cal Program. Except for hospitals this is the largest portion of Medi-Cal funds paid to any single class of vendors. The maximum fee paid to nursing homes for caring for a Medi-Cal beneficiary is $14 a day. This fee is based on a formula which determines the homes' \"cost of operation.\" The investigation revealed that nursing homes are engaging in numerous activities which violate the laws and regulations governing Medi-Cal. (1) Many nursing homes require beneficiaries or their relatives to pay money \"under the table\" to secure admission of the beneficiary into the home. Such payments are often required not just upon the initial admission of the beneficiary but also for each month the beneficiary is kept in the home. A Medi-Cal regulation provides that vendors under the program shall not, in addition to being reimbursed from Medi-Cal, collect or demand reimbursement from beneficiaries or from other persons on behalf of beneficiaries. (2) Medi-Cal beneficiaries in nursing homes receive $15.00 per month from the county for incidental expenses (e.g., cigarettes, candy, etc.). In many homes this money is maintained by the nursing home on behalf of the beneficiary. The investigation has disclosed that some nursing homes misappropriate this incidental expense money which they maintain on behalf of beneficiaries. In one case, for example, it was found that a nursing home was in possession of some $2,000 which belonged to persons who either died or who were discharged from the home.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 815 (3) Several nursing homes have been found to be submitting claims to Medi- Cal for services rendered to patients who either died or who had been discharged from the home prior to the period covered in the billing. One home, for example, received $3,000 for rendering services to patients who had in fact died prior to the date of the alleged services. (4) Another abuse which was found relates to the receipt of duplicate pay- ments by nursing homes. This can occur in situations where the fiscal agent accidentally makes the duplicate payment or where the nursing home submits a duplicate payment hoping to be paid twice. In either situation the unethical vendor retains the duplicate payment without notifying the fiscal agent. We have already noted that HCS itself estimates that approximately 2.5 million dollars in overpayments have been made to all types of vendors. Duplicate payments also occur where a nursing home has patients who are eligible to receive benefits from both Medi-Cal and Medicare. While Medi-Cal is only supposed to pay that amount which Medicare does not cover, the submission of duplicate claims under both welfare programs often results in the nursing homes getting paid in full from both Medi-Cal and Medicare. One nursing home, for example, received a duplicate payment of approximately $50,000 by billing in this manner. Nursing homes may also receive duplicate payment in another manner. A home is reimbursed by Medi-Cal for providing a service, yet it also bills and receives payment for this same service from the patient or his relatives. Many persons receiving Medi-Cal benefits do not know that the services they are billed for have already been paid by Medi-Cal. (5) The investigation revealed that it is common practice for nursing homes to require vendors with whom they deal to give kickbacks in order to provide their services to persons in the nursing home. In some instances the kickbacks ranged as high as 35% of the fee received by the vendor. Kickbacks are prohibited by Medi-Cal regulations. Nevertheless, it is a com- mon practice for vendors such as pharmacists, therapists, X-ray technicians and laboratory clinics to give kickbacks in order to obtain business from nursing homes. (6) Nursing homes often provide services to their residents which are greatly in excess of the services actually needed. Such overservicing is cause for dropping a nursing home from the Medi-Cal program. (a) Our investigation indicated that some nursing homes order drugs far in excess of the quantities required by their residents. This situation can occur since physicians often prescribe continuous medication for persons in the homes and the homes determine when to order the medication. For example, one nurs- ing home had a patient who was to take three pills a day. A prescription of 100 pills would have lasted an entire month. The home, however, ordered three prescriptions, each for 100 pills, during this one month. The temptation of this abuse is enhanced in those situations where there is either common ownership between a nursing home and pharmacy or some kick- back arrangement betwen the home and a pharmacy. Common interests in nurs- ing homes and pharmacies are, in fact, becoming more prevalent under the welfare program. (b) Another method by which excessive services are provided is where nurs- ing homes have arrangements with vendors such as physicians, dentists, optom- etrists, podiatrists, etc., which permit them to examine persons in the home whether or not their services are required or requested. Indications of \"mass examinations\" by such vendors have been observed by county consultants throughout the state in the course of their processing requests for prior authorization. Persons in the home seldom object to such examination since they are not usually required to pay for such services. (c) Information has been obtained which indicates yet a third method by which excessive services are provided by nursing homes. This relates to the situation where a nursing home attempts to \"qualify\" Medi-Cal patients for Medicare. Since nursing homes receive greater reimbursement for persons who are eligible for Medicare than they do for persons eligible for Medi-Oal it is to their benefit to have a patient classified as a Medicare patient. To be eligible for Medicare benefits while in a nursing home the patient must have been hospitalized for a period of three days. A former administrator of a nursing home has alleged that some nursing homes have an arrangement with hospitals whereby Medi-Cal patients are transferred from the home to the hospital for a period of three days and then returned to the home.816 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS The nursing home benefits by this arrangement since it receives reimbursement at the greater rate from Medicare when the patient is returned to the home. The hospital benefits because it is reimbursed for providing services to the patient which usually include laboratory tests, x-rays, etc. (Under such an arrangement the nursing home or hospital usually has a physician who author- izes the patient to be hospitalized.) This type of activity not only provides services to a patient which were not needed nor requested, but the question of \"eligibility\" may determine whether a nursing home will accept a Medi-Cal patient into the home. * * * In addition to effecting services provided under Mledi-Cal, the unlawful activi- ties of nursing homes also effect services provided under the federal program of Medicare. The activities described also result in a needless expenditure of funds under that program. Indeed, the scope of such unlawful activities was a matter of inquiry before a congressional subcommittee on Long Term Care in 1965. Testimony given before this subcommittee indicated that many of the activities we have described concerning nursing homes are prevalent throughout the nation. B. Hospitals The largest share of 'Medi-Cal funds, approximately $220,000,000 is received by hospitals. Of this amount, $120,000,000 goes to county hospitals. The remainder goes to private and non-profit hospitals. We concentrated our investigation of hospitals on the profit making variety. There have been no indications that the abuses we are studying are prevalent in public and non-profit institutions. Generally, we discovered that many of the abuses which we have seen in nurs- ing homes occur equally in hospitals. Such abuses include overservicing, kick- backs and double billing. These MNedi-Cal abuses seem to be predominant in physician-owned hospitals. Since there are no significant differences in the patterns of abuse in nursing homes and hospitals, we will not offer extensive examples of hospital problems. Our comments on nursing homes clearly indicate the Medi-Cal problems which may be found in hospitals. An audit of just seven hospitals, for example, between March and August 1968, resulted in a recovery of $136,000 by Blue Cross. C. Physicians Medi-Cal pays around $95,000,000 a year to 18,000 physicians who participate in the program. (1) The primary fraudulent activity engaged in 'by physicians as disclosed by the investigation has been submitting claims for services which were not in fact rendered by the physicians. One area in particular where this type of activity occurs relates to physicians submitting claims for having examined patients in nursing homes, although such examinations were not in fact performed. Due to problems which hamper investigative activities into fraudulent activ- ities (discussed infra) the investigation was unable to determine the extent to which this type of conduct occurs. (2) Overservicing is the major problem concerning physicians in the Medi-Cal Program. This involves services which are not necessary for a patient's well being, but which are provided primarily for the purpose of obtaining additional fees under the Medi-Cal Program. (a) Examples of activities involving such overservicing include unnecessary examinations, office visits, laboratory tests, x-rays, injections and surgical pro- cedures. (b) The placement of persons in nursing homes whose physical condition does not require such extensive care is another form of overservicing. In Los Angeles County alone during a one-year period of time some 1300 per- sons were requested to leave nursing homes by county consultants because their physical condition no longer required such extensive care. (c) Many nursing homes have \"house physicians\". These are physicians who have an arrangement with nursing homes whereby they take care of the persons in the home. By having a \"captive audience\" the physician is able to realize a significant amount of income regardless of the actual need of the individual residents.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 817 Under this type of arrangement however a physician may often compromisehis professional judgment to the point where he relies upon recommendations miade by the nursing home itself as to services to be given to the patient.For example, our investigation revealed incidents where physicians signedblank prescriptions which were given to them by the nursing home and whichwere subsequently completed by the home itself. In one instance, a physicianthought he was signing a prescription for a drug when in fact it was filled in bya nursing home for a wheel chair for a patient who was ambulatory. In anothercase, 75 blank prescriptions signed by a doctor were found in a nursing home.Review of claims by consultants have also given rise to suspicion that it is thenursing home which prepares the forms describing the physicial condition ofpersons who seek admission into the home. The \"house physicians\" sign suchforms although they, in fact, have not eyamined the patients.The determination of whether a physician is providing excessive services isone which usually requires the judgment of other physicians. Claims of physi-cians are processed for payment by Blue Shield. Blue Shield maintains aUtilization Committee which began functioning in February 1967. One majorpurpose of this committee is to discover physicians who overutilize the program.As will be seen later in this report, the current method of reviewing claimssubmitted by physicians does not maximize the discovery of abuses. Never-theless, as of September 30. 196S, the Utilization Committee had discoveredapproximately 1000 physicians who had engaged in overutilization. As a resultthe committee either recovered or made adjustments in the doctors' claims tothe extent that Medi-Cal realized a savings of approximately one half milliondollars. In addition to the Utilization Committee, physicians who act as advisorsfor Blue Shield at the county level have saved the program approximately$2,000,000 in just the first six months of this year based upon their review ofclaims submitted by physicians. The question of overservicing also arises when doctors receive huge feesfrom the welfare program. Over 3 million dollars in payments have been madeto just 35 physicians in a period of one year, with payments ranging from $70,000to $131,000 each. Investigation disclosed overservicing by many of thesephysicians. Physicians with a financial interest in pharmacies, laboratories and hospitalsare also presented with the opportunity of subjecting Medi-Cal beneficiaries tothese services although they may not be required for medical reasons. For ex-ample, of four hospitals whose claims are under constant review by Blue Crossto determine if excessive services are being provided, all four are owned byphysicians. One blatant example of unnecessary services in a physician-owned hospitalconcerns a patient who was hospitalized for sixteen days. Ten blood tests.many of them identical, were taken each day the patient was hospitalized.Of the 160 tests taken, not one revealed an abnormal finding. Multiple X-raysof the chest, skull and cervical spine were also taken although here again noabnormality was ever revealed. This type of overservicing was similarly providedto many other patients in this same hospital. D. Pharmacists There are approximately 4.900 pharmacies in the State of California. Forthe fiscal year ending June 30, 1967, pharmacies participating in Medi-Calreceived 40 million dollars from the program. Until recently, the formula used to reimburse pharmacies for drugs theydispensed was the cost of the drug, plus 50% of the cost, plus a fee of $1.15.Thus, if a drug cost $1. the pharmacy would receive $1 plus 50 cents plus$1.15. for a total of $2.65. Under a recent regulation this was changed to the cost of the drug, plus aprofessional fee of $2.30 per prescription.The investigation has revealed numerous ways in which pharmacies areengaging in activities which violate the laws and regulations governing 'Medi-Cal.(1) HICS publishes a drug formulary which contains instructions as to themanner in which pharmacies are to determine the cost of their drugs whenbilling the Medi-Cal Program.Pharmacists are instructed not to charge the state a price which is in excessof the price charged to the public for the same drug. Based upon inuestiga-818 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS tions made both before and since the enactment of Medi-Cal, it appears that a large number of pharmacies are violating this instruction. This conclusion is based on the fact that prior to 'Medi-Cal, Los Angeles County (which contains approximately 45% of the pharmacies in the state) maintained a staff of investigators who would make periodic visits to pharmacies to deter- mine if the county was being charged a higher price than the public for the same drugs. This spot-check revealed that a vast majority of the pharmacies visited were, in fact, selling identical drugs at a lower price to the public than to the vwelfare program. With the enactment of Medi-Cal, the staff used by Los Angeles County to do such field audits ceased to exist and HCS does not have personnel who check on pharmacies in this manner. It is therefore highly unlikely that the practice of excessive billing ended with the enactment of the Mledi-Cal Program. Indeed, spot-checks which have been made on pharmacies since Medi-Cal revealed that a majority of the pharmacies visited are still charging prices to the state which are in excess of those charged to the public. There is a special problem involving the difference in drug prices charged to public agencies and private individuals. This involves private health programs which may pay less for drugs than the public welfare program. For example, the United Auto Workers is negotiating a contract under which Blue Shield would cover the expense of drugs purchased by members of the union. Under the proposed contract, the UAW Program would pay less for drugs than the state welfare program. (2) The drugs formulary instructs the pharmacist to dispense the lovwest cost item iwhich he has in stock provided that it meets the requirements of the practi- tioner as shown in the prescription. Many pharmacies are not complying with this instruction. For example, in situations where an inexpensive generic drug could have been dispensed, the patient has been given an expensive brand name drug which resulted in greater reimbursement to the pharmacy under the for- mula previously described. Many drugs have both a brand and generic name. A brand name is always more expensive than the generic name drug. Often, the brand name is as much as two or three times more expensive. Examples of the difference in price can be seen by a comparison of the cost of some leading brand name drugs with the cost of comparable generic drugs. BRAND NAME COMPARABLE GENERIC Achromycin caps (250 mg.): Tetracycline caps (250 mg.): 100 ----------- $---------- 511. 22 ----------------------- $4. 20 Peritrate tabs (10 mg.): Pentaerythritol tetranitrate tabs 100 ---------------------- 2. 50 (10 mg.): 1,000 -------------------- 22. 50 100 ----------------------- .65 1.000 -________________ 3. 00 Seconal sodium (1/2 gr.)

Under the formula for reim- bursement the excessive expenditure made by Medi-Cal due to such false claims can amount to a significant amount of money. (4) The investigation revealed that pharmacies often purchase drugs in large quantities but bill Mfedi-Cal at a cost premised upon a mninimium quantity pur- chase. This results in the pharmacy receiving more than its actual cost for the drug dispensed. Furthermore, Aledi-Cal not only pays out excessive money for the cost of the drug, but the excessive expenditure is compounded when this higher cost is used in applying the formula for reimbursement. Under the formula for reimbursement, a pharmacist is supposed to bill 'Medi- Cal for his \"cost\" of the drug dispensed. The drug formulary prescribes that theCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICAINS 819 pharmacist shall apply the maximum allowable wholesale cost or his actual cost, whichever is lower in calculating the cost of the drug dispensed. Most pharmacies buy certain drugs in large quantity (e.g., on a thousand lot or gallon basis) so that the cost per hundred or per pint of the drug is cheaper than if purchased in a quantity of hundreds or pints. Drugs purchased on a minimum quantity basis are more expensive than drugs purchased in large quantities. The differe~nce in cost when buying small quantities as compared to large quantities can be illustrated by the following examples: Cost for 100 on purchase Percent of Name of drug Cost for 100 of 1,000 difference Lanoxin tabs, 25 mg-- --------------------- S1. 14 $0. go 47 ----------------------------- 62 32 Butisol sodium tabs. 3.' gr ---------------------- 2. 15 1.84 13 An audit of a single pharmacy's prescriptions paid by the state during a two- month period revealed that the pharmacy overstated its cost of drugs at an aver- age of 38 cents per prescription. During the year, this pharmacy submitted 14,000 prescriptions to Medi-Cal. Applying the excessive cost of 38 cents per prescrip- tion, the state may have overpaid this one pharmacy some $5,300 for the year. (5) It is permissible in California for a pharmacist to fill a prescription whsch has been authorized by a physician over the telephone. Whenever a pharmacist gets a request from a person other than a physician for a prescription, it is the duty and responsibility of the pharmacist to contact the physician prior to issu- ing the drug. Analysis of prescription-s submitted for payment by pharmacies disclosed sev- eral situations which indicate that the drugs were probably not authorized by the physician and .sonsetimes never dispensed by the pharmacy. Examples of such situations are described below. (a) Some pharmacies needlessly dispense multiple prescriptions of the same drug to tlfe same patient over a short period of time. Examination of such pre- scriptions revealed that if the drug was taken as directed, there was no need to dispense the quantity of drugs indicated on the prescriptions submitted for pay- ment. For example, a pharmacy might submit for reimbursement to Medi-Cal four prescriptions written for the same patient during a thirty-day period of time. Each prescription was for 30 pills of the same drug or a total of 120 pills. If the pills were taken as directed in the prescription (e.g., 1 pill twice a day), 60 pills would be been sufficient for the entire month. This situation also occurs when nursing homes order prescription medicines. In such circumstances, pharmacies often prepare multiple prescriptions to meet the quantity ordered rather than writing a single prescription. Since pharmacies were reimbursed on a basis of cost, plus 50%1 of cost, plus $1.15 fee per prescrip- tion, they were able to obtain greater reimbursement by writing several prescrip- tions for small quantities of n drug rather than writing one prescription for a larger quantity. (b) Some pharmacies dispense an ececessive number of prescriptions for a particular patient or family on one day, or within a relatively short period of time. In one case, 15 prescriptions were dispensed to a single family on a given day. The family consisted of a hus~band, wife and three children. The 15 prescriptions involved only three different medicines. An identical prescription for each member of the family was written for each of the three medicines. (E.g., each member of the family got a prescription for 4 ounces of the same cough medicine: each member of the family got a prescription for 2 ounces of the same antibiotic.) (c) Misuse of \"preprin ted\" prescription-s is another problem revealed 'by the investigation. A preprint is a prescription form which is already printed to con- tain such information as the name of the patient, name of drug, quantity of drug, directions for use, name of doctor and name of pharmacy. Pharmacies prepare these prescription forms without any request from a physician for such a pre- scription. Allegedly, they are prepared to improve service to regular customers. Actual misuse or temptation to misuse such preprints is patently obvious. A successful criminal prosecution wvas brought against a pharmacist who used pre-820 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS printed prescription forms to submit false claims. This pharmacist had never dispensed the drugs indicated on the preprinted forms which he submitted for payment. In most of the examples mentioned an examination of prescriptions indicated that they were in fact written by the pharmacist as telephone prescriptions. In- quiries were made to physicians whose names appeared on suspicious prescrip- tions. A majority of the physicians who responded stated that they did not authorize the issuance of the prescriptions. (6) Nursing homes usually order all the drugs required by persons residing in the homes. This often amounts to the purchase of a few thousand dollars worth of drugs per month. The investigation revealed that many pharmacies are giving kickbacks to nursing homes in order to obtain their business. One pharmacy has even sent letters to nursing homes offering to give discounts for their business. A MIedi-Cal regulation specifically prohibits a vendor from offering an un- earned rebate, refund, discount or other unearned consideration as compensation for the referral of business under the M1edi-Cal Program. * * * Several pharmacies are currently under separate investigations for engaging in the types of activities we have been discussing. One such investigation has resulted in the filing of a criminal complaint against a pharmacist who requested payments for prescriptions never dispensed. Although the investigation could not determine the exact amount of money the state is spending due to abuses by pharmacies it is significant to note that an audit of only 39 stores has resulted in a recovery of approximately $132,000. Under the present system these audits arise out of complaints. Complaints in- volving around 70 other stores have not yet been investigated. It is estimated by experienced investigators that if routine audits were initiated by M~edi-Cal the amount of recovery would probably exceed $500,000 a year. E. Dentists Dentists who participate under the program receive about $12,000,000 a year from 3Iedi-Cal. Unlike physicians who perform whatever services they deem necessary, den- tists are required to get prior authorization from dental consultants for any plan of treatment which would exceed $35. Also, unlike physicians, reimbursement to dentists is fixed by a schedule of fees depending upon the dental procedure performed. Investigation disclosed the following fraudulent activities by dentists. (1) In order to avoid getting prior authorization, dentists have submitted separate bills, each under $35, directly to Blue Shield for payment of services rendered to a particular patient. The total sum of the bills, however, clearly re- vealed that the entire single plan of treatment did exceed $35 and should have been submitted for prior authorization. (2) Submitting false claims. This type of abuse can occur when a dentist seeks payment where he has performed no services. It can also occur where a dentist submits a bill for having performed a specific dental procedure entitling him to a certain reimbursement when in fact he did a different procedure for which he should have received a smaller sum of money. In one instance. a dentist falsified his claims by putting down the wrong procedure number for his dental work thereby obtaining $60 more than he was entitled to receive on each claim. (3) Overservicing also exists in the field of dentistry. (a) Dentists are providing dentures or other prosthetic work under Medi-Cal which would not be provided under normal circumstances. Such services are be- ing performed primarily because reimbursement can be obtained under the MIedi- Cal Program. In one county, twenty percent of the requests for prior authoriza- tion are denied because the consultants deem that the proposed dental work is unnecessary. (b) Examination by dentists of patients in nursing homes is a special area where overservicing exists. Dental consultants throughout the state agree that dental work performed in nursing homes presents a large area of potential abuse. In one county, more than fifty percent of all requests for prior authorization submitted by a dentist for patients in one nursing home were rejected on the ground that the treatment requested would not be beneficial to the patient. Even where authorization to perform work is denied, however, the dentists are stillCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 821 entitled to receive their fee for making routine examinations, although theseexaminations are not always requested nor needed. (c) Just as suspicion of overservicing is raised when large fees are paid tophysicians, the same is equally true when big fees are received by dentists. Elevendentists received close to one million dollars in fees in the year 1967. The ac-tivities of many of these dentists are, in fact, suspect by dental consultants atthe county level. F. Optonaetrists Expenditures under Medi-Cal to optometrists are approximately $S.000,000 ayear. Optometrists need prior authorization before they can provide lenses orframes to a beneficiary under the program. However, no such authorizationis required for an optometrist to perform a routine eye examination.(1) Frauodu lent activities by optometrists have primarily involved requestingprior authorization to provide appliances based upon the sobmission of falseinformation. The extent to which optometrists submit false information in requesting priorauthorization is indicated by the fact that one county rejects approximatelyone third of the requests received for prior authorization to provide lenses andframes to patients in nursing homes. 'Many of these rejections were based onthe ground that the information supplied was false.In one case, for example, an optometrist requested approval for a pair ofexpensive prescription sun glasses for a patient. Investigation disclosed that thepatient was blind. In other cases requests stated that the patients were in pos-session of old glasses which were in poor condition. Investigation revealed thatthe patients were in fact in possession of new glasses which they received withinsix months prior to the latest request. (2) Optometrists were also fou-nd to be providing materials ichich( do notmeet the quality specified by the regulations. Several optometrists suspected ofproviding inferior quality materials are now under investigation.(3) Optometrists overutilize the Medi-Cal Program by providinq unnecessaryexamAlnhations and by providing lenses and frames which are not needed by thebeneficiary. Once again, investigation disclosed that review of requests for authorizationreceived from optometrists concerning patients in nursing homes are oftenrejected on the ground that the glasses requested will not be of benefit to thepatient. In several cases, for example, requests stated that the patient was \"active,alert and expressed a need and desire for improved vision.\" Examination of thepatients by the optometric consultant however revealed that their physical con-dition was such that communication with them was difficult, if not impossible,and that the glasses would not be of benefit to the patients.Another manner of overservicing exists where optometrists replace lenses andalso request replacement of frames which are still in good condition. CONCLUSION In mentioning various types of fraudulent activities and acts of overservicingwhich are occurring we have only attempted to show some of the more shockingand extravagant abuses. We have not exhausted all of the methods by whichevery class of vendor can take advantage of the program. Nor have we relatedevery ease which is under investigation. Instances of fraud and overservieing,for example, could also be given for vendors such as hearing aid dealers, podia-trists and ambulance services.In some cases the abuses mentioned may be prevalent among a specific class ofvendor. In other cases only a small percentage of the class of vendors involvedmay be engaging in a particular type of abuse.The one fact which is certain however is that the abuses mentioned are occur-ring and have resulted in millions of dollars being needlessly spent since the com-mencement of the program. Moreover, unless immediate efforts are made tocurtail these activities it is likely they will grow in scope and cost to theprogram. Our attention is now directed to the type of enforcement which has existedunder the Medi-Cal Program for the purpose of discovering and preventingabuses and whether whether the program of enforcement has been effective inthese areas.822 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS III. Enforcement of Laws and Regulations We have concluded from the investigation that an effective enforcement pro- gram to discover and investigate vendors who are taking advantage of the pro- gram does not exist. Medi-Cal became effective March 1, 1966. It was not until twenty-one months later in December 1967 that HCS hired any trained investigators and then only two men were hired for the whole state. Whether it was the myraid of problems encountered in getting the Medi-Cal Program operating, or a belief that potential abuses were not significant or would be adequately discovered by the fiscal intermediary agents, the fact is that an effective investigative unit was not initially established and does not exist today. Since the commencement of Medi-Cal in March, 1966, only twenty-one vendors have been suspended from the program. These few suspensions, in light of the substantial amount of abuses revealed by the investigation, vividly reflect the inadequate enforcement of the program. Two main problems confront attempts to seek compliance with the laws and regulations governing Medi-Cal. (1) There is a lack of an effective system to discover those vendors who are engaging in fraudulent activities and overservicing. (2) Even after vendors become suspect, proper investigation into tlic matter is difficult, if not impossible, due to a number of internal problems. A. Discovery of Abuses Most abuses are discovered in the course of the fiscal agents processing claims submitted for payment or consultants passing upon requests for prior authoriza- tion. (1) Professional Consultants The professional consultants in counties throughout the state must give prior authorization before the services of many individual vendors can be provided (e.g., dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, etc.) and part of their responsibility is to discover abuses by such vendors. Professional consultants had a similar responsibility under the welfare program prior to the enactment of Medi-Cal. Prior to Medi-Cal, however, the consultants would not only get requests for prior authorization, but they would also receive and approve claims for payment after services had been performed enabling them to maintain complete patient and vendor folders. This system permitted comparisons of services rendered wih approved requests, and verification of prices charged. By doing so, the consultants were able to detect overservicing and fraudulent activities such as billing for services not rendered, or billing at an exorbitant price. Under Medi-Cal, the consultants only receive requests for prior authorization. The claims for payment of services rendered go directly to Blue Shield with no copies of the billing going to the consultants. It was the unanimous opinion of consultants with whom ice spoke throughout the state that the failure to pro- vide them with billing information has greatly diminished their ability to dis- cover abutses. In Los Angeles County, for example, the dental consultants were able to either recover from dentists or to adjust requests for authorization to the extent that the welfare program was able to \"save\" over a million dollars a year prior to the enactment of Medi-Cal. However, since they are no longer receiving claims sub- mitted by dentists for services rendered, they have been unable to maintain com- plete files and to achieve such savings under the Medi-Cal Program. This county still retains a \"bad boy\" list of dentists, many of whom receive large fees from the program, whose claims they believe merit careful scrutiny which is not being given under the current method of review. (2) Blue Shield Blue Shield, with certain exceptions, receives 70,000 claims a day from indi- vidual vendors throughout the state. Since consultants at the county level must give prior authorization before many vendors can provide services, Blue Shield's main concern is to process this huge number of claims for payment. In doing so, the main review is to see if the service and the fee set forth on the claim is allowed under the program. Discovery of abuses by such review is primarily limited to claims submitted by physicians and pharmacists, whose claims are not subject to prior authorization. Efforts to discover fraudulent activities and acts of overservicing are made by personnel who are trained to examine claims to see if they are justified.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 823 (a) Without maintaining a patient or vendor folder, and by eaaamining claims on an individual rather than group basis, many of the abuses by physicians will not be discovered by the present method of review. Assume for example that a physician intends to take advantage of the program by requiring a patient to make unnecessary visits to his office. Since the individ- ual claims submitted to Blue Shield for each office visit would appear proper and be processed for payment, the chances of discovering this type of abuse is remote upon a review of claims on an individual basis. This abuse is more likely to be discovered if a number of claims submitted by this physician were reviewed at the same time, or if a patient or vendor file was maintained. Due to the volume of documents involved in reviewing claims of physicians throughout the state, such files are not presently maintained. As previously noted, the review of claims by the Utilization Committee and county-level advisors to Blue Shield recovered approximately four and one half million dollars in one year from physicians who were providing excessive serv- ices. This figure alone is a commentary on the extent of abuse occurring under the program by just one class of vendor. Furthermore, this figure relates only to those excessive activities which have in fact been discovered. While this type of review has achieved some success in discovering acts of overservicing by physicians, it has not been able to discover numerous other abuses we have mentioned are being engaged in by other vendors. One indication of this is that while Blue Shield has taken action on over 1,000 cases involving Medi-Cal, only 18 cases were deemed significant enough to be sent to IICS with recommendations for suspension. The Utilization Committee has recently commenced reviewing claims of physi- cians after they have been paid. This \"post-audit\" is done by establishing various parameters. This involves determining services or procedures which indicate overservicing and obtaining, by means of computer, the names of physicians who exceed the \"norm\" in regard to the performance of such procedures. The selec- tion of one such parameter, for example, resulted in the review of some 20 physicians who performed a certain surgical procedure. Most of the physicians reviewed were found to have performed excessive services in regard to this particular procedure. This method in reviewing claims is too new to be evaluated at this time, although it offers certain advantages which will be discussed later in the report. (b) The results of the method used in examining claims submitted by pharma- cists presents even a better illustration of the inadequacy of the current method of review. We have already mentioned the numerous ways in which pharmacists are known to be abusing the program. Prior to our investigation, action had been taken against only one pharmacist since the enactment of Medi-Cal. One reason few pharmacists have been investigated is that the review of indi- vidual prescriptions submitted for payment will not usually reveal a pattern of abuse. To effectively discover abuses numerous prescriptions of a pharmacist should be analyzed at the same time. At our request a former pharmaceutical consultant was asked to select at random from Blue Shield's files prescriptions which had been submitted for payment and to analyze them for possible abuses. His examination of claims in this manner developed facts giving rise to several questions as to the propriety of the activities of several pharmacies. Set forth below are some examples of the suspicious activities detected by this type of examination. (i) One pharmacy submitted 15 prescriptions, all of which were given to one family in a single day. Five of the prescriptions were identical, each being for four ounces of the same cough medicine. (ii) A pharmacy dispensed in a period of 33 days 300 pills to a single patient. If taken as directed (one pill three times a day) 100 pills would have sufficed for the entire period. (iii) One pharmacy employing one pharmacist dispensed 290 Medi-Cal prescriptions in a single day. These prescriptions amounted to his being reimbursed $1,190. Many of these prescriptions were preprinted. Around fifty percent of these prescriptions were written by two physicians, one of whom sees 75 to 100 patients a day and prescribes 100 to 125 prescrip- tions a day. For comparison purposes. a major chain drugstore employing seven pharmacists in a thirteen hour day writes an average of 300 presrip- tions a day. While legitimate reasons could exist to explain the above patterns, the exam- ples illustrate how this type of examination at least reveals activities which may justify additional investigation.824 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS (3) Blue Cr0s8 Blue Cross receives 5,000 claims a day from iinstitutional vendors such as nusring homes and hospitals. (a) Claims for nursing homes are submitted monthly and primarily set forth the names of the persons in the home during the period for which pay- ment is requested. Reimbursement to a home is based on a fixed rate de- termined by its \"cost of operation.\" Since county consultants have authorized the admission of pesrons into homes, the examination of claims for nursing homes by Blue Cross is basically limited to determine if the appropriate amount of money is being paid. It is therefore highly unlikely that in the processing of such claims Blue Cross will detect the many types of abuses which we have mentioned as being engaged in by nursing homes. A review of claims, for example, will not determine if nursing homes have submitted false claims, misappropriated patients' money, required kickbacks, or received duplicate payments. Knowledge of such abuses can only effectively be discovered through periodic audits of nursing homes. Such audits have not been taking place. The combination of lack of audits and the inadequacy of claims review has offered little deterrence to those nursing homes which are tempted to take advantage of the Medi-Cal Program since any unlawful or unethical activities are not likely to be discovered. (b) The major reviewed performed by Blue Cross relates to claims sub- mitted by hospitals. Examination of such claims is primarily directed toward determining if excessive services were provided. Such claims contain infor- mation relating to the diagnosis of patients and the treatment provided to them. The majority of expenditures to hospitals are made to county and non- profit hospitals. Discovery of excessive services has been associated primarily with profit-making hospitals. The examination of claims to discover excessive services is performed by persons trained to detect this abuse. The review of such claims was initiated around November, 1967, with a staff of just two persons. This staff has now been increased to six. Two physicians who work part time for Blue Cross also review questionable claims of hospitals under the Medi-Cal Program (as well as claims submitted to Blue Cross under other government and private contracts). In the limited time that this review has been going on, abuses have been discovered resulting in a savings of $136,000 to the Medi-Cal Program. B. Investigative Activities Although the present review system makes it difficult to discover abuses, HCS investigators have opened cases for investigation to determine if a vendor might be engaging in unlawful practices. The difficulty in discovering abuses has been exeeded only by the inability of investigators and consultants to obtain essential information from HCS and the fiscal agents to pursue investigations on specific cases. Several factors hamper investigative activities. (1) To prove that a vendor is abusing the Medi-Cal program so that ap- propriate action may be taken-be it administrative suspension or criminal action-it is essential to examine documents submitted by the vendor. In the event of a hearing or trial, witnesses will also be needed to testify. Since we are often dealing with elderly people-whose health and memory are a legitimate matter of concern-time is of the essence if any investigation is to be successful. The fiscal intermediary agents maintain possession of most documents which are pertinent and necessary to any investigation such as claims for services rendered, records of payments made, etc. Our investigation disclosed that investigators and consultants have not been successful in their attempts to obtain documents and other information from the HCS and the fiscal agents for the purpose of pursuing investigations. The inability to obtain such information within a reasonable period of time not only makes cases moot because of the passage of time. but has the effect of dis- couring the efforts of persons charged with the responsibility of discovering abuses and performing investigations. One vivid example of the frustration encountered is illustrated by tracing a request made to Blue Shield in September 1967 by the dental consultants inCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 825 one county. Documents were requested on 15 dentists whose activities weresuspicious. As time elapsed without receiving the information, additional let-ters were written to both Blue Shield and HCS requesting the documents. InDecember 1967, the consultants were advised of the person to whom the re-quest should be directed. The request was again made to this individual. As ofthis date, the information has still not been received.Numerous other examples could be cited where investigators and consultantshad to literally wait months before receiving answers to inquiries or docu-ments which were requested. In many instances no responses at all were everreceived. The failure to provide documents may indicate a lack of cooperation and com-munication between HCS and the fiscal agents, or a lack of interest and concernby these organizations as to the importance of such investigations.If, for example, requests for documents are not being sent to the proper per-sons both the fiscal agents and HOS have been -aware of the problem long enoughto have taken corrective action. If the number of requests for information aretoo great to enable expeditious replies to all requests, priority should be given tothose matters involving investigations.The delay in sending documents may be due to the fact that the fiscal agentsmicrofilm documents which they process for payment. In using this procedureit may require some time to locate the proper microfilm and make the necessarycopies. This office, for example, requested from Blue Shield documents concern-ing the activities of one vendor for a period of three months. Giving this mattertop priority it still required 235 man hours and three weeks to provide thisinformation at a cost of $800. While this may explain a reasonable delay, it doesnot justify the failure wihch has usually been encountered by those persons whohave requested documents and other information.Whatever the reason, the inability of investigators and consultants to obtaindocuments and other information presents a serious problem and is precludingeffective investigation. In commenting on this problem. it is important to note that Blue Shield hasmade every effort to cooperate with this office in providing documents which werequested and has often furnished such documents within a reasonable periodof time. This would indicate that the ability to provide documents is not thebasis for the lack of success which has been experienced by others.(2) HCS is responsible for administering the Medi-Cal Program. BlueShield and Blue Cross have contracts to act as fiscal intermediary agents onbehalf of the state.These organizations have a mutual goal and interest in seeing that the Medi-Cal Program is efficiently administered and that abuses by vendors are held toa minimum. Our investigation reveals. however, that the coordination, cooperation andcommunication which one would expect to exist between HCS, Blue Cross andBlue Shield does not prevail. (a) We have already mentioned the inability of an investigator to obtaininformation from the fiscal agents.(b) Another example of this lack of communication is seen by the problem ofdetermining which organization will investigate cases. Wre previously mentionedthat Blue Shield has a Utilization Committee which attempts to discover casesof overservicing. There has not been a clear understanding however as to whichcases involve fraud and should therefore be referred to HCS.(c) Problems in the coordination of activities are further manifested bysituations where Blue Shield has referred cases to HCS but HCS has no recordof receiving the cases. Also, when cases are sent to HCS by Blue Shield recom-mending either further investigation or suspension of the vendor this is often thelast that Blue Shield ever hears of the matter. Recommendations to suspendphysicians are made by \"peer\" committees which exist within county medicalsocieties. Serious frustration on the part of these committees has resulted fromthe failure of HCS to either take any action or to sustain such recommendations.In regard to cases received from Blue Shield, HCS claims that they are usuallynot properly reported so that rather than being able to continue investigatingcases which are referred, it is necessary for them to start the investigation fromscratch. This often results in duplicating work which has already been done byBlue Shield but not properly reported.(d) Another area of lack of communication or coordination of activities relatesto our previous discussion of abuses. We have seen that the activities of certainvendors may tend to overlap with activities of other vendors. Discovery of over-826 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS servicing by hospitals or nursing homes, for example, may often give rise upon further inquiry to overservicing by physicians, pharmacists and other vendors. Our investigation disclosed, however, that where abuses have been discovered by one fiscal agent which indicate that other vendors whose claims are reviewed by the other fiscal agent should be investigated there has been a failure to ade quately inform either HCS or the fiscal agent of potential investigations which might prove fruitful. (3) \"Investigation Units\" exist in the offices of HCS, Blue Shield and the Department of Social Services of Los Angeles County. Although the three units all have basically the same objectives there has been no supervision or coordination of their activities so that often one unit does not know what the other is doing. Thus, one unit might commence an investigation against a vendor who is already under investigation by another unit, or who has been investigated and cleared by another unit. This duplication of investi- gative efforts constitutes a serious problem with its resultant unnecessary expenditures and inefficient investigations. (4) A major weakness in the investigative program of HCS has been the lack of adequate personnel. (a) Ten field investigators are employed by the Utilization Committee of Blue Shield. Their primary area of concern relates to investigating cases of overservicing by physicians which are handled by administrative action. There are three investigators on the payroll of Los Angeles County, which county accounts for approximately 45% of the money expended under the program. HCS employs just two investigators to cover the entire state. These inves- tigators' primary responsibility is in the area of criminal fraud. It therefore seems that the number of investigators decreases in proportion to the importance and geographic scope of the investigative activities. Each investigator for HCS has approximately 100 cases. Most investigations require interviews with numerous persons and examination of many documents just to determine if a complaint has merit. Therefore, the investigative \"staff\" of one in southern California and one in northern California is unable to pursue more than a handful of cases at a time. (b) The lack of an adequate investigative staff has meant that far too few actions have been brought against vendors who have been cheating the program. Failure to bring such actions precludes Medi-Cal from recovering or offsetting monies to which it may be entitled from such vendors and also enables them to continue participating in the program without much fear of detection. Since there is no noticeable evidence of an investigative program-and hence no threat of criminal prosecution, suspension from Medi-Cal or disciplinary action against a practitioner's license-the current investigative program offers no deterrent to those vendors wcho may consider taking advantage of the program. (c) In discussing the lack of an adequate investigative staff, it should be noted that the basic equipment and staff necessary for the effective performance of an investigator has not been provided by HCS. Lack of portable tape recorders for use in the field when doing interviews and secretarial help to prepare reports and summaries of interviews are just two illustrations of the handicaps under which investigators must presently work. The investigator for HCS in southern California, for example, does not even have someone to answer his telephone when he is not in his office. Other examples could be stated which would illustrate the problems involved in discovering and pursuing investigations. The matters mentioned above, however, amply demonstrate the dire need to review the procedures now being used to determine what appropriate steps should be taken to increase the effectiveness of enforcing the program. IV. General Administration of Program In the course of the investigation information was obtained concerning prob- lems which exist in the general administration of the Medi-Cal Program. Mfany of Medi-Cal's administrative problems indirectly contribute to the abiiscs iehich arc occurring under the program. In relating such problems we are aware that Medi-Cal is only two years old and still experiencing growing pains. Many problems could not have been antici- pated (e.g., Medi-Cal must conform to constant changes in regulations estab- lished by the federal government) or are inherent in the administration of any program this size. Indeed, efforts have already been made to remedy many of the problems which will be mentioned.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 827 (A) Comnunuication and Coordination 1. Reference has been made to the difficulty which exists in coordinating theactivities of HOS and the fiscal agents in regard to investigating vendors whomay be abusing the program. a. There is also a need for greater communication between HCS and the fiscalagents as to the general administration of the program. HCS and the fiscal agentshave not established an effective means of communication to enable HCS to keepabreast of problems confronting the intermediaries in the performance of theirduties. For example, frequent changes by HCS in the type of information desiredfrom the fiscal agents have often been made without consultation with the fiscalagents as to the feasibility and cost of making such changes. b. Blue Cross has not performed audits to determine the accuracy of fces beingpaid to nursing homes and hospitals. The amount of payment received by nursing homes and hospitals is deter-mined by a formula which ascertains the 'cost of operation\" of such institu-tions. One responsibility of Blue Cross as the fiscal agent for processing claimsof nursing homes and hospitals is to perform audits of such institutions todetermine if their \"cost of operation\" justifies the fees they are receiving fromMedi-Cal. As previously mentioned, only by doing audits of nursing homes canthere be effective discovery of the abuses some homes are engaging in under theprogram. Lack of direction from HCS and its failure to formulate policies have con-tributed significantly to Blue Cross' failure to perform audits until recently. Theresults of these recent audits reveal that Medi-Cal has been making excessivepayments to nursing homes. As one example, a recent audit by Blue Cross determined that one chain ofeight nursing homes has received in excess of $380,000 from Medi-Cal. Otheraudits which are now in process are disclosing that the majority of institutionsaudited have also received excessive payments from Medi-Cal.Audits of hospitals have also recently been commenced by public accountingfirms under contract with Blue Cross. c. The problem of communication also extends into the relationship which HCShas with. the counties throughout the state. (i) There are 58 counties in the State of California. Most of these processMedi-Cal claims for prior authorization. In general there has been a failure onthe part of HCS to effectively communicate with these counties for the purposeof discussing problems concerning their duties and the manner in which the lawsof Medi-Cal should be applied. One example of this lack of communication is illustrated by a form which wasrecently used throughout the state for authorization to admit or retain personsin nursing homes. The form was prepared by ECS without consulting most ofthe medical consultants who had to determine from the information on the formif the request should be granted. Various county consultants contend that theform should have contained additional information to assist them in making theirdecisions. This problem is also seen in the dissemination of a new form which is used inrequesting authorization from county consultants to extend the period of timethat Medi-Cal beneficiaries can remain in a hospital. This new form was not onlydevised without the advice of county consultants, but was also distributed to hos-pitals without prior notification to local consultants. Another example reflecting lack of communication is illustrated by the factthat for several months consultants for one county were directing correspondenceto a division chief at HCS who no longer held his post. County consultants werenever notified of the change in the division chief.(ii) \"Communication\" between HCS and the counties is also weak in regardto the amount of discretion and responsibility county consultants can exerciseon matters not specifically covered by any law or regulation. Needless to say, amultitude of problems arise in various counties for which there is no specificanswer provided in any law or regulation governing the program. In such in-stances. the consultants have a choice of either acting upon their own discretionor requesting direction from HCS. The failure of HCS to respond promptly torequests for advice often results in no action at all being taken by the counties.The failure to clearly advise the counties as to areas of discretionary respon-sibility has resulted in counties taking inconsistent positions on matters wherethere should be uniformity. (iii) HCS has also issued directives which were inconsistent with existing lawsand regulations governing the Medi-Cal Program. The current time lag in cor-828 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANNS recting such inconsistencies-often weeks-would be eliminated by more effective lines of communication. (B) Evasion of Regulations Certain 'loopholes\" exist in the laws and regulations governing Medi-Cal which enable vendors to engage in activities which are contrary to the intent and language of the law. 1. Through a simple subterfuge, physicians who are suspended from the pro- gram man continue to receive Medi-Cal payments. Persons participating as vendors in the Medi-Cal Program possess a vendor number. Usually this number is the same as the professional license number possessed by the vendor. When the vendor is a physician, however, and practices as a member of a group or clinic a vendor number is also assigned to the group or clinic. As a result, physicians who have been suspended from the program for over- servicing or fraud are able to continue treating Medi-Cal patients and to receive payment for their services by submitting their claims under their group or clinic vendor number. This results in the physician being able to evade the purpose of the suspension which is to remove him as a participant in the Medi-Cal Program. 2. The regulations also provide that a physical therapist shall not receive payment for rendering more than six treatments to a patient without having obtained a new prescription from a physician authorizing further treatments. Home health agencies, another type of vendor under the program, are also allowed to provide physical therapy to Medi-Cal patients. Unlike the individual physical therapist, no limitation has been placed on the amount of payments which can be made to a home health agency for providing physical therapy. As a result, it is common for physical therapists to have an arrangement with home health agencies whereby the latter will submit claims for services rendered by the physical therapists as though the service was ren- dered by the home health agency itself. In effect the home health agency is merely acting as a billing service for the therapist and receives a fee from the therapist for doing so. Under this arrangement with home health agencies the individual therapists are able to evade the limitation which the Medi-Cal Regulations impose upon them. (C) Determining \"Cost\" of Drugs We have seen that some pharmacies inflate their fees by overstating the cost of the drugs they dispense. IICS publishes a drug formulary which basically provides that \"cost\" is in- tended to be the acquisition cost of the drug. (The formulary defines \"cost\" as being the lower of the maximum allowable wholesale cost or the actual cost to the pharmacist. The former price refers to a few drugs in the formulary on which there is placed a maximum allowable wholesale cost.) A new drug formulary has recently been published. \"Cost\" has again been defined in the same manner. However, appearing under the caption \"Billing Instructions\" in the new formulary is a section which provides, in part, that the wholesale cost for the standard package of the drug dispensed shall be used in determining the cost of the drug to the pharmacy. A \"standard package\" is defined as 100's, pints, or pounds or the available size that is closest to said packages. In providing that \"cost\" should be figured at the wholesale cost of a \"standard package\" this section ignores the acquisition cost of the drug. Hence, it gives the pharmacy the advantage of obtaining drugs at a cheaper price by purchas- ing in large quantities without passing this saving along to Medi-Cal. The effect of this new Medi-Cal instruction is to allow reimbursement to the pharmacy for more than its actual cost in purchasing the drug. In the past several years a great increase has occurred in the cost of drugs under the welfare program. In 1967 the number of welfare prescriptions filled on a nationwide basis was 26.4% greater than the year before. In California the increase in welfare prescriptions over the same period of time was 37.4%. Cali- fornia also led the nation in both the number of welfare prescriptions filled in 1967 and the amount of dollar volume paid out for prescriptions in that year. The number of welfare prescriptions and their cost for the current fiscal year have both been estimated as being higher than in the past year. It is now antici- pated that as a result of the billing instruction in the new drug formulary the cost of drugs will be even greater than predicted. Although previously mentioned, it is again significant to note that under the new welfare program in California the amount of money reimbursed to phar-COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 829 macies will be greater than the reimbursement provided under private negotiatedcontracts. (D) Purchase of Appliances Appliances such as wheelchairs, crutches and beds are purchased by both thestate for persons eligible for Medi-Cal and by counties for persons who are onwelfare but not under the Medi-Cal Program.1. In Los Angeles County alone Medi-Cal purchases over $250,000 worth ofappliances a year. However, whereas Los Angeles County has entered into con-tracts with suppliers of such appliances to purchase them at a discount the statehas no such agreements and purchases identical appliances at a full retail price.The effect is that the Medi-Cal is paying more money (often as much as twentypercent more) than the county for identical medical appliances.2. When Medi-Cal does purchase an appliance, the patient retains title to it.This means that when there is no longer any need for the appliance, because ofdeath or otherwise, the patient or his family retains possession of the appliance.Prior to Medi-Cal, Los Angeles County developed a procedure whereby appli,ances could be reobtained, serviced and stored so as to be available for futureuse by another welfare patient. No procedure for Medi-Cal to reobtain medicalappliances-after it gives them to patients-exists under the current program.(E) Beneficiaries under the Medi-Cal Program who passess certain assets aresupposed to pay a portion of the cost of the services they receive.1. The counties have the responsibility of ascertaining the liability of thepatient. There has been a general failure by the counties in assuring that thefinancial liability of patients for Nedi-Cal treatment is being paid.If the patient's liability is not fulfilled, Medi-Cal ends up paying the vendormoney which should have been paid by the patient. One county which is con-centrating its efforts in this area has reeovered from Medi-Cal patients approxi-mately $20.000 in a period of one year.2. The state also has a right of subrogation where there may be a third partyliability to a Medi-Cal patient. Failure to ascertain cases where subrogationmight exist and to pursue such cases is also depriving Medi-Cal of a potentialrecovery of money. (F) The failure by the counties and HCS to maintain current records of bene-ficiary eligibility has also been a source of many problems in administering theprogram. 1. One problem of constant irritation has been the making of duplicate pay-ments to vendors. This often occurs where an initial claim is rejected because thepatient is not found to be eligible for benefits. Upon further inquiry, however,the patient is deemed eligible and a second claim is submitted. This problem witheligibility records has often resulted in payments being made upon both claims.2. The failure by the counties and HCS to maintain current records on eligi-bility has also caused the rejection of claims which should have been paid andthe payment of claims which should have been rejected. By not keeping recordscurrent inquiries as to eligibility have also resulted in undue delay in renderingservices and paying vendors.(G) Processing Claims Mention has been made that the fiscal agents are responsible for processingclaims of vendors. A closer look at their activities is necessary in considering theoverall administration of the Medi-Cal Program.Blue Shield receives 70,000 claims a day to process. These claims are intiallyreviewed for completeness of form and legibility. They are then examined on anindividual claims basis by people trained to determine if the vendor has billed theproper amount for the services and if the services seem reasonable. If the claimsseem proper they are forwarded to be microfilmed and to be paid.Each claim is reviewed for the purpose of preparing it for data processing. Thisfunction actually requires some employees to cross out information requested onthe forms provided by the state, but which is not needed for the processing of theclaim. (E.g., telephone number of vendor.) Other employees have the task ofprinting names of vendors which are not legible on the claims submitted.Blue Cross processes some 5,000 claims a day from institutional vendors. They,too, use trained personnel who review claims primarily to determine if the serv-ices and amount of claim is proper. These claims are also processed to preparethem for data processing. Both fiscal agents utilize computers to a great extent. Among other things. thecomputers are supposed to be used for the purpose of determining who has beenpaid, amounts which have been paid, and kicking out requests for duplicate pay- 24-798-69-pt. 3-15830 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS ment. The effectiveness of any computer is dependent upon how it is programmed and the accuracy of information it is given. 1. There have been numerous instances where vendors have received double and triple payment for services they have rendered. Preliminary investigation has disclosed that one hospital, for example, has received duplicate payments involving some 59 different patients amounting to $17,000 in overpayments. -a. Various reasons exist for such duplicate payments. In the case of the hospital it was found that employees of the fiscal agent insert a diagnostic code on the claim received from the hospital. The code is determined by the diagnosis set forth on the claim. If a duplicate claim is submitted a different employee might interpret the same diagnosis in such a way so as to insert a different code number on the claim. Due to the difference in code numbers the computer will not detect the duplicate claim and payment will be made upon both claims. b. Another means in which duplicate payments can occur is where a vendor initially submits a claim for $1,000 which shows that the patient's liability for such services is $100. The claim would thus request a net payment to the vendor of $900. If it was subsequently determined that the patient's liability should have been $200 a duplicate claim might be submitted by the vendor requesting $800. Due to the difference in the net amount claimed the computer would once again be unable to detect the duplicate claim and again it is probable that payments of both $800 and $900 would be made to the vendor. 2. There also have been cases where the computers have not properly recorded where vendors have or have not been paid. This type of error often results in inquiries being made by the vendors resulting in additional time and expense in ascertaining if payment has been made. The inability of the fiscal agents to accurately advise investigators and con- sultants who request information as to whether vendors have been paid creates further delay and interference in the pursuit of investigations. Investigation dis- closed, for example, that upon inquiry as to whether specific vendors have been paid the fiscal agent replied in the negative although such vendors had in fact received payment. 3. The current systenm of processing claims has not only resulted in making duplicate payments to vendors who have rendered services to patients, but errors in the program have also caused checks to be sent to persons who have never provided services to Medi-Cal patients. It is difficult to estimate the amount of money which Medi-Cal has mistakenly paid out as a result of the errors we have mentioned. At the outset of the report we noted that as of June 30, 1967, one and a half million dollars in overpay- ments were voluntarily refunded by vendors. HCS estimates that another one million dollars in overpayments are still outstanding. Unless the vendor is hon- est and voluntarily notifies the fiscal agents of such duplicate payments it is unlikely that they would be discovered under the current auditing procedures. Both fiscal agents have expressed the desire and need for better computer op- erations which would assist them in the performance of their duties in processing claims for payment. REcoMMENDATIoNs The responsibility imposed upon H0CS to administer the Medi-Cal Program is not one to be envied. Massive problems have confronted 10CS from the initial day the program began operating and many of them still exist today. Since the operation of the Medi-Cal Program is under constant review by both HCS and the California Legislature we offer herein suggestions concerning cer- tain areas in the program which may be of some benefit to those agencies which are looking for ways to improve the program. Many of the matters mentioned in this report have been discussed with I0CS which has already begun to take steps to remedy some of the weaknesss found in the program. 1. Establish an Effective Investigating Unit ka) One problem which has been mentioned in regard to the enforcement of the program has been the difficulty in discovering vendors who have taken ad- vantage of the program. Similar difficulty exists in finding those recipients of Medi-Cal who also take advantage of the program. We have noted that under the current system investigators are employed by HICS, Los Angeles County and the fiscal agents. Failure to coordinate theirCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 831 activities has resulted not only in duplication of work and needless expenditureof money, but has produced far too few cases against persons abusing the program.HCS investigations have produced few proceedings against vendors. This lackof suspensions and criminal or other disciplinary actions has been caused ingreat part by the inordinate amount of time which expires between the com-mencement and the conclusion of investigations. Because of the time lag evidencebecomes stale and, in some cases, the witnesses have died. The latter, of course,is a particular problem in the field of medical investigations.It is therefore recommended that a single investigative unit be established,consisting of at least ten men, under the supervision of one person who wouldhave the responsibility of assigning cases and coordinating investigativeactivities. The investigators should be experienced or trained to efficiently perform in-vestigations into the various types of abuses mentioned in this report. Since LosAngeles County receives approximately forty-five percent of the money spent inthe welfare program the majority of investigators should be located in the LosAngeles area. The recommendation of a single investigative unit is not intended to precludeconsideration of a proposed arrangement whereby the fiscal agents would havetheir own investigators. (b) The investigative staff should be provided with adequate equipment andsecretarial help to assist them to perform their duties in an efflcient manner.(c) This report has discussed the various means by which vendors have beentaking advantage of the program. It is recommended that with use of thisknowledge a manual be prepared to set forth basic procedures which should befollowed by investigators when doing audits and investigations of specific typesof vendors. (d) Investigations now occur as the result of complaints which may be re-ceived. It is suggested that consideration be given to having investigators performroutine audits and investigations without the necessity of receiving a complaint.Such routine investigations would be especially effective in discovering abusesamong such vendors as pharmacies and nursing homes and in acting as a deter-rent to those who might otherwise consider abusing the program.(e) The inability of investigators to obtain information from the fiscal agentshas hampered effective investigation. Procedures should therefore be establishedwhereby investigators can request and obtain within a reasonable period of timeinformation which is needed for investigations.(f) Both fiscal agents when processing claims attempt to discover providerswho may be engaging in fraud or providing excessive services.Effective liaison should be established between the investigative unit and thefiscal agents so that they may be apprised of the activities of each other. 2. Improve Procedures to Expedite Suspension Proceedings If our recommendations for investigations are followed, there should be a vastimprovement in the ability of the investigators to expedite cases and, whereappropriate, to recommend disciplinary proceedings. While recommendations forcriminal or disciplinary action would be referred to agencies other than HCS,in most instances the suspension of the vendor from the program would also beappropriate. This emphasizes the need for improving HCS suspension proceed-ings. In the past, HCS' method in acting on suspensions from the program hasproven unsatisfactory from the standpoint of both procedure and results.It is therefore recommended that HCS take steps to improve the manner inwhich it handles proceedings to determine if a vendor should be suspended. Twopossible sources to which HCS may look for advice in this matter are the AttorneyGeneral's Office and the Office of Administrative Procedure since both these officeshave extensive experience in the processing of administrative hearings. S. Publicize Eexistence and Actions of Investigative Unit It is recommended that the existence of the investigative unit be made knownto the public and to persons providing and receiving benefits under the program.This would encourage information and complaints from the public and wouldalso deter abuses. The establishment of an effective unit should also result in an increase in thenumber of criminal actions, suspensions, and disciplinary actions taken against832 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS persons participating in the program. Here again, it is recommended that such actions be publicized as a deterrant to abuses. 4. Establish Liaison with Professional Licensing Boards Most of the persons providing services under Medi-Cal, such as physicians, dentists and optometrists are licensed by a professional board within the Depart- ment of Professional and Vocational Standards. Many of the abusive activities engaged in by vendors under the welfare program would also constitute a viola- tion of the regulations established by their licensing boards. Since it is the desire of both HCS and such licensing boards to discover and take appropriate action against such vendors, it is recommended that HCS establish an effective liaison with the relevant professional boards. By doing so, 10CS not only will bring to the attention of such boards the activities of their licentiates which may warrant disciplinary action, but HCS may also be able to obtain additional investigative help through use of the staff of investigators employed by such boards. 5. Improve Communication Between Organizations Participating in the Ad- ministration of the Program This report has revealed that the lack of communication between fICS, the fiscal agents and the counties has been a major impediment to the effective ad- ministration of the program. It is therefore recommended that HCS should take appropriate steps to im- prove the communication and cooperation between these agencies. One suggestion would be to hold periodic meetings with the professional county consultants and the fiscal agents to provide the opportunity to exchange views on improving program administration. Professional consultants, for ex- ample, from their review of thousands of claims might be a good source from which to obtain information to improve the program to assure the providing of necessary health services. Such meetings would also clarify such matters as when discretion is to be exercised by counties when processing claims. Meetings with the fiscal agents could be used to keep HCS abreast of the problems in processing claims and advised of new electronic data processing techniques to meet present and anticipated problems. 6. lNew Regulations Consideration should be given to enacting new regulations which would im- plement the enforcement of the program. (a) Improved communication with the counties and fiscal agents might prove to be one source of determining additional regulations which may be appropriate. (b) At the present time vendors are not required to maintain any specific records or documents in regard to services they have provided. For example, nursing homes are not required to maintain records which would show the various services rendered to their patients. We have seen from this report that a major area of fraudulent billing concerns services provided to persons in nursing homes. It is therefore suggested that consideration be given to the enactment of a regulation which would specify the types of records that must be maintained by vendors and which requires them to retain such records for a reasonable period of time. One possible effect of such a regulation might be to expedite investigations by enabling investigators to examine documents in the possession of vendors thereby removing the delay now encountered when records must be obtained from the fiscal agents. (c) Mention has been made of at least two \"loopholes\" in the program which allows physical therepists to bill through nursing homes and suspended physicians to bill through a group practice to circumvent existing regulations. Regulations should be enacted to prevent such circumvention. 7. Review Procedure of Processing Claims Blue Shield employs some 360 persons to process 70,000 claims a day. Blue Cross employs approximately 70 persons to process 5,000 claims a day. The procedures used by these fiscal agents should be periodically reviewed to see if their system of processing claims can be expedited and the cost lowered. (a) In light of the large number of claims processed each day, the elimination of any one unnecessary step might result in a significant savings of money. As an example, claim forms provided by HCS request information which is not needed in the processing of claims. In fact, persons reviewing claims actually cross out such information to avoid errors in preparation of data processing.COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 833 Other persons who review claims do so for the limited purpose of printing thename of the vendor on those claims where the name is not legible.The expense of providing new forms which only contain required informationor the identification of the vendor; or the providing of preprinted identificationcards to vendors and recipients of benefits, might be one means to expedite andlower the cost of processing claims.(b) Reference was made in the report to the fact that the fiscal agents micro-film the claims they process. The large number of claims processed may wellmake it necessary to do so since it enables thousands of records to be stored onmicrofilm in a single file drawer.Since the use of microfilm however is one factor in the delay in providing in-formation to investigators, efforts should be made to establish a procedure where-by information can be made more readily available to investigators. S. Improve Use of Computers Computers are presently used by both fiscal agents in the reviewing and proc-essing of claims. Efforts should be made to improve control procedures and theprogramming of computers to assist them in their handling of claims.Improved procedures in the computer program should eliminate errors suchas making payments to persons who do not participate in the program and inmaking duplicate payments. Since Medi-Cal pays a fixed fee to many vendors for specific procedures andservices which are usually listed by code number on claim forms, considerationshould be given to the feasibility of programming computers to make use of thisinformation. By doing so, such errors as excessive payments and payments forservices not authorized should be eliminated. The success of such programmingmight also reduce the need to employ persons who now manually perform thesetasks. Another area in which improved techniques of the computer system might beof value is in providing information to investigators and to vendors who requestinformation on the status of claims. The inability to accurately determine whohas been paid is one cause of the needless expenditure of money under theprogram. It is important to mention that, prior to considering methods to improve theuse of computers, HCS and the fiscal agents should attempt to anticipate the typeof information and statistics which would be of value in the future to both theadministration and the legislature as they seek to improve the Medi-Cal Program. 9. Review of Claims on a Local Basis Pior to Medi-Cal the county welfare departments had the responsibility ofreceiving, reviewing and paying claims of persons providing services under thewelfare program. That responsibility has now been shifted to the fiscal agentswhich process claims from vendors all over the state, although professionalconsultants employed by the counties still pass upon requests for priorauthorization. In the opinion of most persons interviewed, the current method of review hasgreatly diminished the ability of both the county consultants and the fiscalagents to discover vendors abusing the program and has reduced the amount ofmoney saved by the discovery of such abuses.It is therefore recommended that consideration be given to returning to a systemwhere claims are reviewed on a local basis rather than out of the one office ofBlue Shield and the two offices of Blue Cross. Indeed, to some extent this typeof review is being employed under the current system.Blue Shield, for example. subcontracts with various county medical founda-tions whereby said foundations perform the task of receiving and reviewingclaims of physicians in their county. There is also a pilot project going on inSan Joaquin County where the county medical foundation is performing the taskof receiving and reviewing claims submitted by most vendors. Evaluation of thisproject should be of considerable help in determining the feasibility of againhaving local review. One advantage of a local review is that it is usually performed by persons whoare more familiar with the practice in a given area and with vendors whosereputation might justify their claims being closely scrutinized.Another advantage is that local review allows for maintenance of betterrecords. For example, San Joaquin County Medical Foundation in the pilot projecthas been able to maintain a patient folder upon which It records all services whichthe patient receives from any type of vendor. This has enabled the foundation to24-798-69-pt. 8-16834 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS discover situations where vendors, or the patient himself, has been taking advan- tage of the program. The foundation is currently working on a method of estab- lishing a profile on vendors participating in the program as another means of discovering abuses being engaged in by vendors. Also, the foundation has been able to program computers to provide greater information than that which is now available in the processing of claims by Blue Shield and Blue Cross on a statewide basis. This too has been a means of enabling greater detection of abuses under the program. While a return to reviewing claims on a local basis might present problems such as central control of payment of checks and maintenance of statistics, the concept of local review appears to merit further attention. Another interesting experiment in the pilot project in San Joaquin is that the county foundation is processing claims of physicians on a \"prepaid\" basis. A fixed amount of money has been given to the foundation to cover the services provided by physicians in the county. If the funds provided are not adequate the loss is incurred by the member physicians in the foundation. If successful, use of a prepaid system should be studied and evaluated to see if it would be appropriate in other areas in the state. 10. Post-examination of CGamgs Reference was briefly made in the report to the fact that the Utilization Committe of Blue Shield recently began checking claims by doing a \"post- examination\" of claims. Careful evaluation of the success in discovering abuses should be given to this method of examining claims. If proven successful, consideration should be given to establishing some type of post-examination for other types of vendors. Several advantages appear to 'be offered under this system. First, a review of claims by this method is done on a \"group -basis\" which we have seen is preferable to the examination of claims on an \"individual claim\" basis. Secondly, by taking advantage of information which can be obtained from computers it enables those who review claims to take the initiative in checking on vendors who engage in services that are considered likely to be abusing the program. By use of computers, for example, it is possible to establish profiles of vendors who receive the greatest reimbursement for specific procedures. If successful as a method of discovering abuses the use of post-examination of claims might achieve additional savings by eliminating the need and cost of hiring persons who now perform duties which would be unnecessary in the processing of claims. Finally, the use of a post-examination would probably be successful in regain- ing money from vendors who have abused the program. Since vendors who do abuse the program usually perform services to which they are legitimately en- titled to receive payment, it would be possible to withhold money due the vendor for legitimate claims as an offset for the money which he wrongfully obtained. One example of the success resulting from a post audit review of claims is illustrated by an investigation made into the activities of twenty physicians who performed an unusual number of surgical operations for umbilical hernias in children under five. Of the cases so far reviewed, the determination has been made that the operations performed by many of these physicians were in fact unnecessary. 11. Controlling the Cost of Drugs We have discussed at length the potential increase in costs which may accom- pany the new method under which pharmacies have been instructed to ascertain their \"cost\" of drugs for the purpose of billing the Medi-Cal Program. If the intent of the administration is to reimburse pharmacies for the true cost of drugs they dispense and then to pay them a fixed professional fee for their services, the billing instructions in the new drug formulary does not achieve this goal. If pharmacies are to be paid in a manner which fixes their cost on the purchase of a minimum quantity of drugs it is recommended that this method of reimbursement be carefully evaluated to determine its effect on the anticipated cost of the drug program. The new drug formulary also deletes a number of drugs upon which there was previously-placed a maximum cost which could be charged to the welfare pro- gram. If the effect of deleting these drugs 'results in a significant increase in the cost to Medi-Cal to provide such drugs, consideration should be given not onlyCOSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 835 to reinstating a maximum cost on these drugs but also to the merit of imposingsimilar maximum costs on other drugs. Imposing a maximum cost on drugsapparently has not had the effect of preventing such drugs from being madeavailable to patients in the program so that such action does not prevent patientsfrom receiving proper care.In connection with the cost of drugs, suggestions have been made that a fairprice could be established for all drugs in the formulary thereby establishing adefinite fee schedule for drugs.As in the case of any other specific service being paid based on a fee schedule,improved computer programming of such information could expedite the pay-ment of such claims and eliminate the errors which have been found in theamount of money being paid and even in the payment of drugs and other medicalsupplies which are not authorized under the program.Another means of controlling the drug cost of the program which has beensuggested is to establish \"Medi-Cal Pharmacies\" throughout the state. This wouldrequire patients to go to one of the numerous pharmacies which would contractwith the state to service persons in the program. 12. Scope of Benefits It is the opinion of many persons directly involved in administering the Medi-Cal Program that Medi-Cal patients are receiving health care services which.are far greater than services which a non-welfare patient would either antici-pate or demand. The opportunity to provide and receive such services has created a temptingarea of abuse by both vendors and recipients of benefits.It is therefore recommended that consideration be given to the question ofwhether changes could be made to assure persons on welfare of proper medicaltreatment without providing the opportunity to abuse the program.To illustrate this problem, we mentioned in the report that the investigationdisclosed that thousands of persons are now residing in nursing homes althoughtheir physical conditions do not warrant such extensive care. One major reasonfor this situation results from Medi-Cal's failure to provide benefits to personsin facilities other than nursing hollies (e.g., board and care homes, rest rooms,etc.). Family pressure upon physicians to keep persons in nursing homes sincethey would not get reimbursed if in other types of facilities is just one reasonwhy so many persons are found in nursing homes although their physical condi-tions do not merit such care.If reduced Medi-Cal payments were made to facilities providing less exten-sive care than nursing homes, the end result might to be effectuate a savingsin the total Medi-Cal Program. Furthermore, a program which would removethousands of persons from nursing homes who do not need such care would alsocreate vacancies for persons who do require such care but are unable to receiveit due to lack of space in the homes. 13. Third Party Liability Although provisions exist in the law for Medi-Cal to recover its expenditures,if there is third party liability involved, the program has been very lax in pur-suing this avenue to reduce the cost of the program.It is therefore recommended that procedures be established to allow Medi-Calto avail itself of this source of revenue.Similarly, the methods now used to determine if the recipients of benefits arepaying their share of liability under the program should be reviewed since thefailure to do so needlessly increases the cost of the program. 14. Purchase of Appliances Consideration should be given to determining if the state could contract withvendors of appliances (e.g., wheelchairs, crutches, etc.) whereby there is anagreement to purchase such appliances at a discount. Also, study should begiven to the question of whether a savings would result if a procedure wasestablished whereby the state or the vendor of the appliance could reobtain,service and store the appliance from patients who no longer required them,which appliances could then be used for other patients.These matters should be reviewed to determine not only if they are feasiblefrom a money savings point of view but if they can be accomplished in com-pliance with federal laws under which Medi-Cal operates.836 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS CONCLUSION The recommendations set forth herein are not intended to exhaust all prob- lem areas in the Medi-Cal Program which require attention. These recommendations are intended to correct the weaknesses in the ad- ministration of the program which contribute especially to cheating by per- sons participating in the program. The abuses and weaknesses pointed out in the report are serious in nature and do merit further attention by the appropriate bodies which can take steps to improve the administration of the program and achieve immense savings of money without diminishing the quality of the services being offered to persons under the program. As you requested\" this report will be provided to law enforcement agencies to improve surveillance of outright criminal activity in the Medi-Cal Program. HERBERT DAvIs, Deputy Attorney General. ITEM 2: STATEMENT ON ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REPORT MADE BEFORE THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON MEDI-CAL ADMINISTRATION ON NOVEMBER 13, 1968, BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NURS- ING HOMES, SANITARIUMS, REST HOMES, AND HOMES FOR THE AGED, INC. ExHIBIT On November 6, 1968, the Attorney General of the State of California released a document which purported to be a report on the findings of a nine-month inves- tigation of the Medi-Cal program. This document displays an unconscionable misfeasance and malfeasance in an office of public trust. That such an unethical and unprofessional report should be issued from the office of the Attorney General can only serve to demonstrate that political motives have taken control of a public office that presumably is pledged to protect and defend against unwarranted prosecution and presecu- tion. as it is to seek out and punish individual criminals. The report is replete with false accusations against a body of health care professionals who are dedicated to the highest ideals of service. The document is loaded with generalities, vague statements, uneducated guesses, passive word- ing, and displays a shocking lack of knowledge oil the part of the attorney general's personnel, of the professional relationships in the health care field they seek to explore. To use the prestige of the high office of Attorney General to publish such a document, to hold a press conference, and to release this scurrilous report for public consumption is inexcusable conduct. To attempt to destroy the public confidence in an industry that is dedicated to serve them, and to attempt to do so with a document based on hearsay, unconfirmed statements and isolated instances is reprehensible, and is grounds for a legislative investigation of the office of California's Attorney General. The following review of excerpts of the Attorney General's report will support this contention. REPORT ON MEDI-CAL INVESTIGATIONS Verbatim quotes from the Attorney General's report follo: Comments from the California Association of Nursing Homes are identified as such and folou; each quote from the report. Excerpt: \"Our investigation indicates that illegal and unethical activities of persons providing services under Medi-Cal are siphoning millions of dollars annually from the program.

Comment-how can anything be termed unethical without first identifying the details of the applicable ethics? Comment-if poor administration exists, then some effort should be made to improve it.

This committee recommended changeswhich would allegedly save Medi-Cal $90,000,000 annually.\"Comment-not being a part of the findings of the investigation, this is obvi-ously a politically inspired statement which seeks to discredit the administrationwhich is of a different political party than the attorney general.

And, it was done with-out the help of the several interested professional associations that had vol-unteered help. Excerpt: \". ..we recognize the problems confronted by Health Care Services in ad-ministering a program which was hastily conceived and implemented.\"Comment-one of the few unquestionable statements in the report. Excerpt: \"There is a lesson here for both the state and federal governments. The enact-ment of federal legislation which requires immediate response from the statesto take advantage of federal funding is laden with peril, as well as with tokenprosperity. Unprepared and without sufficient analysis, the states are rushed intoformulating programs which are both essential and ill-considered. There shouldbe an effort by both federal and state governments to transform such programsinto more meaningful and fruitful cooperative actions.\"Comment-is it the place of the offce of the Attorney General to issue phil-osophical editorials? It is here suggested that all governmental agencies should seek the help ofprofessionals \"to transform such programs into more meaningful and fruitfulcooperative actions\". Excerpt: \"The investigation revealed that vendors are engaging in unlawful activitiesand are bilking the program....\" Comment-such condemnatory and infiamatory language is not necessaryand is unbecoming the office of California's attorney general.

Excerpt: \"In describing these abuses we recognize that they may in fact be engagedin by only a small number of providers.\"Comment-this statement is not consistent with the many insinuations, ac-cusations and allegations that appear throughout the report. Excerpt: \". ..the millions of dollars drained from the program by such activitiesmerit their exposure to the public and....\"838 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Comment-the function of the attorney general's office is not one of seeking publicity. Why such an effort at this time? Excerpt: \"There are approximately 1,000 nursing homes licensed by the State of Cal- ifornia....\" Comment-if this investigation had been as complete and thorough as the attorney general's office would have us believe, the investigators certainly would have discovered that there are approximately 1,160 homes licensed by the De- partment of Public Health and another 90 (approximately) licensed by the De- partment of Mental Hygiene. Excerpt: \"The investigation revealed that nursing homes are engaging in numerous activities which violate the laws and regulations governing Medi-Cal.\" Comment-if this is more than an allegation, there should be some citations issued and prosecutions instigated. And-how many are described by the word Inumerous'. Excerpt: \"Medi-Cal beneficiaries in nursing homes receive $15 per month from the county for incidental expenses. In many homes this money is maintained by the nursing home on behalf of the beneficiary. The investigation has disclosed that some nursing homes misappropriate ex- pense money which they maintain on behalf of beneficiaries.\" Comment-the funds are retained-not maintained-for the patient by the nursing home administration which has posted a bond for handling such per- sonal funds. Did investigators determine that there had been any claims filed against these bonds? Also, just what quantities are indicated by such words as 'many' and 'some'? Excerpt: \"In one case, for example, it was found that a nursing home was in pos- session of some $2,000 which belonged to persons who either died or who were discharged from the homes.\" Comment-is this the only case discovered by the investigation? One such case out of more than 1,250 possibilities is much above the record of any other profession in the matters of poor judgment, questionable practices or plain ignorance. Excerpt: \"(4) Another abuse which was found relates to the receipt of duplicate pay- ments by nursing homes. This can occur in situations where the fiscal agent accidentally makes the duplicate payment or where the nursing home submits a duplicate payment hoping to be paid twice. In either situation the unethical vendor retains the duplicate payment without notifying the fiscal agent.\" Comment-this passive statement is evidently based on conjecture and sur- mise. The investigator acknowledges the probability of an accidental happening. However, the report proceeds to damn an entire profession for one imagined happening. Excerpt: \"WVe have already noted that HCS itself estimates that approximately 2.5 million dollars in overpayments have been made to all types of vendors.\" Comment-admittedly, this is purely an estimate; no basis is supplied to ex- plain it. Although the amount of 2.5 million dollars is here identified as over- payment to all types of vendors, elsewhere in this report the amount is identified as overpayment to nursing homes alone. Exrcerpt: \"Duplicate payments also occur where a nursing home has patients who are eligible to receive benefits from both Medi-Cal and Medicare. While Medi-Cal is only supposed to pay that amount which Medicare does not cover, the sub- mission of duplicate claims under both welfare programs often results in the nursing home, for example receiving a duplicate payment of approximately $50,000 by billing in this manner.\"COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 839 Comment-this just simply is not so. Again, how often is 'often'? Was thereonly one nursing home that could be charged with \"billing in this manner\"? Oneout of how many? Was there proof of intent to defraud? Excerpt: \"Nursing homes may also receive payment in another manner. A home is re-imbursed by Medi-Cal for providing a service, yet it also bills and receives pay-ment for this same service from the patient or his relatives.\"Comment-with shared liability (Group II), the nursing home must bill boththe intermediary and the patient. The patient (family) is given official notice ofshared payment. Again, how many is indicated by the word \"many\"? Excerpt: \"The investigation revealed that it is common practice for nursing homesto....\" Comment-if it is common practice then can it be objectionable? (By definition,anything 'common' is shared or approved by all; belongs or pertains to the publicat large.) Actually, this comment is made to show the bias in the Attorney General'soffice in using words to insinuate the scope of investigation was far greater thanthe report itself openly admits. Such a broadly sweeping charge and generalallegation without any supporting evidence is reprehensible. Excerpt: .it is common practice for vendors such as pharmacists, therapists, X-raytechnicians and laboratory clinics to give kickbacks in order to obtain businessfrom nursing homes.\" Comment-such a broad, all-inclusive indictment should be supported by somedocumentation. Again, the investigator is careless with language by statingthat (if true) the one thing he attempts to condemn is known and accepted byall. Eaxcerpt: \"(6) Nursing homes often provide services to their residents which are greatlyin excess of the services actually needed. Such overservicing is cause for droppinga nursing home from the Medi-Cal program.\"Comment-all services of a nursing home are ordered by the patient's ownphysician. In this erroneous statement, the investigator should have explainedhow a nursing home can 'overservice' a patient. Actually, this paragraph displaysthe appalling ignorance of the investigating staff in the basic relationship of thephysician-patient-provider of service. Excerpt: \"(a) Our investigation indicated that some nursing homes order drugs far inexcess of the quantities required by their residents. This situation can occursince physicians often prescribe continuous medication for persons in the homesand the homes determine when to order the medication.\"Comment-during a nine-month investigation, the attorney general's repre-sentatives did not discover that nursing homes do not order drugs. This is doneby the physician who also specifies the quantities required by the patient. Anursing home chart is a requisition-not a prescription. A pharmacist is legallyand professionally required to verify and obtain prescriptions from the doctor. Excerpt: \" (b) Another method by which excessive services are provided is where nursinghomes have arrangements with vendors such as physicians, dentists, optometrists,podiatrists, etc.., which permit them to examine persons in the home whether ornot their services are required or requested.\"Comment-all such services are ordered by the physician. This is an assertionwithout foundation. Excerpt: \"Indications of 'mass examinations' by such vendors have been observed bycounty consultants throughout the state in the course of their processing re-quests for prior authorization. Persons in the home seldom object to such exam-ination since they are not usually required to pay for such services.\"840 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Comment-this is an attempt at a sweeping indictment against all 58 counties in California; which is patently ridiculous. If \"county consultants throughout the state\" observed all these things, why wasn't something done about it? The final sentence is both fatuous and absurd. The fact is all such \"examinations\" are ordered or appropved by the patient's attending physician. Excerpt: \"(c) Information has been obtained which indicates yet a third method by which excessive services are provided by nursing homes. This relates to the sit- uation where a nursing home attempts to 'qualify' Medi-Cal patients for Medi- care. Since nursing homes receive greater reimbursement for persons who are eligible for Medicare than they do for persons eligible for Medi-Cal it is to their benefit to have a patient classified as a Medicare patient.\" Comment-this statement again demonstrates the fact that the investigators did not have sufficient knowledge to qualify them for this study. The fact is that both Medi-Cal and Medicare are cost reimbursement programs. If the Attorney General in this paragraph is admitting that Medi-Cal reimbursement is less than the reasonable cost required by law then it is acceptable as such. However, a simple statement to this fact would be more appropriate than the round-about verbiage in the report. Excerpt: \"A former administrator of a nursing home has alleged that some nursing homes have an arrangement with hospitals whereby Medi-Cal patients are trans- ferred from the home to the hospital for a period of three days and then returned to the home.\" Comment-the investigators strive mightily to make a point based on the allegations of a former administrator, hinting at an unspecified 'arrangement'. Among other things, one may wonder why their source is now a former admin- istrator. The fact is that all transfers of a patient from a nursing home to a hos- pital are ordered or approved by the patient's attending physician (except in the possible case of an emergency). Excerpt: \"The nursing home benefits 'by this arrangement since it receives reimburse- ment at the greater rate from Medicare when the patient is returned to the home. The hospital benefits because it is reimbursed for providing services to the patient which usually include laboratory tests, x-rays, etc. (Under such an ar- rangement the nursing home or hospital usually has a physician who authorizes the patient to be hospitalized.)\" Comment-in stating that Medicare reimburses at a greater rate than Medi- Cal, are the investigators calling attention to the fact that Medi-Cal rates are less than reasonable cost? Tn the parenthesized sentence, the investigators are again displaying a great lack of knowledge of their subject. There is always an attending physician-not usually. Excerpt: \"This type of activity not only provides services to a patient which were not needed nor requested, but the question of 'eligibility' may determine whether a nursing home will accept a Medi-Cal patient into the home.\" Comment-a patient does not request services; the doctor does. This statement makes an absurd assumption; that such an unlikely and illegal action is ap- proved by the nursing home administrator, the hospital management, several doctors, a utilization review team, a medical staff (audit committee). and the fiscal intermediary. This is idiotic. Further, with reference to \"eligibility\" we assume that this is another reference to Medi-Cal reimbursement being less than reasonable cost. Veiled as it is we accept it as such. Excerpt: \"In addition to effecting services provided under Medi-Cal. the unlawful activi- ties of nursing homes also effect services provided under the federal program of Medicare. The activities described also result in a needless expenditure of funds under that program. Indeed, the scope of such unlawful activities was a mat- ter of inquiry before a congressional subcommittee on Long Term Care in 1965. Testimony given before this subcommittee Indicated that many of the activities we have described concerning nursing homes are prevalent throughout the nation.\"COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 841 Comment-in addition to using the words 'effecting' and 'effect' when it is ob-vious that they meant to use 'affecting' and 'affect', and drawing on events thattook place before the time of Medicare (the 1965 Long Term Care inquiry), thewriters of this paragraph have lost themselves in polysyllabic hash that is as in-competent as it is irrelevant and immaterial. The true meaning of this paragraphis that the report itself documents the appalling ignorance and incompetency ofthe investigatory staff in stating conclusions on Medicare with reference to acongressional report prepared prior to the enactment of Medicare. Excerpt: \"We concentrated our investigation of hospitals on the profit making variety.There have been no indications that the abuses we are studying are prevalentin public and non-profit institutions.\"Comment-why do the investigators make this discriminatory statement; theymust have discovered that administrative controls apply to all types.If no investigation was made, how do they know that there is no indication ofabuses in public and non-profit facilities. Excerpt: \"These Medi-Cal abuses seem to be predominant in physician-owned hospitals.Since there are no significant differences in the patterns of abuse in nursinghomes and hospitals, we will not offer extensive examples of hospital problems.\"Comment-Conjecture again. The investigators state that abuses seem to bemore prevalent in one type of facility. This sort of statement is inadmissible inany court of law. If there is 'no significant difference' in the patterns of abuse in nursing homesand hospitals, why, then, did the investigators choose to persecute the nursinghomes? They have already established that hospitals are the bigger spenders,yet they make nursing homes the target of their unfounded accusations. This isrank discrimination. Excerpt: \"Our comments on nursing homes clearly indicate the Mledi-Cal problems whichmay be found in hospitals. An audit of just seven hospitals, for example, betweenMarch and August 1968, resulted in a recovery of $136,000 by Blue Cross.\"Comment-this is a msleading statement; comments of the investigators havenot clearly indicated anything; in saying that something 'may' be found is inad-missible; an audit of seven hospitals out of more than 600 is not conclusive.Question: how can the study of one class of institution (nursing homes) lendto any conclusion, 'clearly' or not, about another class of institution (hospitals),or put another way, how can the study of oranges lead to a conclusion concerningapples? Question: with reference to the audit result why does the report always drawthe wrong conclusion? That is, if there has been overpayment the purpose of auditis for recovery of the money. Thus, if audit results in repayment the audit isworking as intended. Excerpt: \"One area in particular where this type of activity occurs relates to physicianssubmitting claims for having examined patients in nursing homes, although suchexaminations were not in fact performed.\"Comment-why do the investigators insist on singularly pointing out nursinghomes even when talking about an alleged abuse that has nothing to do witha nursing home? In this statement the investigator is talking about physicians,but drags in nursing homes to share the misleading accusation. Excerpt: \"Due to problems which hamper investigative activities into fraudulentactivities (discussed infra) the investigation was unable to determine the extentto which this type of conduct occurs.\"Comment-the investigators, themselves, admit this is a poor report. Excerpt: \"(b) The placement of persons in nursing homes whose physical conditiondoes not require such extensive care is another form of overservicing.\"Comment-the report should state that this is an abuse due to the actionsof a physician rather than-again-implying that nursing homes are at fault.842 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Excerpt: \"In Los Angeles County alone during a one-year period of time some 1,300 persons were requested to leave nursing homes by county consultants because their physical condition no longer required such extensive care.\" Comment-this indicates that the Medi-Cal consultant is functioning accord- ing to regulations-therefore, conclusion is entirely erroneous. Excerpt: \"Many nursing homes have 'house physicians'. These are physicians who have an arrangement with nursing homes whereby they take care of the persons in the home. By having a 'captive audience' the physician is able to realize a signi- ficant amount of income regardless of the actual need of the individual resident.\" Comment-once again, while delineating an accusation directed at physi- cians, the investigators feel called upon to mention nursing homes. Had they investigated hospitals, which they admittedly did not, they might have found that doctors have even more direct relations with the acute care facilities through an organized medical staff. The use of the word 'arrangement' in this context suggests something never defined in a straightforward manner; a sly type of aspersion. The statement that many-how many is that-have house doctors is ridiculous and misleading. Excerpt: \"For example, our investigation revealed incidents where physicians signed blank prescriptions which were given to them by the nursing home and which were subsequently completed by the home itself. In one instance, a physician thought he was signing a prescription for a drug when in fact it was filled in by a nursing home for a wheel chair for a patient who was ambulatory. In another case, 75 blank prescriptions signed by a doctor were found in a nursing home. Review of claims by consultants have also given rise to suspicion that it is the nursing home which prepares the forms describing the physical condition of per- sons who seek admission into the home. The 'house physicians' sign such forms although they, in fact, have not examined the patients.\" Comment-the investigator fails to identify exactly who in the nursing home is the object of his criticism. He, instead, refers to the nursing home as if it was a living, active entity. If it was determined that a doctor actually signed 75 blank prescription forms, he should have been prosecuted. Is it not the responsibility of the attorney gen- eral's office to enforce the laws. What has been done about this case other than talk about it and, again, calumniate the nursing homes by blaming them for the laxity of the legally responsible party. Excerpt: \"One blatant example of unnecessary services in a physician-owned hospital concerns a patient who was hospitalized for sixteen days. Ten blood tests, many of them identical, were taken each day the patient was hospitalized. Of the 160 tests taken, not one revealed an abnormal finding. Multiple x-rays of the chest, skull and cervical spine were also taken although here again no abnormality was ever revealed. This type of overservicing was similarly provided to many other patients in this same hospital.\" Comment-on one example the attorney general's investigator tries to build a case. Such a detailed statement justifies an equally detailed rebuttal. Frequently, even the most extensive testing fails to reveal laboratory findings which are reactive or diagnostic. The patient may, neverthless, be critically ill upon clinical examination and presentation of symptoms. An attorney is not qualified to criticize the doctors' processes, for the doctor is trying to find out why the patient is ill. Even in these hyperscientific times, there are old and newly identified clinical disorders that can-and do-make a patient very ill and still defy a laboratory finding. If the attorney general's office is going to be so presumptuous as to be critical of a physician's methodology, then any opinions should be supported with specific laboratory (investigative) reports that will lend credence to his clinical diag- nosis. Excerpt: \"(1) HCS publishes a drug formulary which contains instructions as to the manner in which pharmacies are to determine the cost of their drugs when billing the Medi-Cal Program.\"COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 843 Comment-to determine the cost of drugs, it is suggested that pharmacies lookat the appropriate invoice. This sort of statement again suggests the absolutelack of knowledge on the part of the investigators. Excerpt: \"It is therefore highly unlikely that the practice of excessive billing endedwith the enactment of the Medi-Cal Program.\"Comment-the use of the expression \"highly unlikely\" is an editorial con-clusion unsupported by fact. Excerpt: \" (3) Visits to nursing homes, hospitals, sanitariums and homes of patientsrevealed that some pharmacies give patients a generic drug but bill the state asthough the brand name drug had been dispensed. Under the formula for reim-bursement the excessive expenditure made by Medi-Cal due to such false claimscan amount to a significant amount of money.\"Comment-during their nine months of investigation, did the attorney general'sinvestigators determine the difference between nursing homes and sanitariums?They must have determined a significant difference that induced them to identifythem individually. Actually, this is a matter of highly imprecise terminology,but, again, displays the lack of knowledge of the Attorney General's staff. Excerpt: \" (5) It is permissible in California for a pharmacist to fill a prescription whichhas been authorized by a physician over the telephone. Whenever a pharmacistgets a request from a person other than a physician for a prescription, it is theduty and responsibility of the pharmacist to contact the physician prior to issuingthe drug.\"Comment-rather than erroneously condemning nursing homes, proprietaryhospitals and doctors earlier in this report, why did not the investigatorsacknowledge this bit of fact on pages 11(6), 12(b), 16 and elsewhere? Excerpt: \"(a) Some pharmacies needlessly dispense multiple prescriptions of the samedrug to the same patient over a short period of time.\"Comment-all prescriptions are dispensed in accordance with a doctor's writtenorders. How does the attorney general's office determine this medical judgement?Actually, this statement \"charges\" the pharmacist for doing what the law re-quires of him. Excerpt: \"This situation also occurs when nursing homes order prescription medicines.\"Comment-nursing homes do not order drugs-physicians are solely responsiblefor this. Excerpt: 'One pharmacy has even sent letters to nursing homes offering to give dis-counts for their business.\" Comment-in nine months of investigation, one culpable pharmacy was dis-covered, and the investigators feel they must ask nursing homes to share theblame. Excerpt: \"Although the investigation could not determine the exact amount of moneythe state is spending due to abuses by pharmacies it is significant to note that anaudit of only 39 stores was resulted in the recovery of approximately $132,000.\"Comment-This is less than eight-tenths of one percent; hardly a valid sample.Yet the attorney general's office insists this is a complete investigation. Again,the wrong conclusion-if audit results in recovery that is what it's supposedto do. Excerpt: \"Even where authorization to perform work is denied, however, the dentistsare still entitled to receive their fees for making routine examinations, althoughthese examinations are not always requested nor needed.\"Comment-if this investigation was as thorough as we have been asked tobelieve, then the investigators should have discovered that oral hygiene examsare required by Medicare. Again, medical judgement by an attorney?844 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Excerpt: ..... to provide lenses and frames to patients in nursing homes.\" Comment-would the investigators have us believe that only nursing homes have patients requiring the attentions of optometrists? Did they ignore all other types of facilities in their eagerness to indict the long-term health care profes- sion? Excerpt: \"In one case, for example, an optometrist requested approval for a pair of expensive prescription sunglasses for a patient. Investigation disclosed that the patient was blind.\" Comment-had the investigation been a thorough one, it might have been discovered that a patient may be legally blind and still have enough vision to require care and protection. And-this is one case in how many? Excerpt: \"Instances of fraud and overservicing, for example, could also be given for vendors such as hearing aid dealers, podiatrists and ambulance services.\" Comment-if the investigators do, indeed, have what they consider to be factual evidence involving these services, why are they not supplied. There was no hesitation in impugning the motives of other vendors with no supportable evidence in any considerable amount. Excerpt: \"In some cases the abuses mentioned may be prevalent among a specific class of vendor. In other cases only a small percentage of the class of vendors involved may be engaging in a particular type of abuse.\" Comment-The investigators proceed to becloud their own issue by declining to identify which type of vendor they are maligning the most. The second sentence should be amplified as it is most inconsistent with the entire report. Excerpt: \"'lost abuses are discovered in the course of the fiscal agents processing claims submitted for payment or consultants passing upon requests for prior authorization.\" Comment-being denied something does not constitute an abuse; it is exactly the opposite. The function of the fiscal agents and the county consultants is not understood by the Attorney General is the true meaning of this paragraph in the report. Excerpt: \"Whatever their reason, the inability of investigators and consultants to ob- tain documents and other information presents a serious problem and is pre- cluding effective investigation.\" Comment-after admitting this, the investigators have the audacity to issue this \"ineffective\" report. Excerpt: \"There has not been a clear understanding however as to which cases involve fraud and should therefore be referred to HCS.\" Comment-in view of the reasonably well stated laws and regulations and the fact that the attorney general's staff is supposed to contain legal experts, this statement only adds to the obfuscation of the report. Excerpt: \"Discovery of overservicing by hospitals or nursing homes, for example, may often give rise upon further inquiry by physicians, pharmacists and other ven- dors. Our investigation disclosed, however, that where abuses have been discov- ered by one fiscal agent which indicate that other vendors whose claims are reviewed by other fiscal agents should be investigated there has been a failure to adequately inform either HCS or the fiscal agent of potential investigations which might prove fruitful.\" Comment-these 77 words constitute one of the most generalized, irresponsible statements ever contrived. It serves to characterize the entire report. Excerpt: \"As one example, a recent audit by Blue Cross determined that one chain of eight nursing homes has received $380,000 from aIedi-Cal.\"COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS 845 Comment-Another example of the confusion which exists in this document.The report implies that a payment of \"in excess of $380,000 from Medi-Cal\" toa chain of eight nursing homes is an abuse of the program. The period of timeover which the amount was paid was not specified. Using this example, the fol-lowing extrapolations can be made: The average size of nursing homes in Cali-fornia is 57 beds, so we may assume these eight nursing homes comprise 456beds. We also know that approximately 65% of the nursing home beds in Cali-fornia are being \"purchased\" by the Medi-Cal program. Also giving the statewideoccupancy figure of 90%, the approximate number of beds occupied by Medi-Calpatients is 266.76. If the period (not specified in the report) is one year, therewould be a total of 97,367.4 Medi-Cal patient days. If one were to further assumea $10.00 per patient day rate for those facilities (maximum rate is $14.00), totalpayment to that chain would on this average basis be $973,674.00. Certainly,$380,000 is not excessive. This example illustrates how vague, confusing. poorlydocumented and unintelligible the report is. The report relies on implication andinnuendo to make its points. However, since the entire report is so carelesslywritten, it may be that the report intended to say that on audit this chain ofeight nursing homes was revealed to have received $380,000 more than it wasentitled to under the program. If that is the case then the obvious conclusionis that the audit system is working, which does not seem to be understood bythe Attorney General. Excerpt: \"For example, nursing homes are not required to maintain records whichwould show the various services rendered to their patients. We have seen fromthis report that a major area of fraudulent billing concerns services provided topersons in nursing homes.\" Comment-the statement made in the first sentence points out an appallingignorance of existing laws and regulations on the part of the attorney general'sstaff. Such medical records are required by law and must be retained for aminimum of 7 years. The second sentence is tantamount to libel of an entire industry; a statementbased on erroneous conclusions, no evidence and pure guesswork. We demand aretraction from the attorney general's office. Furthermore, we demand an in-vestigation by the legislature of what system in the Attorney General's officepermits such untruthfully repugnant statements in a publicly released document. Excerpt: \"It is therefore suggested that consideration be given to the enactment ofregulations which would specify the types of records that must be maintainedby vendors and which requires them to retain such records for a reasonableperiod of time. One possible effect of such a regulation might be to expediteinvestigations by enabling investigators to examine documents in the possessionof vendors thereby removing the delay now encountered when records must beobtained from the fiscal agents.\"Comment-the first sentence again displays the incompetence of the attorneygeneral's staff. There already is a law to this effect.As for the second statement, these records are available if the investigatorsknew where to look. Excerpt \";7. Review Procedure of Processing Claims\"Blue Shield employs some 350 persons to process 70,000 claims a day. BlueCross employs approximately 70 persons to process 5,000 claims a day.\"The procedures used by these fiscal agents should be periodically reviewedto see if their system of processing claims can be expedited and the cost lowered.\"Comment-if the attorney general's figures are correct, Blue Shield personnelmust process claims at the rate of 200 per man-day; 25 each hour, or approxi-mately 2 minutes per claim, and Blue Cross employees must adjudicate 710claims each man-day; approximately 88 per hour, or one every 40 seconds.One wonders if the attorney general's personnel, in suggesting that claimsprocessing be expedited, are claiming to be office systems engineers. Excerpt: \"a) In light of the large number of claims processed each day, the elimina-tion of any one unnecessary step might result in a significant savings of money.\"I846 COSTS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OLDER AMERICANS Comment-the attorney general's office now presumes to be a management consultant to the various state administrative agencies. Is the attorney gen- eral's staff instructed to spend investigative efforts to reach such determinations? Again, the validity of the entire report is questioned when it \"reaches\" for this type of a conclusion. Excerpt: \"In the opinion of most persons interviewed... Comment-how many were interviewed-who were they-were they knowl- edgable in the field of health care? And, is such a significant document as this is represented to be acceptable when, in part, it is based on opinions? Exoerpt: \"The recommendations set forth herein are not intended to exhaust all prob- lem areas in the Medi-Cal Program which require attention.\" Comment-in making this disclaimer a part of the summation, the attorney general's office implies realization of the inept nature of this report. 0 "}
