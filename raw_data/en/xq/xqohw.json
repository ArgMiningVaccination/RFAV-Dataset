Methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey of 307 practicing family physicians, full- time faculty physicians, and resident physicians in Kansas from December 14, 2020, to December 31,2020. The study participants completed an anonymous, 20-item survey assessing family physicians' con- cerns about exposure to COVID-19 and their perceptions of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to control SARS-CoV-2. A mixed-method approach was used to collect, analyze, and interpret the data. Results: There was a 51.1% response rate. The proportion of family physicians who reported their intentions to be vaccinated for COVID-19 was signicantly higher than those who were hesitant toreceive the mRNA vaccines (90.6% vs 9.4%; x2[1, n = 307] = 201.9.1; P<.0001). Among those who were willing to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, the main reasons were to pre- vent COVID-19 infection; protect self, family, and community; contribute to herd immunity; inspire con- dence that the vaccines are safe and end the pandemic and bring life back to normal. Conclusion: Our ndings suggest a signicantly positive association between a physician's concerns and their willingness to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. With the authoriza-tion of 2 new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, future studies should investigate the number of physicians in our study who received the vaccine. ( J Am Board Fam Med 2021;34:898-906.)

By January 9, 2021, over 87 million total con rmed cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and over 1.9 million con- rmed deaths had been reported globally, with theUnited States alone accounting for 22,102,069 con-rmed cases and 371,084 deaths. 1,2The number of cases began to rise sharply in Midwestern states dur- ing November 2020, affecting cities and small towns, with daily case rates surpassing 4,600 per 100,000 people in the state of Kansas, compared with just over2,000 per 100,000 at the beginning of October 2020. 2Health care professionals, including those in primary care specialties such as family medicine, areamong those working on the frontlines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 3,4 As the world struggles with the widespread infection, the scienti c community has raced to nd answers to control the spread and devastating consequences of the SARS-CoV-2. On December11, 2020, and December 18, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for P zer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, respectively for the prevention of severe symptoms of COVID- 19 in individuals 16 years and older. 5,6The EUAThis article was externally peer reviewed.

Downloaded from allowed the vaccines to be distributed and used in the United States. Despite the unprecedentedefforts by the scienti c community to ensure that the vaccines were safe and ef cacious, the wide- spread uptake of the COVID-19 vaccination had been undermined by vaccine hesitancy, similar to prior studies about vaccines where there was vari-able and inconsistent compliance. 7-12Successful immunization programs require widespread publiceducation campaigns by trusted stakeholders, such as primary care physicians. Prior studies have shown that physicians are the most trusted sourceof immunization information, 12-15suggesting that physicians are a valuable source of knowledge todrive acceptance of the approved mRNA COVID- 19 vaccines. In addition to educating patients about the safety and ef cacy of the approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, vaccination of health care providers is important in controlling the spread of the virus and role-modeling vaccine acceptance. Given that physicians are a trusted source of in- formation about vaccine acceptance, the purposes of this study were to assess family physicians 'per- ception of the FDA approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, their plans to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and their support for vaccination of patients and family mem- bers. We evaluated the concerns family physicians have about themselves, family, and patients becom-ing infected with COVID-19. We hypothesized that the family physicians 'concerns about their per- sonal risk of acquiring COVID-19 infections woulddirectly relate to their compliance with personally receiving an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Methods Study Design and Participants This study was a cross-sectional survey of practicing family physicians, full-time faculty physicians, and resident physicians of the 3 family medicine residen-cies sponsored by the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita (KUSM-W) Department of Family and Community Medicine (DFCM). The questionnaire focused on physician perceptions of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines used toprevent severe symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study used a mixed-method approach to collect, analyze, and interpret the data. 16The quantitative approach allowed the authors to obtain value-free and objective insights into the respondents 'opinions about the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. In contrast, the qualitative approach allowed for an in-depth understanding of those insights. The KUSM Institutional Review Board approved the study. Study Instrument and Data Collection Process We used a 20-item questionnaire (Appendix) to assess family physicians 'concerns about exposure to COVID-19 and their perceptions of the FDAauthorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to control SARS-CoV-2. Several information sources were used to generate and select the questions. First, thequestions were created based on study goals. The generated questions were reviewed by a family phy- sician and a research scientist to ensure that the questions had face validity. The questionnaire was hosted on SurveyMonkey \u00ae(SVMK Inc., San Mateo, CA), a secure web-based survey system. A generated link to the 20-item survey was sent via e- mail to 601 potential participants. We utilized an e- mail system called FM-RADIO (Family Medicine Research And Data, Information, and OutcomesPractice-Based Research Network) as a survey col- lection tool. The FM-RADIO is an electronic prac- tice-based research network comprised of actively practicing family physicians throughout the state of Kansas who are KUSM-W family medicine resi-dency program graduates, family physician non- KUSM-W graduates, faculty physicians, and resi- dent physicians. The potential participants were on the FM-RADIO list. As a standard practice, the physicians who opened 1 of 3 e-mail invitations were considered to have received the invitation to participate in the study. 17-19Overall, 375 physicians opened at least 1 of the e-mail invitations and were considered to have received the invitation to participate. Participation was voluntary, and responses were anonymous. Data collection occurred from December 14, 2020, to December 31, 2020. No compensation was provided to participants. Statistical Analyses Quantitative Data Standard descriptive statistics were used to create a de- mographic pro le of the respondents. Associations between the variables were evaluated using aLikelihood-Ratio (or Fisher exact test when cell sizeswere<5). For statistical analysis purposes, the respondents 'perceived concerns about becoming infected with COVID-19 were clustered into 3 groups doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2021.05.210052 Family Physicians 'Perception of the New mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines 899copyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from (extreme concern, moderate concern, and slight con- cern [combination of somewhat, slightly, and not at allconcerned]). Then the Likelihood-Ratio test was used to evaluate the relationship between the clustered con- cern groups and family physicians 'decisions to receive an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (yes/no[combination of maybe and noresponses]). A sample size of 100 was calculated as necessary for adequate power ( >0.85) to detect signi cant relationships among the variables with 2 degrees of freedom,P<.05, and 0.3 effect size. 20,21All quantitative analy- ses were 2-sided with aof 0.05. The IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), version26, was used for these analyses. Open-Ended Responses The study team used an immersion-crystallization approach16,22 -25to analyze the content of open- ended responses individually and in a group meet-ing. The immersion-crystallization approach offersresearchers the opportunity to examine collected data in detail and periodically suspend the immer- sion process to re flect on emerging ndings until consistent themes are identi ed. 16,24This multidis- ciplinary team was composed of a health psycholo-gist (SO-D), a family physician (RK), and a family medicine resident (TR). Results Respondent Characteristics Of the 375 family physicians who opened the e-mail invitation, 307 completed all or most of the survey for a participation rate of 69.2%. Of the 601 potential participants, 307 responded to the survey for a response rate of 51.1%. Table 1 represents the demo-graphic information of the respondents. The average age of respondents was 46.6 years (standard devia- tion, 13.1), 54.9% were male, 76.4% were practicing physicians, and 46.5% practiced primarily in Sedgwick County; all others practiced in a total of 51counties in Kansas. Slightly over 11% reported that they had either received a positive COVID-19 test or were diagnosed with COVID-19. Just over 90% of the respondents expressed their intentions to be vac- cinated for COVID-19. There was a 64.69% mar- gin of error at a 95% con dence level between the study sample and the population of all familyphysicians in Kansas, demonstrating that our sam- ple generally represented the population of family physicians in Kansas. 26Table 1.

Respondents listed several reasons for their decisions. In addi- tion, the proportion of family physicians who wouldrecommend an approved COVID-19 vaccine to patients was signi cantly higher than those who were hesitant to recommend the vaccine (94.9% vs 5.1%; x2[1, n = 293] = 237.1; P<.0001).As Table 2 shows, 73% of the respondents reported extreme/moderate concern that they would personally become infected with COVID- 19. Fisher exact test showed a signi cant association between respondents 'perceived concerns about personally becoming infected with COVID-19 and their decision to be vaccinated with an approvedmRNA COVID-19 vaccine ( x2[2, n showed signicant pairwise differences between the clus- tered extreme concern group and the slight concern group and between the moderate concern group and the slight concern group. The greater the level of concern about personal exposure to COVID-19, the more likely a family physician 's intention to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Qualitative Results Family Physicians Who Intend to Be Vaccinated with an Approved COVID-19 Vaccine Nearly 91% of 307 respondents reported their intention to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Seven themes about support for the COVID-19 vaccination emerged from the qualitative analyses: prevent COVID-19infection; protect self, family, community; con- t r i b u t et oh e r di m m u n i t y ;i n s p i r ec o n dence that the vaccines are safe; end the pandemic and bringlife to normal; belief in science and vaccine safety; and the vaccine is less risky than contractingCOVID (Table 4a). Family Physicians Who Were Resistant to Be Vaccinated with an Approved mRNA COVID- 19 Vaccine Nearly 8% of 307 respondents indicated their hesi- tancy to receive the approved mRNA COVID-19Table 2.

Four themes emerged from the qualitative analyses: concerns about safety and adverse side effects, previous COVID-19 infection, low risk, and other reasons (Table 4b). Only 5 of 307 (1.6%) respondents indicated their outright refusal of the approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines because they just \"do not want it. \" Discussion Our study has demonstrated that family physiciansin Kansas have a positive perception of the approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines as safe and ef cacious against COVID-19 infections. A signi cantly high proportion (90.6%) of the physicians expressed theirintention to receive an approved mRNA COVID- 19 vaccination. Among those who were willing to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, the main reasons were to prevent spread ofthe infection; protect self, family, and others against COVID-19; contribute to herd immunity; and endthe pandemic. Interestingly, several physicians indi-cated that they intended to be vaccinated with themRNA COVID-19 vaccine to inspire con dence that the vaccine is safe, a reason consistent with rec-ommended strategies to drive vaccine acceptance. 13 Only 1.6% of physicians expressed their outright rejection of the vaccines because they simply did notwant the vaccination. The reasons for objection toCOVID-19 vaccination by family physicians wereconsistent with prior studies documenting vaccina-tion hesitancy among different populations. 12,27,28 Nearly 8% of physicians indicated their hesitancy to receive the vaccine for various reasons, includingconcerns about safety and adverse side effects, existingimmunity due to prior COVID-19 infections, preg-nancy, and breastfeeding.

Downloaded from understandable, the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices have reviewed data on the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines anddetermined them to be safe and effective in reducing potential infection with COVID-19 among individu- als 16 years of age and older. 29-34Subsequent studies have shown that the approved mRNA COVID-19vaccines are safe and effective in preventing severeCOVID-19 illness among individuals 16 years and older. 34-36 Regarding hesitancy due to pregnancy and breast- feeding, the CDC, the American College of Obstetricsand Gynecology, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend that the approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding individuals, even though there arelimited data about the safety of the vaccines for this population subset. 29,37- 39Some physicians who were hesitant to receive the approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines assumed they have natural immunity to the infection due to a prior COVID-19 infection. There is a lack of complete data on the duration of immunity provided by natural infection or vaccination.30,31 While more data are being collected; the CDC advises that both natural and vaccine-induced immunity are important to control the spread of COVID-19 infec- tion.30More efforts to overcome perceived barriers to the approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are needed. Physician perception of the positive bene ts and safety of the approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may improve the general public 'sc o n dence in the vaccine, especially for those who are unsure aboutsafety and effectiveness and may encourage the public to be vaccinated against COVID-19.27,28This is especially relevant given that physicians are regardedas a trusted source of vaccination information. 12-15,40 We hypothesized that the family physicians 'con- cerns about their personal risk of exposure to COVID-19 infections would encourage compliance with per- sonally receiving the approved mRNA COVID-19 vac- cines. Our ndings showed that a high proportion of the physicians were extremely/moderately concerned about becoming infected and subsequently infecting patients and family members. These concerns havebeen expressed by other frontline health care providers battling the pandemic. 33,41- 43Ourndings suggest a signicantly positive association between a physician 's concerns and their willingness to be vaccinated with an approved COVID-19 vaccine. This nding makes sense given that family physicians are working on the frontline of the pandemic, have a high risk of contract- ing COVID-19, and witness the devastating conse- quences of COVID-19.3,27,41,42Vaccinations prevent both viral infections and illnesses.43,44One way to slow down the spread of COVID-19 infections and return tosome sense of normalcy is through the COVID-19 vac- cinations. Family physicians 'positive perception of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, their intention to receive, and their advocacy for the vaccines should be reassuring to the public. Study Limitations Our study has limitations. The survey presents a snapshot of the physicians 'subjective responses. The survey instrument was not previously validated, butTable 4b.

In addition, the study relied on self-reported data collected in the form of an online survey and may have been in fluenced by recall and selection biases. As this is a cross-sectional study, we could not estab-lish a causal relationship between concerns about personally contracting COVID-19 and respondentintention for COVID-19 vaccination; nor can we know whether one preceded the other. Additional research is warranted. Finally, the study population was limited to a speci c geographic area, though, for the purposes of this study, family physicians inKansas were the target population. As the world continues to grapple with the pan- demic, COVID-19 vaccination is the next and nec-essary step to protect Americans, reduce the impact of the pandemic, and return life to normal. The high proportion of surveyed physicians willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19 is encouragingand should be reassuring to the public regarding the safety and ef cacy of the vaccines. Public health efforts to encourage COVID-19 vaccination coulduse this information to encourage vaccination and overcome vaccine hesitancy. With the authoriza-tion of 2 new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, future studies should investigate the number of physicians in our study who went on to receive the vaccine.
