But good nutrition isn't just about popping a pill or chewable. Eating the right foods that are loaded with immune boosters can help keep you thriving. \"There is a fundamental interrelationship between the diet, nutritional status and the immune system,\" says Michael S. Fenster, M.D., an adjunct professor of culinary medicine at the Kansas Health Science Center. \"Proper nutrition serves a critical function in maintaining healthy cells that maintain a protective barrier between our bodies and potentially toxic invaders.\" What is the Role of Nutrition in Immunity? Research shows when the body has optimal nutrition, it initiates an effective response against pathogens and is more successful in combating any underlying chronic inflammation [[1]](#footnote_1). \"The gut is home to one of the largest reservoirs of our immune system, and poor nutrition quite simply increases the risk of infection and transforms that once-protective gut barrier into the equivalent of Walmart on Black Friday,\" says Dr. Fenster. This internal chaos created from eating less-than-nutritious foods can also become a bit of a vicious cycle. When the immune system is \"activated\" in the face of potential threats (i.e. a cold or virus), there's a greater demand for energy, and a proper supply of nutrients is required to fight an active infection. Without those nutrients, your body doesn't have the stores from which to pull that could help you get well sooner. \"Adequate and appropriate nutrition is required for the cells of the body to function optimally, and this includes cellular immune health,\" says David Friedman, a naturopathic doctor, clinical nutritionist and board-certified alternative medical practitioner based in North Carolina. \"When the body is exposed to disease-causing germs, the best defense is a healthful diet and nutrition.\" In fact, in areas of the world where people suffer from malnutrition, there is a corresponding impairment of immune function and more sickness and hospitalization compared to developed countries. Long story short, if you want to stay healthy, pay attention to what makes it to your plate. What Are the Best Vitamins for the Immune System? To keep your body healthy, energized and protected, consider including some of these nutrients in your [daily diet](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-diets/). Vitamin C When it comes to health and immunity, one of the first vitamins most people think of is [vitamin C](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-vitamin-c-supplements/). This water-soluble vitamin is known for its ability to ward off sickness and can help shorten the duration of colds once contracted. A powerful antioxidant, it can fight free radicals, which may prevent or delay certain cancers, heart disease and aging. Vitamin C supplementation can also help prevent and treat respiratory infections. Get it from food: Oranges are chock-full of this nutrient, as are tropical fruits like kiwi, guava papaya and lychee and non-citrus fruits like plums, cherries, strawberries, currants and persimmons. Vegetables that are good reservoirs of vitamin C include cruciferous choices like Brussels sprouts and broccoli, as well as mustard spinach, sweet peppers, chili peppers and kale, says Dr. Fenster. Rosehips, also provide abundant doses.

It's known as an anti-inflammation vitamin because of its role in developing and enhancing the immune system. Since the body doesn't make vitamin A on its own, it must come from the foods you eat or supplementation. Get it from food: Foods rich in vitamin A include natural cheeses (not processed cheese like slices of American cheese), milk products like yogurt, eggs and fatty fish like salmon, tuna, anchovies and herring.

Studies have also found over 80% of COVID-19 patients have vitamin D deficiency [[3]](#footnote_3). \"We get 90% of our needed vitamin D from our skin exposure to the sun; however, during the winter, we tend to avoid outside activities, and even when we are outside, we bundle up with extra clothing,\" says Friedman. So unless you live on a tropical island, it's likely that you're going to have to ingest your vitamin D in the winter. Get it from food: Oily fish\u2014such as salmon, sardines, herring and mackerel\u2014red meat, liver and egg yolks are all great sources of vitamin D. But since it's not easy to get enough vitamin D in the winter, supplementation is often recommended, says Friedman.

Otherwise known as pyridoxine, vitamin B6 is in charge of keeping the immune system strong, aiding in the production of white blood cells and T cells (which regulate immune response) and helping transport oxygen throughout the body. Vitamin B6 deficiencies can lead to a reduction in antibodies needed to ward off infection. Get it from food: Heritage and pasture-raised pork and poultry deliver plenty of vitamin B6. Tuna and salmon are also good options. Plant sources include peanuts, soy, chickpeas, leafy greens, oats and bananas.

In fact, results from 13 randomized placebo-controlled trials show taking zinc soon after the onset of symptoms of the common cold can significantly reduce both the duration and severity of symptoms [[4]](#footnote_4). Studies have also alluded to the efficacy of zinc supplementation in thwarting COVID-19 and other respiratory infections [[5]](#footnote_5). \"With so much evidence supporting zinc's immune-boosting powers, it's become one of the most popular supplements sold during the pandemic,\" says Friedman. Get it from food: While zinc is prevalent in oysters, crab, lobster, beef, chickpeas, cashews and beans, it can be hard to get enough for an immunity boost through diet alone when you're sick. In such cases, supplementation in capsule, tablet or lozenge form may be a good idea. \"The recommended daily zinc intake is 8 milligrams for women and 11 milligrams for men,\" says Friedman.

Selenium This lesser-known antioxidant is essential for the activity of virtually all arms of the immune system. People who are deficient in this trace element may have less protection against bacteria, viruses and even cancer. On the other hand, studies show that increased blood levels of selenium are associated with enhanced immune response to the flu [[6]](#footnote_6). Get it from food: Brazil nuts are one of the best sources of selenium, but you can also get this nutrient in healthy doses via tuna, halibut, ham, turkey and cottage cheese.

Vitamin supplements\u2014sometimes referred to as dietary supplements\u2014contain a variety of ingredients to help people attain the nutrients they need in the recommended amounts. Ingredients often include vitamins, minerals, enzymes, amino acids and sometimes herbs. Vitamin supplements can provide a wide range of benefits, including assisting in disease prevention and preventing nutrient deficiencies. Speak with your doctor before beginning a new vitamin supplement, especially if you're on blood clotting medications, as certain supplements may interfere with drug effectiveness. How to Boost Your Immune System Naturally In addition to a healthy diet and vitamin supplements, several other lifestyle factors can contribute to a boosted immune system as well. Exercise and maintaining a healthy weight are among helpful tactics, as well as getting enough sleep, minimizing stress, keeping up with recommended vaccines, practicing good hygiene, moderating alcohol consumption and quitting smoking. Supplemental Immune Boosters Want to add even more immunity-promoting ingredients to your daily health regimen? Consider the following three plants. (Always consult your doctor before adding a new supplement to your health routine\u2014even natural ones.) Garlic Research suggests taking a daily garlic supplement can reduce the number of colds a person contracts by 63% compared to a placebo. The same research found the average duration of cold symptoms also dropped by 70%, from five days in the placebo group to just one and a half days in the garlic group [[7]](#footnote_7). \"The magic compound responsible for garlic's immune-boosting properties is called allicin,\" says Friedman. It's produced when garlic is crushed or chopped. Garlic is also a great source of vitamin C, vitamin B6 and selenium. Fresh cloves of garlic are ideal, but it's difficult for most people to consume a therapeutic amount each day. \"Supplements are an easier and more convenient way, and there are many 'odorless' brands available,\" says Friedman. The recommended amount is one 300-milligram dried garlic powder tablet two to three times a day, or 7.2 grams of aged garlic extract per day. Echinacea Echinacea, a group of flowering plants, is known for its beneficial effects on the immune system. Research finds this plant may help combat infections and viruses, as well as ameliorate recovery. In fact, taking echinacea may lower your risk of developing colds by more than 50% and shorten the duration of active colds by one and a half days [[8]](#footnote_8). \"Echinacea is loaded with healthful antioxidants, such as flavonoids, cichoric acid and rosmarinic acid, which help reduce inflammation in the body and may help defend against oxidative stress,\" says Friedman. \"With the stressful holidays quickly approaching, you'll also be happy to know echinacea contains compounds that may reduce feelings of anxiety.\" The recommended dose for encapsulated echinacea is 300 milligrams three times a day. For tinctures, a concentration of 2.5 milliliters three times a day or up to 10 milliliters daily is recommended. Elderberry The berries and flowers of the elderberry plant are packed with antioxidants and vitamins (including vitamin C) that may serve as immunity boosters. Elderberry has antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties as well, and it's commonly used as a remedy for colds, the flu and sinus infections. One study found people who consumed 15 milliliters of elderberry syrup four times a day reduced their flu symptoms four days earlier than a control group [[9]](#footnote_9). Another study found elderberry to have the ability to help fight viruses, including COVID-19 [[10]](#footnote_10). \"Scientists believe the reason elderberry can offer such profound health benefits is due to the phytochemicals inside the plant,\" says Friedman. \"They stimulate infected cells to release cytokines, a class of chemical messengers the immune system uses for communication between different cell types to aid in coordinating a more efficient response against the invading pathogen.\" There is no standard dose of elderberry, but one tablespoon (15 milliliters) of elderberry juice-containing syrup four times daily for three to five days has been shown to have positive immune-boosting effects.

How many supplements can I take at once? Supplements should only be taken in the amount designated on the bottle, or as recommended by your health care provider. If you're interested in taking multiple supplements at once, speak with your doctor or a qualified nutritionist who is aware of your health needs and conditions to determine the right nutrients and amounts for you. How do I boost my immune system quickly? Following steps such as getting enough sleep, eating a well-balanced diet of fruits and vegetables and exercising regularly will help boost the immune system and contribute to additional health benefits over time. How do I boost the immune system in my kids? Boosting immunity in kids is similar to boosting immunity in adults. A well-rounded diet of whole foods, fruits and vegetables is necessary, as well as a good night's sleep, exercise and stress management. If you're considering giving your [child vitamin supplements](https://www.forbes.com/health/family/best-multivitamins-for-kids/), consult with their pediatrician to determine which nutrients they need and safe dosage amounts. Is it good to take vitamin supplements every day? Ideally, the vitamins and nutrients your body needs will come from your diet. If you do choose to take vitamin supplements, consult your doctor to ensure you're taking the right ones and in the correct doses. Can vitamin D help treat COVID-19? There is not enough evidence to determine whether vitamin D is an effective treatment for COVID-19. While vitamin D does help strengthen the immune system, its protection against COVID-19 is inconclusive. If you're suffering from a vitamin D deficiency, however, you should speak with your health care provider to receive treatment, as this could lead to a weakened immune system and other health issues.
