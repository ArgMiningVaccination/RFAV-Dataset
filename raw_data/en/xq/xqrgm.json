Before hopping back to your inbox or scrolling down to the best hair growth vitamins, take a second to think about your locks. Does your hair feel nourished or dull? How would you describe the state of your scalp? What about your hairline? Is your [scalp dry](https://camillestyles.com/style/how-to-take-care-of-your-scalp/)? Hair thinning? As you answer these questions, keep in mind that everything from genetics and hormonal imbalances (hello, postpartum!) to stress and [nutritional deficiencies](https://camillestyles.com/style/beauty/best-food-for-hair-growth/) can compromise your hair. It's also important to remember that we shed an average of 80-100 hairs every day. Additionally, during certain times of the year, we may notice an increase in shedding, especially in the coming fall months. This common phenomenon is known as [seasonal shedding](https://www.hairscalp.com/seasonal-hair-shedding/#:~:text=We%20shed%20an%20average%20of,considered%20normal%2C%20healthy%20hair%20shedding.&text=During%20certain%20times%20of%20the,is%20known%20as%20seasonal%20shedding.). At any rate, changes in your hair could indicate nutrition or lifestyle issues. A dry scalp, for example, could mean you aren't getting enough [healthy fats](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/ss/slideshow-foods-healthy-hair) in your diet. Similarly, thinning hair could be caused by stress or a lack of protein on your plate. Featured image by Michelle Nash.

Without a doubt, you probably think about your hair on a daily basis. You're either fretting over a bad hair day, in the midst of [growing longer, stronger hair](https://camillestyles.com/style/8-diy-tips-to-growing-longer-stronger-hair/), or are considering an end-of-summer chop. Maybe, you're stressing over recent [hair loss](https://camillestyles.com/style/beauty/how-to-grow-thicker-hair-in-your-40s/). If that's the case, you might be missing clues that your hair is revealing about your health. After all, [research shows](https://www.romper.com/p/9-subtle-changes-to-your-hair-that-can-signal-a-serious-health-concern-15577542) that changes in your hair's look, texture, thickness, etc. can be signs of underlying health conditions. Before jumping to any conclusions, chat with your doctor about any changes you've noticed. In terms of what causes hair loss, along with other hair conditions, it varies. For example, hair thinning could be tied to a thyroid disease. In essence, [hypothyroidism](https://www.btf-thyroid.org/hair-loss-and-thyroid-disorders) can cause hair shedding, as well as a change in hair appearance. Anemia, another health condition, can be a sign of low iron stores, thus impacting hair health. And while it's not completely understood why low iron causes hair loss, [iron](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/best-iron-supplements-for-women/) is critical for many biological reactions. From a [nutrition standpoint](https://camillestyles.com/style/beauty/best-food-for-hair-growth/), diet matters. Certain foods\u2014like avocados, eggs, lentils, salmon, and seaweed\u2014can support your hair's luminosity, strength, and thickness. Postpartum Hair Loss Common for many mothers, the postpartum time period is often correlated with hair loss. During pregnancy, the body experiences soaring estrogen and progesterone, which causes hair to remain in an ongoing stage of growth. As hormones level out in the months following childbirth, changes in hair thickness can occur. Rest assured that postpartum hair loss is both normal and temporary. It's actually a change that is unrelated to breastfeeding. Most women will return to their usual hair growth cycle between 6-12 months after giving birth. If you're a new mom and are noticing dramatic hair loss, that's also common. If you have any concerns, discuss them with your doctor. Otherwise, continue to eat [nutrient-dense foods](https://camillestyles.com/food/nutrient-dense-foods/), incorporate self-care when possible, and continue taking your prenatal vitamin. Hair Wellness Begins on the Inside If take one thing from this article, make it this: hair wellness starts internally. Yes, products can transform your hair, revitalize your locks, and re-introduce a healthy scalp, but nothing compares to a diet rich in key vitamins and nutrients. Unfortunately, the Standard American Diet (SAD) lacks essential nutrients\u2014but armed with an understanding that eating whole, minimally processed foods is ideal, you're on your way to establishing healthy locks. And while eating foods that promote hair growth is important, adding a daily supplement will further support your hair growth goals. Important Ingredients in Hair Growth Supplements The right hair growth vitamins can help nourish your hair from the inside out, resulting in a faster growth rate and thicker, more nourished strands. An effective supplement can improve the length and condition of your hair, and as an added bonus, it can also improve your nails and skin. When it comes to choosing the best hair growth supplement, you want to look for these key ingredients: Vitamin A A fat-soluble vitamin, vitamin A is in the same class as retinoids\u2014a common ingredient in many beauty creams. Vitamin A is necessary for cell growth, and because hair has some of the most quickly replicating cells in the body, hair needs adequate levels of vitamin A. B Vitamins Vitamins B6, B7, and B12 are especially important for hair health. [Biotin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2230.2002.01076.x) is a common B vitamin and probably one of the most popular supplements for healthy hair. In fact, not getting enough B vitamins can cause hair loss. [Vitamin B12 deficiency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380979/) has also been linked to hair loss and may be involved in the premature greying of hair. Vitamin C Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect against free radicals, and free radical damage can block hair growth. Additionally, our bodies need vitamin C to create collagen (a protein). Collagen is an important part of hair structure. Vitamin E Like vitamin C, vitamin E is a potent [antioxidant](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/foods-that-are-high-in-antioxidants/). Vitamin E helps block free radicals at the hair follicle level, potentially helping maintain healthy locks in the long run. Iron Given that adequate iron levels are necessary for hemoglobin production, and hemoglobin is required to deliver oxygen to your hair follicle cells, iron is crucial for hair health. Zinc [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3870206/#:~:text=With%20regard%20to%20hair%20loss,resulting%20in%20hair%20loss3.) shows that zinc is a potential inhibitor of hair follicle regression, meaning that it plays a role in hair health. Zinc is involved in protein synthesis and cell division, two components of hair growth. Protein Last but not least, because hair is made almost entirely of protein, it's an important ingredient in your daily supplement and/or diet. All About Biotin First of all\u2014what is it? [Biotin](https://www.healthline.com/health/the-benefits-of-biotin#TOC_TITLE_HDR_1) is one of the B complex vitamins. It helps convert food into energy. Like other B vitamins, biotin is water-soluble, so any extra biotin you consume will simply pass through your body when you urinate. Between [30-100 mcg per day](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/biotin-oral-route/description/drg-20062359) of biotin is recommended. Most people get the daily recommended amount of biotin from eating a healthy diet (it's present in eggs, milk, bananas, etc.), but adding a biotin supplement has no known toxicity symptoms associated with supplementing too much. While the [National Institutes of Health](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/313.html) reports that there is still insufficient evidence to provide the efficacy of a biotin supplement, signs of biotin deficiency include hair loss, skin rashes, brittle nails, etc. The [jury may still be out](https://www.allure.com/story/biotin-hair-growth-benefits) about its ability to deliver scientifically-proven results, but reviews on popular biotin supplements say otherwise. More on that, below. At any rate, biotin is considered harmless if you take more than the RDA. If you notice more breakouts than usual after taking high doses of biotin, you may want to scale back. There isn't a [proven link](https://thedermatologyclinic.com/can-biotin-cause-acne/#:~:text=While%20there%20isn't%20a,help%20your%20body%20combat%20acne.) between biotin and acne breakouts, but this micronutrient can reduce your body's absorption of other nutrients (including ones that naturally help your body combat acne). Toxic Ingredients to Avoid in Hair Supplements When it comes to beauty, [non-toxic](https://camillestyles.com/style/6-nontoxic-tinted-moisturizers-i-tested-and-loved/) (when possible!) is the way to go, and organic is always a plus. Luckily, there are a variety of clean supplements that help restore hair strength and luminosity on the market. You can find a full list of ingredients to avoid [here](https://www.lovehair.com/blogs/the-daily-muse/harmful-ingredients), but these are a few harmful offenders: - Sulfates (cost-effective cleansing agents) - Parabens (preservatives) - Denatured alcohols (drying to the scalp) - Synthetic fragrances (an array of potential irritants hidden in artificially-fragranced formulas) - Formaldehyde (currently under investigation for potential safety concerns) How to Choose the Best Supplement for Hair Growth When it comes to choosing the most optimal hair growth supplement, you want to look for clinically-backed products that have been tested for efficacy and quality. Keep in mind that most supplements take at least three months in order to build up stores of various vitamins, minerals, and compounds, so having patience is key. Before buying a hair growth supplement, chat with your doctor or dermatologist. Get tested for any potential nutrient deficiencies and make sure you choose a supplement that won't cause allergies or other adverse effects. Furthermore, read all labels and steer clear of non-natural or chemical ingredients. Ideally, the ingredients are plant-based and come from organic sources. 14 Best Hair Growth Supplements Ranging from organic and plant-derived to unique, cutting-edge capsules, serums, and powders, there is no shortage of hair growth supplements on the market. Again, when taking a hair growth supplement, consistency is key. You may notice a difference in just a few weeks, otherwise it may take upwards of two months.
