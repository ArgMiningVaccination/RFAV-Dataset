NDNY l 6-CV-1496 that Court decided to be Moot in that DJT became POTUS, and in my opinion and experience after 2016, the California Vote Harvesting Study (see Exhibit D) repeats all over the country in the 2018 General Election when the feckless Republicans lost the U.S. House of Representatives, remains an issue to renew that case to the court calendar wasn't done (see Exhibit E) -but heavy lifting is not to be done in Second Circuit that increasingly appears as if 9th Circuit with Pilgrim's new USURPER HARRIS joins USURPER OBAMA with sufficient reason to renew I reconsider denied (see Exhibit F); and 10. That the fact the State of New York under the Eleventh Amendment ONLY grants Strunk the right to claim financial injury may be done in its State Court of Claim shown herein at Exhibit E- 4 (NYS CLAIM), however now is not a venue for suffrage relief in that the State unreasonably closed the court system and told me it cannot even assign a claim number and or Judge for more than six weeks because the mass murderer Gov Andrew Cuomo politically uses the lockdown to disrupt the 3 November 2020 and 14 December 2020 elections even despite the ameliorated 2013 Fauci/Obama facilitated Chinese Gain-of-Function modified bio-weapon SARS COV-2 Virus aka COVID-19 is merely the common cold CCP engineered Bioweapon that with herd immunity poses no continued threat, and as such Strunk humbly seeks assistance in the Lone Star State accordingly. 11. Strunk contends for FRCvP Rule 65(b) relief that New York State officer(s) acts of non I mis I malfeasance in omission and or commission of public administration and enforcement duty under color of law or code whereby they knew or should have known of infringement wherein THE STATE OF NEW YORK is willfully use \"BORN A CITIZEN\" malicious dis-information from 2007 thru 2020 shown in Exhibit E-4-C, instead of the NATURAL-BORN CITIZEN 5 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-5 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 6 of 9 prima facie requirement of the U.S. Constitution Article 2 Section 1 Clause 5 referenced in the chart shown in Exhibit E-4-C for anyone Running For Office President of the United States (POTUS) and by operation of law Vice President of the United States (VPOTUS), and satisfies support for this extraordinary DEMAND BY ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF with irreparable harm, a likelihood of success under the current law of the land that is based upon preponderance of evidence shown in exhibit, time is of the essence; and 12. Further, this DACA matter is of national urgency with imminent irreparable harm and likelihood of success under existing law as time is of the essence under each state's requirements for Absentee Balloting that according to the Exhibit E-4-A (NYND 16-cv-1496 docket item ::!:l-1) schedule for conducting the 3 November 2020 and 14 December 2020 elections: a.

That Strunk seeks personal plaintiff intervener standing herein as an urgent DACA matter being representative of the State of New York under the Tenth Amendment with demands for national emergency injunctive relief under FRCvP Rule 65(b) for cause in evidence in that the State of New York is without a functioning court system that among those similarly situated be ordered to: a.

Kissinger and Volcker had been members since the 1950s when they became policy advisors for The Rockefeller Foundation after the war and during the implementation of the Marshall Plan. John D. Rockefeller was a Pilgrims Society co-founder (1902). These men chose \"Pilgrims\" in their name in 1902, evidently to glom onto the average American's fondness for the Plymouth Pilgrims. This is classical misdirection and mind control propaganda from this group of high criminals. Their instruction given them by their spiritual leader, British Privy Councilor Cecil J.

OSS agents Allan W. Dulles and William J. Donovan were controlling it, and many of their OSS \"stay behind\" agents were already selling off bits of the gold to banker friends all over the world. By the end of the war, a global gold mafia-like syndicate had been created by Dulles and Donovan, with the full knowledge and tacit approval of Eisenhower, Truman and Churchill. Dulles later became C.l.A. director and planned the JFK assassination after Kennedy told an advisor, \"I will splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds\" after learning of the Cuban Bay of Pigs debacle in 1961. Kennedy clearly knew about the Pilgrims Society and warned against them in his famous \"secret societies\" warning. [CITE AUDIO & TRANSCRIPT OF THE SPEECH]. VOLCKER & KISSINGER HAVE CONTROLLED U.S. FOREIGN & BANKING POLICY FOR THE BRITISH PILGRIMS SOCIETY VIA THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION From the 1950s, until his recent death (Dec. 08, 2019), Volcker had controlled U.S. financial policy with an iron fist for the Pilgrims Society in London. Volcker and the Nixon cabinet (all, or almost all, were Pilgrims, incl. Kissinger, Schultz, Burns, Haig, Weinberger [see his award with Pilgrim Privy Councilor Sir Geoffrey E. Pattie in 2000], Connally, and McCracken) pushed Nixon to take the U.S. dollar off the gold standard and become a fiat currency that their bankers could more easily manipulate. https://aim4truth.org/2020/09/11 /pilgrims-society-ran-the-obama-white-house/ 7120 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-6 Filed TXSD Page 17 of 65 912812020 ---Pilgrims Society Ran the Obama White House -American Intelligence Media Fig. 4-Paul A.

See previous post. JUDICIALLY-RECOGNIZABLE EVIDENCE OF A ENDEMIC CRIMES AGAINST THE REPUBLIC THAT REQUIRE MARTIAL LAW TO FIX OUR REPUBLIC-AN SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES HAS BEEN UNDERMINED AFI/ AIM researchers recently discovered judicially-recognizable proof that Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, was indeed an agent of the British Privy Council and Its Pilgrims Society Crown Agents while he officially advised Obama, Hillary and Biden after the Nov. 4, 2008 election. In fact, president-elect Obama's first meetings on Nov. 5, 2008, the day after the election, were with Volcker. Evidently, the Pilgrims Society was eager to move in. Tellingly, fellow Pilgrim Baby Bush just sat in the corner like a good little puppy dog waiting for his bone. WHERE WERE THE CRIES OF TREASON, SEDITION, SIEGE AND ESPIONAGE COMING FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THEN?

Indeed, Volcker was sent in with a wrecking crew. In addition to the Pilgrims, he applied the full force of The Rockefeller Foundation and their Crown Agent lackeys in the 10,000- person Senior Executive Service (SES). Fig. 5-Sir Henry A. Kissinger, KCMG. British Pilgrims Society Crown Agent, has pledged fielty to many soverigns other than the United States, it appears. The Pilgrims had dreamed of this moment since the 1890's when Elihu Root, Andrew Carnegie's and John D. Rockefeller's attorney, became Secretary of War (1899-1904), then Root co-founded the Pilgrims Society with many dozens of British peers (1902), then Root became Secretary of State (1905-09), then Root was a secret delegate to the First Imperial Press Conference, 1909, secret co-founder of the British Press Union, Ml6, https://aim4truth.org/2020/09/11 /pilgrims-society-ran-the-obama-white-house/ 9120 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-6 TXSD Page 19 of 65 912812020 ---Pilgrims Society Ran the Obama White House -American Intelligence Media Elihu Root is clearly one of the most powerful men in crooked American politics that we know nothing about. Why? He ushered in Pilgrims Society infiuence into successive White Houses and was a Pilgrims Society stealth weapon. He was a committed Anglophile who desired, like Carnegie, J.P. Morgan, Lord Rothschild, FDR and Winston Churchill to return of American to the British Empire. The Imperial Press Conference 1909 had unified the British and American Press and ordered J.P. Morgan to buy up editorial control of Americans top 25 newspapers before WWI. The British press fell in line also. They included Winston Churchill's Morning Post, the Lord Burnham's Daily Telegraph, Financial Times, London Times and Lord Northcliffe's Daily Mail, among many others. The BBC and NBC were eventually formed to exploit the Marconi Wireless technology stolen from Nikola Tesla. They all fell into lockstep with this tight Pilgrims control over all communications, surveillance, vaccines and propaganda. See AFI. (Oct. 24, 2019). The 200-year Information War: The UK-U.S. Pilgrims Society controls the Press that directs intelligence to bend words and culture to atheistic social fascism. Americans for Innovation. DID ANYBODY RAISE THE RED FLAG OF FOUL EARLY ON? YES. Such activity by Root and his compadres J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Paul Warburg, Jacob Schiff and others was evident sedition. Some in Congress raised the red fiag of foul at the time. However, each time these investigations of \"interlocking,\" seditious relationships appeared to be gathering steam, the Pilgrims would start a war somewhere to divert the public's attention, like clockwork. https://aim4truth.org/2020/09/11/pilgrims-society-ran-the-obama-white-house/ 10/20 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-6 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 20 of 65 9/28/2020 ---Pilgrims Society Ran the Obama White House -American Intelligence Media authorities while investigating Andrew Carnegie and his duplicitous history that the British government kicked her out of Britain just days after WWI ended.

Further, Strunk has been outrageously branded a delusional frivolous BIRTHER by orders in the trial court for Index No: 6500-2011 with the largest fines ever imposed in New York history in excess of $177 ,000 and as a full citizen, has been denied free access to the state courts due process without permission; and 9. Further, Strunk has been denied NBC adjudication in any court that now further emboldens the traitorous CIA and Federal Bureau oflnvestigation (FBI) to enlist U.S. Senator KAMALA DEVI HARRIS born in Oakland California on October 20, 1964 to be Democratic National Committee (DNC) Vice Presidential candidate along with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) I DNC sinecure Presidential candidate JOSEPH R. BIDEN; and 10. Further, despite the fact that U.S. Senator Harris may be a \"Anchor Baby\" or a \"Birth Right Citizen\" that at best arguendo grants dual allegiance under the 14th Amendment provision of Federal jurisdiction over the birth in California when both non U.S. Citizen parents were on foreign student visas to study in California in that the mother is from India and the father is from Jamaica as her Alameda County Birth Certificate (see Exhibit 4) shows her Jamaican Student Father at birth in California is under The Jamaica Constitution <1> Order in Council 1962 made on 23rd July 1962 when laid before Parliament 24th July 1962 coming into Operation-Section 3(2) of the Order in Council, and sections 80, 81, 94(1) and (2), 103, 104, 111, 124 and 125 (in part) of the Constitution on the 25th July 1962 with the remainder immediately before the 6th August 1962 at the Court at Buckingham Palace, the 23rd day of July, 1962 Present, THE QUEEN'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY IN COUNCIL Her 1 https://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Jamaica/jam62.html BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 33 of 65 Majesty, by virtue and in exercise of the powers in that behalf by subsection ( 1) of section 5 of the West Indies Act, 1962 or otherwise in Her vested, is pleased, by and with the advice of Her Privy Council 1962 Jamaican Constitution designates KAMALA DEVI HARRIS is a Jamaican Citizen under CHAPTER II CITIZENSHIP Section 3.

Further as applies herein, KAMALA DEVI HARRIS parents divorced when she was seven, and when she was twelve, Harris and her sister moved with their mother Shyamala to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where Shyamala had accepted a research and teaching position at the Jesuit McGill University-affiliated Jewish General Hospital; and 12. Further, KAMALA DEVI HARRIS attended a French-speaking middle school, Notre-Dame\u00ad des-Neiges, and then Westmount High School in Westmount, Quebec, graduating in 1981. 13. That the CIA's U.S. Senator Ted Cruz's parents were not U.S. Citizens at his birth in Canada (his mother is a divorced British subject having been born a U.S. Citizen in Delaware and his Cuban father who later became a U.S. Citizen after leaving Canada) at least recognized his dual allegiance NBC conflict of interest, renounced his Canadian Citizenship before he ran for POTUS, unlike the CIA's Indonesian U.S. Senator a.k.a. BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA II who traveled on an Indonesian Passport and the CIA's Jamaican U.S. Senator KAMALA DEVI HARRIS and with the CIA's U.S. Senators WILLARD MITT ROMNEY and JOHN SIDNEY MCCAIN Ill, ALL have dual allegiance are unqualified for POTUS or VPOTUS.

That based upon the various Court traitorous silence and SCOTUS refusal to provide NBC fundamental constitutional substantive due process review, about which Strunk is branded by Justice Arthur M.

Further, the CIA I FBI I and others maliciously label BIRTHER(s) as a \"Conspiracy Theorist\" or worse and the BIRTHER label serves the CCP/ CIA I FBI bias and fear in targeting POTUS Donald John Trump among others of his political campaign including Lt.

They met at an underground nuclear bunker called Iron Mountain (as well as other, worldwide locations) and worked over the next two years. A member of the panel, one \"John Doe\", a professor at a college in the Midwest, decided to release the report to the public. The heavily footnoted report concluded that peace was not in the interest of a stable society, that even if lasting peace \"could be achieved, it would almost certainly not be in the best interests of society to achieve it.\" War was a part of the economy. necessary to conceive a state of war for a stable economy. The government, the group theorized, would not exist without war, and nation states existed in order to wage war. War served the vital function of diverting collective aggression. They recommended \"credible substitutes\" and paying a \"blood price\" to emulate the economic functions of war. Prospective government- devised alternatives to war included reports of alien life\u00ad forms, the reintroduction of a \"euphemized form\" of slavery \"consistent with modem technology and political processes\", and -one deemed particularly promising in gaining the attention of the malleable masses -threat of \"gross pollution Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 36 of 65 Island Georgia was made perpetual in 1928 by the McFadden Act and transformed with the 1933 FDR Proclamation 2040 Military Government under the Emergency Banking Relief Act is now an extra-constitutional permanent state within a state of United States Government Policy <6> and that James V. Forrestal, in full James Vincent Forrestal, (born February 15, 1892, Beacon, New York, U.S.-was murdered on May 22, 1949, Bethesda, Maryland), first U.S. secretary of defense (1947--49). Earlier, in the Navy Department, he directed the huge naval expansion and procurement programs of World War II with his aided Camp JFK who on 27 April 1961 warned of the danger of Secret Societies <7> before the American Newspaper Publishers Association, was assassinated by the CIA on November 22, 1963\" 18. That Strunk at age 21 in 1968 while deployed by the U.S. Air Force to Panama voted by mail for Richard M. Nixon and Spiro T. Agnew, and again for their 1972 re-election. The Watergate Scandal 19. That Strunk remains upset by what became known as the Watergate scandal. 20. Firstly, the Watergate scandal refers to five men caught on June 17, 1972, burglarizing the Democratic National Committee's headquarters in the Watergate complex, along with their two handlers, E. Howard Hunt of the CIA and G. Gordon Liddy of the FBI, who were Nixon campaign aides. All seven were tried before Judge John Sirica in January 1973. 6 The tenn Deep State disambiguation is a political situation in a country when an internal organ does not respond to the political leadership coined by Peter Dale Scott (born 11 January 1929) who is a Canadian- born poet, academic, and fonner diplomat best known for his critiques of deep politics and American foreign policy since the era of the Vietnam War. A deep state (from Turkish: derin devlet), also know as a state within a state, is a type of governance made up of networks of power operating independently ofa state's political leadership in pursuit of their own agenda and goals. As prescribed by Marist Communist totalitarian doctrine historically seen in Nazi Gennany, the Stalin Beria USSR and the Peoples Republic of China in contrast to a Constitutional Republic as the USA once was, sources for deep state organization include organs of state, such as the armed forces or public authorities (intelligence agencies, police, secret police, administrative agencies, and government bureaucracy). 7 https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/JFKWHA/l 961 /JFKWHA-025-00 l/JFKWHA-025-00 l 483-6 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 37 of 65 21. The period leading up to the trial of the first Watergate Seven began on January 8, 1973. The term \"Watergate Seven\" was coined a few months later, in April 1973, by American lawyer, politician, and political commentator Ed Koch, who, in response to U.S. Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s claim indicating that one of the men in the Watergate bugging case had been ordered in the spring of 1972 to keep certain Senators and Representatives under surveillance, posted a sign on the door of his United States Congress office saying, \"These premises were surveilled by the Watergate Seven. Watch yourself'. 22. Based upon information and belief as a warning to E. Howard Hunt, on December 8, 1972, the Boeing 73 7-222 serving the flight City of Lincoln, with registration N9031 U, crashed during an aborted landing and go around while approaching Chicago Midway International Airport. The plane crashed into a residential neighborhood, destroying five houses; there was an intense ground fire. 43 of the 61 aboard the aircraft and two on the ground were killed. Among the passengers killed were Illinois congressman George W. Collins and Dorothy Hunt, the wife of Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt. This crash was the first fatal accident involving a Boeing 73 7, which had entered airline service nearly five years earlier in February 1968. 23. The second use of the term Watergate Seven refers to seven advisors and aides of United States President Richard M. Nixon who were indicted by a grand jury on March 1, 1974, for their roles in the Watergate scandal. The grand jury also named Nixon as an unindicted co\u00ad conspirator. The indictments marked the first time in U.S. history that a president was so named. 24. The original Watergate Seven and their legal dispositions were: BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 38 of 65 G.

He was acquitted at trial. Although Parkinson was a lawyer, G. Gordon Liddy was in fact counsel for the Committee to Re-elect the President. 26. That William Mark Felt Sr. (August 17, 1913 -December 18, 2008) was an Federal Bureau oflnvestigation (FBI) officer from 1942 to 1973 and was known for his role in the Watergate scandal. Felt was an FBI special agent who eventually rose to the position of Associate Director, the Bureau's second-highest-ranking post. Felt worked in several FBI field offices prior to his promotion to the Bureau's headquarters. In 1980 he was convicted of having violated the civil rights of people thought to be associated with members of the Weather Underground, by ordering FBI agents to break into their homes and search the premises as part of an attempt to prevent bombings, was ordered to pay a fine, but was pardoned by President Ronald Reagan during his appeal; and 27. That in 2005, at age 91, Felt revealed that during his tenure as associate director of the FBI he had been the notorious anonymous source known as \"Deep Throat\" who provided The Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein with critical information about the Watergate scandal, which ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974. Though Felt's identity as Deep Throat was suspected, including by Nixon himself,https://en.wikipedia.or~/wiki[Mark Felt -cite note-;!._ it had generally remained a secret for 30 years. Felt finally acknowledged that he was Deep Throat after being persuaded by his daughter to reveal his identity. 28. That in 2006 I was a part-time employee for a New York Attorney who had worked in the Nixon I Mitchell Law firm trust department and who on November 21, 1963 had spoken by phone with Richard Nixon in Dallas.

That as a result of the Watergate Scandal leaving no opportunity to waste, the DNC, Pilgrim Society, CIA, FBI, FIVE-EYES intelligence community, Congress and various complicit Executive agencies and private corporations not wishing to allow a repeat of the public exposure again created the Senior Executive Service (SES) position classification in the civil service of the United States federal government, equivalent to general officer or flag officer ranks in the U.S. Armed Forces was created in 1979 when the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 went into effect under Trilateral Commission's corporatist President Jimmy Carter whose accommodation merger with the global Five-Eyes national security MIC apparatus best illustrated by the Queens Golden Share in her Privy council's SERCO INC. served by SES inside traders with impunity using the Office of Personnel Management and related offices designed to be a corps of executives selected for their leadership qualifications, serving in key positions just below the top Presidential appointees as a link between them and the rest of the Federal (civil service) workforce. SES positions are considered to be above the GS-15 level of the General Schedule, and below Level III of the Executive Schedule. Career members of the SES ranks are eligible for the Presidential Rank Awards program that remains the seditious foreign existential burr under Mr. Donald J. Trump's saddle to be removed by a patriot building a legacy. 30. Up to 10% of SES positions can be filled as political appointments rather than by career employees. About half of the SES is designated \"Career Reserved\", which can only be filled by career employees. The other half is designated \"General\", which can be filled by either career employees or political appointments as desired by the administration. Due to the 10% limitation, most General positions are still filled by career appointees.

PAGE 024of156 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-6 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 53 of 65..--------------------------------------- That the Natural-born Citizen clause does NOT derive from the term of art \"natural\u00ad born Subject\", but instead was derived from ancient consideration ofGOD's Natural Law as expressed in Greece by the works of Aristotle and carried forward for use in Roman law by the works of Cicero. Aristotle did not define citizenship like the English did in the English common law in which they did not give any relevancy to the citizenship of the child's parents, provided the parents were not diplomats or military invaders. Aristotle included in the definition of a \"citizen\" a person \"of whom both the parents are citizens.\" m It is this definition which was handed down through the millennia through the law of nations and which the Founders and Framers adopted for the new republic. We also see that the then Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) in Minor v. Haopersett, 88 U.S. (21Wall.}162 (1875) (Minor) (decided after the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in 1868) held that \"all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners .. informed that a person who became a citizen by being born in the country to \"citizen\" parents was known in common law with which the Framers were familiar as a \"natural-born citizen!' How do we know that the Founders and Framers looked to Aristotle's view of citizenship? We learn from the historical record that Supreme Court Justice James Wilson wrot.e in 1791: '\"Generally speaking,' says the great political authority, Aristotle, a citizen is one RPTtaking equally of power and of subordination.' ... In Wilson's view, 0a citizen. of Pennsylvania is he. who has resided in the state two years; an.cl, within. that time, has paid a state or coumy tar or he is between the ages of twenty one and twenty two years, and the son of a citizen.'' James Wilson, lat commentaries on the Constitution. Here we clearly see Wilson referring to what could only be a \"natural born Citizen.\" as \"the son of a citizen.\" We also know that the Founders and Framers studied Roman law. The Framers were well read in the Roman and Greek classics as is expounded upon in their writings in the Federalist Papers. Jefferson 1 Arist.otle also gave us a definition of a \"natural born Citizen.'' In \"Politics, Book Three, Part II, Arist.otle, writing in 350 B.C.E., as tzanslated by Benjamin Jowett, gave us his definition of citizenship: \"Part II But in practice a citi.zen. iB defined to be one of whom both the parents arc citizens; others insist on going further back; say to two or three or more aneestors. This is a short and practical definition but there are some who raise the further question: How this third or fourth ancestor came to be a citizen? Gorgias of Leontini, partly because he was in a difficulty, partly in irony, said\u00b7 'Mortars are what is made by the mortar-makers, and the citizens of Larissa are those who are made by the magistrat.ea; for it is their tzade t.o make Larisaaeans.' Yet the question is really simple, for, if according t.o the definition just given they shared in the government, they were citizens. This is a bett.er definition than the other. For the words, 'born of a father or mother who is a citizen,' cannot possibly apply to the first inhabitants or founders of a state. The.re is a greater difficulty in the case ofthoee who have been made citizens after a revolution, as by Cleisthenes at Athens after the expulsion of the tyrants, for he enrolled in tribes many metics, both strangers and slaves. The doubt in these cases is, not who is, but whether he who is ought to be a citizen; and there will still be a furthering the state, whether a certain act is or is not an act of the state; for what ought not t.o be is what is false. Now, there are some who bold office, and yet ought not t.o bold office, whom we describe aa ruling, but ruling unjustly. And the citizen was defined by the fact of his holding some kind of rule or office\u00b7 he who holds a judicial or legislative office fulfills our definition of a citizen. It is evident, therefore, that the citizens about whom the doubt has arisen must be called citizens.\" ... http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/polittcs.html 483-6 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 54 of 65 DEPUTY CLERK and other Founders bad a love for Roman history and education. The Founders and Framers were great admirers of Cicero and read many of his works. It is not inconceivable that they would have read this English translation of The Proposal 12) and seen the clause \"natural born Citizen.\" This shows that they did not need to borrow the clause from English common law's \"natural born subject.\" Rather, they had sources that they read which contained the exact clause, \"natural born Citizen,\" which clause also had its own meaning which was different from that of an English \"natural born subjecr which allowed children born in the King's dominion and under his allegiance to aliens to be English \"natural born subjects.\" A definition of a \"natu.ral born Citizen\" was also provided by the world-renowned, Emer de Vattel in his The Law (London 1797) {1st ed. Neuchatel 1758). Vattel had a great influence on the Founders and Framers in their constituting the new republic and writing the Constitution. See, for example, J.S. Reeves, The Influence of the Law of Nature UDon International Law in the United States. 3 Am.J. Int'l L. 547 et. seq. passim (1909) (Vattel exerted such a profound political influence that it is often pointed out that his theories served as the backbone for American independence} Lee A. Casey, David B. Rivkin, Jr. and Darin R. Bartram, Unlawful Belligerency and Its lmolications Under International I,aw. http://www.fod-soc.org/publications/PubID.104/pub detail.asp (concerning U.S. constitutional analysis, \"Vatel is highly important. He waa probably the international law expert most widely read among the Framerli'). In fact, Vattel continued to be practically applied in our nation for well over 100 years after the birth of the republic; F.S. Ruddy, The Acceptance of Yattel. Grotian Society Papers (1972) (Vattel was mainstream political philosophy during the writing of the Constitution.1JJ!l. Law of Nations was significantly the most cited legal source in America jurisprudence between 1789 and 1820). The Founders and Framers studied and were greatly influenced by Vattel. R.G. Natelson, ~ Origjnal Constitution 49 and 69 (2010) (\"Vattel was probably the Founders' favorite authority on international law .... \" and his, treatise, The Law of Nations, was their favorite). What Minor said about a \"natural born Citizen\" was confirmed in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark. 169 U.S. 649 (1898) (acknowledging and confirming Minor's American common law definition of a \"natural-born citizen\" but adding based on the English common law that since '\"[t]he child of an alien, if born in the country, is as much a citizen aa the natural-born child of a citizen, and by operation of the same principle [birth in the country]\"' (bracketed information supplied), a child born in the United States to domiciled alien parents was a Fourteenth Amendment \"citizen of the United States\"). This American common law definition of a \"natural born Citizen\" has never been changed, not even by the Fourteenth Amendment (only uses the clause \"citizen of the United States\" and does not mention \"natural born Citizen'') or by Wong Kim Ark. and therefore still prevails todazy. Both those U.S. Supreme Court cases define a \"natural born Citizen\" as a child born in a country to parents who are citizens of that country. 2 Roman law provided: \"Lex MENSIA, That a child should be held as a lorejper. if either of the parents was so. But it&oth parentl were Romeos and married. children always obtained the rank of the father. (pafJtem sequuntur liberi. Liv. iv. 4.) and if unmarried, of the mother, Uipian.\" Alexander Adam, Roman antiquities: or, An account of the manners and customs of the Romans 210 (6th ed. eottected 1807). Cicero wrote in A Proposal: \"The Colophonians claim Homer as their own free Denizen, the Chians challenge him as theirs, the Salaminians demand him again for their own, but the Smyrneane assert him to be their natural born Citizen; and therefore have also dedicated a Temple to him in their Town of Smyrna. There are a great many besides at Daggers-drawing among themselves, and contend for him.\" A Proposal For Printing in English, The Select Orations of Marcus Tullius Cicero, According to the last Oxford Edition 17 (Henry Eelbeck trans.

Other enemy .. individuals\" were detincd as \"natives, citizem1, or subjects of any nation with which the United States is at war, other than citizens of the United States.\" These \"citizens of the United States\" in 1917 held Private citizenship of the United States without having been reduced to the inferior citiztnship status of being property of and surety for the State-created Public .. citizen of the United St.ates.\" which public citiwnship status was imposed on March 9, 1933. 4. The .. Trading With the Enemy Act\" also defined the term \"'person.\" A \"person\" was \"deemed to mean an individual. partnership, association, company. or other unincorporated body of individuals, or corporation or body politic.\" Therefore in 1917 a .. person\" could mean both a natural person/Private Citizen of the United States and an artificial person/Public citium of the United States in privilege. 5. Therefore. a \"person\" as defined by the \"Trading with the Enemy Act\" DID INCLUDE a \"citizen of the United States.\" which at the time was a Private \"<!itizen of the United States.\" 6. The \"Emergency Banking Relief Act\" of March 9, 1933, amended the \"Trading With the Enemy Act\" of 1917 (previously amended fourteen times from March 26, 1918. to March 10. 19:30). bringing the \"Trading With the Enemy Act\" inside the United States applying it to \"any place subject to the jurisdiction tlaereof [all the StateJJ within. the United States) when previously, under the \"Tmding With the Enemy Act,\" all transactions .. eucuted wholly within the United Slates .. were excluded; 7.

For that \"individual\" American to be treated as an artificial entity. his Private \"citizenship of the United States\" had to be reduced by an implied, constructive contract by operation of law to the inferior grade of quasi-corporate citizenship. 10. The corporation that is a citizen is a ''Public\" citizen of the United States. It is created for the benefit of the public. The corporation is not a \"Private\" Citizen of the United States. Only individual Men and Women can be \"Private\" Citizens of the United States as intended by Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. 11. Therefore, the Private \"citizen of the United States1 ' is protected in his citizenship status by Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Federal statute. 12 USC 95a amending and resting upon 50 USC 5(b) does not apply to the Private Citizen of the United States. 12. Because the individual Private \"Citizen of the United States\" is protected by Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, he was specifically EXCLUDED by definition from the \"Emergency . Banking Relief Act,\" which act of FDR's Emergency War Powers Congress (by way of the amended \"Trading With the Enemy Act,\" Section 17), imposed a martial process upon the courts, federal and state, after April 25, 1938. 13. Therefore the good news is, all Private \"Citizens of the United States\" are protected in their private right to a civilian due process oflaw on a federal level by the Fifth Amendment, and to a civilian due process on a state level by Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. 14. Therefore every Private \"Citizen of the United States\" is neither a \"person nor \"property> \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" referred to in the Emergency Banking Relief Act (12 USC 95a) passed by the Emergency War Powers Congress on March 9, 1933. 15. And therefore. all Private \"citizens of the United States\" are not subject to the provisions of the \"Emergency Banking Relief Act\" (12 USC 95a) having amended the \"Trading With the Enemy Act\" of October 6, 1917, as previously amended on March 28, 1918, now codified as 50 USC App. 5(b)), including a martial due process of law imposed by the amended ''Trading With the Enemy Act\" upon any artificial \"person\" within the United States and \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\" i.e, \"subject to the de facto Emergency War Powers jurisdiction thereof.\" Exhibit ABIRTHER CONFESSION -DC\"~~tf-\\is PAGE 029of156 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 58 of 65r I I j l l DEPUTY CLERK A Word for Word Comparison Between 50 USC App. Section 5(b) of the \"The Trading With the Enemy Act\" of October 6, 1917, .fO Stat.

Congress llder reinstated the option to use gold clauses for obligations (new contrac\\S) issued after October 1977 in accordance with l I U.S.C. l.llll(dX2). The Uaited States Gold Raern Act of Janaary JO. 193.t required that all goJd and gold certificares held by the UdmJ1 R.mnc be surrendered and vested in the sole title of the Upitcd SWg Department oftbc Treasuty. The Gold Reserve Act outlawed most private possession of gold, forcin& individuals to sell ii to the Treasury. after which it was stored in United States Bullion De,pository at fm1 Knox and other locations. The a(!t also changed tbe nominal price of gold from $20.67 per troy mmceto S35. A year earlier, in 1933, Executive Order 6102 had made it a criminal offense for U.S. citizens to own or rrade gold anywhere in the world. with exceptions for some jewelry and collector's coins. These prohibitions were relaxed starting in 1964 -gold certificates were again allowed for private investors on April 24, 1964, although the obligation to pay the certificate holder on demand in gold specie would not be honored. By 1975 Americans could again freely own and trade gold. The Gold Reserve Act authorized the Excban&e Stabilization Fund to use such assets as were not needed for exchange market stabilization to deal in ~ovemment securities. The Gold Reserve Act had economic ramifications far beyond national finance. At that lime many contracts stipulated that their monetary t.enns could be demanded in gold. Such gold clauses were intended to protect against the United States devaluing the dollar. When the Emewmcy Banking Act of 1933 and the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 outlawed the use of gold. such contracts became smuces of con1r0versy. In the gold claqse case Norma111\u00b7s. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 294 U.S. 240 ( 1935), the U.S. Su.preme .Cmll:t ruled that gold clauses were invalid. However, Congress later reinstated the option to use gold clauses for obJiptions (new conlracts) issued after October 1977 in accordance with 31 U.S.C. UUJ.(d)(2). The 2008 decision 2 J 6 Jamuica Avenue, LLC vs S&:R Playhouse Really Co. established that a gold clause in contracts signed before 1933 was only suspended not erased, and under certain limited circumstances might be nitaetivated.

We have completed a search for records responsive to your request. The search resulted in the retrieval of six documents that are responsive to your request. After careful review of these documents, we have determined. that all six documents may be released in full. We did not locate a 1965 passport application referenced in an application for amendment of passport that is included in the released documents. Many passport applications and other non-vital records from that period were destroyed diwing the 1980s in accordance with guidance from the General Services Administration. Passport records typically consist of applications for United States passports and supporting evidence of United States citizenship. Passport records do not include evidei1ce of travel such as entrance/exit stamps, visas, residence permits, etc., since this information is entered into the passport book after issuance.

Prose plaintiff CHRISTOPHER- EARL STRUNK brings this action against numerous defendants, including President BARACK OBAMA, Vice President JOSEPH BIDEN, Senator JOHN MCCAIN, Speaker of the House of Representatives JOHN BOEHNER, former House of Representatives Speaker NANCY PELOSI, Governor ANDREW CUOMO, Attorney General ERIC -2- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 39 of 88 SCHNEIDERMAN, Comptroller THOMAS DI NAPOLI, the NEW YORK STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, billionaires PETER PETERSEN, PENNY PRITZKER, GEORGE SOROS and six New York State political parties. Thirteen motions are pending before the Court. Plaintiff STRUNK's complaint is a rambling, forty-five page variation on \"birther\" cases, containing 150 prolix paragraphs, in at times a stream of consciousness. Plaintiffs central allegation is that defendants President OBAMA and Senator McCAIN, despite not being \"natural born\" citizens of the United States according to plaintiffs interpretation of Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution, engaged with the assistance of other defendants in an extensive conspiracy, on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church to defraud the American people and usurp control of the Presidency in 2008. Most of plaintiff STRUNK's complaint is a lengthy, vitriolic, baseless diatribe against defendants, but most especially against the Vatican, the Roman Catholic Church, and particularly the Society of Jesus (the Jesuit Order). Plaintiff STRUNK alleges seven causes of action: breach of state constitutional fiduciary duty by the NEW YORK STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS and public officer defendants; denial of equal protection for voter expectation of a correct ballot; denial of substantive due process for voter expectation of a correct ballot; interference with the right to a republican form of government by the two Jesuit defendants and defendant F.A.0. SCHWARZ, JR., who were all members ofthe New York City Campaign Finance -3- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE 076 of 156 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-7 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 40 of 88 Board; interference with plaintiffs election franchise; a scheme to defraud plaintiff of a reasonable expectation of successful participation in the suffrage process; and, a scheme by all defendants for unjust enrichment. Plaintiff requests a declaratory judgment and a preliminary injunction against defendants, including: enjoining the NEW YORK STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS from putting Presidential candidates on the ballot for 2012 unless they provide proof of eligibility, pursuant to Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the U. S. Constitution; ordering that this eligibility certification be submitted to the Court for proof of compliance; enjoining the Jesuits from interfering with the 2012 elections; ordering expedited discovery to determine the scope of damages, alleged to be more than $12 billion; and, ordering a jury trial for punitive treble damages. Various defendants or groups of defendants, all represented by counsel, present eleven motions to dismiss and one motion to admit an attorney pro hace vice for this action. The eleven individual defendants or groups of defendants are, in chronological order of filing their motions to dismiss: defendants President BARACK OBAMA, Vice President JOSEPH BIDEN, OBAMA FOR AMERICA and the OBAMA VICTORY FUND; defendants MCCAIN VICTORY 2008, MCCAIN-PALIN VICTORY 2008 and Senator JOHN MCCAIN; defendants MARK BRZEZINSKI and IAN BRZEZINSKI; defendant Representative NANCY PELOSI; defendant GEORGE SOROS; defendants THE SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY and ROGER CALERO; defendant Speaker -4- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 41 of 88 JOHN BOEHNER; defendant ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI; defendants Father JOSEPH A. O'HARE, S.J., Father JOSEPH P. PARKES, S.J. and FREDERICK A. 0. SCHWARZ, JR.; defendant PENNY PRITZKER; and defendant PETER G. PETERSEN. The eleven motions to dismiss assert: plaintiff STRUNK lacks standing; plaintiff STRUNK fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; plaintiff STRUNK fails to plead fraud with particularity; the action is frivolous; plaintiff STRUNK is barred by collateral estoppel from pursuing this action; and, the Court lacks both personal and subject matter jurisdiction in this action. The motion to admit counsel pro hace vice for the instant action, by counsel for defendants MCCAIN VICTORY 2008, MCCAIN-PALIN VICTORY 2008 and Senator JOHN MCCAIN, for Todd E. Phillips, Esq., a member in good standing of both the California and District of Columbia bars, is granted. Further, plaintiff STRUNK cross-moves to consolidate the instant action with a similar \"birther\" action filed by him, Strunk v Paterson, et al, Index No. 29642/08, in the Kings County Special Election Part, before Justice David Schmidt. Many of the defendants oppose consolidation because Strunk v Paterson, et al, Index No. 29642/08, is a disposed case. The cross-motion to consolidate this action with Strunk v Paterson, et al, Index No. 29642/08, is denied. Defendants who oppose plaintiff's cross-motion are correct. Justice Schmidt disposed of Strunk v Paterson, et al, Index No. 29642/08, on the grounds -5- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 42 of 88 of collateral estoppel, failure to join necessary parties and }aches. The eleven motions to dismiss are all granted and plaintiff STRUNK's instant complaint is dismissed with prejudice. It is clear that plaintiff STRUNK: lacks standing; fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; fails to plead fraud with particularity; and, is barred by collateral estoppel. Also, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over most, if not all, defendants. Furthermore, plaintiff STRUNK 's instant action is frivolous. As will be explained, plaintiff STRUNK alleges baseless claims about defendants which are fanciful, fantastic, delusional and irrational. It is a waste of judicial resources for the Court to spend time on the instant action. Moreover, the Court will conduct a hearing to give plaintiff STRUNK a reasonable opportunity to be heard, pursuant to 22 NYCRR \u00a7 13 0-1.1, as to whether or not the Court should award costs and/ or impose sanctions upon plaintiff STRUNK for his frivolous conduct. At the hearing, an opportunity will be given to counsel for defendants to present detailed records of costs incurred by their clients in the instant action. Therefore, plaintiff STRUNK, who is not a stranger in the courthouses of New York, is enjoined from commencing future litigation in the New York State Unified Court System against: the NEW YORK ST ATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, JAMES A.

In Strunk v New York State Board of Elections, et al., Index No. 08-CV4289 (US Dist Ct, EDNY, Oct. 28, 2008, Ross, J.), the Court dismissed the action because of plaintiffs lack of standing, failure to state a claim and frivolousness. In that action, plaintiff STRUNK accused the NEW YORK STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS of \"misapplication and misadministration of state law in preparation for the November 4, 2008 Presidential General Election\" by, among other things, in if 51 of the complaint, of \"failure to obtain and ascertain that Barrack Hussein Obama is a natural citizen, otherwise contrary to United States Constitution Article 2 Second I Clause 5 [sic]\" and demanded \"Defendants are to provide proof that Barrack Hussein Obama is a natural born citizen and if not his electors are to be stricken from the ballot [sic].\" Judge Ross, at page 6 of her decision, held \"the court finds that portions of plaintiffs affidavit rise to the level of the irrational\" and, in footnote 6, Judge Ross cited two prior 2008 Eastern District cases filed by plaintiff STRUNK in which \"the court has determined that portions of plaintiffs complaints have contained allegations that have risen to the irrational.\" My Kings County Supreme Court colleague, Justice Schmidt, in Strunk v Paterson, et al, Index No. 29642/08, as cited above, disposed of that matter, on March 14, 2011, by denying all of plaintiffs motions and noting that the statute of limitations expired to join necessary parties President OBAMA and Senator MCCAIN. Further, Justice Schmidt -8- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE 081 of Document 483-7 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 45 of 88 denied plaintiff an opportunity to file affidavits of service nunc pro tune and to amend the complaint. Then, plaintiff STRUNK, eight days later, on March 22, 2011, commenced the instant action by filing the instant verified complaint. Plaintiff STRUNK's complaint recites numerous baseless allegations about President OBAMA. These allegations are familiar to anyone who follows the \"birther'; movement: President OBAMA is not a \"natural-born\" citizen of the United States; the President is a radical Muslim; the President's Hawaiian Certificate of Live Birth does not prove that he was born in Hawaii; and, President OBAMA is actually a citizen of Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Kenya, or all of the above. For example, Plaintiff STRUNK alleges, in~ 24 of the complaint, that President OBAMA: is a Madrasah trained radical Sunni Muslim by birth right ... practices Shariah law ... with the full knowledge and blessing of Defendants: Peter G. Peterson; Zbigniew Brzezinski; his sons Mark and Ian; Penny S. Pritzker; George Soros; Jesuits Fathers: Joseph P. O'Hare, Joseph P. Parkes; Brennan Center Executive Frederick A. 0. Schwarz, Jr.; Nancy Pelosi, John Sidney McCain III; John A. Boehner; Hillary Clinton; Richard Durbin Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 46 of 88 Then, in if 28 of the complaint, plaintiff STRUNK alleges that President OBAMA \"or his agent(s) as part of the scheme to defraud placed an image of Hawaiian Certification of Live Birth (COLB) on the Interest ... and as a prima facie fact means the Hawaii issued COLB does not prove 'natural born' citizenship or birth in Hawaii, only a longform document would [sic.]\" Plaintiffs alleged vast conspiracy implicates dozens of political and religious figures, as well as the 2008 presidential candidates from both major parties, with numerous absurd allegations. They range from claiming that an associate at the large law firm of Kirkland and Ellis, LLP masterminded the conspiracy because she wrote a law review article about the U. S. Constitution's natural born citizen requirement for the office of President to the assertion that Islam is a seventh century A.D. invention of the Vatican. Further, plaintiff STRUNK alleges, in if 129 of the complaint, that he: is the only person in the USA to have duly fired fired fired BHO [President OBAMA] on January 23, 2009 by registered mail (rendering BHO the USURPER as Plaintiff is entitled to characterize BHO as) on the grounds that he had not proven himself eligible ... and all acts by the usurper are void ab initio - a serious problem! [sic] Plaintiffs allegations are strongly anti-Catholic, anti-Muslim and xenophobic. -10- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 47 of 88 complaint weaves the occasional true but irrelevant fact into plaintiffs rambling stream of consciousness. Moreover, plaintiff STRUNK alleges, in~ 22 of the complaint, that defendant Vice President BIDEN knew that President OBAMA was \"not eligible to run for president because he is not a Natural-Born Citizen with a British Subject Father with a student visa, however in furtherance of CFR [Council on Foreign Relations] foreign policy initiatives in the mid-east supported Soebarkah [President OBAMA] as a Muslim [sic].\" Also, Plaintiff STRUNK discusses, in the complaint, then-Senator OBAMA's April 2008 co-sponsorship of Senate Resolution 511. This resolved unanimously that Senator MCCAIN, born in 1936 in Panama, while his father was on active duty in the United States Navy at Coco Sola Naval Air Station, is a natural born citizen of the United States. This resolution put to rest questions about Senator MCCAIN' S eligibility to run for President. However, plaintiff STRUNK alleges, in~ 43 of the complaint, that Senate Resolution 511 \"is part of the scheme to defraud\" and \"a fraud upon Congress and the People of the several states and territories contrary to the facts.\" Then, plaintiff STRUNK, in~ 44 of the complaint, cites Senate Resolution 511 's text as evidence that President OBAMA concedes that the definition of natural born citizenship for President requires both parents of a candidate be U.S. citizens at birth. Further, the complaint -11- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 48 of 88 alleges that JOHN MCCAIN and ROGER CALERO, presidential candidate of the SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY, were also ineligible, like then-Senator OBAMA, for President because of their failure to qualify under the natural born citizen requirement. Plaintiffs alleged injury, in~ 47 of the complaint, is \"[t]hat on November 4, 2008, Plaintiff, as a victim of the scheme to defraud, voted for the electors representing ... McCain ... not a natural-born U.S. citizen.\" Further, in~ 49 of the complaint, \"as part of the scheme to defraud, Plaintiff voted for Candidate McCain despite the fact that his wife is a most devoted Roman Catholic whose two sons were educated by Jesuit priests.\" Plaintiff alleges, in~ 51 of the complaint, that Senator MCCAIN, was born in Colon Hospital, Colon, Panama, which was not in the Panama Canal Zone. Further, plaintiff alleges, in~ 52 of the complaint, that according to the November 18, 1903 Hay\u00ad Bunau Varilla Treaty, by which the United States obtained the Canal Zone, Senator MCCAIN is not a natural-born citizen. Plaintiff STRUNK, in his final twenty pages of the complaint, alleges that the massive conspiracy to defraud American voters was perpetrated by hundreds of individuals, at the behest of the Roman Catholic Church and especially the Jesuits, with the aim of bringing about the Apocalypse through the destruction of the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the re-building a new Jewish Temple on that site. Among the entities that Plaintiff STRUNK implicates in his alleged conspiracy are: the Muslim Brotherhood; -12- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE of 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-7 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 49 of 88 the Carlyle Group; the CFR; Halliburton; Kirkland and Ellis, LLP; and, the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU. For example, in ir 91 of the complaint, plaintiff STRUNK states: That members of the Council on Foreign Relations including Peter G. Petersen as then Chairman that act with the Jesuit Order by the oath of allegiance superior to the United States Constitution, Treaties, and various States' Constitutions that starting no later than January 2006 sought to usurp the executive branch of government using Barack Hussein Obama II and John S. McCain III, as a matched set of contenders then under joint command and control, to preclude any other contender in preparation for a banking and sub-prime mortgage collapse that requires subsuming the sovereignty of the people of the united States of America and New York to International Monetary Fund conditionality with loss of the dollar reserve currency status, and collapse of the living standards of the vast majority of the Americans to that ofa third world status. [sic] Plaintiff STRUNK, in ii 139 of the complaint, alleges that defendant GEORGE SOROS \"proves his allegiance to Rome by promoting Muslim Brotherhood overt control -13- BIRTHER CONFESSION \u00b7 DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE 483-7 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 50 of 88 of Egypt ... We cannot forget that the Jesuits in Cairo created the Muslim Brotherhood in 1928, the same year the Order created Opus Dei in Spain [sic].\" Further, plaintiff STRUNK, in~ 145 of the complaint alleges that \"Defendants Pritzker and Soros have managed a crucial role for the Vatican State as a member of the CFR and high level Freemasonry and in conjunction with King Juan Carlos (the King of Jerusalem) to create global regionalism that subsumes national sovereignty of the USA and the People of New York state to the detriment of plaintiff and those similarly situated [sic].\" Eleven defendants or groups of defendants filed motions to dismiss, arguing that plaintiff STRUNK: lacks standing; failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; failed to plead fraud with particularity; and, is barred by collateral estoppel. Further, defendants argue that the Court lacks both personal and subject matter jurisdiction and the instant complaint is frivolous. Plaintiff, in response, filed an affidavit in opposition to the motions to dismiss and moved to consolidate the instant action with Strunk v Paterson, et al, Index No. 29642/08. On August 22, 2011, I held oral arguments on the record with respect to the thirteen instant motions. At the hearing, plaintiff STRUNK agreed with the Court that President OBAMA, with the release of his long-form Hawaiian birth certificate, was born in Honolulu, Hawaii [tr., p. 23]. However, plaintiff STRUNK, at tr., pp. 30 -31, argued that a \"natural born citizen,\" eligible to run for President of the United States, pursuant to -14- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 51 of 88 Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution, means that not only the candidate is natural born, but both of the candidate's parents are natural born. The following exchange at the oral arguments took place, at tr., p. 34, line 25 -p. 35, line 16: MR. STRUNK: THE COURT: MR. STRUNK: My injury, I voted for McCain. Is that an injury? My injury is he did not challenge Mr. Obama after he went through the whole exercise. THE COURT: You're saying he should have challenged Mr. Obama's presidency? MR. STRUNK: Absolutely, and the ballot. The onus is on me because he violated his agreement with me. You can't challenge the eligibility until he's up to be sworn. McCain, since everybody in Congress, since they didn't want to know about anything, so it was my responsibility. I fired him by registered mail within 72 hours. THE COURT: I saw your letter that you fired the President. I guess he didn't agree with you because he's still there. -15- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 52 of 88 A discussion ensued as to how plaintiff STRUNK alleges that President OBAMA is a Muslim [tr., pp. 36 -38]. The following colloquy took place at tr., p. 37, lines 4 -8: THE COURT: How could you come to the conclusion that he's a radical Sunni Muslim? MR. STRUNK: Because that's what his records show and that's what the testimony of individuals who were in class with him show. The following portions of the exchange, at tr., p. 39, line 9 -p. 43, line 8 demonstrates the irrational anti-Catholic bias of plaintiff STRUNK: THE COURT: What I find fascinating, first of all you said there was a connection there where you say Cindy McCain says she's a Catholic. I don't know if she is. I think you said she's Catholic faith, Cindy McCain. MR.STRUNK: She is the largest distributor of Budweiser. THE COURT: I know that. That doesn't make her a Catholic necessarily. MR.STRUNK: It's the connection that counts. Your don't get those connections. -16- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE Filed on in TXSD Page 53 of 88 THE COURT: ... I don't know if the Busch family is Catholic. I don't care. MR.

You said she's a Catholic and you get into this whole riff or rant, whatever you want to call it, about the Catholic Church and Father O'Hare, the Vatican. You go on and on about the Vatican ... but it seems to me you have this theory that everything is a conspiracy and it always falls back to Rome. MR. STRUNK: That's a matter of public record. THE COURT: Oh, okay. MR. STRUNK:, What the key is here, Ms. McCain is on the Board of Directors for a Jesuit run school where her children are going to school. THE COURT: Could very well be. I don't know. MR. STRUNK: ... In fact, it turns out in the discovery of the -17- BIRTHER CONFESSION \u00b7 DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE 483-7 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 54 of 88 connection to the Jesuits it was so compelling that when I started really digging into the background of this scheme of defraud, putting up two Manchurian candidates at once, which would take advantage of New York State's weakness in our law which required honesty. We require to have honesty and didn't get it. THE COURT: Your case is more The Da Vinci Code. MR. STRUNK: The Da Vinci Code is a phoney book. THE COURT: With all due respect to John Frankenheimer, The Manchurian Candidate according to you and the school of the Vatican, by that way it describes the gist of your argument. MR.STRUNK: Frankenheimer? THE COURT: He directed the original Manchurian Candidate movie. MR. STRUNK: The old? THE COURT: With Frank, not Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 55 of 88 MR.

THE COURT: Okay, that's your argument. Standard for a motion to dismiss \"When determining a motion to dismiss, the court must 'accept the facts as alleged in the complaint as true, accord plaintiffs the benefit of every possible favorable inference, and determine only whether tlte facts as alleged flt within any cognizable legal theory' (see Arnav Indus., Felder & Steiner, 96 NY2d 300, 303 84 NY2d 83, 87-88 [ 1994]) [Emphasis addetfj.\" (Goldman 5 NY3d 561, 570-571 [2005]). Fm1her, 451 [2d Dept 2003]), instructed that: In determining whether a complaint is sufficient to withstand a motion pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (7), \"the sole criterion is whether the pleading states a cause of action, and if from its four corners factual allegations are discerned which taken together manifest any cause of action cognizable at law a motion for dismissal will fail\" (Guggenheimer v Ginsburg, 43 NY2d 268, 275 [1977]. The court must accept the facts -20-I !

Ctr. of Brooklyn & Queens, 273 AD2d 193 [2000]). However, bare legal conclusions are not entitled to the benefit of the presumption of truth and are not accorded every favorable inference (see Doria v Masucci, 230 AD2d 764 [2000]). [Emphasis addedj For a plaintiff to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, the factual allegations in the claim cannot be \"merely conclusory and speculative in .nature and not supported by any specific facts.\" (Residents for a More Beautiful Port Washington, Inc. v Town of North Hempstead, 153 AD3d 727, 729 [2d Dept 1989]). \"The allegations in the complaint cannot be vague and conclusory.\" (Staiano.ff v Gahona, 248 AD2d 525 92 NY2d 844 [1998], cert denied by Stoianoffv New York Times, 525 US 953 [1998]). (See LoPresti v Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 30 AD3d 474 [2d Dept 2006]; Levin v Isayeu, 27 AD3d 425 [2d Dept 2006]; Hart v Scott, 8 AD3d 532 [2d Dept 2004]). Plaintiff STRUNK's complaint must be dismissed because the \"Court need not, and should not, accept legal conclusions, unwarranted inferences, unwarranted deductions, baseless conclusions of law, or sweeping legal conclusions cast in the form of -21- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE 094of156 t I 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-7 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 59 of 88 factual allegations.

It is clear that the facts alleged by plaintiff STRUNK do not fit into any cognizable legal theory. Plaintiff STRUNK' S complaint is more of a political manifesto than a verified pleading. Similar lawsuits challenging the eligibility of President OBAMA and Senator MCCAIN for the presidency based upon plaintiffs incorrect interpretation of the term \"natural born Citizen\" in Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution have been dismissed as a matter of law. (See Drake v Obama, 664 F 3d 774 [9th Cir 2011]; Barnett v Obama, 2009 WL 3861788 [US Dist Ct, CA F Supp 2d 1144 [ND Ca 2008]; Hollander [D NH 2008]). Plaintiff STRUNK lacks standin~ Plaintiff STRUNK lacks standing to sue in state court, having suffered no injury. \"Standing to sue is critical to the proper functioning of the judicial system. It is a threshold issue. If standing is denied, the pathway to the courthouse is blocked. The plaintiff who has standing, however, may cross the threshold and seek judicial redress.\" (Saratoga County Chamber of Commerce, Inc. v Pataki, 100 801 812 [2003], cert denied 540 [2003]). Professor David Siegel, Prac, TXSD 60 of 88 instructs that: [i]t is the law's policy to allow only an aggrieved person to bring . a lawsuit ... A want of \"standing to sue,\" in other words, is just another way of saying that this particular plaintiff is not involved in a genuine controversy, and a simple syllogism takes us from there to a \"jurisdictional\" dismissal: (1) the courts have jurisdiction only over controversies; (2) a plaintiff found to lack \"standing\" is not involved in a controversy; and (3) the courts therefore have no jurisdiction of the case when such a plaintiff purports to bring it. \"Standing to sue requires an interest in the claim at issue in the lawsuit that the law will recognize as a sufficient predicate for determining the issue at the litigant's request.\" (Caprer Nussbaum, 36 AD3d 176, 181 [2d Dept 2006]). \"An analysis of standing begins with a determination of whether the party seeking relief has sustained an injury (see Society of Plastic Indus. v County of Suffolk, 77 NY2d 761, 762-773 [1991]).\" (Mahoney v Pataki, 98 NY2d 45, 52 [2002]). \"The Court of Appeals has defined the standard by which standing is measured, explaining that a plaintiff, in order to have standing in a particular dispute, must demonstrate an injury in fact that falls within the relevant zone of interests sought to be protected by law.\" ( Caprer v Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 61 of 88 A plaintiff, to have standing, \"must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\" (Allen v Wright, 468 US 737, 751 [1984]). If a plaintiff lacks standing to sue, the plaintiff may not proceed in the action. (Stark v Goldberg, 297 AD2d 203 [1st Dept 2002]). Plaintiff STRUNK clearly lacks standing to sue because he cannot establish an injury in fact. Plaintiffs claim that his November 2008 vote for Senator MCCAIN for President was his injury is the type of generalized grievance that is foreclosed by the U.S. Constitution's particularized injury requirement. \"We have consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about government-claiming only harm to his and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large-does not state an Article III case or controversy.\" (Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife, 504 US 555, 572 [1992]). \"Thus, a private citizen who does not show any special rights or interests in the matter in controversy, other than those common to all taxpayers and citizens, has no standing to sue.\" (Matter of Meehan v County of Westchester, 3 AD3d 533, 534 [2d Dept 2004]). (See Diederich 'n, 33 AD3d 653, 654 [2d Dept 2006]; Concerned Taxpayers of Stony Point v Town of Stony Point, 28 AD3d 657, 658 [2d Dept 2006]). Plaintiff STRUNK's complaint alleges nothing more than non-justiciable abstract and theoretical claims. Therefore, the instant complaint, failing to state any allegation of a particularized injury, is dismissed with -24- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 62 of 88 prejudice. (Silver v Pataki at 539; Mahoney v Pataki at 52). Plaintiff Strunk's failure to state a cause of action Alternatively, plaintiff STRUNK's complaint must be dismissed for his failure to state a cause of action. The Court is under no obligation to accept as true plaintiffs complaint, full of legal conclusions and bald assertions cloaked as facts. (Ruffino v New York City Tr. Auth., 55 AD3d 817, 818 [2d Dept 2008]). As noted above, in Morris v Morris at 451, \"bare legal conclusions are not entitled to the benefit of the presumption of truth and are not accorded every favorable inference.\" Moreover, plaintiff has failed to plead any facts that fit within any cognizable legal theory. (Goldman v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.~ at 570-571 ). Further, plaintiff STRUNK's often rambling and almost incomprehensible complaint fails to satisfy the pleading requirements of CPLR \u00a73013 and CPLR Rule 3014. CPLR \u00a7 3013 requires statements in a pleading to be \"sufficiently particular to give the court and parties notice of the transactions, occurrences, or series of transactions or occurrences, intended to be proved and the material elements of each cause of action or defense.\" CPLR Rule 3014 imposes additional pleading requirements that \"[ e ]very pleading shall consist of plain and concise statements in consecutively numbered paragraphs. Each paragraph shall contain, as far as practicable, a single allegation ... Separate causes of action or defenses shall be separately stated and numbered and may be -25- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 \u00b7 PAGE 483-7 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 63 of 88 stated regardless of consistency.\" In Sibersky v New York City (270 AD2d 209 [Id Dept 2000], the Court dismissed an amended petition for its \"complete failure to follow the dictates of CPLR 3013 or 3014.\" The Sibersky complaint consisted of\"seven pages of single-spaced, unnumbered paragraphs, the import of which is unascertainable,\" and the Court held that \"[p ]leadings that are not particular enough to provide the court and the parties with notice of the transaction or occurrences to be proved must be dismissed.\" Complaints that do not meet the pleading requirements of CPLR \u00a7 3013 and CPLR Rule 3014 will be dismissed if \"devoid of specific factual allegations\" and do not \"indicate the material elements of a claim and how they would apply to the case.\" (Megna v Becton Dickinson & Co., 215 AD2d 1995]). v Dept 1979]), affd 48 NY2d 734 [ 1979]), a pro se plaintiffs complaint was dismissed for failure to comply with CPLR \u00a7 3013. The Court instructed that \"[a]t a minimum, a valid complaint must include all material elements of the cause of action.\" Plaintiff STRUNK' s rambling, forty-five page prolix complaint, with its irrelevant, scatter-shot morass of alleged historical references, virulent anti-Catholic rhetoric and extensive political rant fails to plead his alleged causes of action in a manner that is \"sufficiently particular to give the.court and parties notice of the transactions, occurrences, or series of transactions or occurrences, intended to be proved and the -26- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 64 of 88 material elements of each cause of action [CPLR \u00a7 3013]\" and organized in \"plain and concise statements in consecutively numbered paragraphs [CPLR Rule 30I4].\" \"While a refined and attenuated analysis might arguably spell out a shadow of a cause of action, neither the defendants nor the trial court should be subject to the difficulties.\" (Kent v Truman, 9 AD2d 649 [Id Dept I 959]). (See Geist v Rolls Royce Limited, 18 AD2d 631 (Id Dept I962]; Safer Bee/Co., Inc. v Northern Boneless Beef, Inc., I5 AD2d 479 [Id Dept 1961 ]). In a case, such as this one, in which \"the amended complaint is prolix, confusing, and difficult to answer\" and the complaint contains \"a confusing succession of discrete facts, conclusions, comments ... and considerable other subsidiary evidentiary matter whose relevance to a particular cause of action is frequently obscure ... Defendants should not be required fo answer such a jumble.\" (Rapaport v Diamond Dealers, Club, Inc., 95 AD2d 743, 744 [Id Dept I983]). (See Etu v Cumberland Farms, Inc., I48 AD2d 821, 824 [3d Dept 1989]). Plaintiff STRUNK fails to plead fraud with particularity \"The elements of fraud are narrowly defined, requiring proof by clear and convincing evidence (cf, Vermeer Owners v Guterman, 78 NY2d 1114, 1116 [1991]).\" (Gaidon v Guardian America, 94 NY2d 330, 349-350 [1999]). Mere conclusory statements alleging the wrong in the pleadings are insufficient. (McGovern v Nassau County Dept. of Social Services, 60 AD3d on 88 50 Dept 2004]; Sforza v Health Ins. Plan of Greater New York, 210 AD2d 214, 215 [2d Dept 1994]). The Appellate Division, Second Department, in Giurdanella v Giurdanella (226 AD2d 342, 343 [1996], held that: to establish a prima facie case of fraud, the plaintiff must establish ( 1) that the defendant made material representations that were false, (2) that the defendant knew the representations were false and made them with the intent to deceive the plaintiff, (3) that the plaintiff justifiably relied on the defendant's representations, and (4) that the plaintiff was injured as a result of the defendant's representation.

Partnership, 12 NY3d 236 [2009]; Small v Lorillard Tobacco Co., Inc. 94 NY2d 43 [1999]; Channel Master Corp. v Aluminum Limited Sales, Inc., 4 NY2d 403 [1958]; Smith v Ameriquest Mortg. [2d 2009]; Financial 58 AD3d 785 [2d Dept 2009]). Plaintiff STRUNK presents in his complaint fraud accusations that can be, at best, described as bare assertions. He does not allege that he relied upon any statements of defendants and fails to allege that he suffered any pecuniary loss as a result of the -28- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE 101 of 156 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-7 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 66 of 88 statements of any defendant. Actual pecuniary loss must be alleged in a fraud action. (Dress Shirt Sales, Inc. v Hotel Martinique Assoc., 12 NY2d 339, 343 [1963]; 184 558, Dept 1992]). The mere use ofthe word \"fraud\" in a complaint is not sufficient to comply with the specific requirements of CPLR \u00a7 3016 (b) that fraud be plead with particularity. Therefore, plaintiff STRUNK fails to allege the necessary elements for a fraud cause of action. This Court lacks jurisdiction Plaintiffs complaint essentially challenges the qualifications of both President OBAMA and Senator MCCAIN to hold the office of President. This is a non-justiciable poJitical question. Thus, it requires the dismissal of the instant complaint. \"The \"nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily a function of the separation of powers.\" (Baker v Carr, 369 US 186, 210 [1962]). Under separation of powers, \"[t]he constitutional power of Congress to regulate federal elections is well established.\" (Buckley v Valeo, 424 US 1, 13 [1976]). (See Oregon v Mitchell, 400 US 112 [1970]; Burroughs v United States, 290 US 534 [1934]). Under New York law, \"[t]his judicial deference to a coordinate, coequal branch of government includes one issue of justiciability generally denominated as the 'political question' doctrine.\" (Matter of New York State Inspection, Security & Law Enforcement Employees, District Council 82, AFSCME, AFL-CJO v Cuomo, 64 NY2d 233, 239 [1984]). The framework for the Electoral College and its voting procedures for President -29- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 67 of 88 and Vice President is found in Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution. This is fleshed out in 3 USC \u00a7 1 et seq., which details the procedures for Presidential elections. More specifically, the counting of electoral votes and the process for objecting for the 2009 Presidential election is found in 3 USC \u00a7 15, as modified by Pub L 110-430, \u00a7 2, 122 US Stat 4846. This required the meeting of the joint session of Congress to count the 2008 electoral votes to be held on January 8, 2009. On that day, after the counting of the Electoral College votes, then-Vice President Dick Cheney made the requisite declaration of the election of President OBAMA and Vice President BID EN. (155 Cong Rec H76 [Jan. 8 2009]). No objections were made by members of the Senate and House of Representatives, which would have resolved these objections if made. This is the exclusive means to resolve objections to the electors' selection of a President or a Vice President, including objections raised by plaintiff STRUNK. Federal courts have no role in this process. Plainly, state courts have no role. Thus, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to determine the eligibility and qualifications of President OBAMA to be President, as well as the same for Senator MCCAIN or ROGER CALERO. If a state court were to involve itself in the eligibility of a candidate to hold the office of President, a determination reserved for the Electoral College and Congress, it may involve itself in national political matters for which it is institutionally ill-suited and interfere with the constitutional authority of the Electoral College and Congress. Accordingly, the political question doctrine instructs this Court -30- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 68 of 88 and other courts to refrain from superseding the judgments of the nation's voters and those federal government entities the Constitution designates as the proper forums to detennine the eligibility of presidential candidates. Justice Robert Jackson, concurring in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v Sawyer (343 US 579, 635 1952], in discussing separation of powers stated that \"the Constitution diffuses power the better to secure liberty.\" Justice Thurgood Marshall, in his majority opinion in US. v Munoz-Flores (495 US 385, 394 [1990]), on the subject of separation of powers, quoted from Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent in Morrison v Olson, 487 US 654, 697 [1988], in which Justice Scalia observed that \"[t]he Framers of the Federal Constitution ... viewed the principle of separation of powers as the absolutely central guarantee of a just Government.\" This Court will not disrupt the separation of powers as enunciated in the U.S. Constitution and articulated by Justices Jackson, Marshall and Scalia. Further, plaintiff STRUNK has failed to properly serve defendants, including President OBAMA and Senator MCCAIN, pursuant to the CPLR. With numerous other grounds present for dismissing the instant action, the Court will not elaborate upon how plaintiff STRUNK failed to obtain personal jurisdiction over defendants. Plaintiff STRUNK is precluded by collateral estoppel Collateral estoppel or \"issue preclusion,\" as observed by CONFESSION -DCD on 88 \u00a7443, at 748-749, [4th ed], \"scans the first action and takes note of each issue decided in it. Then if the second action, although based on a different cause of action, attempts to reintroduce the same issue, collateral estoppel intervenes to preclude its relitigation and to bind the party, against whom the doctrine is being invoked, to the way the issue was decided in the first action.\" In Ryan v New York Telephone Company (62 NY2d 494, 500 [1984]), the Court of Appeals, held that \"[t]he doctrine of collateral estoppel, a narrower species of res judicata, precludes a party from relitigating in a subsequent action or proceeding an issue clearly raised in a prior action or proceeding and decided against that party or those in privity, whether or not the tribunals or causes of action are the same [Emphasis addetf].\" Two prerequisites must be met before collateral estoppel can be raised. The Court of Appeals, in Buechel v Bain (97 NY2d 295 [2001], 1096 [2002]), instructed at 303-304, that: There must be an identity of issue which has necessarily been decided in the prior action and is decisive of the present action, and there must have been a full and fair opportunity to contest the decision now said to be controlling (see, Gilberg v Barnieri, 53 NY2d 285, 291 [ 1981 ]). The litigant seeking the benefit of collateral estoppel must demonstrate that the decisive issue was necessarily decided in the prior -32- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 70 of 88 action against a party, or one in privity with a party (see, id.). The party to be precluded from relitigating the issue bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior detennination. [Emphasis added] (See D'Arata v New York Cent. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 76 NY2d 659, 664 [1990]; Gramatan Home Investors Corp. v Lopez, 46 NY2d 481, 485 supra; Westchester County Correction Officers Benevolent Ass 'n, Inc. v County of Westchester, 65 AD3d 1226, 1227 [2d Dept 2009]; Franklin Dev. Co. Inc. v Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co., 60 AD3d 897, 899 [2d Plaintiff STRUNK litigated many of the issues in the instant action in US District Court, but also in the previously cited Strunk v Paterson, et al, Index No. 29642/08, before Justice Schmidt. He acknowledged this, in~ 2 of the instant complaint, by stating: That this complaint is fairly traceable to the events and actions leading up to the Party primaries during the 2008 election cycle for the ballot access of the Presidential slates at the November 4, 2008 General Election as complained of in the related election law case, Strunk v Paterson, et al. NYS Supreme Court in the County of Kings with Index No. 29642-08 before the Honorable David I Schmidt of Part 1 -33- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 71 of 88 as an election law matter. [sic] As mentioned above, Justice Schmidt disposed of Strunk v Paterson, et al, Index No. 29642/08, on March 14, 2011, by denying all of plaintiffs motions and noting that the statute of limitations expired to join necessary parties President OBAMA and Senator MCCAIN. Therefore, collateral estoppel precludes plaintiff STRUNK from pursuing the instant action. Denial of plaintiff's cross-motion to consolidate Plantiffs cross-motion to consolidate this action with Strunk v Paterson, et al, Index No. 29642/08, and transfer the instant action to Justice Schmidt is denied. Justice Schmidt, on November 19, 2008, in Strunk v Paterson, et al, declined to sign plaintiff STRUNK's order to show cause to enjoin Governor Paterson from convening New York's December 2008 meeting of the Electoral College, because \"plaintiff is collaterally estopped.\" This refers to the Eastern District action dismissed by Judge Ross, in which she found the complaint frivolous. After a hiatus of several years, plaintiff STRUNK, by order to show cause, attempted to amend his complaint. Justice Schmidt, in his January 11, 2011 short-form order, denied this motion in its entirety. Then, plaintiff STRUNK moved to reargue. On March 14, 2011, Justice Schmidt, in a sh011-forrn order, denied reargument because plaintiff \"failed to join a -34- -DCD Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 72 of 88 party President OBAMA and Senator MCCAIN and the statute of limitations to do so expired.\" Finally, on November 9, 2011, H. William Van Allen, an ally of plaintiff STRUNK, moved to intervene as a plaintiff to challenge President OBAMA's placement on the upcoming 2012 ballot. In his November 22, 2011 short-fom1 order, Justice Schmidt denied Mr. Van Allen's intervention \"in all respects.\" Further, Justice Schmidt held \"[t]his is an action that was commenced in 2008 and has remained inactive for several years and it would be improper to allow plaintiff to raise new matters before the Court after the extended period of inactivity.\" Plaintiff's frivolous conduct \"A complaint containing as it does both factual allegations and legal conclusions, is frivolous where it lacks an arguable basis\" and \"embraces not only the inarguable legal conclusion, but also the fanciful factual allegation.\" (Neitzke v Williams, 490 US 319, 325 [ 1989]). Plaintiff STRUNK, as cited above, alleges numerous fanciful, fantastic, delusional, irrational and baseless claims about defendants. The U.S. Supreme Court, citing Neitzke, held in Denton v Hernandez (504 US 25, 32-33 [1992]), that: A court may dismiss a claim as factually frivolous only if the facts alleged are \"clearly baseless,\" 490 US at 127, 109 S Ct at 1833, a category encompassing allegations that are \"fanciful,\" id., at 325, 109 S Ct at 1831, \"fantastic,\" id., at 328, 109 in TXSD Page 73 of 88 \"delusional,\" ibid. As those words suggest, a finding of factual frivolousness is appropriate when the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible. In Denton, the plaintiff alleged that he had been repeatedly raped by a number of inmates at several different prisons, all using the same modus operandi. The Court concluded that these allegations were \"wholly fanciful\" and dismissed the claim as frivolous as a result. In Shoemaker v US. Department of Justice (164 F 3d 619, 619 [2d Cir 1998]), plaintiff alleged that the government and television stations conspired to: \"(l) broadcast infonnation about his feces on national television; and (2) file and publicized false charges of child abuse against him.\" The Court, citing Neitzke and Denton, dismissed the action as frivolous because plaintiffs \"factual claims are irrational and incredible.\" Another case applying the frivolous standards of Neitzke and Denton is Perri v Bloomberg (2008 WL 2944642 [US Dist Ct, ED NY 2008]), in which plaintiff alleged that a secret unit of the NYPD was attempting to kill him and his cats. The Court dismissed the case, finding that plaintiffs complaint has \"a litany of sensational allegations pertaining not only to the NYPD, but also to various arms of government, both state and federal. Accordingly, Perri has not established that he is entitled to a preliminary injunction, because his allegations of irreparable harm are unsupported and bizarre.\" -36- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE 109 of 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-7 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 74 of 88 Plaintiff STRUNK' S complaint, as well as his opposition to defendants' motions to dismiss, alleges that the correct interpretation of the natural born' citizen clause of the U.S. Constitution requires a natural born citizen to have been born on United States soil and have two United States born parents. Despite plaintiff's assertions, Article II, Section I, Clause 5 does not state this. No legal authority has ever stated that the natural born citizen clause means what plaintiff STRUNK claims it states. \"The phrase 'natural born Citizen' is not defined in the Constitutioh, see Minor v Happersett, 88 US 162, 167 [1875]), nor does it appear anywhere else in the document, see Charles Gordon, Who Can Be President of the United States: An Unresolved Enigma, 28 Md. L. Rev. 1, 5 (1968).\" (Hollander v McCain at 65). Plaintiff STRUNK cannot wish into existence an interpretation that he chooses for the natural born citizen clause. There is no arguable legal basis for the proposition that both parents of the President must have been born on U.S. soil. This assertion is as frivolous as the multitude of alleged allegations outlined above. Moreover, President OBAMA is the sixth U.S. President to have had one or both of his parents not born on U.S. soil. Plaintiff STRUNK and his fellow \"birthers\" might not realize that: both parents of President Andrew Jackson were born in what is now Northern Ireland; President James Buchanan's father was born in County Donegal, Ireland; President Chester A. Arthur's father was born in what is now Northern Ireland; -37- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE 110 of 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-7 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 75 of 88 President Woodrow Wilson's mother was born in Carlisle, England; and, President Herbert Hoover's mother was born in Norwich, Ontario, Canada. Therefore, the prosecution of the instant action by plaintiff STRUNK, with its fanciful, fantastic, delusional, irrational and baseless claims about defendants appears is frivolous. 22 NYCRR \u00a7 130-1.1 (a) states that \"the Court, in its discretion may impose financial sanctions upon any party or attorney in a civil action or proceeding who engages in frivolous conduct as defined in this Part, which shall be payable as provided in section 130-1.3 of this Subpart.\" 22 NYCRR \u00a7 130-1.1 (c) states: conduct is frivolous if: (1) it is completely without merit in law and cannot be supported by a reasonable argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law; (2) it is undertaken primarily to delay or prolong the resolution of the litigation, or to harass or maliciously injure another; or (3) it asserts material factual statements that are false. Conduct is frivolous and can be sanctioned, pursuant to 22 NYCRR \u00a7 130-1.1 (c), if\"it is completely without merit ... and cannot be supported by a reasonable argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\" (Gordon v Marrone, 202 AD2d 104, 110 [2d Dept 1994] lv denied 84 NY 2d 813 [1995]). RKO v 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-7 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 76 of 88 Dept 2010]; Glenn v Annunziata, 53 AD3d 565, [2d Dept 2006]; Greene v Doral Center 18 clear complaint: \"is completely without merit in ... to harass\" defendants; and, \"asserts material factual statements that are false.\" Several years before the drafting and implementation of the Part 130 Rules for costs and sanctions, the Court of Appeals (A.G. Ship Maintenance Corp. v Lezak, 69 NY2d 1, 6 [ 1986]) observed that \"frivolous litigation is so serious a problem affecting the proper administration of justice, the courts may proscribe such conduct and impose sanctions in this exercise of their rule-making powers, in the absence of legislation to the contrary (see NY Const, art VI,\u00a7 30, Judiciary Law\u00a7 211 [1] [b] ).\" Part 130 Rules were subsequently created, effective January 1, 1989, to give the courts an additional remedy to deal with frivolous conduct. In Levy v Carol Management Corporation (260 AD2d 27, 33 [1st Dept 1999)) the Court stated that in determining if sanctions are appropriate the Court must look at the broad pattern of conduct by the offending attorneys or parties. Further, \"22 NYCRR 130-1.1 allows us to exercise our discretion to impose costs and sanctions on an errant party.\" (Levy at 33). Moreover, \"[s]anctions are retributive, in that they punish past conduct. They also are goal oriented, in that they are useful in deterring future frivolous conduct not only by the particular parties, but also by the Bar at large.\" (Levy at 34). -39- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE 112 of 156 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-7 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 77 of 88 The Court, in Kernisan, MD. v Taylor (171AD2d869 [2d Dept 1991]), noted that the intent of the Part 130 Rules \"is to prevent the waste of judicial resources and to deter vexatious litigation and dilatory or malicious litigation tactics (cf Minister, Elders & Deacons of Refm. Prat. Church of City of New Yorkv 198 Broadway, NY2d 411; addelfj.\" To adjudicate the instant action, with the complaint replete with fanciful, fantastic, delusional, irrational and baseless allegations about defendants, combined with plaintiff STRUNK's lack of standing, the barring of this action by collateral estoppel and the Court lacking personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction over many of the defendants, is \"a waste of judicial resources.\" This conduct, as noted in Levy, must be deterred. In Weinstock v Weinstock (253 AD2d 873 [2d Dept 1998]) the Court ordered the maximum sanction of $10,000.00 for an attorney who pursued an appeal \"completely without merit,\" and holding, at 874, that \"[w]e therefore award the maximum authorized amount as a sanction for this conduct (see, 22 NYCRR 130-1.1) calling to mind thatfrivolous litigation causes a substantial waste of judicial resources to the detriment of those litigants who come to the Court with real grievances [Emphasis addelfj.\" Citing Weinstock, the Appellate Division, Second Department, in Bernadette Panzella, P. C. v De Santis (36 AD3d 734 [2d Dept 2007]) affirmed a Supreme Court, Richmond County $2,500.00 sanction, at 736, as \"appropriate in view of the plaintiffs waste of judicial resources [Emphasis addelfj.\" In Navin v Mosquera (30 AD3d 883, 883 [3d Dept 2006]) the Court instructed that -40- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE 113 of 156 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-7 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 78 of 88 when considering if specific conduct is sanctionable as frivolous, \"courts are required to examine 'whether or notthe conduct was continued when its lack of legal or factual basis was apparent [or] should have been apparent' (22 NYCRR 130-1.l [c]).\" Therefore, the Court will examine the conduct of plaintiff STRUNK in a hearing, pursuant to 22 NYC RR \u00a7 13 0-1.1, to determine if plaintiff STRUNK engaged in frivolous conduct, and to allow plaintiff STRUNK a reasonable opportunity to be heard. Further, at the hearing, an opportunity will be given to counsel for defendants to present detailed records of costs incurred by their clients in the instant action. Plaintiff precluded from reliti1:ation of the same claims .The Court is concerned that plaintiff STRUNK continues to use the scarce resources of the New York State Unified Court System to fruitlessly pursue the same claims. He is no stranger to litigation in Supreme Court, Kings County, Civil Term. Further, plaintiff STRUNK has had several bites of the same apple in U.S. District Court, which resulted in findings of his engagement in frivolous conduct with, as stated by Judge Ross, complaints that \"have contained allegations that have risen to the irrational.\" The Court should not have to expend resources on the next action by Mr. STRUNK that will be a new variation on the same theme of defendants' alleged misdeeds and misconduct. The continued use of the New York State Unified Court System for the personal pursuit by plaintiff STRUNK of irrational complaints against defendants must cease. Our courts have an interest in preventing the waste of judicial resources by a party -41- BIRTHER CONFESSION -DCD 20-cr-165 PAGE Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 79 of 88 who knows that his or lawsuit has no legitimate basis in law or fact and continues to attempt to relitigate resolved claims and issues. (Martin-Trigona v Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., 145 Misc 2d 405 [Sup New Dept 1984]), noted that \"public policy mandates free access to the courts ... and, ordinarily, the doctrine of former adjudication will serve as an adequate remedy against repetitious suits.\" Then, the Sassower Court observed, in the next paragraph, that: \"[ n ]onetlieless, a litigious plaintiff pressing a frivolous claim can be extremely costly to the defendant and can waste an inordinate amount of court time, time that this court and the trial courts can ill afford to lose (see Harrelson v United States, 613 F2d 114).\" Pro se litigants whom abuse judicial process have had their access to the courts limited. In Spremo v Babchik (155 Misc2d 796 (Sup Ct, Queens County 1996]), the Court, in enjoining a pro se litigant from instituting any further actions and proceedings in any court in the New York State Unified Court System, citing Sas sower and Kane v City of New York, 468 1979]).

The Court in dismissing the action, based upon res judicata, observed, at 903, that \"all litigants have a right to impartial and considered justice. Insofar as any litigant unnecessarily consumes inordinate amounts of judicial time and energy, he or she deprives other litigants of their proper share of these resources. A balance must be kept.\" Therefore, plaintiff STRUNK, with his history of abusing the civil justice system, by bringing prose actions devoid of merit against the same defendants, is precluded from relitigating the same claims and issues which waste court resources and is enjoined from bringing any future actions in the New York State Unified Court System against: the .

The Senate ethics rules require judge candidates to disclose all \"material\" relationshfps. Judge Boasberg conceals his secret past. Thfs new research proves his duplicity.

It appears that St. Peter's College is used for grooming media spies. This is the company Boasberg kept. Who pulls Judge Boasberg's chain? Answer: Pilgrims Society globalists. When one puts together the lists of alumni from St. Peter's College Oxford, Yale Skull f:t Bones and St. Alban's boy's school, we see a long list of notables to whom Judge Boasberg has pledged his loyalities. These loyalties would appear to supercede his oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution. No wonder Boasberg avoided disclosing St. Peter's College, The /SIS and Yale Skull f:t Bones in his disclosures.

BOASBERG FALSIFIED HIS SENATE ... THE OTHER MOVIE REVIEWERS ARE EVIDENTLY GROOMED PILGRIMS SOCIETY SOLDIERS Now havfng discovered the elusive November 1985 The I /SIS movie reviews (Nos. 2, 4), ft is certain that Boasberg's name does not appear. We cannot rule out the possibility that Boasberg's name was edited out, but forensic analysis is inconclusive. We have no reason to believe British archivists would have altered the magazine to edit out Boasberg, but Hillary Clinton, Robert Mueller and Michael Chertoff (former OHS director) control the Encrypt, Vertsign, etc.). Therefore, they have the capacity to alter British Library, Cambridge and Oxford archives without the librarians' knowledge. The November 29, 1985 movies that Boasberg told the Senate he reviewed were Cocoon, Suburbia, My Beautiful Launderette and Off#cfal Version. The reviews are chock full of \"sex fnterests,\" sexual fantasies, alien intercourse, rape, \"tarting-up,\" \"long homosexual loves scenes,\" a homosexual father who sodomizes his son. Was this Nov. 1985 movie review by Boasberg and his collaborators a cry for help? It is notoriously known that certain Oxford Colleges very intentionally groom selected students in homosexuality for the Pilgrims Society propaganda and spy business. Notably, the authors' UK library sources reviewed all copies of The /SIS in the years before and after Boasberg\u00b7s claimed Nov. 1985 authorship. They confirm that Boasberg's name does not appear anywhere. They concluded that either he did not publish the movie review, or he used a pen name, which is also unlikely since the other names appeared in multiple issues of the magazine. law It~ WISl!lnl\\Ofl University Law Cent\u00ab, fooner Leader d1n!ctor See of fntcrest In /Aathr v.

During WWI, Pigott worked for the Ministry of Information under John Buchan and even met with President Woodrow Wilson actually acting as a spy for the Ministry of Information. His cover was as Secretary of the British Universities Mission to the United States. Pigott handpicked a notorious homosexual Beverly Nichols to restart The /SIS in 1919 after returning from the propaganda spy mission against President Wilson. See ~\u00a3~~~~~~~~~\u00b7 The fact in itself that Nichols was an open homosexual is only mentioned because the British intelligence feeder system appears to have been focused on recruiting Oxford, Cambridge and Eton homosexuals, probably because their psychological profiles made them easier to control and manipulate as spies.

The most recent election law that allows 'vote harvesting' of an executed ballot by a biased political party member who is not an official government agent or even sworn to tell the truth, breaks existing California election laws and thwarts election accountability and transparent elections. In 2016, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law a change to Sections 3017 of the Election Code that allows any person to collect mail-in ballots from voters and then mail the ballots or deliver them to prescribed locations. Prior law only allowed relatives of the voter or those living in the same household as the voter, to return the ballot in lieu of the voter. Alex Padilla, the CA Secretary of State, made a ludicrous tweet regarding CA's vote harvesting election laws. He infers that the new law allows for every vote to be counted when the opposite is true -there is no chain of title required after the ballot is taken from the voter by a party hack. One of the possible problems is that a democrat could pretend to be a Republican collecting ballots, collect them and then dump them in the trash. The person collecting does not have to show a government ID or any party affiliation proof, nor does he have to sign the outside of the envelope as you will see further along in the summary. Vote harvesting also allows for voter intimidation and illegal electioneering away from the watchful eyes of election officials. t/ Tweet from @AlexPadilla4CA .@SpeakerRyan, in California we make sure every ballot is properly counted and accounted for. That's not \"bizarre,\" that's DEMOCRACY.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1068185072015155200 That means that any Tom, Dick, Harry or Sally can return a ballot instead of a relative or someone living in the house who the voter knows, and the following law allows for there to be no chain of title of the ballot once it leaves the alleged voter's hand per 301 l(c). \"[A] ballot shall not be disqualified solely because the person authorized to return it did not provide on the identification envelope his or her name, relationship to the voter, or signature. (This explicitly allows for ballot/election fraud. Additionally, in California, it is not known how many fictitious and duplicate voters exist. Because an identification is not required to register to vote.) The following are the statutes that were changed (Changed section in bold face.): . THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS: SECTION 1. Section 3011 of the Elections Code is amended to read: 3011. (a) The identification envelope shall contain all of the following: (1) A declaration, under penalty of perjury, stating that the voter resides within the precinct in which he or she is voting and is the person whose name appears on the envelope. (2) The signature of the voter. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 35 of 91 (3) The residence address of the voter as shown on the affidavit of registration. ( 4) The date of signing. (5) A notice that the envelope contains an official ballot and is to be opened only by the canvassing board. ( 6) A warning plainly stamped or printed on it that voting twice constitutes a crime. (7) A warning plainly stamped or printed on it that the voter must sign the envelope in his or her own handwriting in order for the ballot to be counted. (8) A statement that the voter has neither applied, nor intends to apply, for a vote by mail voter's ballot from any other jurisdiction for the same election. (9) The name of the person authorized by the voter to return the vote by mail ballot pursuant to Section 3017. (10) The relationship to the voter of the person authorized to return the vote by mail ballot. ( 11) The signature of the person authorized to return the vote by mail ballot. (b) Except at a primary election for partisan office, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the vote by mail voter's party preference may not be stamped or printed on the identification envelope. (Vote harvesters know the party preference before they go to a residence.) (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (9) to (11), inclusive, of subdivision (a), a ballot shall not be disqualified solely because the person authorized to return it did not provide on the identification envelope his or her name, relationship to the voter, or signature. SEC. 2. Section 3017 of the Elections Code is amended to read: 3017. (a) (1) All vote by mail ballots cast under this division shall be voted on or before the day of the election. After marking the ballot, the vote by mail voter shall do any of the following: (A) Return the ballot by mail or in person to the elections official who issued the ballot. (B) Return the ballot in person to a member of a precinct board at a polling place or vote center within the state. (C) Return the ballot to a vote by mail ballot drop-off location within the state that is provided pursuant to Section 3025 or 4005. (2) A vote by mail voter who is unable to return the ballot may designate another person to return the ballot to the elections official who issued the ballot, to the precinct board at a polling place or vote center within the state, or to a vote by mail ballot dropoff location within the state that is provided pursuant to Section 3025 or 4005. The person designated shall return the ballot in person, or put the ballot in the mail, no later than three days after receiving it from the voter or before the close of the polls on election day, whichever time period is shorter. Notwithstanding subdivision (d), a ballot shall not be disqualified from being counted solely because it was returned or mailed more than three days after the designated person received it from the voter, provided that the ballot is returned by the designated person before the close of polls on election day. (3) The ballot must be received by the elections official who issued the ballot, the precinct board, or the vote by mail ballot drop-off location before the close of the polls on election day. If a vote by mail ballot is returned to a precinct board at a polling place or vote center, or to a vote by mail ballot drop-off location, that is located in a county that is not the county of the elections official who issued the ballot, the elections official for the county in which the vote by Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 36 of 91 mail ballot is returned shall forward the ballot to the elections official who issued the ballot no later than eight days after receipt. (b) The elections official shall establish procedures to ensure the secrecy of a ballot returned to a polling place and the security, confidentiality, and integrity of any personal information collected, stored, or otherwise used pursuant to this section. (c) On or before March 1, 2008, the elections official shall establish procedures to track and confirm the receipt of voted vote by mail ballots and to make this information available by means of online access using the county's elections division Internet Web site. If the county does not have an elections division Internet Web site, the elections official shall establish a toll\u00ad free telephone number that may be used to confirm the date a voted vote by mail ballot was received. (d) The provisions of this section are mandatory, not directory, and a ballot shall not be counted if it is not delivered in compliance with this section. ( e) ( 1) A person designated to return a vote by mail ballot shall not receive any form of compensation based on the number of ballots that the person returns and an individual, group, or organization shall not provide compensation on this basis. (2) For purposes of this paragraph, \"compensation\" means any form of monetary payment, goods, services, benefits, promises or offers of employment, or any other form of consideration offered to another person in exchange for returning another voter's vote by mail ballot. (3) A person in charge of a vote by mail ballot and who knowingly and willingly engages in criminal acts related to that ballot as described in Division 18 (commencing with Section 18000), including, but not limited to, fraud, bribery, intimidation, and tampering with or failing to deliver the ballot in a timely fashion, is subject to the appropriate punishment specified in that division. By having a \"party official\" intrude upon a person's privacy within their home to take their private ballot, is reminiscent of the same practice engaged in by dictators around the world. With no election officials around, there is nothing to stop voter intimidation within the person's home voting booth. CALIFORNIA ST ATE LAW CONFLICTS The following are some codes that the new \"harvesting law\" breaks: UNDER VOTE HARVESTING A PERSON'S HOME BECOMES A VOTING BOOTH AND THUS FRAUGHT WITH THE POTENTIAL OF BREAKING ELECTIONEERING STATUTE The new law will also increase the number of invasions by party agents into a person's home which is also his voting booth on election day by party agents, which also increases the chances for electioneering out of the watchful eye of sworn election officials in EC 183 71 . ARTICLE 7. Electioneering [18370 -18371] (Article 7 enacted by Stats. 1994, Ch. 920, Sec. 2.) Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 37 of 91 18371. (a) No candidate or representative of a candidate, and no proponent, opponent, or representative of a proponent or opponent, of an initiative, referendum, or recall measure, or of a charter amendment, shall solicit the vote of a vote by mail voter, or do any electioneering, while in the residence or in the immediate presence of the voter, and during the time he or she knows the vote by mail voter is voting. (b) Any person who knowingly violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor. ( c) This section shall not be construed to conflict with any provision of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, nor to preclude electioneering by mail or telephone or in public places, except as prohibited by Section 18370, or by any other provision oflaw. (Amended by Stats. 2007, Ch. 508, Sec. 113. Effective January 1, 2008.) ARTICLE 7. Electioneering [18370 -18371] (Article 7 enacted by Stats. 1994, Ch. 920, Sec. 2.) 18370. No person, on election day, or at any time that a voter may be casting a ballot, shall, within 100 feet of a polling place, a satellite location under Section 3018, or an elections official's office: (a) Circulate an initiative, referendum, recall, or nomination petition or any other petition. \u00b7 (b) Solicit a vote or speak to a voter on the subject of marking his or her ballot. (c) Place a sign relating to voters' qualifications or speak to a voter on the subject of his or her qualifications except as provided in Section 14240. (d) Do any electioneering as defined by Section 319.5. As used in this section, \"100 feet of a polling place, a satellite location under Section 3018, or an elections official's office\" means a distance 100 feet from the room or rooms in which voters are signing the roster and casting ballots. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor. (Amended by Stats. 2009, Ch. 146, Sec. 2. (AB 1337) Effective January 1, 2010.) Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 38 of 91 Also, by allowing party officials into the private home ballot booth of the voter out of the watchful eye of election officials, there is more of a chance that voter intimidation will occur which is a violation of EC 18540. CHAPTER 6. Corruption of the Voting Process [18500 -18578] (Chapter 6 enacted by Stats. 1994, Ch. 920, Sec. 2. ) ARTICLE 3. Intimidation of Voters [18540 -18548] (Article 3 enacted by Stats. 1994, Ch. 920, Sec.2.) 18540. (a) Every person who makes use of or threatens to make use of any force, violence, or tactic of coercion or intimidation, to induce or compel any other person to vote or refrain from voting at any election or to vote or refrain from voting for any particular person or measure at any election, or because any person voted or refrained from voting at any election or voted or refrained from voting for any particular person or measure at any election is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 of the Penal Code for 16 months or two or three years. (b) Every person who hires or arranges for any other person to make use of or threaten to make use of any force, violence, or tactic of coercion or intimidation, to induce or compel any other person to vote or refrain from voting at any election or to vote or refrain from voting for any particular person or measure at any election, or because any person voted or refrained from voting at any election or voted or refrained from voting for any particular person or measure at any election is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 of the Penal Code for 16 months or two or three years. (Amended by Stats. 2011, Ch. 15, Sec. 77. (AB 109) Effective April 4, 2011. Operative October 1, 2011, by Sec. 636 of Ch. 15, as amended by Stats. 2011, Ch. 39, Sec. 68.) ARTICLE 3. Intimidation of Voters [18540 -18548] (Article 3 enacted by Stats. 1994, Ch. 920,Sec.2.) 18541. (a) No person shall, with the intent of dissuading another person from voting, within 100 feet of a polling place, do any of the following: (1) Solicit a vote or speak to a voter on the subject of marking his or her ballot. (2) Place a sign relating to voters' qualifications or speak to a voter on the subject of his or her qualifications except as provided in Section 14240. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 39 of 91 (3) Photograph, video record, or otherwise record a voter entering or exiting a polling place. (b) Any violation of this section is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 12 months, or in the state prison. Any person who conspires to violate this section is guilty of a felony. (c) For purposes of this section, 100 feet means a distance of 100 feet from the room or rooms in which voters are signing the roster and casting ballots. (Amended by Stats. 2009, Ch. 88, Sec. 33. (AB 176) Effective January 1, 2010.) Consequently, the potential for voter intimation and lack of private voting appears to be a potential violation of the Voter's Bill of Rights, EC 2300. ( 4) You have the right to cast a secret ballot free from intimidation. The new laws also break the following law because the vote harvester is not a voter and not authorized by the precinct board to keep order or enforce the law, so is not allowed by EC 14221 to be within the voting booth which is the person's private home; ARTICLE 2. Election Day Procedures [14210 -14227.5] ( Article 2 enacted by Stats. 1994, Ch. 920, Sec. 2. ) 14221. Only voters engaged in receiving, preparing, or depositing their ballots and persons authorized by the precinct board to keep order and enforce the law may be permitted to be within the voting booth area before the closing of the polls. A person's home is there polling place, thus the party operative vote harvester would be within the voting booth area and the harvester is neither a voter actively voting, nor are they a member of the precinct board there in the home to keep order and enforce the law. This law like it says to 'keep order' however it is also to prevent voter intimidation or last minute influence which could possibly be not made in good faith, and grant privacy to the voter.

Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 40 of 91 There is nothing to guarantee or protect a voter within his home from a party official/member from intimidating the voter or from changing the markings on the ballot or throwing their ballot in the trash. The voter is left with no proof that he voted or how he voted because his ballot is being handled by an unknown political operative and there is no chain of title. Thus, it is completely ridiculous for the SOS to state that vote harvesting makes sure that all votes are counted - the converse is true. DIVISION 14.

If a marking or punching device is used, the voter shall be instructed to use only that device. The voter shall also be instructed how to fold the ballot and place it in the envelope. If any voter, after entering the booth, asks for information regarding the operation of the machine or device, the precinct board shall give him or her the information. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 41 of 91 This law shows that the state, of California intends to give the voter privacy while voting in the voter booth. DIVISION 14.

That KAMALA DEVI HARRIS birth certificate (see Exhibit D) shows she was born to foreign parents with temporary residence, who based upon information and belief were duly married Jamaican non-immigrant students present in the California USA only on a non-immigrant student visas, during which time both parents lived in Stanford University student housing and who did not have a business per se; and 11. As such KAMALA DEVI HARRIS was born a Jamaican Citizen according to the Jamaican Constitution <3> and remains under Jamaican Jurisdiction notwithstanding the intent of the 14th Amendment is defined under the 8 U.S.C. \u00a71101 (a) (15) (F) statutory requirements for her parents as non-immigrants with U.S. Student Visa status <4>_ 3 https://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Jamaica/jam62.html 4 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101-U.S. Code -Unannotated Title 8. Aliens and Nationality\u00a7 1101. Definitions (a) As used in this chapter--(15) The term \"immigrant\" means every alien except an alien who is within one of the following classes of nonimmigrant aliens--(F) (i) an alien having a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning. who is a bona fide student qualified to pursue a full course o(study and who seeks to enter the United States temporari/v and solely for the purpose of pursuing such a course of study consistent with section J J 84m of this title at an established college. university. seminary, conservatory. academic high school. elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program in the 5 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 58 of 91 12. Further, and at best arguendo, under the 14th Amendment that remains to be adjudicated U.S. Senator KAMALA DEVI HARRIS may be adjudged an \"Anchor Baby\" or a \"Birth Right Citizen\" as a matter of dual allegiance with limited provision of Federal jurisdiction over the birth in California when both non U.S. Citizen parents were using non-immigrant foreign student visas to study in California in that the mother is from India and the father is from Jamaica as her Alameda County Birth Certificate shows in Exhibit D, and her Jamaican student father at her birth in California is under The Jamaica Constitution Order in Council 1962 made on 23rd July 1962 when laid before Parliament 24th July 1962 coming into Operation-Section 3(2) of the Order in Council, and sections 80, 81, 94 (1) and (2), 103, 104, 111, 124 and 125 (in part) of the Constitution on the 25th July 1962 with the remainder immediately before the 6th August 1962 at the Court at Buckingham Palace, the 23rd day of July, 1962 Present, THE QUEEN'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY IN COUNCIL Her Majesty, by virtue and in exercise of the powers in that behalf by subsection (1) of section 5 of the West Indies Act, 1962 or otherwise in Her vested, is pleased, by and with the advice of Her Privy Council 1962 Jamaican Constitution designates that KAMALA DEVI HARRIS is a Jamaican Citizen under CHAPTER II CITl'?ENSHIP Section 3. Persons who become Jamaican citizens on 6th August 1962. subsection 3C -Every person born outside Jamaica shall become a citizen of Jamaica -clause (b) on the date of his birth, in the case of a person born on or after the sixth day of August. 1962. if. at that date. his father or mother is a citizen of Jamaica by birth. descent or registration by virtue of marriage to a citizen of Jamaica; I United States, particularly designated by him and approved by the Attorney General after consultation with the Secretary of Education, which institution or place of study shall have agreed to report to the Attorney General the termination of attendance of each nonimmigrant student, and if any such institution of learning or place of study fails to make reports promptly the approval shall be withdrawn, (ii) the alien spouse and minor children of any alien described in clause (i) if accompanying or following to join such an alien, and (iii) an alien who is a national of Canada or Mexico, who maintains actual residence and place of abode in the country of nationality, who is described in clause (i) except that the alien's qualifications for and actual course of study may be full or part-time, and who commutes to th~ United States institution or place of study from Canada or Mexico; 6 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 59 of 91 13. That KAMALA DEVI HARRIS' father DONALD JASPER HARRIS status is as follows: Donald Jasper Harris: ~~~:-~~g_.}_~, 1938, And as for the non-immigrant student Mother from India who married the non-immigrat student Jamaican Father: Citizenship at the \u00b7 commencement of th~ (:on$titution. PART II CITIZENSHIP S. At the commencement of this Constitution, every person \\Vho has his domicile in the territory of India and- (a) who was born in the territory of India;\u00b7 or (l>) either of whose parents was born in the territory of India; or (c) who has been ordinarily resident in the territory of India for not less than five years immediately preceding such commencement, shall be a citizen of India. 15. Jamaica as with India and Canada remain part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and as such arguendo, KAMALA DEVI HARRIS as well as her divorced parents remain defacto subjects of Queen Elizabeth II who serves as the Head of the British Commonwealth. 16. Further as applies herein, KAMALA DEVI HARRIS' parents divorced when she was seven, and when she was twelve, as subjects of the Commonwealth Queen, Harris and her sister moved with their mother Shyamala to Montreal, Quebec, Cana~ where Shyamala had accepted a research and teaching position at Jesuit McGill University-affiliated Jewish General Hospital; and 7 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 60 of 91 17. Further, KAMALA DEVI HARRIS attended a Jesuit associated French-speaking middle school, Notre-Dame-des-Neiges, and then Westmount High School in Westmount. Quebec, graduating in 1981. 18. Arguendo, KAMALA DEVI HARRIS never renounced her Jamaican citizenship like Ted Cruz did in regards to Canada when he decided to run for POTUS in 2016; and 19. As such, Defendant's use of the BORN A CITIZEN term that was used before 2008 until now is intentional harmful disinformation that Claimant sues the Defendant for as it unjustly causes Claimants loss of opportunity costs, and now in 2020 is being done all over again for KAMALA DEVI HARRIS who is a fraudulent candidate on the ballot must be removed and or a warning to unsuspecting voters that she is a foreigner interfering with the 2020 New York Election; and 20. Claimant has even more concrete evidentiary proof than for the CIA's POTUS Usurper Barack Hussein Obama Claimant had for judicial use from 2008 through 2016, the Usurper still remains ineligible to be the President of the United States Trustee I Administrator over any United States Departments with fiduciary responsibilities the Usurper is not entitled to the emoluments of office must be clawed back as the Usurper who denied use of Claimant's power of Attorney on January 23, 2009 the Usurper continued as a proven Indonesian and whose every action is void ab initio. 21. Nonetheless as an outlaw entity conducted an act of treason, The 2020 Democratic National Convention (DNC) held a presidential nominating convention from August 17 to 20, 2020, at the Wisconsin Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and virtually across the United States. 22. The DNC nominated JOSEPH ROBINETTE BIDEN JR. their POTUS candidate and KAMALA DEVI HARRIS their VPOTUS candidate, who after 20 August 2020 were certified by NANCY PELOSI are U.S. Constitution Article 2 Section 1 Clause 5 eligible for the New York ballot. 23. That Claimant from 2008 through 2014 sought relief and exhausted his remedies to no avail; however in the process provided the State ofNew York etal full and complete notice regarding the misrepresentation using BORN A CITIZEN for those running for POTUS I VPOTUS. 8 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 61 of 91 ' \" 24. Jn my ballot access challenge in the trial court at an IAS Term, Part 27 of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, before Justice Arthur M. Schack held in and for the County of Kings, at the Courthouse, at Civic Center, Brooklyn, New York, on the 11th day of April 2012 for Index No: 6500-2011 decision and order that STRUNK in the matter of Natural Born Citizen and associated conspiracy to be baseless claims about defendants which are fanciful, fantastic, delusional and irrational; and 25. Further, on 4 March 2014 the New York State Supreme Court Appellate Division for the Second Department Judicial panel sitting in review of Appellant's Amicus motion in Appeal Cases 2012- 05515, 2013-06335 and 2014-00297 from orders in the trial court for Index No: 6500-2011, to my demand that it provide ''for civilian due process of law\" rather than the continued martial due process of law under statutory direct authority of the POTUS Commander-in-chief over the de facto Federal and New York State Unified Court System courts under statutory authority of 12 USC \u00a795 and 50 USC App. \u00a75(b) ORDERED to deny \"for civilian due process oflaw\"; and 26. Further, Strunk has been outrageously branded a delusional frivolous BIRTHER by orders in the trial court for Index No: 6500-2011 with the largest fines ever imposed in New York history in excess of $177 ,000 and as a full citizen, has been denied free access to the state courts due process without permission; and 27. Further, Strunk has been denied NBC adjudication in any court that now further emboldens the traitorous CIA and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to enlist U.S. Senator KAMALA DEVI HARRIS born in Oakland California on October 20, 1964 to be Democratic National Committee (DNC) Vice Presidential candidate along with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) I DNC sinecure Presidential candidate JOSEPH R. BIDEN whose treachery together with Governor Andrew Cuomo and too many to be named herein is an act of treason with aiding and abetting foreign tortuous interference with our election to say the least; and Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 62 of 91i ' ~. /-'..,. 28. That as applies to absentee voting as notice in Exhibit A for November 3, 2020 the State Board of Elections has published instructions for obtaining absentee ballots that currently apply even under the questionable Virus lockdown imposed by Governor Andrew Cuomo( see Exhibit E); and 29. That on or about July 22, 2020 Claimant contacted the Warren County Board of Elections where Strunk-Trustee spoke with the Democratic Party Warren County Board of Elections Commissioner Kimberly Ross to ascertain if masks are mandatory for voting at the 3 November 2020 General Election; to wit she stated that masks are voluntary and if not worn a mask or plastic visor will be offered to wear while voting in person, and if rejected the Voter may use a machine properly spaced from other voters; and 30. Further, if a qualified voter is ill or disabled, under election law /state constitution may request an absentee ballot be mailed for return to the County, and the so-called vote by mail proposal shown to be outside the New York law must be stopped or modified to prevent fraud and represents an irreparable harm worthy of action by this Court with time as the essence; and 31.

First, I apologize for the frantic nature of my 9/18/2020 filing shown at Docket Item 41: 09/18/2020 41 MOTION to Restore to the Court Calendar for Preliminary Injunction and Restraint Relief Available filed by Christopher Earl Strunk. (Attachments: # l Motion, # 2. Letter, # J Proposed Order/Judgment, # 1 Certificate of Service,#~ Envelope) Motions referred to Daniel J. Stewart. Gel.) (Entered: 09/18/2020) 2. However, I contend that my motion to restore was done in good faith, and as such this is my urgent motion to reconsider the Court's 9-21-2020 denial of Plaintiffs motion to restore the case to the court calendar for the e:xpressed cause for relief despite Docket Item #42: 09/21/2020 42 TEXT ORDER: The Court has reviewed Plaintiffs \"Motion to Restore to the Court Calendar for Preliminary Injunction and Restraint Relief Available.\" 41 This case was closed and Judgment entered in favor of Defendants on May 19, 2017. 39 Plaintiff has identified no basis under Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for relief from that Judgment. Accordingly, Plaintiffs motion 41 is DENIED. SO ORDERED by Judge Brenda K. Sannes on 9/21/2020. (Copy served on pltf via 483-8 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 83 of 91 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7DJ( 3. The unchallenged basis for the 5-19-2017 Dismissal shown at Exhibit 1 was moot because the electors cast their vote on 19 December 2016 and DONALD J. TRUMP I MICHAEL PENCE are now POTUS/VPOTUS per se, and are so notwithstanding the facts of illegal voters and Vote Harvesting in California that was an unproven allegation; 4. However now is not moot as such now, is even more urgent than for the 2016 election gravamen, now is fundamental to our Constitutional system in the 2020 general election based upon my recent discovery that meets the purpose of FRCP Rule 60 (b)(2) and the Rule 60 (b) (6) exception per se, because there is newly discovered evidence that with reasonable diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b) as the then Attorney General of California KAMALA DEVI HARRIS is not a U.S. Citizen per se and that THE ST ATE OF CALIFORNIA etal Defendants were not properly represented in good faith by Tamar Pachter who if he had not done reasonable diligence on his boss the Attorney General became a accessory to a spoliation cover-up at the California Department of Justice 455 Gold Gate Avenue, Suite 11000 San Francisco, CA 94102 415-703-5500 Fax: 415-703-1234 Email: tamar.pachter@doj.ca.gov; and 5. Further, there is presently one (1) Elector of the 55 electors of the California electoral college part of the total 535 Federal electors that is challenged as Harris' place in Congress is void ab initio at the 14 December 2020 election per se reduces the total Federal electors to 534; and 6. Further, because the defacto U.S. SENATOR KAMALA DEVI HARRIS purportedly represents California in Congress starting on January 3, 2017 after the 2016 General Election she is not a U.S. Citizen per se according to the requirements of the U.S. Constitution 2 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 84 of 91,. /-.. '' / 1,:\u00b7 ' Article I, Section 3, that sets three qualifications for senators: (1) they must be at least 30 years old; (2) they must have been citizens of the United States for the past nine years or longer; and (3) they must be inhabitants of the states they seek to represent at the time of their election; and 7. Further, at the time of the 2016 General Election Kamala Harris was the Attorney General of California who was also on the ballot as the 2016 Democratic Party's Candidate for U.S. Senator from California who won the election; however, as such was not a party to this case in 2016 because she was not an elector that coincided with an elector appointed for the 19 December 2016 election per se, now applies on 14 December 2020 based upon the evidence. 8. Therefore, NOW COMES Christopher Earl Strunk, Individually of New York, in propria persona, with time of the essence with imminent irreparable harm, likelihood of success, no other adequate remedy at law, to avoid unrest, hereby moves the Court to restore the dismissed Complaint shown in Exhibit 1 with docket shown as Exhibit 2 of Defendants' malicious infringement of Plaintiffs fundamental rights protected under the Constitution for the United States by the State of State of New York's Public Officers malicious administration and enforcement of the New York Election Law (NYEL) and related law to resolve the Vacancy Committee duties for the BIDEN-HARRIS electors and or of every state including the State of California's Public Officers with others similarly situated with the Democratic Party National Committee (DNC), in that KAMALA (IYER) DEVI HARRIS is not a Natural-Born Citizen (NBC) per se required by the U.S. Constitution Article 2 Section 1 Clause 5 or even a Born-a-Citizen isn't even a DACA baby that as a matter of law is an 3 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 85 of 91 illegal alien to be removed from the USA but first from the US Senate, and as such plaintiff contends there is a conspiracy of New York State Public Officers much more than the foregoing who outrageously effect the State of California's Public Officers with others similarly situated jointly with the DNC who intend to use legal absentee ballots and unconstitutional illegal mail-in-votes using the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) now under the constitutionally questionable \"COVID-19 Virus\" lockdown that arbitrarily and capriciously varies on a state by state basis the 2020 General Election, and that according to the 14 September 2020 Federal Court Opinion in THE COUNTY OF BUTLER etal. versus THOMAS W.

Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 see https://supreme .justia.com/cases/federal/us/197 /11/); and 9. If this weren't enough of a quagmire threat by a multitude of arbitrary and capricious set of State Executive orders operating differently on a state by state basis for each lockdown that absolutely effects the 3 November 2020 General Election and the early voting that starts on 19 October 2020 here in New York, is absolute evidence that the Jamaican Citizen illegal alien US Senator KAMALA DEVI HARRIS (shown in Exhibit 4D) is an additional real threat of tortuous foreign interference with elections beyond other face less illegal alien voters at the 3 November 2020 General Election involving the California 55 electors now reduced to 54 and effecting the New York 29 electors slate etal. for certification of the elector vote on or about 14 December 2020 for election of President of the United States (POTUS) and Vice POTUS (VPOTUS) with United States Code (USC) Title 3 under color of 4 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 483-8 Filed on 10/06/20 in TXSD Page 86 of 91 California Election Code (CAEC) and New York Election Law (NYEL) etal. to the contrary; and Plaintiff(s) among those similarly situated with natural and fundamental rights otherwise protected against infringement by Sections l, 2, 3, 4, 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America. with related law and available remedy, a case of first impression to reduce the basis of California and New York POTUS I VPOTUS Electors at the 14 December 2020 electoral college election and the 2020 decennial census. 10.

In 2012 and again in 2014, unilateral executive action by the Obama Administration created far-reaching, class-based \"deferred action\" programs to grant to millions of unlawfully present aliens the legal classification of \"lawful presence\" in this country and numerous attendant benefits\u2014without congressional authorization. 2. In a decision affirmed by the divided Supreme Court, the Fifth Circuit upheld this Court's preliminary injunction of the 2014 executive action that created \"DAPA\" and \"Expanded DACA.\" The Fifth Circuit held this executive action invalid as lacking notice-and-comment procedure and, in any event, contrary to federal law. As the Fifth Circuit noted, the Executive's cl aim of authority to create these programs \"would allow [the Executive] to grant lawful presence and work authorization to any illegal alien in the United States\u2014an untenable position in light of the INA's intricate system of immigration classifica tions and employment eligibility.\" Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 184 (5th Cir. 2015) (emphasis added), aff'd by an equally divided Court , 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (per curiam). 3. In June 2017, after the Supreme Co urt's ruling, the Executive Branch rescinded prospectively its 2014 executive ac tion creating DAPA and Expanded DACA. 4. Later that month, Texas and other Plaintiffs proposed to resolve the then-pending litigation if the Executive Branch also rescinded prospectively its 2012 executive action creating \"D ACA.\" Otherwise, Plaintiffs wrote, they would amend their complaint in that pending litigation to challenge DACA on the same bases that they challenged DAPA and Expanded DACA. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 2 of 1373 5. On the September 2017 deadline for accepting Plaintiffs' proposal, the Executive Branch issued a memorandum re scinding DACA by directing that DACA permits would not be issued or renewe d starting March 5, 2018. Accordingly, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their th en-pending litigation in this Court. 6. Yet DACA is still in force and will re main in force for the indefinite future. In January 2018, a California district court issued a preliminary injunction of the Executive's 2017 decision to rescind DACA, allowing several challenges to that 2017 executive action to proceed. 7. In another challenge in the District of Columbia, the district court on April 24, 2018, vacated the Executive's de cision to rescind DACA, granted summary judgment that the executive action was substantively unlawful under the APA, and ordered the Executive to continue issuing new DACA applications, staying that order a mere 90 days. NAACP v. Trump , No. 1:17-cv-1907, 2018 WL 1920079, at *1, *28 (D.D.C. Apr. 24, 2018). 8. Plaintiffs abided DACA while the controlling legal issues were decided in the prior litigation and while the Exec utive reweighed DACA's legality. But the recent injunctions of the 2017 executive action undermine Plaintiffs' express basis for dismissing their prior litigation\u2014and means that Plaintiffs will suffer ongoing harm from DACA for the indefinite future. 9. Plaintiffs thus bring this lawsuit challenging the 2012 executive action creating DACA in the first place. This lawsui t does not call on this Court to resolve any of the challenges pending in Califor nia or elsewhere about the validity of Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 3 of 1374 executive action in 2017. Rather, this la wsuit challenges whether the 2012 executive action unilaterally creating DACA was itself lawful. 10. This lawsuit also does not challenge the Executive Branch's ability to prioritize removal resources. It does not seek an injunction requiring the Executive to remove any alien from the country. As the Fifth Circuit has noted, those matters are distinct from programs like that he re, which grant lawful-presence status. 11. This lawsuit is emphatically about the rule of law. The policy merits of immigration laws are debated in and decided by Congress. The Executive Branch does not exercise a lawmaking role. Its duty is to take care that the law is faithfully executed\u2014substantive immigration law and procedural administrative law alike. 12. Under the Fifth Circuit's controlling precedent, DACA is unlawful for the same reasons as DAPA and Expanded DACA were unlawful. See Texas , 809 F.3d 134. This lawsuit seeks declaratory an d injunctive relief to that effect. 13. Indeed, Plaintiffs' challenge to the Obama Administration's class-based deferred-action programs has only become stronger since the prior suit challenging DAPA and Expanded DACA. Each memora ndum creating DACA, Expanded confers . path way to citizenship.\" See infra \u00b6\u00b6 84, 151. But, as of August 21, 2017, as many as 39,514 aliens had used their DACA status to obtain a pathway to ci tizenship, through the conferral of lawful- permanent-resident status (commonly known as \"LPR\" or \"green card\" status), and Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 4 of 1375 approximately 1,056 alien DACA recipients with LPR status had obtained United States citizenship.1 14. If ever there were a violation of the President's duty to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully execut ed,\" U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 3, this is it. The Executive unilaterally conferred lawful presence and work authorization on otherwise unlawfully present aliens, and then the Executive used that lawful-presence \"dispensation\" to unilaterally confer United States citizenship. Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 435 (2012) (Scalia , J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). 15. The Attorney General of the United States has announced that DACA suffers from the same legal defects as DAPA and that, if DACA were challenged, \"the likeliest outcome is that it would be enjoined just as was DAPA.\"2 16. That is precisely what the Court should do here. This Court has authority to immediately rescind and cancel all DACA permits currently in existence because they are unlawful. However, Plainti ffs are amenable to a remedy that enjoins Defendants from issuing or renewing DACA permits in the future, effectively phasing out the program within two years. 1 See Press Release, Office of Sen.

Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 5 of 1376 JURISDICTION AND VENUE 17. The Court has federal-question ju risdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 because this action arises under the U. S. Constitution, art. II, \u00a7 3, and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S. C. \u00a7 706. The Court also has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2) because this is a civil action or claim against the United States. Finally, the Court has jurisdiction to compel an officer or employee of the above-named federal agencies to perform his or her duty under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. 18. Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e) because the State of Texas is a resident of this judicial district, and a substantia l part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs ' claims occurred in this District. 19. This Court is authorized to award the requested declaratory and injunctive relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201-2202; the U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. THE PARTIES 20. Plaintiffs are the States of Texa s, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, and West Virginia. 21. The Plaintiff States have interests th at fall within the zone of interests of federal statutes on immigration policy. \"The pervasiveness of federal regulation does not diminish the importance of immigrat ion policy to the States,\" which \"bear[ ] many of the consequences of unlawful immigration.\" Arizona , 567 U.S. at 397. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 6 of 1377 22. Defendant United States of Am erica is sued under the APA. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703 (\"[T]he action for judicial review may be brought against the United States . . . .\"). 23. Defendant Kirstjen M. Nielsen is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"). Defendant Nielsen and DHS are responsible for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\"), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"). Defendant Nielsen also is responsible for the continued administration of DACA and Expanded DACA. 24. Defendant Kevin K. McAleenan is the Commissioner of CBP. Defendant McAleenan shares responsibility for th e administration of DACA and Expanded DACA. 25. Defendant Thomas D. Homan is th e Deputy Director and Acting Director for ICE. ICE administers a formal program for allowing unlawfully present aliens to apply for deferred action and to appeal for reconsideration if deferred action is denied. 26. Defendant L. Francis Cissna is the Director of USCIS. Cissna and USCIS administer the DACA program. USCIS is the principal agency responsible for the continued administration of DACA and Expanded DACA. 27. Defendant Carla L. Provost is Acting Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol. Provost and the U.S. Border Patrol are re sponsible for enforcing immigration laws and the detection, interdiction and appr ehension of those who attempt to illegally Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 7 of 1378 enter or smuggle people or contraband across U.S. borders between official ports of entry. FACTUAL BACKGROUND I. Congress Created an Extensive Statutory Framework in the Area of Immigration, and Congress Has Not Given the Executive Unilateral Power to Confer Lawful Presence and Work Authorization on Unlawfully Present Aliens Simply Because the Executive Chooses Not to Remove Them. 28. \"Policies pertaining to the entry of aliens and their right to remain here are . . . entrusted exclusively to Congress.\" Arizona , 567 U.S. at 409 (alteration in original) (quoting Galvan v. Press , 347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954)). 29. Congress has accordingly enacted \"extensive and complex\" statutes governing \"immigration and alien status.\" Id. at 395. 30. Title 8 of the United States Code, dealing with immigration, functions as a \"single integrated and all-embracing sy stem\" governing the presence of aliens in the country. Id. at 400 (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz , 312 U.S. 52, 74 (1941)). 31. Through the Immigration and Nationa lity Act (\"INA\"), of aliens\" who may be admitted into and lawfully present in the country as well as the consequences for unlawful presence. Arizona , 567 U.S. at 395. 32. Congress has enacted complex provisions detailing how over forty different classes of immigrants, nonimmigran ts, refugees, and other aliens can attain lawful presence in the country. See Texas , 809 F.3d at 179. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 8 of 1379 33. Moreover, under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (\"IRCA\"), Congress created \"a comprehen sive framework for 'combating the employment of illegal aliens.'\" Arizona , 567 U.S. at 404 (quoting Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB , 535 U.S. 137, 147 (2002)). 34. Congress reinforced immigration laws with the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\") and the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Re conciliation Act of 1996 (\"PRWORA\"), responding to the States' concerns about the effects of exte nding benefits to unlawfully present aliens. E.g., 142 Cong. Rec. 26,680 (1996) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (\"With this immigration bill, we have the o pportunity to lift this financial burden off the States by forcing the Federal Government to take responsibility for reducing illegal immigration . . . .\"). 35. Congress never gave the Executive Branch carte blanche to sidestep these statutes and unilaterally permit unlawfully present aliens to be lawfully present or obtain attendant benefits and work authorization simply because the Executive chooses not to remove them. 36. Lawful presence is an immigration classification created by Congress. 37. Unlawful presence is an immigration classification created by Congress. 38. The classification of lawful presen ce is a necessary prerequisite for aliens to be eligible for Social Security. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1611(b)(2). 39. The classification of lawful presen ce is a necessary prerequisite for aliens to be eligible for Medicare. See id. \u00a7 1611(b)(3). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 9 of 13710 40. The classification of lawful presen ce is a necessary prerequisite for aliens to be eligible for a retirement benefit in PRWORA. See id. \u00a7 1611(b)(4). 41. The classification of unlawful presence makes time spent in that status count towards a reentry ban un IIRIRA , subject to statutory exception. See id. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i) (3-year reentr y ban for aliens \"unlawfully present in the United States for a period of more than 180 days but less than 1 year\"; 10-year reentry ban for aliens \"unlawfully present in the Un ited States for one year or more\"). 42. The classification of lawful presen ce is a necessary prerequisite for aliens to be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 32(c)(1)(A), (c)(1)(E), (m) (eligibility based on an indi vidual having a valid Social Security number). II. Congress Has Declined to Pass the DREAM Act. 43. On August 1, 2001, the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act was first introduced in Congress. See S. 1291, 107th Cong. (2001). 44. The DREAM Act has been introduced in some form in each Congress since then. See, e.g. , The proposed DREAM Act would have allowed unlawfully present aliens to apply for lawful presence through condit ional-permanent-resident status if, among Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 10 of 13711 other things, (1) they entered the United States before the age of 16, and (2) they had been in the United States continuously for five years. 46. Congress has repeatedly declined to enact the DREAM Act. 47. Features of the DREAM Act cl osely resemble DACA and DAPA. 48. The DREAM Act's coverage criteria ar e substantially similar to DACA's and Expanded DACA's coverage criteria, as DACA's and Expanded DACA's coverage criteria also require entry into the United States before the age of 16 and at least five years of continuous residence in the United States. 49. Former President Obama repeatedly urged Congress to pass the DREAM Act. 50. Former President Obama consistent ly asserted that he could not achieve the goals of the DREAM Act on hi s own through unilateral Executive action. He said, for instance: \"Comprehensive reform, that's how we'r e going to solve this problem. . . . Anybody who tells you . . . [that] I can wave a magic wand and make it happen hasn't been paying attention [to] how this town works.\" President Barack Obama, Remarks on Comprehensive Immigration Reform (May 5, 2010), https://obamawhitehouse.archiv es.gov/blog/2010/05/05/cinco-de- mayo-a-call-comprehensive-i mmigration-reform. \"I am president, I am not king.

In response to a question about whether he could stop deportation of unlawfully present students with an ex ecutive order: \"Well, first of all, temporary protective status histor ically has been used for special circumstances where you have immigran ts to this country who are fleeing persecution in their countries, or there is some emergency situation in their native land that required them to come to the United States. So it would not be appropriate to use that just for a particular group that came here primarily . . . for economic opportunity . With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that's just not the case, because there are laws on the b ooks that Congress has passed . . . .

Despite former President Obama's statements, Congress refused to pass the DREAM Act. III. The Obama Administration Unilaterally Created DACA, Which Confers Eligibility for Lawful Pres ence, Work Authorization, and a Host of Attendant Benefits. 52. On June 15, 2012, former Presiden t Obama's Secretary of Homeland Security Napolitano announced the unilatera l creation of a program that has become known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\"). See Exhibit 1 . 53. This Department of Homeland Security memorandum creating DACA was issued without APA notice-and-comment procedure. 54. Through Secretary Napolitano's DACA memo, the Executive Branch ordered federal immigration officials to ma ke qualifying unlawfully present aliens eligible to receive \"deferred action\" status if they (1) entered the United States before the age of 16; (2) had been in the United St ates continuously for at least five years; (3) met certain educational standards or were veterans; (4) had not been convicted of a felony, a \"significant\" misdemeanor or \"m ultiple\" misdemeanors, or otherwise posed Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 14 of 13715 a threat to national security or public safe ty; and (5) were not above the age of thirty. Id. at 1. 55. DACA's \"deferred action\" terms last for 2 years. Id. at 2. 56. DACA's \"deferred action\" terms are renewable. Id. 57. DACA's criteria would cover appr oximately 1.7 million otherwise unlawfully present aliens. 58. As of September 30, 2017, DACA relief had been conferred on approximately 800,000 aliens. See USCIS, Number of Form I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , Fiscal Year 2012-2017, attached as Exhibit 2 (798,980 initial applications and 1, 002,810 renewal applications approved from 2012 through September 2017). 59. As of September 30, 2017, DACA relief had been conferred on approximately 125,000 aliens in Texas alone. See id. at 2 (125,239 initial applications and 128,812 renewal applications approved for Texas residents from 2012 through September 2017). 60. According to USCIS, deferred action under DACA \"may be terminated at any time, with or without a Notice of In tent to Terminate, at DHS's discretion.\" USCIS, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Toolkit 16, Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591 (S.D. Tex. 2015) 61. DACA's conferral of \"deferred action \" entails much more than the Executive simply choosing not to remove an alien with DACA. 62. The Executive Branch treats DACA's conferral of \"deferred action\" as Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 15 of 13716 also conferring lawful presence: \"An indivi dual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be present in the Unit ed States, and is therefore considered by DHS to be lawfully present during the pe riod deferred action is in effect.\" See, e.g. , Frequently Asked Questions , USCIS, https://www.uscis.gov /archive/frequently-asked- questions (last May Thus, \"while [a DACA recipient's] de ferred action is in effect and, for admissibility purposes, [the DACA recipient is ] considered to be lawfully present in the United States during that time.\" Id. This has been true since 2012. 64. The Executive's implementation of DACA as conferring lawful presence tracks the Executive's practice stated in the 2014 DAPA and Expanded DACA memorandum (the \"DAPA Memo\") issued by which stated: \"Deferred action . . . means that, for a specified period of time, an individual is permitted to be lawfully present in the United States.\" Exhibit 3 at 2. 65. The United States has also confir med in court that DACA \"approved deferred action status is lawful status th at affords a period of authorized stay.\" See United States' Brief as Amicus Curiae in Opposition to rehearing En Banc at 16, Ariz. Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer , 757 F.3d 1053 (9th Cir. 2014) (No. 13-16248), ECF No. 75 (internal quotation marks omitted). 66. DACA's conferral of lawful presence creates eligibility for a host of benefits. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 16 of 13717 67. DACA's conferral of lawful presence appears to eliminate predicates necessary under the INA to pursue proceedings to remove an alien from the United States. 68. An alien is removable if he is \"prese nt in the United States in violation of [federal law].\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). 69. An alien may also be removed if he cannot establish that he \"is lawfully present in the United States pu rsuant to a prior admission.\" Id. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(B). 70. DACA's conferral of lawful presence negates the removability charge that an alien is \"present in the United States in violation of [federal law].\" Id. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). 71. DACA's conferral of lawful presence negates the removability charge that an alien is present \"without being admitted or paroled,\" id. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), as the Executive maintains that an alien gran ted lawful presence is not considered \"present in the United States without being admitted or paroled,\" Pet. Br. at 9 n.3, Texas, 136 S. (No. 15-674), 2016 WL 72. DACA's conferral lawful presence means a DACA recipient satisfies the lawful-presence prerequisite for the alien to be eligible for Social Security. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1611(b)(2). 73. DACA's conferral of lawful presence means a DACA recipient satisfies the lawful-presence prerequisite for th e alien to be eligible for Medicare. See id. \u00a7 1611(b)(3). 74. DACA's conferral of lawful presence means a DACA recipient satisfies Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 17 of 13718 the lawful-presence prerequisite for the alien to be eligible for a retirement benefit in PRWORA. See id. \u00a7 1611(b)(4). 75. DACA's conferral of lawful presence means a DACA recipient is eligible for tolling of the IIRIRA reentry-ban clock th at accrues during periods of unlawful presence. See id. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B). 76. DACA's conferral of lawful presence also creates eligibility for various State benefits\u2014including a driver 's license in most States. 77. Additionally, the Executive Branch treats DACA's conferral of \"deferred action\" as conferring eligibility for \"work authorization.\" Exhibit 1 at 3. 78. The Executive has consistently told aliens that their DACA applications must be accompanied by applications fo r a Form I-765 app lication for work authorization. See Frequently Asked Questions , USCIS, https://www.uscis.gov/archive/frequently-asked -questions (last visited May 1, 2018). 79. Work authorization has been granted to the substantial majority of DACA recipients. 80. \"The United States concedes that '[a]n alien with work authorization may obtain a Social Security Number,' 'ac crue quarters of covered employment,' and 'correct wage records to add prior covered employment within approximately three years of the year in which the wages we re earned or in limited circumstances thereafter.'\" Texas , 809 F.3d at 149 (citation omitted). 81. DACA recipients are eligible for earn ed income tax credits once they received a Social Security number. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 18 of 13719 82. Some DACA recipients have received Earned Income Tax Credits. 83. The nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that, over a 10-year period, DAPA recipi ents could have received $1.7 billion in Earned Income Tax Credit payments alone. Press Release, Offi ce of Sen. Chuck Grassley, Senators Introduce Bill Disall owing Tax Credit Under 2014 Executive Actions (Mar. 10, 2015), https://www.g rassley.senate.gov/news/news- releases/senators-introduce-bill-disallo wing-tax-credit-under-2014-executive- actions. 84. The June 15, 2012 DACA memo stated that \"[t]his memorandum confers no . . . pathway to citizenship.\" Exhibit 1 at 3. 85. However, the Executive's implem entation of DACA has conferred United States citizenship and a pathway to citizenship on some DACA recipients. 86. The Executive has given some DACA recipients \"advance parole.\" 87. The \"advance parole\" granted to aliens because of their receipt of DACA has resulted in some of those aliens obta ining adjustment to LPR status, for which they would otherwise be ineligible. 88. LPR status is commonly referred to as possessing a \"green card.\" See supra \u00b6 13 & n.1. 89. LPR status provides a pathway to United States citizenship. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427(a). 90. By allowing advance parole, which satisfies a requisite for a green card under the Executive's practice, DACA allowed aliens to obtain citizenship when their Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 19 of 13720 unlawful entry into the United States wo uld otherwise foreclose this pathway to citizenship. 91. The \"advance parole\" granted to aliens because of their receipt of DACA has resulted in some of those aliens obtaining United States citizenship. 92. \"Advance parole\" is an Executive practi ce that allows aliens to leave the country and reenter. USCIS, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Toolkit, supra, 23-24; Letter from Le\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, Di r., USCIS, to Hon. Charles Grassley 3- 4 (Oct. 9, 2014), Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591 (No. 1:14-cv-254), , USCIS, https://www.uscis.gov /archive/frequently-asked- questions (last visited May 1, 2018). 93. The Executive has deemed DACA and Expanded DACA recipients who obtain \"advance parole\" from the Executive\u2014and then leave and reenter the United States\u2014as being lawfully \"admitted or parole d into the United States\" upon reentry. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). 94. Congressional statutes, however, ge nerally impose a reentry ban for aliens who were unlawfully present in the country for more than 180 days as an adult. See id. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i) (3-year reentry ban for aliens \"unlawfu lly present in the United States for a period of more than 180 days but less than 1 year\"; 10-year reentry ban for aliens \"unlawfully present in the United States for on e year or more\"); id. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(iii)(I) (unlawful presen ce before 18 is not counted). 95. Under DACA's criteria, an alien must have been in the United States for more than 180 days to possibly qualify for DACA. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 20 of 13721 96. Thus, Congress's reentry ban applies to all DACA recipients over 18.5 years of age. 97. The Executive's discretion to waive this reentry ban is significantly limited, as that waiver authority only applie s \"in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse or son or daughter of a United States citizen or of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, if it is established to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the refusal of admission to su ch immigrant alien would result in extreme hardship to the citizen or lawfully resident spouse or parent of such alien.\" Id. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(v) (emphases added). 98. Congressional statutes also significantly limit the Executive's authority to grant aliens temporary \"parole\" into the country: \"The Attorney General may, except as provided in subparagraph (B) or in section 1184(f) of this title, in his discretion parole into the United States te mporarily under such conditions as he may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit any alien applying for admission to the United States, but such parole of such alien shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien and when the purposes of such parole shall, in the opinion of th e Attorney General, ha ve been served the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.\" Id. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A) (emphases added). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 21 of 13722 99. The Executive considers \"advance parole\" an exercise of its humanitarian-parole authority. E.g., DHS, DACA National Standard Operating Procedures 125, Texas , 86 F. Supp. 3d 591 (No. 1:14-cv-254), ECF No. 64-17. 100. Unlike other categories of aliens s eeking advance parole, the Executive has not required DACA recipients to qual ify for the \"urgent humanitarian reasons\" or \"significant public statut 1182(d)(5)(A). See USCIS, Instructions for Applic ation for 4-5 (expires Dec. 31, 2018), https://www.uscis .gov/system/files_fo rce/files/form/i- 131instr.pdf?download=1. 101. Instead, the Executive has consider ed DACA recipients eligible for advance parole based on its own far broader criteria: \"humanitarian purposes,\" such as \"tr avel to obtain medical treatment, attending funeral services for a fam ily member, or visiting an ailing relative\"; \"educational purposes,\" such as participating research\"; or \"employment purposes,\" including \"overseas assignments, interviews, conferences or, training, or meet ings with clients overseas.\" Frequently Asked Questions , USCIS, https://www.uscis.gov /archive/frequently-asked- questions (last visited May 1, 2018). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 22 of 13723 102. The Executive's conferral of advance parole on DACA recipients did not invoke the limited \"extreme hardship\" exception to the reentry ban that applies to DACA recipients. 8 U.S. C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(v). 103. To the contrary, the Executive consid ers an alien with advance parole not to have made a \"departure\" from the United States by physically leaving the country, so there would never be a triggeri ng of the reentry bar when that alien returns to the United States and seeks parole into the country at the port of entry. 7 USCIS, Policy Manual, pt. M, ch. 3 (last updated Aug. 23, 2017), https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/HTML/PolicyManual-Volume7-PartM-Chapter3.html (citing In re Arrabally and Yerrabelly , 25 I&N Dec. 771 (BIA 2012)). 104. Advance parole is unlawful as applied to DACA recipients over 18.5 years of age because those aliens are r eentry-barred under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B) and the Executive has not purported to excu se that bar under the limited exception of \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(v). 105. Independently, advance parole is unlaw ful as it has been applied to all DACA recipients because the Executive has not required DACA recipients to qualify for the \"urgent humanitarian reasons\" or \"significant public benefit\" statutory requirements for parole. Id. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A). 106. For an alien to be eligible to adjust to lawful-permanent-resident status (and thus obtain a pathway to United States citizenship), the alien must be lawfully \"admitted or paroled into the United States.\" Id. \u00a7 1255(a). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 23 of 13724 107. Thus, leaving and reentering the Un ited States with advance parole removes a significant impediment for some otherwise unlawfully present aliens to seek adjustment to LPR status (which entails a pathway to United States citizenship). See Immigrant Legal Res. Ctr., Pr actice Advisory: DACA, Advance Parole, and 2016), https://www.ilr c.org/sites/default/ files/resources/prac_adv-daca_ad vance_parole_fam_pet-20160531.pdf. 108. Indeed, DACA recipients have successfully adjusted their status after being paroled back into the United States. See, e.g. , id. at 7. 109. As of December 31, 2015, at least 2,994 DACA recipients were approved for adjustment to LPR status. See Letter from Le\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, Dir., USCIS, to Hon. Charles E. Grassley (June 29, 2016), https://www.judi ciary.senate.gov/imo/media/ doc/2016-06-29%20USCIS%20to%20CEG%20-%20DACA%20Advance%20Parole%20Program.pdf. 110. As of August 21, 39,514 DACA recipients were adjusted to LPR status. See Press Release, Office of Sen. Chuck Grassley, Data Indicate Unauthorized Immigrants Exploited Loophole to Gain Legal Status, Pathway to Citizenship (Sept. 1, 20 17), https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news- releases/data-indicate-unaut horized-immigrants-e xploited-loophole-gain-legal-status. 111. Thus, some individuals now have a previously unavailable pathway to United States citizenship on account of receiving DACA, even though the June 15, 2012 DACA memo said that DACA would confer no pathway to United States citizenship. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 24 of 13725 112. Of those aliens, as of August 21, 2017, approximately 2,181 DACA recipients have applied for United States citizenship, and approximately 1,056 DACA recipients have been granted United States citizenship. See id. 113. By enabling this pathway to citizens hip, DACA provided an additional incentive for unlawfully present aliens, who wo uld otherwise be subj ect to up to a ten- year reentry ban, to remain in the United States rather than return to their country of nationality. Cf. Texas , 86 F. Supp. 3d at 635. 114. For an alien whose pathway to citizenship (for example, through an immigrant visa from marriage to a United Stat es citizen) is foreclosed by his accrued unlawful presence, traveling to the alien's home country and returning with advance parole is likely preferable to returning to the alien's home country and waiting out a ten-year unlawful-presence reentry bar. 115. Because it is unlawful to grant advance parole premised on DACA status, it is unlawful for the Executive to adjust an alien's status to lawful- permanent-resident status based on that advance parole. 116. Consequently, it is unlawful for the Executive to confer lawful- permanent-resident status or United States citizenship on DACA recipients who were ineligible to adjust their status but for advance parole. 117. Before the 2012 DACA memo issued, fo rmer President Obama asked the Department of Justice's Of fice of Legal Counsel (\"OL C\") whether DACA \"would be legally permissible.\" Memorandum Opinion for the Secretary of Homeland Security Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 25 of 13726 and the Counsel to the President 18 n.8 (N ov. 19, 2014) (\"OLC Memo\"), attached as Exhibit 4 . 118. The OLC Memo never mentioned that DACA or Expanded DACA confers lawful presence. 119. The OLC Memo never mentioned that DACA or Expanded DACA could confer a pathway to citizenship. 120. OLC's \"preliminary view was that such a program would be permissible, provided that immigration officials retained discretion to evaluate each application on an individualized basis.\" Id. 121. OLC explained that \"extending deferred action to individuals who satisfied these and other specified criteria on a class-wide basis would raise distinct questions not implicated by ad hoc grants of deferred action.\" Id. 122. OLC \"advised that it was critical that, like past policies that made deferred action available to certain cla sses of aliens, the DACA program require immigration officials to evaluate each app lication for deferred action on a case-by- case basis, rather than granting deferred action automatically to all applicants who satisfied the threshold eligibility criteria.\" Id. IV. The Obama Administration's Refu sal to Follow Immigration Laws Caused a Humanitarian Crisis. 123. The Executive Branch did not stop at DACA with dispensing with the Nation's immigration laws. Rather, the former Presidential Administration adopted a policy that encouraged international ch ild smuggling across the Texas-Mexico Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 26 of 13727 border. See Order at 2, United States v. Nava-Martinez , No. 1:13-cr-00441 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 13, 2013), ECF No. 37. 124. The defendant in Nava-Martinez , an admitted human trafficker, was caught attempting to smuggle a ten-year-old Salvadoran girl into the United States. Id. at 1. 125. In Nava-Martinez , the district court noted that this was \"the fourth case with the same factual situation this Court has had in as many weeks.\" Id. at 3. Although the human traffickers were appr ehended in each case, \"the DHS completed the criminal conspiracy . . . by delivering th e minors to the custody of the parent.\" Id. 126. This was done pursuant to DHS's \"appa rent policy . . . of completing the criminal mission of individuals who are viol ating the border security of the United States.\" Id. at 2. As the district court observ ed, \"[t]his DHS policy is a dangerous course of action.\" Id. Under the policy, \"instead of enforcing the laws of the United States, the Government [takes] direct steps to help the individuals who violated it.\" Id. at 3. 127. Moreover, the district court found that DHS's policy promotes human trafficking, which in turn \"help[s] fund th e illegal drug cartels which are a very real danger for both citizens of this country and Mexico.\" Id. at 6. The district court explained that citizens of the United States bear the economic brunt of this policy, because DHS \"fund[s] these evil ve ntures with their tax dollars.\" Id. at 8. In addition, the policy harms the citizens of each co untry that suffers from the \"nefarious activities of the cartels.\" Id. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 27 of 13728 128. DACA and the policy described in Nava-Martinez have had and continue to have dire consequences in Plaintiff States. In the summer of 2014, an enormous wave of unlawfully present aliens surged across the Texas-Mexico border, creating what President Obama described as a \"hum anitarian crisis.\" Nick Miroff & Joshua Partlow, Central American Migrants Overwhelm Border Patrol Station in Texas, WASH. POST (June 12, 2014). 129. Law enforcement officers reported \"picking up children as young as 4 without their parents and other children with Hello Kitty backpacks, cellphones and the telephone numbers of U.S. relative s on note cards.\" Miroff & Partlow, supra. 130. But the humanitarian crisis is by no means limited to unaccompanied children. \"[A]n unprecedented surge of families crossing illegally into the U.S.\" has also been recognized. Cindy Carcamo, Rumors of U.S. Haven for Families Spur Rise in Illegal Immigration , L.A. TIMES (June 6, 2014). While immigration officials do not have an official count of such families, they have acknowledged that \"the numbers appear to be substantial.\" Id. 131. This wave of immigration was concentrated in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. Miroff & Partlow, supra. A June 2014 report noted that \"[e]very day, hundreds of Central American migrants, in groups as large as 250 people, are wading across the muddy Rio Grande.\" Id. 132. The crisis has imposed enormous law enforcement costs on Plaintiff States. For example, the Texas Department of Public Safety estimated in 2014 that it spent $1.3 million a week on troopers and resources to deal with the immigration Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 28 of 13729 surge; in addition, former Governor Perry deployed 1,000 National Guard troops to the border at a cost of $38 million. 133. This crisis was caused by the immigration policies of the federal government, including the policy already held to be unlawful. As Ronald D. Vitiello, then serving as Deputy Chief of U.S. Border Patrol, reportedly explained in a 2014 memorandum (\"Vitiello Memorandum\"), \"[i]f the U.S. government fails to deliver adequate consequences to deter aliens from attempting to illegally enter the U.S., the result will be an even greater increase in th e rate of recidivism and first-time illicit entries.\" The Obama Administration acknowledged that there was a \"growing perception minors are crossing the border because they feel they will not be deported by the administration.\" Brett LoGiurato, There's a Staggering Humanitarian Crisis on the US Border, and It's Only Going to Get Worse , B US. INSIDER (June 16, 2014). Indeed, a research report commissioned by DHS revealed that \"[w]ord had spread in Central America about a 'lack of consequences' for illegal entry\" and that \"[s]mugglers were exploiting the system.\" Susan Carroll, Report Warned of Child Migrant Crisis , HOUSTON CHRON . (June 17, 2014). 134. Former President Obama himself pred icted this outcome. On July 1, 2010, he explained that it would be \"both unwise and unfair\" to \"ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation\" because it \"would suggest to those thinking about coming here illegally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision.\" That in turn, President Obama recognized, \"could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration.\" As President Obama conclude d, \"no matter how decent they are, no Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 29 of 13730 matter their reasons, the 11 million who broke these laws should be held accountable.\" President Barack Obama, Remarks on Comprehensive Immigration Reform (July 1, 2010), https://obam awhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press- office/remarks-president-comprehensive-immigration-reform. 135. The Obama Administration, however, contributed to the surge of illegal immigration by refusing to enforce the laws on the books. On average, only 1,600 unaccompanied children are removed each year; in 2013, there were over 20,000 detentions of unaccompanied children from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, but only 496 unaccompanied children from those countries were repatriated. Carroll, supra. The total number of unlawfully present children deported by the Obama Administration in 2013 was only 1,669\u2014an 80 percent reduction from 2008. Brian Bennett, Deportation Data Won't Dispel Ru mors Drawing Migrant Minors to U.S. , L.A. TIMES (July 5, 2014). 136. By fiscal year 2016, the number of unaccompanied children captured at the border spiked to nearly 60,000. See Press Release, United States Border Patrol Southwest Family Unit Subject and Unaccompanied Alien Children Apprehensions Fiscal Year 2016: Statement by Secretary Johnson on Southwest Border Security (Oct. 18, 2016), https://www.cbp.gov /newsroom/stats/southwest-border- unaccompanied-children/fy-2016. 137. Similarly, adults with children who are detained at the border are routinely released and allowed to travel within the United States. Carcamo, supra . And while they may be instructed to show up for a follow-up appointment, \"ICE Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 30 of 13731 officials said they couldn't guarantee th at they would pursue all cases in which immigrants do not show up for follow-up appointments.\" Id. Tellingly, the immigrants arrested for illegally entering the U.S. refer to ICE's Notice to Appear documents as \"permisos,\" or permits. Byron York, On Immigrant Surge, White House Story Falls Apart , WASH. EXAMINER (June 16, 2014). 138. Unsurprisingly, the unlawfully present aliens crossing the border are motivated primarily by the belief that they will not be deported. The federal government's own analysis demonstrates as much. When Border Patrol agents recently questioned 230 unlawfully present a liens about why they came, \"[t]he results showed overwhelmingly that the immigrants, including those classified as . . . unaccompanied children, were motivated by th e belief that they would be allowed to stay in the United States.\" Id. 139. Multiple reports indicate that unlawf ully present aliens are counting on federal officials for help in reuniting with th eir friends or family in the U.S. According to a June 2014 report, hundreds of Central American migrants were \"turning themselves in to the Border Patrol\" on a daily basis. Miroff & Partlow, supra. One unlawfully present alien stated that she an d her group \"had looked forward to being caught . . . at one point even waving down federal helicopters . . . because of the welcoming treatment they had assumed they would receive.\" Carcamo, supra . Another planned to surrender to Border Patrol because she had heard \"that the Americans are helping Hondurans right now,\" especially women and children. Miroff & Partlow, supra . All of the 230 unlawfully present aliens interviewed by Border Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 31 of 13732 Patrol agents for their report \"stated that they had family members or, to a lesser extent, friends already living in the U.S.\" York, supra. 140. The Obama Administration conceded that its failure to enforce the federal immigration laws increased the flow of illegal immigration across the Texas- Mexico border. See Vitiello Memorandum, supra. 141. The effects of that failure have caus ed acute crises in Plaintiff States. V. Former President Obama \"Chang e[d] the Law\" Again\u2014Through the 2014 DHS Memorandum Creating Expanded DACA and DAPA. 142. Between the unveiling of the 2012 DACA memorandum and the midterm elections in November 2014, former President Obama repeatedly stated that any extension of DACA would be unlawful and would have to be accomplished by legislation. He said, for instance: \"[A]s the head of the executive branch, there's a limit to what I can do. . . . [U]ntil we have a law in place that provides a pathway for legalization and/or citizenship for the folks in question, we're going to . . . continue to be bound by the law.\" President Barack Obama, Remarks at Univision Town Hall with Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena Salinas (Sept. 20, 2012), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/20/remarks-president-univision-town-hall-jorge-ramos-and-maria-elena-salina. \"We are a nation of immigrants. . . .

Former President Obama repeatedly called on Congress to pass an immigration reform bill. Congress did not do so. 144. After being rebuffed by Congress again, former President Obama announced that he would unilaterally creat e a program conferring lawful presence and work authorizations for an additional estimated 4 million unlawfully present aliens. 145. On November 20, 2014, former DHS Secretary Johnson issued the DAPA memo creating Expanded DACA and DAPA. See Texas , 809 F.3d at 146-48; Exhibit 3 . 146. Like the DACA memo, the DAPA memo again created a class-based deferred-action program\u2014that confers e ligibility for lawful presence and work authorization\u2014without congressional authorization or notice-and-comment procedure. 147. The DAPA memo first expanded the class eligible for DACA relief by: (1) eliminating the DACA criteria's age cap, (2) increasing the DACA term from two Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 36 of 13737 years to three years, and (3 ) pushing the DACA date-of-ent ry deadline from 2007 to 2010. Exhibit 3 at 3-4. 148. The DAPA memo then directed USCIS \"to establish a process, similar to DACA,\" for granting three-year terms of deferred action to a new class of aliens: unlawfully present aliens who were parents of United States citizens and other lawful permanent residents who were not enforcement priorities. Id. at 4. 149. Together, the coverage criteria for DAPA and Expanded DACA would have covered approximately 40% of the co untry's known population of unlawfully present aliens. 150. The 2014 DAPA and Expanded DACA\u2014like the original 2012 DACA\u2014 did not merely forbear from removing aliens who qualified. All three affirmatively granted lawful presence and eligibility for work authorization to those who would otherwise be unlawfully present and unauthorized to work. 151. The November 20, 2014 DAPA memo stated that \"[t]his memorandum confers no . . . pathway to citizenship.\" Id. at 5. 152. DAPA memo stated that \"deferred action . . . may be terminated at any time at the agency's discretion.\" Id. at 2. 153. Former President Obama candidly admitted that his plan, through these programs, was unilateral legislation: \"What you're not paying attention to is, I just took an action to change the law .\" Steven T.

Former President Obama further a dmitted that he was changing the law because Congress chose not to: \"[T]o th ose members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better . . . I have one answer: Pass a bill. . . . And the day I sign that bill into law, the actions I take will no longer be necessary.\" President Barack Obama, Rema rks by the President in Address to the Nation on Immigration (Nov. 20, 2014), h ttps://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the- press-office/2014/11/20/rema rks-president-address-nation-immigration. 155. Former President Obama also made clear that he was \"offer[ing] the following deal\" to unlawfully present aliens: \"[I]f you've taken responsibility, you've registered, undergone a background check, you' re paying taxes, you've been here for five years, you've got roots in the community \u2014you're not going to be deported. . . .

Through the creation of Expanded DACA and DAPA, the Obama Administration again dispensed with cert ain of the Nation's immigration laws without congressional approval.

On December 3, 2014, Plaintiffs and ot her States filed a lawsuit in this district court seeking to immediately halt the implementation of Expanded DACA and DAPA. 158. On February 16, 2015, the district court granted the requested relief and issued a preliminary injunction of Expanded DACA and DAPA. In its opinion, the district court explained, despite the Defendants' claims to the contrary, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the meri ts of their claim and that they would suffer irreparable harm if Expanded D ACA and DAPA went into effect.

Apr. 7, 2015), and the Fifth Circuit, Texas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733, 769, 784 (5th Cir. 2015), denied a stay of the preliminary injunction. 161. The Defendants appealed from the district court's preliminary injunction. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, find ing that the plaintiffs had standing to challenge the Executive's class-based defe rred-action programs that grant lawful presence and work authorization, that such programs are judicially reviewable, that Expanded DACA and DAPA were unlawful both procedurally (as promulgated without notice and comment) and substantively (as foreclosed by substantive federal Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 39 of 13740 statutes), and that the plaintiffs sati sfied the equitable requirements for a preliminary injunction.

On that same date\u2014June 15, 2017\u2014fo rmer DHS Secretary Kelly issued a new memorandum \"rescind[ing] the No vember 20, 2014 DAPA memorandum and the policies announced therein.\" Exhibit 5 at 2. 171. Secretary Kelly added that \"[t] he June 15, 2012 DACA memorandum, however, will remain in effect.\" Id. 172. Secretary Kelly also explained that his memorandum did \"not alter the remaining periods of deferred action under the Expanded DACA policy granted between issuance of the November 20, 2014 Memorandum and the February 16, 2015 preliminary injunction order in the Texas litig ation, nor does it affect the validity of related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) granted during the same span of time.\" Id. at 2 n.3. 173.

Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 41 of 13742 174. This reminder echoes the DACA memo language that the district court found pretextual in Texas's challe nge to DAPA and Expanded DACA. 86 F. Supp. Wi thdrew the 2012 DACA Memorandum in Response to an Imminent Legal Ch allenge Threatened by Plaintiffs and Other States. 175. On June 29, 2017, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the attorneys general of nine other states (including Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, and West Virginia), and the governor of Idaho sent a letter to the federal Executive Branch urging the Trump Administration to phase out DACA. See Exhibit 6 . 176. Plaintiffs' June 29, 2017 letter requested \"that the Secretary of Homeland Security rescind the June 15, 2012 DACA memorandum and order that the Executive Branch will not renew or issue any new DACA or Expanded DACA permits in the future.\" Id. at 2. 177. Plaintiffs' letter explained how DACA is unlawful under the Fifth Circuit's decision in Texas. Id. at 1-2. 178. Plaintiffs' letter proposed a resolution of the then-pending lawsuit, and avoiding additional litigation relating to DACA: \"If, by September 5, 2017, the Executive Branch agrees to rescind th e June 15, 2012 DACA memorandum and not to renew or issue any new DACA or Expanded DACA permits in the future, then the plaintiffs that successfully challenged DAPA and Expanded DACA will voluntarily dismiss their lawsuit currently pending in th e Southern District of Texas. Otherwise, Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 42 of 13743 the complaint in that case will be amended to challenge both the DACA program and the remaining Expanded DACA permits.\" Id. at 2. 179. On September 4, 2017, United States Attorney General Sessions wrote the DHS Acting Secretary, advising that DHS should rescind DACA. Letter from Attorney General Sessions to Acting Secretary Duke, https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/file s/publications/17_0904_DOJ_AG-letter- DACA.pdf. 180. Attorney General Sessions noted that \"DACA was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Co ngress' repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result.\" Id. 181. Attorney General Sessions advised: \"Because the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation wo uld yield similar results with respect to DACA.\" Id. 182. On September 5, 2017, United St ates Attorney General Sessions publicly announced that DHS would rescind the 2012 DACA memorandum. U.S. Dep't of Justice, Attorney General Sessi ons Delivers Remarks on DACA (Sept. 5, 2017) , https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/ attorney-general-sessions-delivers- remarks-daca. 183. During his remarks, Attorney General Sessions stated that by implementing DACA the Obama Administration had \"deliberately sought to achieve Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 43 of 13744 what the legislative branch specifically re fused to authorize on multiple occasions\" and that \"[s]uch an open-ended circum vention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.\" Id. 184. Attorney General Sessions further explained that DACA was \"vulnerable to the same legal and constitution al challenges that the courts recognized with respect to the DAPA pr ogram\" and that if DHS deci ded to maintain DACA, \"the likeliest outcome is that it would be enjoined just as was DAPA.\" Id. 185. Attorney General Sessions also observ ed that \"[t]he effect of [DACA], among other things, contributed to a surge of unaccompanied minors on the southern border that yielded terrible humanitarian consequences. It also denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allo wing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens.\" Id. 186. On September 5, 2017, DHS issued a memorandum rescinding the 2012 DACA memorandum. See Exhibit 7 . 187. The September 2017 memorandum initiated the DACA wind-down process. The memorandum provided that DHS would \"adjudicate\u2014on an individual, case by case basis\u2014properl y filed pending DACA renewal requests and associated applications for Employment Authorizatio n Documents from current beneficiaries that have been accepted by the Departme nt as of [September 5, 2017], and from current beneficiaries whose benefits w ill expire between the date of this memorandum and March 5, 2018 that have been accepted by the Department as of October 5, 2017.\" Id. at 5. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 44 of 13745 188. The September 2017 memorandum allowed for the orderly phase-out of DACA. 189. DHS's September 2017 memorandum and the impending wind-down of DACA thus satisfied the condition proposed by Plaintiffs' June 29, 2017 letter for ending the then-pending lawsuit and avoiding additional litigation regarding DACA. 190. The Plaintiffs therefore did not file an amended complaint challenging DACA in September 2017. 191. Instead, the parties to the then-pending DAPA/Expanded DACA lawsuit filed a stipulation of dismissal on September 12, 2017, in that suit. Stipulation of Dismissal, Texas, No. 1:14-cv-254 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 12, 2017), ECF No. 473, IX. Following the September 2017 Me morandum, Numerous Parties Seek to Halt the Recession of DACA\u2014Acknowledging, in the Process, that DACA Was Never Lawful. 192. Following DHS's September 2017 DACA rescission memorandum, lawsuits were filed claiming that the de cision to rescind DACA was itself unlawful . Five of these actions were file d in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, and at least four other lawsuits were filed in other federal district courts. See Complaint, Trs. of Princeton Univ. v. United States , No. 1:17-cv-2325 (D.D.C. Nov. 2018), No. Sept. 29, 2017), ECF No. New Trump , No. 1:17-cv-5228 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 6, 2017), ECF No. 1. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 45 of 13746 193. In those challenges to the 2017 executive action, the plaintiffs' own pleadings essentially concede that DACA itself was unlawful because\u2014as Plaintiff States allege in this suit\u2014it was a substant ive rule that modified rights and was thus required to go through APA notice-and-comment procedures. 194. For example, in a challenge brought by the University of California, the plaintiffs claim that the September 2017 rescission memorandum \"constitutes a substantive rule subject to APA's notice-and-comment requirements.\" Complaint 14, Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Dep't of Homeland Sec. , No. 3:17-cv-5211 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 8, 2017), ECF No. 1. This stat ement could be true only if DACA, the program being rescinded, was itself a substantive rule. 195. The University of California plai ntiffs further admit that DACA unilaterally modified rights by conferring lawful presence: Individuals with DACA status were \"not considered to be unlawfully present during the period in which deferred action [was] in effect.\" USCIS FAQs. Id. at 8. 196. In the same litigation, the State of California concedes that \"DACA Provides Numerous Benefits,\" wh ich they describe in detail: 83. DACA grantees are gran ted eligibility to receive employment authorization . 84. DACA also opened the door to allow travel for DACA grantees. For example, DACA grantees were allowed to briefly depart the U.S. and legally return under cert ain circumstances, such as to visit an ailing relative, attend funeral services for a family member, seek medical treatment , or further educational or employment purposes. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i); see also Ex. E, Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 46 25, 2017) Q57. Travel for vacation is not permitted. 85. Unlike other undocumented i mmigrants, DACA grantees are not disqualified on the basis of their immigration status from receiving certain public benefits. These include federal Social Security, retirement, and disability benefits . See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1611(b)(2)-(3), 1621(d). As a result, and in reliance on DHS's oft-stated position that DACA an d similar programs are a lawful exercise of the agency's auth ority, Plaintiff States have structured some schemes around DACA which allow, for example, applicants to demonstrate elig ibility for state programs by producing documentation that they have been approved under DACA. The rescission of DACA undermines such regulatory frameworks. 86. DACA grantees are able to secure equal access to other benefits and opportunities on which Americans depend, including opening bank accounts, obtaining credit cards, starting businesses, purchasing homes and cars, and conducting other aspects of daily life that are otherwise often unavailable for undocumented immigrants. Complaint at 17-18, California v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., No. 3:17-cv-5235 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 11, 2017), ECF No. 1 (emphases added). 197. In the New York lawsuit, the plaintiffs similarly allege that DACA affirmatively confers benefits\u2014that is, that DACA alters benefits on DACA grantees. Notably, DACA grantees are granted the right not to be arrested or detained based solely on their immigration status during the time period their deferred action is in effect. See Ex. 14, Question 9. . . . . 220. DACA grantees are eligible to receive certain public benefits . These include Social Security, retiremen t, and disability benefits , and, in certain states, benefits such as driver's licenses or unemployment insurance. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1611(b)(2)-(3), 1621(d). In the State of Washington, DACA holders also are eligible for certain state financial aid programs and state-funded food assistance. See Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 28B.92.010; Wash. Admin. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 47 of 13748 Code \u00a7\u00a7 388-400-0050, 388-424-0001, 388-424-0030. In the State of New York, DACA holders are eligible for teaching and nursing licenses. See Comm. of Educ. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 59.4; 80-1.3; Ex. 78 (NYS Board of Regents Press Release, Feb. 24, 2016). Complaint at 41, New York , No. 1:17-cv-5228, ECF No . 1 (emphases added). 198. Like the California plaintiffs, the New York plaintiffs have likewise tacitly admitted that DACA was a substantive rule because it modified rights: 289. In implementing the DHS Memorandum, federal agencies have changed the su bstantive criteria by which individuals DACA grantees wo rk, live, attend school, obtain credit, and travel in the United States. Federal agencies did not follow the proc edures required by the APA before taking action impacting these substantive rights. Id. at 54. 199. If DACA's rescission affected substa ntial rights, as the challengers to DHS's September 2017 memorandum claim, then DACA also affected substantial rights and was unlawful in the first plac e as alleged in the instant lawsuit. X. The Northern District of Cali fornia Enjoins DHS's Wind-Down of DACA. 200. On January 9, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued an injunction in the challenge brought by the University of California and other plaintiffs to the 2017 executive action rescinding DACA. See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec. , 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2018). The Northern District of Califor nia ordered DHS, \"pending final judgment herein or other order, to maintain the DACA program on a nationwide basis on the same terms and conditions as were in effect before the rescission on September 5, Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 48 of 13749 2017, including allowing DACA enrollees to renew their enrollments,\" subject to several exceptions. See id. at 1048-49. 201. The Northern District of California's order stated that \"new applications from applicants who have never before received deferred action need not be processed.\" Id. at 1048. 202. The Northern District of California further indicated that \"the advance parole feature need not be continued for the time being for anyone,\" id., and that this injunction order \"will not require advance parole,\" id. at 1049. 203. The Northern District of California concluded that DHS \"may take administrative steps to make sure fair dis cretion is exercised on an individualized basis for each renewal application.\" Id. at 1048. 204. DHS also was ordered to \"post reasonable public notice that it will resume receiving DACA renewal applicatio ns and prescribe a process consistent with\" the Northern District of California's order. Id. 205. On April 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued an order in the challenge brought by the NAACP and other plaintiffs to the 2017 executive action rescinding DACA. See NAACP , 2018 WL 1920079, at *1-28. The district court ordered that it would \"vacate the Department's September 5, 2017 decision to rescind the DACA program\" and \"grant plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment as to th eir substantive APA claim.\" Id. at *28. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 49 of 13750 206. The district court found that the \"[ v]acatur of DACA's rescission will mean that DHS must accept and process new as well as renewal DACA applications.\" Id. at *1. 207. The District of Columbia district co urt stated that it would \"stay its order of vacatur for 90 days, however, to a fford DHS an opportunity to better explain its view that DACA is unlawful.\" Id. at *28. 208. The Northern District of California's injunction of the Executive's 2017 decision to wind down DACA and the District of Columbia's vacatur of the wind-down decision forced this lawsuit to declare whether the Executive had authority to promulgate DACA in the first place. Becaus e DACA is still in effect, the basis upon which Plaintiffs agreed to resolve the prior litigation has been frustrated, and Plaintiffs therefore effectua te their previously stated plans \"to challenge both the DACA program and [any] remaining Expanded DACA permits.\" Exhibit 6 at 2. THEORIES OF RELIEF 209. Because permits issued under the Executive's unlawful class-based \"deferred action\" programs created by the former Presidential Administration remain in existence, Plaintiffs file this Co mplaint challenging those unlawful acts. 210. DACA is unlawful for the same reasons that courts held Expanded DACA and DAPA unlawful: The Executive does not have the unilateral power to confer eligibility for lawful presence or work authorization on unlawfully present aliens simply because the Executive chooses not to remove them. See Texas , 809 F.3d at 179-81. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 50 of 13751 211. But for the Executive's implementation of DACA, aliens covered by that program would not be eligible for lawful presence, and would be removable under the INA. 212. But for the Executive's implementation of DACA, aliens covered by that program would not be eligible for work authorization. 213. But for the Executive's implementati on of the program, many DACA recipients would not be eligible for lawf ul-permanent-resident status by obtaining advance parole. 214. But for the Executive's implementati on of the program, many DACA recipients would not be eligible for United States citizenship by obtaining advance parole. 215. Thus, Plaintiffs challenge, at a minimum, (1) the 2012 DACA memo issued by former Secretary Napolitano, (2) the implementation of that 2012 DACA memo, (3) the part of form er Secretary Kelly's June 2017 memo retaining the 2012 DACA memo, and (4) any DACA permits that remain in effect. 216. On belief, no three-year Expanded DACA permits currently remain in effect or will be issued, because such three-ye ar permits were last issued on or before March 2015 (over three years ago) and have not been renewed since that time because of this Court's February 2015 preliminary injunction of Expanded DACA and the Executive Branch's later June 2017 memo randum rescinding Expanded DACA. 217. If that belief regarding Expanded DACA permits is incorrect, however, Plaintiffs also challenge (1) any part of former Secretary Johnson's 2014 memo Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 51 of 13752 creating Expanded DACA that may remain in effect when comb ined with former Secretary Kelly's June 2017 memo retaining a subset of previously granted Expanded DACA permits, (2) the part of former Secr etary Kelly's June 2017 memo retaining a subset of previously granted Expanded DACA permits, and (3) any Expanded DACA permits that remain in effect. All arguments below co ncerning DACA equally apply to Expanded DACA. 218. DACA violates the APA's notice-and-comment requirements, is contrary to law under the APA, and violates the Take Care Clause. I. The Plaintiffs Have Standing. 219. The Plaintiff States have standing because they have a \"personal stake\" in the outcome of this litigation. Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus , 134 S. Ct. 2334, 2341 (2014). 220. The Plaintiff States have suffered, and will continue to suffer, concrete injuries that are traceable to DACA, and an injunction of DACA will redress those injuries. 221. DACA imposes significant costs on Plaintiff States. As the Supreme Court has explained, States \"bear[] ma ny of the consequences of unlawful immigration.\" Arizona , 567 U.S. at 397. 222. Only one plaintiff needs standing for an Article III case or controversy to exist. See Texas, 809 F.3d at 151 (citing Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc. , 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006)). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 52 of 13753 223. Once a concrete injury is shown, the magnitude of that injury is irrelevant to the standing inquiry. See, e.g. , Massachusetts v. EPA , 549 U.S. 497, 525- 26 (2007). 224. Both the district court and the Fifth Circuit already have concluded that Plaintiff States have standing to cha llenge the Executive's unilateral actions conferring class-based deferred action to grant lawful presence and work authorizations. 225. DACA's conferral of lawful presence triggers eligibility for benefits\u2014 some of which are paid for by Plaintiff States. Id. at 148-49 (explaining lawful presence status qualifies recipients for So cial Security, disability benefits, Medicare, work authorization, unemployment benefits, and driver's licenses). 226. If Plaintiff States sought to change their benefits programs to prevent DACA recipients from being eligible, Plaintiff States would be threatened with federal preemption through the operation of DACA as it relates to their benefits programs. The Ninth Circuit enjoined\u2014as preempted by federal law\u2014Arizona's state law that prevented the State of Arizona from issuing driver's licenses to DACA recipients. Ariz. Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer , 855 F.3d 957, 975 (9th Cir. 2017), cert. denied , 138 S. Ct. 1279 (2018). The Ninth Circuit purported to rest its ruling on the basis that the INA's alien classifications preempted Arizona's law, id., and that is just another way of ruling that DACA is lawful and its lawful-presence designation is lawful as consonant with the INA. DACA's lawful-presence designation, in turn, is what the Ninth Circuit held preempted Ar izona's law. After all, without the DACA Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 53 of 13754 program, DACA recipients wo uld not be deemed lawfully present. The Plaintiff States' benefits programs are threatened by such alleged preemption, thus representing an injury imposed by DACA. 227. Other financial injuries to Plaint iff States are caused by DACA's granting of lawful presence and work authorization. For instance, federal work authorization functions as a precondition for certain professional licenses in Plaintiff States. See, e.g. , 16 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 33.10 (requiring applicants for an alcoholic beverage license to be \"legally authorized to work in the United States\"); Tex. Bd. of Law Exam'rs, Rules Governing Admission to the Bar of Tex., R. II(a)(5)(J) (making individuals who are \"authorized to work lawf ully in the United States\" eligible to apply for admission as licensed attorn eys). 228. Additionally, Plaintiff States have incurred considerable financial injuries on education, healthcare, and law-enforcement cost s caused by DACA. 229. The Plaintiff States would not otherw ise incur certain costs associated with education, healthcare, and law enforcement but for DACA. See Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 628-30. 230. DACA incentivizes aliens\u2014who woul d otherwise be unlawfully present and unauthorized to work without thes e programs\u2014to remain in the country. Id. at 634-35. 231. Because additional aliens will remain in Plaintiff States, those aliens will cause Plaintiff States to incur addition al financial costs\u2014particularly education, healthcare, and law-enforcement costs. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 54 of 13755 232. States are required by federal law to incur some of these costs. For example, the Supreme Court has held that States are constitutionally obligated to provide free education to children of unlawfully present aliens. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982). Similarly, both Medicare and Me dicaid require provision of emergency services, regardless of lawful-presence st atus, as a condition of participation. \u00a7 1395dd; 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.255. 233. found in Plaintiffs' challenge to DAPA and Expanded DACA, Texas pays about $9,473 per year to educate each unlawfully present alien in its school system. See Texas , 86 F. Supp. 3d at 630. 234. In a single year, \"Texas absorbed addi tional education costs of at least $58,531,100 stemming from illegal immigration.\" Id. 235. Other expenditures are required by preexisting state law. For example, Texas law requires local governments to provide healthcare for the indigent. See Tex. Health & Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 61.001 et seq . Texas law also requires nonprofit hospitals to provide unreimbursed care for the indige nt as a condition of maintaining their nonprofit status. See id. \u00a7 311.043. \"Evidence in the record . . . shows that in 2008, Texas incurred $716,800,000 in uncompensated medical care provided to illegal aliens.\" Texas , 86 F. Supp. 3d at 630. 236. Other States besides Texas have similar financial injuries caused by DACA. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 55 of 13756 237. Under the Article III standing inquir y, courts do no t examine whether financial injuries incurred are \"offset\" by other policies reducing other expenditures. Texas, 809 F.3d at 155-56. 238. So any hypothetical financial gains to Plaintiff States caused by DACA are irrelevant for determining whether Plaintiff States have standing. 239. Moreover, Plaintiff States have parens patriae standing to protect the quasi-sovereign interest in \"the health and well-being\" of their citizens. Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez , 458 U.S. 592, 607 (1982). 240. Specifically, Plaintiff States seek to protect their citizens' \"economic and commercial interests\" from labor-market distortion caused by the continued existence of DACA. Id.at 609. 241. The Plaintiff States seek the enfo rcement of federal law \"to assure [their] residents that they w ill have the full benefit of federal laws designed to address th[e] problem\" of illegal immigration and labor-market distortion. Id. at 609-10. 242. The Plaintiff States also possess \"special solicitude\" in the Article III standing analysis under Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 520. See Texas , 809 F.3d at 151. 243. The Plaintiff States do not need special solicitude to establish standing, but Massachusetts v. EPA 's special solicitude makes standing an easy question. 244. Just as the Supreme Court found in Massachusetts v. EPA, the federal government here has \"abdicated its resp onsibility\" to enforce federal statutes. Texas , Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 56 of 13757 86 F. Supp. 3d at 663 (\"DAPA does not re present mere inadequacy; it is complete abdication.\"). 245. The Plaintiff States face a more ce rtain risk of harm than the state plaintiffs who had standing in Massachusetts v. EPA. Id. at 629; see Texas , 809 F.3d at 159 (\"Texas is entitled to the same 'spe cial solicitude' as was Massachusetts, and the causal link is even closer here.\"). 246. The Plaintiff States also seek to vindicate a procedural right\u2014namely, the right to be heard under the APA's notice-and-comment procedures. 247. Separately, Plaintiff States have st anding to challenge federal agency action that dispenses with congression al enactments when those congressional enactments preempt state prerogatives. 248. A State is \"an institutional plaintiff.\" Ariz. State Leg. v. Ariz. Indep. Redistricting Comm'n , S. Ct. 2652, 2664 (2015). 249. An \"institutional plaintiff\" has standing when it suffers a mere \"institutional injury.\" Id. 250. An \"institutional injury\" includes when a powers are \"strip[ped]\" or \"nullif[ied].\" Id. at 2663, 2665. 251. When a federal statute preempts stat e prerogatives, the State's powers are stripped or nullified. 252. \"When a State enters the Union, it surrenders certain sovereign prerogatives\" that become \"lodged in the Federal Government.\" Massachusetts v. EPA , 549 U.S. at 519. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 57 of 13758 253. A State's agreement to have its au thority preempted on such sovereign matters\u2014for instance, determining the citizenship or lawful presence of individuals within its borders\u2014is premised on the understanding that Congress's enactments serve to \"protect\" the States. Id. 254. Due to the preemption of their sovereign prerogatives, States also have a \"quasi-sovereign,\" if not purely sovereig n, interest in the enforcement of federal laws that preempt surrendered prerogatives. Id. at 520. 255. When the Executive Branch \"has abdicated its responsibility under [federal statutes],\" it negates the basis on which the States agreed to allow federal preemption of their sovereign prerogatives. Id. at 505. 256. States therefore also have \"abdicat ion standing\" to challenge federal Executive agency action that dispenses with statutes pa ssed by Congress when those statutes preempt state prerogatives. Texas , 86 F. Supp. 3d at 636-43. 257. The Plaintiff States thus have standing to maintain all their claims. II. This Action Is Timely. 258. The Plaintiff States have commenced this action within the applicable limitations periods. 259. \"Unless another statute provides ot herwise, civil claims against the United States\u2014including those brought pu rsuant to the APA\u2014are subject to the statute of limitations cont ained , APA notice-and-comment claim). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 58 of 13759 260. Under this provision, a party must commence an action within six years of the right of action accru ing. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a). 261. Congress has not adopted a special stat ute of limitations for the type of claims Plaintiff States bring herein. 262. The Plaintiff States commenced this action within six years of the promulgation of DACA. 263. The Plaintiff States commenced this action within six years of the implementation of DACA. 264. The Plaintiff States' request for injunctive relief preventing the Executive from renewing or issuing any ne w DACA permits in the future is not barred by any statute of limitations. III. The Plaintiff States' Interests Ar e At Least Arguably Within the Zone of Interests Protected by Immigration Statutes and the APA. 265. The Plaintiff States' interests are at least arguably within the zone of interests protected by immigration statutes. See Texas , 809 F.3d at 163. 266. The Plaintiff States' interests are ar guably within the zone of interests protected by the APA. IV. DACA Is Reviewable Agency Actions. 267. The creation of DACA\u2014and its conferral of lawful presence and work authorization\u2014is affirmative agency ac tion, not mere enforcement-discretion inaction. Id. at 166-67. 268. This lawsuit does not challenge the DHS Secretary's separate February 20, 2017 memorandum setting immigration enforcement priorities. Memorandum Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 59 of 13760 from John Kelly, Secretary, DHS, to Ke vin McAleenan, Acting Comm'r, CBP, et al, Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest (Feb. 20, 2017), https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/ publications/17_0220_S1_Enforcement-of- the-Immigration-Laws-to-Serve-the-National-Interest.pdf. 269. This lawsuit Executive's \"discretion to abandon\" the \"initiation or prosecution of various stages in the deportation process.\" Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. , 525 U.S. 471, 483 (1999). 270. Deferred action under DACA \"is much more than nonenforcement: It would affirmatively confer 'lawful presence ' and associated benefits on a class of unlawfully present aliens.\" Texas , 809 F.3d at 166. 271. \"Declining to prosecute does not tr ansform presence deemed unlawful by Congress into lawful presence and co nfer eligibility for otherwise unavailable benefits based on that change.\" Id. at 167. 272. In contrast to enforcement discretion, DACA confers eligibility for a change in immigration classification that triggers eligibility for attendant benefits. 273. The Defendants unilaterally deem DACA recipients \"lawfully present.\" 274. The congressional-created classifica tion of \"lawful presence\" confers eligibility for Social Security, Medicare, th e Earned Income Tax Credit, a driver's license, and a host of other benefits. 275. DACA also unilaterally confers the ability to obtain work authorization. 276. DACA has even provided some recipients with United States citizenship or a pathway to citizenship. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 60 of 13761 277. Justice Scalia correctly explained that DACA cannot be justified as mere nonenforcement discretion: \"the considerable administrative cost of conducting as many as 1.4 million background checks, and ruling on the biennial requests for dispensation that the nonenforcement program envisions, will necessarily be deducted from immigration enforcement.\" Arizona, 567 U.S. at 435 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis in original). 278. The Defendants cannot identify any \"clear and convincing evidence of legislative intention to preclude review\" of DACA. Japan Whaling Ass'n v. Am. Cetacean Soc'y, 478 U.S. 221, 230 n.4 (1986). 279. The Defendants have indicated that \"DHS has absolute discretion to revoke deferred action unilaterally, without notice or process.\" Pet. Br. at 5, supra, 2016 WL 836758, at *5. 280. \"Revocability, however, is the to uchstone for whether agency . . . action is reviewable.\" Texas, 809 F.3d at 167. V. DACA Is Unlawful. A. DACA Is Unlawful Because It Was Issued Without the Required APA Notice-and-Comment Procedure. 281. DACA is a substantive rule, not exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act's notice-and-comment requirements as an interpretive rule, as a general statement of policy, or as a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(A). See Texas , 809 F.3d at 171-78. 282. No exceptions to the APA's notice-and-comment requirements are applicable to DACA. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 61 of 13762 283. DACA, Expanded DACA, and DAPA are some of the largest immigration policy changes in our Nation's history. 284. The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action taken \"without observan ce of procedure required by 706(2)(D). 285. DHS is an \"agency\" under the APA. Id. \u00a7 551(1). 286. The memorandum creating (or continuing) DACA is a \"rule\" under the APA. Id. \u00a7 551(4). 287. The DACA memorandum required notice-and-comment procedure because it is a binding rule. 288. DACA required notice-and-comment procedure because it modifies substantive rights and interests, as it confers on recipients a legal status (lawful presence) and eligibility for attendant benefits. See Texas, 809 F.3d at 176. 289. Additionally, DACA required notice-and-comment procedure because it does not genuinely leave the agency and its decisionmaker free to exercise discretion. 290. As the district court found in the DA PA lawsuit, \"[n]othing about DAPA 'genuinely leaves the agency and its [employees ] free to exercise discretion.'\" Id. at 171-72 & n.127 (quoting Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 670 (emphasis and second alteration in district court opinion)). 291. In the DAPA lawsuit, the district co urt's finding regarding the lack of genuine discretion afforded to USCIS an d its employees under DAPA \"was partly informed by analysis of the implementa tion of DACA, the precursor to DAPA.\" Id. at 172 & n.128 (citing Texas , 86 F. Supp. 3d at 669-70). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 62 of 13763 292. \"Like the DAPA Memo, the DACA Memo instructed agencies to review applications on a case-by-case basis and exercise discretion, but the district court found that those statements we re 'merely pretext' . . . .\" Id. at 172 & Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 669 n.101). 293. As the Fifth Circuit recognized, \"only about 5% of the 723,000 [DACA] applications accepted for evaluation [thr ough the end of 2014] had been denied.\" Id. at 172 & n.130 (citing Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 609). 294. As the Fifth Circuit explained, \"'[d]espite a request by the [district] [c]ourt, the [g]overnment's counsel did not provide the number, if any, of requests that were denied [for disc retionary reasons] even thou gh the applicant met the DACA criteria.'\" Id. at 172 & n.131 (quoting Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 609 (alterations in Fifth Circuit opinion)). 295. The district court's \"finding of pretext was also based on a declaration by Kenneth Palinkas, the president of th e union representing the USCIS employees processing the DACA applicat ions, that 'DHS management has taken multiple steps to ensure that DACA applications are si mply rubberstamped if the applicants meet the necessary criteria.'\" Id. at 172-73 & n.132 (quoting Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 609- 10). 296. The district court's \"finding also on . . . DACA's Operating Procedures, which 'contain[] nearly 150 pages of specific instructions for granting or denying deferred action.'\" Id. at 172-73 & n.133 (quoting Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 669 (alteration in Fifth Circuit opinion)). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 63 of 13764 297. recorded in a 'che ck the box' standardized form, for which USCIS personnel are provided templates.\" Id. at 175 (quoting Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 669 (alteration in Fifth Circuit opinion)). 298. \"Certain denials of [DACA] must be se nt to a supervisor for approval[, and] there is no option for granting [DACA] to an individu al who does not meet each criterion.\" Id. (quoting Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 669 (a lteration in Fifth Circuit opinion)). 299. \"'[R]outing [DACA] applications throug h service centers instead of field offices . . . created an application proc ess that bypasses in-person investigatory interviews with trained US CIS officers from conducting case-by-case inve stigations, undermines officers' abilities to detect fraud and national-security risks, an d ensures that applications will be rubber- stamped.'\" Id. (quoting Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 609-10 (a lteration and omission in Fifth Circuit op.)); see Decl. of Kenneth Palinkas \u00b6 10, Texas, 591 (No. 1:14-cv-254), ECF No. 64-42. 300. DACA relief confers a st amp of approval from the government and encodes a substantive value judgment. See Texas , 809 F.3d at 176-77. 301. DACA does not clearly and directly relate to \"public benefits\" as that term is used in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(a)(2), be cause the agency administering DACA (USCIS) is not an agency managing benefit programs, much less the kind of public benefit that has been recognized under \u00a7 553(a)(2). See Texas , 809 F.3d at 178. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 64 of 13765 302. Although OLC cautioned the Executive that it was \"critical\" to DACA's legality that the Executive Branch evaluate every application on a case-by-case basis, Exhibit 4 at 18 n.8, the President and DHS ignore d that advice by granting deferred action mechanically to all applicants who satisfy the threshold criteria specified in the DACA memo. 303. DHS officials who implement the D ACA program exercise, in practice, effectively no discretion to deny DACA to applicants who meet the eligibility criteria in the DACA memo and the administrative application requirements, such as a background check and application fee. B. DACA Is Contrary to Law, Because It Violates Congressional Statutes. 304. DACA is contrary to law because it is \"not authorized by statute,\" Texas , 809 F.3d at 184, and is \"foreclose d by Congress's careful plan,\" id. at 186. 305. The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is \"(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to co nstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; [or] (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2). 306. \"In specific and detailed provisions, the INA expressly and carefully provides legal designations allowing defined classes of aliens to be lawfully present.\" Texas, 809 F.3d at 179. 307. \"Entirely absent from those specific classes is the group of . . . illegal aliens who would be eligible fo r lawful presence under\" DACA. Id. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 65 of 13766 308. \"The INA also specifies classes of aliens eligible and ineligible for work authorization.\" Id. at 180-81 (footnotes omitted). 309. Federal statutes defining which aliens are eligible for work authorization make \"no mention of the cl ass of persons whom\" DACA \"would make eligible for work authorization.\" Id. at 181. 310. \"[T]he INA flatly does not permit the reclassification of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully present and thereby make them eligible for a host of federal and state benefits, including work authorization.\" Id. at 184. 311. \"[H]istorical practice . . . 'does not, by itself, create power.'\" Id. at 184 & n.193 (quoting Medellin v. Texas , 552 U.S. 491, 532 (2008)). 312. \"[I]n any event, previous deferred-action programs are not analogous to [DACA].\" Id. at 184. 313. \"[M]any of the previous programs were bridges from one legal status to another, whereas [DACA] awards lawful pr esence to persons who have never had a legal status and may never receive one.\" Id. (footnotes omitted). 314. DACA has even provided some recipients with United States citizenship or a pathway to citizenship\u2014without any statutory authorization to do so from Congress. C. DACA Violates the Take Care Clause. 315. DACA violates the Take Care Clause because it dispenses with certain immigration statutes by declaring as lawf ul conduct that Congress established as unlawful. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 66 of 13767 316. DACA violates the Take Care Clause because it dispenses with certain immigration statutes by granting United States citizenship or a pathway to citizenship to aliens who would otherw ise be unlawfully pr esent but for DACA. 317. The Take Care Clause has its roots in the dispute between Parliament and King James II, who was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Parliament was infuriated at King James's use of his purported power to suspend or dispense with Parliament's laws. Zachary Price, Enforcement Discretion and Executive Duty , 67 Vand. L. Rev. 671, 676, 690-91 (2014). The subsequent monarchs, William and Mary, agreed to the English Bi ll of Rights, which stripped the monarchy of all suspending and dispensing authority. See English Bill of Rights of 1689, art. 1. 318. The Framers of the U.S. Constitution unanimously rejected a proposal to grant dispensing powers to the President. 319. The Supreme Court has held that the Take Care Clause does not grant the President a power to dispense with statutes: \"To contend that the obligation imposed on the President to see the laws fait hfully executed, implies a power to forbid their execution, is a novel construction of the [C]onstitution, and entirely inadmissible.\" Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes , 37 U.S. 524, 613 (1838). Any other conclusion would \"vest[] in the President a dispensing power.\" Id. 320. DACA dispenses with certain immigration statutes. 321. Just as King James attempted to make unlawful office-holding lawful, Price, supra, at 691, the Executive through DACA, Expanded DACA, and DAPA sought to make unlawful presence lawful. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 67 of 13768 322. Even worse than that, after the Executive made unlawful presence lawful through DACA, the Executive then us ed that lawful-prese nce dispensation to affirmatively confer United States citizens hip or a pathway to citizenship on some DACA recipients. 323. As Justice Scalia correctly noted, DACA is a program that involves \"biennial requests for dispensation \" from immigration statutes. Arizona, 567 U.S. at 435 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and di ssenting in part) (emphasis added). 324. OLC recognized that class-based deferred-action programs like DACA \"raise particular concerns about whether immigration officials have undertaken to substantively change\" immigration statutes, Exhibit 4 at 22, and \"effectively rewrite the laws to match the Executive's policy preferences,\" id. at 24. 325. DACA is unlawful even under the four-part test established by the OLC Memo under the Obama Administration delineating limitations imposed by \"the nature of the Take Care duty.\" Id. at 6-7. 326. First, OLC stated that a class-based deferred-action program must reflect the agency's expert judg ment about resource allocation, id. at 6, and must not confer legal status, id. at 20-21. 327. But DACA deems unlawful presence lawful\u2014a fact never mentioned by the OLC Memo. 328. DACA has even provided some recipients with United States citizenship or a pathway to citizenship\u2014a fact never mentioned by the OLC Memo. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 68 of 13769 329. DACA is a programmatic decision to confer benefits on hundreds of thousands of aliens. 330. Second, OLC stated that a class-based deferred-action program must be \"consonant with, rather than contrary to, the congressional policy underlying the [relevant] statutes.\" Id. at 6. 331. DACA is \"incompatible with the expr ess or implied will of Congress.\" Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). 332. DACA violates explicit and impl icit congressional objectives. 333. Third, OLC stated that a class-based deferred-action program cannot be an \"[a]bdication of the duties assigned to the agency by statute.\" Exhibit 4 at 7. 334. But DACA is an \"abdication\" of i mmigration statutes enumerating in careful detail which aliens may be lawfully present and obtain work authorization. Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 663. 335. DACA also is an \"abdication\" of immigration statutes enumerating in careful detail which aliens may obtain Unit ed States citizenship or a pathway to citizenship. Id. 336. Fourth, OLC stated that a class- based deferred-action program must allow for \"case-by-case\" discretion. Exhibit 4 at 7. 337. As explained above, see supra \u00b6\u00b6 289-303, DACA does not allow for case- by-case Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 69 of 13770 VI. The Court Should Declare that DACA Is Unlawful and Enjoin the Defendants Nationwide from Issuing or Renewing DACA Permits. 338. For the reasons explained above, the Court should enter a declaratory judgment that DACA is unlawful. 339. While the Court would have the power to enter an injunction immediately rescinding all DACA permits th at confer lawful presence and work authorization, Plaintiff States are amenabl e to an injunction that prospectively enjoins Defendants in the future from renewing or issuing any new DACA permits that confer lawful presence and work authorization, but does not require the Executive to immediately rescind any exis ting DACA permits that confer lawful presence or work authorization. Such an injunction would effectively phase out the DACA program within two years. 340. Such an injunction would account for any alleged reliance interests that aliens claim in DACA permits already received. Any such re liance interest, however, could not possibly extend beyond the existing two-year terms of those permits. The memorandum announcing DACA itself explic itly stated that \"DHS cannot provide any assurance that relief will be granted.\" Exhibit 1 at 2. 341. An injunction prohibiting the Execut ive from issuing or renewing DACA permits should apply to Defendants wherever they may act. 342. Both the Constitution and Congress have directed that the Nation needs a uniform, nationwide immigration policy. See Texas , 809 F.3d at 187-88. 343. Additionally, the Court should grant any and all other relief to which Plaintiff States may be entitled. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 70 of 13771 VII. The Deferred-Action Work-Authori zation Regulation Is Invalid as Applied to DACA and Expanded DACA Recipients. 344. An executive regulation declares th at \"an alien who has been granted deferred action\" can obtain employment au thorization from the federal government. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(c)(14). 345. Defendants have previously assert ed that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(c)(14) authorizes the federal government to grant work authorization to recipients of DAPA and Expanded DACA. See Defs.' Mem. P. & Inj. 7-8, 3d 591 (No. 1: 14-cv-254), ECF No. 38. 346. There is no statutory authorization for the regulation to be applied in this manner. Although 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(c)( 14) may be valid as applied to the four, narrow types of deferred action authorized by statute, it is not valid as applied to recipients of DACA, Expanded DACA, or DAPA\u2014which are not statutorily authorized. VIII. The Federal Benefits Triggered by Lawful Presence Cannot Be Validly Extended to DACA Recipients. 347. The classification of lawful presence is a requirement for myriad federal benefits, including Social Security, Medicare, and PRWORA-restricted benefits. See supra \u00b6\u00b6 38-40. 348. Conversely, time during which an alie n lacks the classification of lawful presence counts towards lengths of time that trigger a reentry bar. See supra \u00b6 41. 349. DACA confers lawful presence on individuals whose presence in this country is not lawful under th e Nation's immigration laws. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 71 of 13772 350. The statutory provisions conferring eligibility for benefits based on lawful presence cannot be validly applied to DACA recipients. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of the Take Care Clause 351. The allegations in paragraphs 1-351 are reincorporated herein. 352. Defendants' actions here in creating and implementing DACA violate the President's constitutional duty to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\" U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 3. To the extent Expanded DACA permits remain in effect, they also violate the same duty. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of the APA's Procedural Requirements, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 353. The allegations in paragraphs 1-353 are reincorporated herein. 354. Defendants have violated the APA by promulgating, implementing, and relying upon the DACA program without using the required APA notice-and- comment procedure. To the extend Expanded DACA permits remain in effect, they violate the same procedural law. THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of the APA's Substantive Requirements, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 355. The allegations in paragraphs 1-355 are reincorporated herein. 356. Defendants have acted contrary to la w and have violated 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 by creating and implementing DACA. To the extent Expanded DACA permits remain in effect, they violate the same substantive law. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 72 of 13773 PRAYER FOR RELIEF Underlying DACA is a dangerously broa d conception of Executive power\u2014one that if left unchecked, could allow future Executives to dismantle other duly enacted laws. The Court must not allow that to occu r. Plaintiff States respectfully request that the Court issue the following relief regarding DACA (and Expanded DACA, to the extent any permits remain in effect): A. An order enjoining Defendants from issuing or renewing any DACA permits in the future; B. A declaratory judgment that DACA violates the Take Care Clause; C. A declaratory judgment that DACA is procedurally unlawful under the APA; D. A declaratory judgment that DACA is substantively unlawful under the APA; and E. Any and all other relief to whic h Plaintiff States may be entitled. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 73 of 13774 Respectfully submitted.

Aguilar Secretary U.S. Department of Homeland Security W~hington. DC 20528 Homeland Security Acting Commiss ioner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Alejandro Mayorkas Director, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services John Morton Director, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Janet Napolitano Secretary of Home ccuf/7~ Exercising Prose orial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children By this memorandum, I am setting forth how, in the exercise of our prosecutorial discretion, the Department of Homeland Security (OHS) should enforce the Nation's immigration laws against certain young people who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as home. As a general matter, these individuals lacked the intent to violate the law and our ongoing review of pending removal cases is already offering administrat ive closure to many of them. However, additional measures are necessary to ensure that our enforcement resources are not expended on these low priority cases but are instead appropriate ly focused on people who meet our enforcement priorities. The following criteria should be satisfied before an individua l is considered for an exercise of prosecutorial discretion pursuant to this memorandum: came to the United States under the age of sixteen~ has continuously resided in the United States for a least five years preceding the date of this memorandum and is present in the United States on the date of this memorandum; is currently in school, has graduated from high school, has obtained a general education development certificate , or is an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States; has not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, multiple misdemeanor offenses, or otherwise poses a threat to national security or public safety; and is not above the age of thirty. www.dhs.gov Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 78 of 137 Our Nation's immigration laws must be enforced in a strong and sensible manner. They are not designed to be blindly enforced without consideration given to the individual circumstances of each case. Nor are they designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language. Indeed, many of these young people have already contributed to our country in significant ways. Prosecutorial discretion , which is used in so many other areas, is especially justified here. As part of this exercise of prosecutorial discretion, the above criteria are to be considered whether or not an individual is already in removal proceedings or subject to a final order of removal. No individual should receive deferred action under this memorandum unless they first pass a background check and requests for relief pursuant to this memorandum are to be decided on a case by case basis. DHS cannot provide any assurance that relief will be granted in all cases. 1. With respect to individuals who are encountered by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and BordelI' Protection (CBP), or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS): With respect to individuals who meet the above criteria, ICE and CBP should immediately exercise their discretion, on an individual basis, in order to prevent low priority individual s from being placed into removal proceedings or removed from the United States. USCIS is instructed to implement this memorandum consistent with its existing guidance regarding the issuance of notices to appear. 2. With respect to individual s who are in removal proceedings but not yet subject to a final order of removal, and who meet the above criteria: ICE should exercise prosecutorial discretion, on an individual basis, for individuals who meet the above criteria by deferring action for a period of two years, subject to renewal, in order to prevent low priority individuals from being removed from the United States. ICE is instructed to use its Office of the Public Advocate to permit individuals who believe they meet the above criteria to identify themselves through a clear and efficient process. ICE is directed to begin implementing this process within 60 days of the date of this memorandum. ICE is also instructed to immediately begin the process of deferring action against individuals who meet the above criteria whose cases have already been identified through the ongoing review of pending cases before the Executive Office for Immigration Review. 3. With respect to the individuals who are not currently in removal proceedings and meet the above criteria, and pass a background check: USCIS should establish a clear and efficient process for exercising prosecutorial discretion , on an individual basis, by deferring action against individuals who meet the 2 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 79 of 137 above criteria and are at least 15 years old, for a period of two years, subject to renewal, in order to prevent low priority individuals from being placed into removal proceedings or removed from the United States. The USCIS process shall also be available to individuals subject to a final order of removal regardless of their age. users is directed to begin implementing this process within 60 days of the date of this memorandum. For individuals who are granted deferred action by either ICE or USCIS, USCIS shall accept applications to determine whether these individuals qualify for work authorization during this period of deferred action. This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship. Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights. It remains for the executive branch, however, to set forth policy for the exercise of discretion within the framework of the existing law. I have done so here. 3 Exhibit 2 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 80 of 137Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 81 of 137 9 US Cllt:1t'11'l11p Number of Form !--82W,Cons 1derabon ~c.~1 \\it cs Fiscal YHr 20U-2017 (September 30) Requests C'ase&tatus Intake Biometrics ' case0eWew' . 2014 Initial 2014 Renewal 2015 2015 Initial 2015 Renewal 2016 2016 Initial 2016 Renewal 2017 2017 Initial 2017 Renewal Total Cumulative Total a request for usas to consider deferred removal action for an individual based on guidelines described in the sea-etary of Homeland security's memorandwn is.sued June t.s, 2012.

Winkowski Acting Director U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforceme nt R. Gil Kerlikowske Commission er U.S. Customs and Bor Secretary Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children and with Respect to Certain Individuals Who Are the Parents of U.S. Citizens or Permanent Residents This memorandum is intended to reflect new policies for the use of deferred action. By memoran dum dated June 15, 2012, Secretary Napolitano issued guidance entitled Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children. The following supplements and amends that guidance. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its immigration components are responsible for enforcing the Nation's immigration laws. Due to limited resources , DHS and its Components cannot respond to all immigration violations or remove all persons illegally in the United States. As is true of virtually every other law enforcement agency, DHS must exercise prosecutorial discretion in the enforcement of the law. Secretary Napolitano noted two years ago, when she issued her prosecutorial discretion guidance regarding children, that \"[o]ur Nation's immigration laws must be enforced in a strong and sensible manner. They are not designed to be blindly enforced without consideration given to the individual circumstances of each case.\" 1 www.dhs.gov Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 85 of 137 Deferred action is a long-standing administrative mechanism dating back decades, by which the Secretary of Homeland Security may defer the removal of an undocumented immigrant for a period oftime.1 A form of administrative relief similar to deferred action, known then as \"indefinite voluntary departure ,\" was originally authorized by the Reagan and Bush Administrations to defer the deportations of an estimated 1.5 million undocumented spouses and minor children who did not qualify for legalization under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Known as the \"Family Fairness\" program, the policy was specifically implemented to promote the humane enforcement of the law and ensure family unity. Deferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion by which the Secretary deprioritizes an individual's case for humanitarian reasons, administrative convenience, or in the interest of the Department's overall enforcement mission. As an act of prosecutorial discretion , deferred action is legally available so long as it is granted on a case-by-case basis, and it may be terminated at any time at the agency's discretion. Deferred action does not confer any form of legal status in this country, much less citizenship; it simply means that, for a specified period of time, an individual is permitted to be lawfully present in the United States. Nor can deferred action itself lead to a green card. Although deferred action is not expressly conferred by statute, the practice is referenced and therefore endorsed by implication in several federal statutes.2 Historically, deferred action has been used on behalf of particular individuals, and on a case-by-case basis, for classes of unlawfully present individuals, such as the spouses and minor children of certain legalized immigrants, widows of U.S. citizens, or victims of trafficking and domestic violence.3 Most recently, beginning in 2012, Secretary Napolitano issued guidance for case-by-case deferred action with respect to those who came to the United States as children, commonly referred to as \"DACA.\" 1 Deferred action, in one form or another, dates back to at least the 1960s. \"Deferred action\" per se dates back at least as far as 1975. See, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Operation Instructions\u00a7 103.l(a)(l)(ii) (1975). 2 INA\u00a7 204(a)(l)(D)(i)(II), (IV) (Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) self-petitioners not in removal proceedings are \"eligible for deferred action and employment authorization \"); INA\u00a7 237(d)(2) (DHS may grant stay of removal to applicants for Tor U visas but that denial of a stay request \"shall not preclude the alien from applying for ... deferred action\"); REAL ID Act of 2005 \u00a7 202(c)(2)(B)(viii), Pub. L. 109-13 (requiring states to examine documentary evidence oflawfal status for driver's license eligibility purposes, including \"approved deferred action status\"); National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 \u00a7 1703( c) ( d) Pub. L. 108-136 (spouse, parent or child of certain US. citizen who died as a result of honorable service may self-petition for permanent residence and \"shall be eligible for deferred action, advance parole, and work authorization \"). 3 In August 2001, the former-Immigration and Naturalization Service issued guidance providing deferred action to individuals who were eligible for the recently created U and T visas. Two years later, USCIS issued subsequent guidance, instructing its officers to use existing mechanisms like deferred action for certain U visa applicants facing potential removal. More recently, in June 2009, USCIS issued a memorandum providing deferred action to certain surviving spouses of deceased U.S. citizens and their children while Congress considered legislation to allow these individuals to qualify for permanent residence status. 2 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 86 of 137 By this memorandum, I am now expanding certain parameters of DACA and issuing guidance for case-by-case use of deferred action for those adults who have been in this country since January 1, 2010, are the parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, and who are otherwise not enforcement priorities, as set forth in the November 20, 2014 Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants Memorandum . The reality is that most individuals in the categories set forth below are hard-working people who have become integrated members of American society. Provided they do not commit serious crimes or otherwise become enforcement priorities, these people are extremely unlikely to be deported given this Department 's limited enforcement resources-which must continue to be focused on those who represent threats to national security, public safety, and border security. Case-by-case exercises of deferred action for children and long-standing members of American society who are not enforcement priorities are in this Nation's security and economic interests and make common sense, because they encourage these people to come out of the shadows, submit to background checks, pay fees, apply for work authorization (which by separate authority I may grant), and be counted. A. Expanding DACA DACA provides that those who were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012, who entered the United States before June 15, 2007 (5 years prior) as children under the age of 16, and who meet specific educational and public safety criteria, are eligible for deferred action on a case-by-case basis. The initial DACA announcement of June 15, 2012 provided deferred action for a period of two years. On June 5, 2014, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that DACA recipients could request to renew their deferred action for an additional two years. In order to further effectuate this program, I hereby direct USCIS to expand DACA as follows: Remove the age cap. DACA will apply to all otherwise eligible immigrants who entered the United States by the requisite adjusted entry date before the age of sixteen (16), regardless of how old they were in June 2012 or are today. The current age restriction excludes those who were older than 31 on the date of announcement (i.e., those who were born before June 15, 1981). That restriction will no longer apply. Extend DACA renewal and work authorization to three-years . The period for which DACA and the accompanying employment authorization is granted will be extended to three-year increments , rather than the current two-year increments. This change shall apply to all first-time applications as well as all applications for renewal effective November 24, 2014. Beginning on that date, USCIS should issue all work 3 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 87 of 137 authorization documents valid for three years, including to those individuals who have applied and are awaiting two-year work authorization documents based on the renewal of their DACA grants. USCIS should also consider means to extend those two-year renewals already issued to three years. Adjust the date-of-entry requirement. In order to align the DACA program more closely with the other deferred action authorization outlined below, the eligibility cut-off date by which a DACA applicant must have been in the United States should be adjusted from June 15, 2007 to January 1, 2010. USCIS should begin accepting applications under the new criteria from applicants no later than ninety (90) days from the date of this announcement. B. Expanding Deferred Action I hereby direct USCIS to establish a process, similar to DACA, for exercising prosecutorial discretion through the use of deferred action, on a case-by-case basis, to those individuals who: have, on the date of this memorandum, a son or daughter who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; have continuously resided in the United States since before January 1, 2010; are physically present in the United States on the date of this memorandum , and at the time of making a request for consideration of deferred action with USCIS; have no lawful status on the date of this memorandum; are not an enforcement priority as reflected in the November 20, 2014 Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants Memorandum ; and present no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion , makes the grant of deferred action inappropriate . Applicants must file the requisite applications for deferred action pursuant to the new criteria described above. Applicants must also submit biometrics for USCIS to conduct background checks similar to the background check that is required for DACA applicants. Each person who applies for deferred action pursuant to the criteria above shall also be eligible to apply for work authorization for the period of deferred action, pursuant to my authority to grant such authorization reflected in section 274A(h)(3) of 4 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 88 of 137 the Immigration and Nationality Act.4 Deferred action granted pursuant to the program shall be for a period of three years. Applicants will pay the work authorization and biometrics fees, which currently amount to $465. There will be no fee waivers and, like DACA, very limited fee exemptions. USCIS should begin accepting applications from eligible applicants no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date of this announcement. As with DACA, the above criteria are to be considered for all individuals encountered by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or USCIS, whether or not the individual is already in removal proceedings or subject to a final order of removal. Specifically: ICE and CBP are instructed to immediately begin identifying persons in their custody, as well as newly encountered individuals , who meet the above criteria and may thus be eligible for deferred action to prevent the further expenditure of enforcement resources with regard to these individuals. ICE is further instructed to review pending removal cases, and seek administrative closure or termination of the cases of individuals identified who meet the above criteria, and to refer such individuals to USCIS for case-by-case determinations. ICE should also establish a process to allow individua ls in removal proceedings to identify themselves as candidates for deferred action. USCIS is instructed to implement this memorandum consistent with its existing guidance regarding the issuance of notices to appear. The USCIS process shall also be available to individuals subject to final orders of removal who otherwise meet the above criteria. Under any of the proposals outlined above, immigration officers will be provided with specific eligibility criteria for deferred action, but the ultimate judgment as to whether an immigrant is granted deferred action will be determined on a case-by-case basis. This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship. Only an Act of Congress can confer these rights. It remains within the authority of the Executive Branch, however, to set forth policy for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action within the framework of existing law. This memorandum is an exercise of that authority. 4 INA \u00a7 274A(h)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 l 324a(h)(3) (\"As used in this section, the term 'unauthorized alien' means, with respect to the employment of an alien at a particular time, that the alien is not at that time either (A) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or (8) authorized to be so employed by this chapter or by the[Secretary].\"); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a. l 2 (regulations establishing classes of aliens eligible for work authorization). 5 Exhibit 4 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 89 of 137 1 The Department of Homeland Security's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present in the United States and to Defer Removal of Others The Department of Homeland Security's proposed poli cy to prioritize the removal of certain aliens unlawfully present in the United States would be a permissible exercise of DHS's discretion to enforce the immigration laws. The Department of Homeland Security's proposed de ferred action program for pa rents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents woul d also be a permissible exercise of DHS's discretion to enforce the immigration laws. The Department of Homeland Security's proposed defe rred action program for parents of recipients of deferred action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals pr ogram would not be a permissi- ble exercise of DHS's enforcement discretion. November 19, 2014 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT You have asked two questions concerning the scope of the Department of Homeland Security's discretion to enforce the immigration laws. First, you have asked whether, in light of the limited resources available to the Department (\"DHS\") to remove aliens unlawfully pr esent in the United States, it would be legally permissible for the Department to implement a policy prioritizing the removal of certain categories of aliens over others. DHS has explained that although there are approximately 11.3 million undocumented aliens in the country, it has the resources to remove fewer than 400,000 such aliens each year. DHS's proposed policy would prioritize the removal of aliens who present threats to national security, public safety, or border security. Under the proposed policy, DHS officials could remove an alien who did not fall into one of these categories provided that an Immigration and Cust oms Enforcement (\"ICE\") Field Office Director determined that \"removing su ch an alien would serve an important federal interest.\" Draft Memorandum for Thomas S. Winkowski, Acting Director, ICE, et al., from Jeh Charles Johnso n, Secretary of Homeland Security, Re: Policies for the Apprehension, Detention, and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants at 5 (Nov. 17, 2014) (\"Johnson Prioritization Memorandum\"). Second, you have asked whether it would be permissible for DHS to extend deferred action, a form of temporary admi nistrative relief from removal, to certain aliens who are the parents of children who are present in the United States. Specifically, DHS has proposed to implement a program under which an alien could apply for, and would be eligible to receive, deferred action if he or she is not a DHS removal priority under the policy described above; has continuously resided in the United States since before Ja nuary 1, 2010; has a child who is either a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident; is physically present in the United Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 90 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 2 States both when DHS announces its program and at the time of application for deferred action; and presents \"no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion, make[] the grant of deferred action inappropriate.\" Draft Memorandum for Leon Rodriguez, Director, U.S. C itizenship and Immigration Se rvices, et al., from Jeh Charles Johnson, Secretar y of Homeland Security, Re: Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children and Others at 4 (Nov. 17, 2014) (\"Johnson Deferred Action Memorandum\"). You have also asked whether DHS could implement a similar program for parents of individuals who have received deferred action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\") program. As has historically been true of deferred action, these proposed deferred action programs would not \"legalize\" any aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States: Deferred action does not confer any lawful immigration status, nor does it provide a path to obtaining permanent residence or citizenship. Grants of deferred action under the proposed programs would, rather, represent DHS's decision not to seek an alien's removal for a prescribed period of time. See generally Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm. , 525 U.S. 471, 483-84 (1999) (describing deferred action). Under decades-old regulati ons promulgated pursuant to authority delegated by Congress, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1103(a)(3), 1324a(h)(3), aliens who are granted deferred action\u2014like certain other categories of aliens who do not have lawful immigration status, such as asyl um applicants\u2014may apply for authoriza- tion to work in the United States in certain circumstances, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(c)(14) (providing that deferred action recipients may apply for work authorization if they can show an \"economic necessity for employment\"); see also 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 109.1(b)(7) (1982). Under DHS policy guidance, a grant of deferred action also suspends an alien's accrual of unlawful presence for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i) and (a)(9)(C)(i)(I), provisions that restrict the admission of aliens who have departed the United States after having been unlawfully present for specified periods of time. A grant of deferred action under the proposed programs would remain in effe ct for three years, subject to renewal, and could be terminated at any time at DHS's discretion. See Johnson Deferred Action Memorandum at 2, 5. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that DHS's proposed prioritiza- tion policy and its proposed deferred action program for parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents would be permissible exercises of DHS's discre-tion to enforce the immigration laws. We further conclude that, as it has been described to us, the proposed deferred action program for parents of DACA recipients would not be a permissible exercise of enforcement discretion. I. We first address DHS's authority to prioritize the removal of certain categories of aliens over others. We begin by discussing some of the sources and limits of Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 91 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 3 DHS's enforcement discretion under the immigration laws, and then analyze DHS's proposed prioritization policy in light of these considerations. A. DHS's authority to remove aliens from the United States rests on the Immigra- tion and Nationality Act of 1952 (\"INA\"), as amended, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101 et seq. In the INA, Congress established a comprehensive scheme governing immigration and naturalization. The INA specifies certain categories of aliens who are inadmissible to the United States. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182. It also specifies \"which aliens may be removed from the United States and the procedures for doing so.\" Arizona v. United States , 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2499 (2012). \"Aliens may be removed if they were inadmissible at the time of entr y, have been convicted of certain crimes, or meet other criteria set by federal law.\" Id. (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227); . . . in and admitted to the United States shall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be removed if the alien\" falls within one or more classes of deportable aliens); see also 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (listing classes of aliens ineligible to receive vi sas or be admitted to the United States). Removal proceedings ordinarily take place in federal immigration courts adminis- tered by the Executive Office for Immigration Review, a component of the Department of Justice. See id. \u00a7 1229a (governing removal proceedings); see also id. \u00a7\u00a7 1225(b)(1)(A), 1228(b) (setting out expedited removal procedures for certain arriving aliens and certain alie ns convicted of aggravated felonies). Before 2003, the Department of Justice, through the Immigration and Naturali- zation Service (\"INS\"), was also responsible for providing immigration-related administrative services and generally enforcing the immigration laws. In the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135, Congress transferred most of these functions to DHS, giving it primary responsibility both for initiating removal proceedings and for carrying out final orders of removal. See 6 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq.; see also Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 374 n.1 (2005) (noting that the immigration authorities previously exercised by the Attorney General and INS \"now reside\" in the S ecretary of Homeland Security and DHS). The Act divided INS's functions among three different agencies within DHS: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"), which oversees legal immigra-tion into the United States and provides immigration and naturalization services to aliens; ICE, which enforces federal laws governing customs, trade, and immigra- tion; and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\"), which monitors and secures the nation's borders and ports of entry. See Pub. L. No. 107-296, \u00a7\u00a7 403, 2195, 2205; see also Name Change From the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services , 69 Fed. Reg. 60938, 60938 (Oct. 13, 2004); Name Change of Two DHS Components , 75 Fed. Reg. 12445, 12445 (Mar. 16, 2010). The Secretary of Homeland Security is thus now \"charged with the administration and Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 92 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 4 enforcement of [the INA] and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(a)(1). As a general rule, when Congress vests enforcement authority in an executive agency, that agency has the discretion to decide whether a particular violation of the law warrants prosecution or other enforcement action. This discretion is rooted in the President's constitutional duty to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\" U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 3, and it reflects a recognition th at the \"faithful[]\" execution of the law does not necessarily entail \"act[ing] against each technical violation of the statute\" that an ag ency is charged with enforcing. Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831 (1985). Rather, as the Supreme Court explained in Chaney, the decision whether to initiate en forcement proceedin gs is a complex judgment that calls on ag ency to \"balanc[e] . . . a number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise.\" Id. These factors include \"whether agency resources are best spent on this violation or another, whether the agency is likely to succeed if it acts, whether the particul ar enforcement action requested best fits the agency's overall policies, and . . . whether the agency has enough resources to undertake the action at all.\" Id. at 831; cf. United States v. Armstrong , 517 U.S. 456, 465 (1996) (recognizing that exercise s of prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases involve consideration of \"'[s]uch fa ctors as the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence value, th e Government's enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to the Gove rnment's overall enforcement plan'\" (quoting Wayte v. United States , 470 U.S. 598, 607 (1985))). In Chaney, the Court considered and rejected a challenge to the Food and Drug Administration's refusal to initiate enforcement proceedings with respect to alleged violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, co ncluding that an agency's decision not to initiate enforcement proceedings is presumptively immune from judicial review. See 470 U.S. at 832. The Court explained that, while Congress may \"provide[] guidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers,\" in the absence of such \"legislativ e direction,\" an agency's non-enforcement determina- tion is, much like a prosecutor's decision not to indict, a \"special province of the Executive.\" Id. at 832-33. The principles of enforcement discretion discussed in Chaney apply with par- ticular force in the contex t of immigration. Congress enacted the INA against a background understanding that immigration is \"a field where flexibility and the adaptation of the congressional policy to infinitely variable conditions constitute the essence of the program.\" United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy , 338 U.S. 537, 543 (1950) (internal quotation marks omitted). Consistent with this under- standing, the INA vested the Attorney Ge neral (now the Secretary of Homeland Security) with broad authority to \"establish such regulations; . . . issue such instructions; and perform such other acts as he deems necessary for carrying out his authority\" under the statute. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(a)(3). Years later, when Congress created the Department of Homeland Se curity, it expressly charged DHS with responsibility for \"[e]stablishing national immigration enforcement policies and Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 93 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 5 priorities.\" Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, \u00a7 402(5), 116 Stat. 2135, 2178 (codified at 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 202(5)). With respect to removal decisions in particular, the Supreme Court has recog- nized that \"the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials\" is a \"principal feature of the removal system\" under the INA. Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2499. The INA expressly authorizes immigration offi cials to grant certain forms of discre- tionary relief from removal for aliens, including parole, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A); asylum, id. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A); and cancellation of removal, id. \u00a7 1229b. But in addition to administering these statutory form s of relief, \"[f]ederal officials, as an initial matter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all.\" Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2499. And, as the Co urt has explained, \"[a]t each stage\" of the removal process\u2014\"commenc[ing] pr [and] Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim. at U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g) (alterations in original)). Deci ding whether to pursue removal at each of these stages implicates a wide range of considerations. As the Court observed in Arizona: Discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces immedi- ate human concerns. Unauthorized workers trying to support their families, for example, likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who commit a serious crime. The equities of an individual case may turn on many factors, in cluding whether the alien has chil- dren born in the United States, long ties to the community, or a rec-ord of distinguished military service. Some discretionary decisions involve policy choices that bear on this Nation's international rela-tions. . . . The foreign state may be mired in civil war, complicit in political persecution, or enduring conditions that create a real risk that the alien or his family will be harmed upon return. The dynamic nature of relations with other countries requires the Executive Branch to ensure that enforcement policies are consistent with this Nation's foreign policy with respect to these and other realities. 132 S. Ct. at 2499. Immigration officials' discretion in enfo rcing the laws is not, however, unlim- ited. Limits on enforcement discretion are both implicit in, and fundamental to, the Constitution's allocation of governmental powers between the two political branches. See, e.g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , 343 U.S. 579, 587- 88 (1952). These limits, however, are not clearly defined. The open-ended nature of the inquiry under the Take Care Clause\u2014whether a particular exercise of discretion is \"faithful[]\" to the law enacted by Congress\u2014does not lend itself easily to the application of set formulas or bright-line rules. And because the exercise of enforcement discretion genera lly is not subject to judicial review, see Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 94 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 6 Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831-33, neither the Supreme Court nor the lower federal courts have squarely addressed its constitutional bounds. Rather, the political branches have addressed the proper allocation of enforcement authority through the political process. As the Court noted in Chaney, Congress \"may limit an agency's exercise of enforcement power if it wishes, either by setting substantive priorities, or by otherwise circumscribing an agency's power to discriminate among issues or cases it will pursue.\" Id. at 833. The history of immigration policy illustrates this principle: Since the INA was enacted, the Executive Branch has on numerous occasions exercised discretion to extend various forms of immigration relief to categories of aliens for humanitarian, foreign policy, and other reasons. When Congress has been dissatisfied with Executive action, it has responded, as Chaney suggests, by enacting legislation to limit the Executive's discretion in enforcing the immigration laws. 1 Nonetheless, the nature of the Take Care duty does point to at least four general (and closely related) principles governing the permissible scope of enforcement discretion that we believe are particularly relevant here. First, enforcement decisions should reflect \"factors which are peculiarly within [the enforcing agency's] expertise.\" Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. Those factors may include considerations related to agency resources, such as \"whether the agency has enough resources to undertake the action,\" or \"whether agency resources are best spent on this violation or another.\" Id. Other relevant considerations may include \"the proper ordering of [the agency's] priorities,\" id. at 832, and the agency's \"whether the particular enfo rcement action [at best fits the agency's overall policies,\" id. at 831. Second, the Executive cannot, under the guise of exercising enforcement dis- cretion, attempt to effectively rewrite the laws to match its policy preferences. See id. at 833 (an agency may not \"disregard legislative direction in the statutory scheme that [it] administers\"). In other words, an agency's enforcement decisions should be consonant with, rather than contrary to, the congressional policy underlying the statutes the agency is charged with administering. Cf. Youngstown , 343 U.S. at 637 (Jackson, J., concurring) (\"When the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.\"); Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife , 551 U.S. 644, 658 (2007) (explaining that where Congress has given an agency the power to administer a statutory scheme, a court w ill not vacate the agency's decision about the proper administration of the statute unless, among other things, the agency \"'has relied on factors which Congress had not intended it to consider'\" (quoting 1 See, e.g., Adam B. Cox & Cristina M. Rodr\u00edguez, The President and Immigration Law , 119 Yale L.J. 458, 503-05 (2009) (describing Congress's response to its dissatisfaction with the Executive's use of parole power for refugee populations in the 1960s and 1970s); see also, e.g. , infra note 5 (discussing legislative limitations on voluntary depart ure and extended voluntary departure). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 95 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 7 Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. , 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983))). Third, the Executive Branch ordinarily cannot, as the Court put it in Chaney, \"'consciously and expressly adopt[] a general policy' that is so extreme as to amount to an abdication of its statutor y responsibilities.\" 470 U.S. at 833 n.4 (quoting Adams v. Richardson , 480 F.2d 1159, 1162 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (en banc)); see id. (noting that in situations where an agency had adopted such an extreme policy, \"the statute conferring authority on the agency might indicate that such decisions were not 'committed to agency discretion'\"). Abdication of the duties assigned to the agency by statute is ordinarily incompatible with the constitutional obligation to faithfully execute the laws. But see, e.g., Presidential Authority to Decline to Execute Unconstitutional Statutes , 18 Op. O.L.C. 199, 200 (1994) (noting that under the Take Care Clause, \"the President is required to act in accordance with the laws\u2014including th e Constitution, which takes precedence over other forms of law\"). Finally, lower courts, following Chaney, have indicated that non-enforcement decisions are most comfortably characterized as judici ally unreviewable exercises of enforcement discretion when they are made on a case-by-case basis. See, e.g., Kenney v. Glickman , 96 F.3d 1118, 1123 Pe\u00f1a , 37 F.3d 671, 676-77 (D.C. Cir. 1994). That reading of Chaney reflects a conclusion that case-by- case enforcement decisions generally avoid the concerns mentioned above. Courts have noted that \"single-shot non-enforcement decisions\" almost inevitably rest on \"the sort of mingled assessments of fact, policy, and law . . . that are, as Chaney recognizes, peculiarly expertise and discretion.\" Crowley Caribbean Transp. , 37 F.3d at 676- 77 (emphasis omitted). Individual enforcement decisions made on the basis of case-specific factors are also unlikely to constitute \"general polic[ies] that [are] so extreme as to amount to an abdication of [the agency's] statutory responsibilities.\" Id. at 677 (quoting Chaney, 477 U.S. at 833 n.4). That does not mean that all \"general policies\" respecting non-enforcem ent are categorically forbidden: Some \"general policies\" may, for example, merely provide a framework for making individualized, discretionary assessments about whether to initiate enforcement actions in particular cases. Cf. Reno v. Flores , 507 U.S. 292, 313 (1993) (explain- ing that an agency's use of \"reasonable presumptions and generic rules\" is not incompatible with a requirement to make individualized determinations). But a general policy of non-enforcement that fo recloses the exercise of case-by-case discretion poses \"special risks\" that the agency has exceeded the bounds of its enforcement discretion. Crowley Caribbean Transp. , 37 F.3d at 677. B. We now turn, against this backdrop, to DHS's proposed prioritization policy. In their exercise of enforcement discretion, DHS and its predecesso r, INS, have long Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 96 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 8 employed guidance instructing immigrati on officers to prior itize the enforcement of the immigration laws against certain ca tegories of aliens and to deprioritize their enforcement against others. See, e.g. , INS Operating Instructions \u00a7 103(a)(1)(i) (1962); Memorandum for All Field Office Directors, ICE, et al., from John Morton, Director, ICE, Re: Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion Consistent with the Civil Immigration Enforcement Priorities of the Agency for the Apprehension, Detention, and Removal of Aliens (June 17, 2011); Memorandum for All ICE Employees, from John Morton, Director, ICE, Re: Civil Immigration Enforcement: Priorities for the Apprehension, Detention, and Removal of Aliens (Mar. 2, 2011); Memorandum for Regional Directors, INS, et al., from Doris Meissner, Commissioner, INS, Re: Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion (Nov. 17, 2000). The policy DHS proposes, which is similar to but would supersede earlier policy guidance, is designed to \"provide cl earer and more effective guidance in the pursuit\" of DHS's enforcement priorities; namely, \"threats to national security, public safety and border security.\" Johnson Prioritization Memorandum at 1. Under the proposed policy, DHS would identify three categories of undocu- mented aliens who would be priorities for removal from the United States. See generally id. at 3-5. The highest priority category would include aliens who pose particularly serious threats to national security, border security, or public safety, including aliens engaged in or suspected of espionage or terrorism, aliens convict-ed of offenses related to participation in criminal street gangs, aliens convicted of certain felony offenses, and aliens appreh ended at the border while attempting to enter the United States unlawfully. See id. at 3. The second-highest priority would include aliens convicted of multiple or significant misdemeanor offenses; aliens who are apprehended after unlawfully entering the United States who cannot establish that they have been continuously present in the United States since January 1, 2014; and aliens determined to have significantly abused the visa or visa waiver programs. See id. at 3-4. The third priority category would include other aliens who have been issued a final order of removal on or after January 1, 2014. See id. at 4. The policy would also provide that none of these aliens should be prioritized for removal if they \"qualify for asylum or another form of relief under our laws.\" Id. at 3-5. The policy would instruct that resources should be directed to these priority categories in a manner \"commensurate with the level of prioritization identified.\" Id. at 5. It would, however, also leave significant room for immigration officials to evaluate the circumstances of individual cases. See id. (stating that the policy \"requires DHS personnel to exercise discretion based on individual circumstanc- es\"). For example, the policy would pe rmit an ICE Field Office Director, CBP Sector Chief, or CBP Director of Field Operations to deprioritize the removal of an alien falling in the highest priority category if, in her judgment, \"there are compelling and exceptional factors that clearly indicate the alien is not a threat to national security, border security, or public safety and should not therefore be an enforcement priority.\" Id. at 3. Similar discretionary provisions would apply to Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 97 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 9 aliens in the second and third priority categories.2 The policy would also provide a non-exhaustive list of factors DHS personnel should consider in making such deprioritization judgments.3 In addition, the policy would expressly state that its terms should not be construed \"to prohibit or discourage the apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens unlawfully in the United States who are not identified as priorities,\" and would furt her provide that \"[i]mmigration officers and attorneys may pursue removal of an alien not identified as a priority\" if, \"in the judgment of an ICE Field Office Direct or, removing such an alien would serve an important federal interest.\" Id. at 5. DHS has explained that the proposed policy is designed to respond to the prac- tical reality that the number of aliens who are removable under the INA vastly exceeds the resources Congress has made available to DHS for processing and carrying out removals. The resource constr aints are striking. As noted, DHS has informed us that there are approximately 11.3 million undocumented aliens in the country, but that Congress has appropriated sufficient resources for ICE to remove fewer than 400,000 aliens each year, a significant percentage of whom are typically encountered at or near the bord er rather than in the interior of the country. See E-mail for Karl R. Thompson, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, from David Shahoulian, Deputy General Counsel, DHS, Re: Immigration Opinion (Nov. 19, 2014) (\"Shahoulian E-mail\"). The proposed policy explains that, becau se DHS \"cannot respond to all immigra- tion violations or remove all persons illegally in the United States,\" it seeks to \"prioritize the use of enforcement personn el, detention space, and removal assets\" to \"ensure that use of its limited resources is devoted to the pursuit of\" DHS's highest priorities. Johnson Prio ritization Memorandum at 2. In our view, DHS's proposed prioritization policy falls within the scope of its lawful discretion to enforce the immigration laws. To begin with, the policy is based on a factor clearly \"within [DHS's] expertise.\" Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. Faced with sharply limited resources, DH S necessarily must make choices about which removals to pursue and which removals to defer. DHS's organic statute itself recognizes this inevitable fact, instru cting the Secretary to establish \"national 2 Under the proposed policy, aliens in the second tier could be deprioritized if, \"in the judgment of an ICE Field Office Director, CBP Sector Chief, CBP Director of Field Operations, USCIS District Director, or USCIS Service Center Director, there ar e factors indicating the alien is not a threat to national security, border security, or public safety , and should not therefore be an enforcement priority.\" Johnson Prioritization Memo randum at 4. Aliens in the third tier could be deprioritized if, \"in the judgment of an immigration officer, the alien is not a threat to the inte grity of the immigration system or there are factors suggesting the a lien should not be an enforcement priority.\" Id. at 5. 3 These factors include \"extenuating circumstances involving the offense of conviction; extended length of time since the offense of conviction; length of time in the United States; military service; family or community ties in the United States; status as a victim, witness or plaintiff in civil or criminal proceedings; or compelling humanitarian factors such as poor health, age, pregnancy, a young child or a seriously ill relative.\" Johnson Prioritization Memorandum at 6. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 98 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 10 immigration enforcement policies and pr iorities.\" 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 202(5). And an agency's need to ensure that scarce enforcement resources are used in an effective manner is a quintessential basis for the use of prosecutorial discretion. See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831 (among the factor s \"peculiarly within [an agency's] expertise\" are \"whether agency resources are best spent on this violation or another\" and \"whether the agency has en ough resources to undertake the action at all\"). The policy DHS has proposed, moreover, is consistent with the removal priori- ties established by Congress. In appr opriating funds for DHS's enforcement activities\u2014which, as noted, are sufficient to permit the removal of only a fraction of the undocumented aliens currently in the country\u2014Congress has directed DHS to \"prioritize the identification and removal of aliens convicted of a crime by the severity of that crime.\" Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014, Pub. L. No. 113-76, div. F, tit. II , 128 Stat. 5, 251 (\"DHS Appropriations Act\"). Consistent with this directive, the proposed policy prioritizes individuals convicted of criminal offenses involving active participation in a criminal street gang, most offenses classified as felonies in the convicting jurisdiction, offenses classified as \"aggravated felonies\" u nder the INA, and certain misdemeanor offenses. Johnson Prioritization Memorandum at 3-4. The policy ranks these priority categories according to the severity of the crim e of conviction. The policy also prioritizes the removal of other categories of aliens who pose threats to national security or border security, matters about which Congress has demon- strated particular concern. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c)(1)(D) (providing for detention of aliens charged with removability on national security grounds); id. \u00a7 1225(b) & (c) (providing for an expedited removal process for certain aliens apprehended at the border). The policy thus raises no concern that DHS has relied \"on factors which Congress had not intended it to consider.\" Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders, 551 U.S. at 658. Further, although the proposed policy is not a \"single-shot non-enforcement decision,\" neither does it amount to an abdication of DHS's statutory responsibili-ties, or constitute a legislative rule overriding the commands of the substantive statute. Crowley Caribbean Transp. , 37 F.3d at 676-77. The proposed policy provides a general framework for exercising enforcement discretion in individual cases, rather than establishing an absolute, inflexible policy of not enforcing the immigration laws in certain categories of cases. Given that the resources Congress has allocated to DHS are sufficient to remove only a small fraction of the total population of undocumented aliens in the United States, setting forth written guidance about how resources should presumptively be allocated in particular cases is a reasonable means of ensuring that DHS's severely limited resources are systematically directed to its highest priorities across a large and diverse agency, as well as ensuring consistency in the administration of the removal system. The proposed policy's identification of categories of aliens who constitute removal Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 99 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 11 priorities is also consistent with the categ orical nature of Congress's instruction to prioritize the removal of criminal a liens in the DHS Appropriations Act. And, significantly, the proposed policy does not identify any category of re- movable aliens whose removal may not be pursued under any circumstances. Although the proposed policy limits the discretion of immigration officials to expend resources to remove non-priority aliens, it does not eliminate that discre- tion entirely. It directs immigr ation officials to use their resources to remove aliens in a manner \"commensurate with the leve l of prioritization identified,\" but (as noted above) it does not \"prohibit or discourage the apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens unlawfully in the United States who are not identified as priorities.\" Johnson Prioritization Memora ndum at 5. Instead, it authorizes the removal of even non-priority aliens if, in the judgment of an ICE Field Office Director, \"removing such an alien would serve an important federal interest,\" a standard the policy leaves open-ended. Id. Accordingly, the policy provides for case-by-case determinations about whethe r an individual alien's circumstances warrant the expenditure of removal resources, employing a broad standard that leaves ample room for the exercise of individualized discretion by responsible officials. For these reasons, the proposed policy avoids the difficulties that might be raised by a more inflexible prioritization policy and dispels any concern that DHS has either undertaken to rewrite the immigration laws or abdicated its statutory responsibilities with re spect to non-priority aliens. 4 II. We turn next to the permissibility of DHS's proposed deferred action programs for certain aliens who are parents of U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents (\"LPRs\"), or DACA recipients, and who are not removal priorities under the proposed policy discussed above. We begin by discussing the history and current practice of deferred action. We then discuss the legal authorities on which deferred 4 In Crane v. Napolitano , a district court recently conclude d in a non-precedential opinion that the INA \"mandates the initiation of removal proceedings whenever an immigrati on officer encounters an illegal alien who is not 'clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted.'\" Opinion and Order Respecting Pl. App. for Prelim. Inj. Relief, No. 3:12-cv-03247-O, 2013 WL 1744422, at Tex. Apr. 23) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(b)(2)(A)). The court later dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. See Crane v. Napolitano , No. 3:12-cv-03247-O, 2013 WL 8211660, at *4 (N.D. Tex. July 31). Although the opinion lacks precedential value, we have nevert heless considered whether, as it suggests, the text of the INA categorically forecloses the exerci se of enforcement discretion with respect to aliens who have not been formally admitted. The district c ourt's conclusion is, in our view, inconsistent with the Supreme Court's reading of the INA as permitting immigration officials to exercise enforcement discretion at any stage of the removal process, including when deciding whet her to initiate removal proceedings against a particular alien. See Arizona , 132 S. Ct. at 2499; Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm. , 525 U.S. at 483-84. It is also difficult to square with authority holding that the presence of mandatory language in a statute, standing alone, does not necessarily limit the Executiv e Branch's enforcement discretion, see, e.g., Chaney, 470 U.S. at 835; Inmates of Attica Corr. Facility v. Rockefeller , 477 F.2d 375, 381 (2d Cir. 1973). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 100 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 12 action relies and identify legal principles against which the proposed use of deferred action can be evaluated. Finally, we turn to an analysis of the proposed deferred action programs themselves, beginning with the program for parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs, and concluding with the program for parents of DACA recipients. A. In immigration law, the term \"deferred ac tion\" refers to an exercise of adminis- trative discretion in which immigration officials temporarily defer the removal of an alien unlawfully present in the United States. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm. , 525 U.S. at 484 (citing 6 Charles Gordon et al., Immigration Law and Procedure \u00a7 72.03[2][h] (1998)); see USCIS, Standard Operating Procedures for Handling Deferred Action Requests at USCIS Field Offices at 3 (2012) (\"USCIS SOP\"); INS Operating Instructions \u00a7 103.1(a)(1)(ii) (1977). It is one of a number of forms of discretionary relief\u2014in addition to such statutory and non-statutory measures as parole, temporary protected status, deferred enforced departure, and extended voluntary departure\u2014that immigration officials have used over the years to temporarily prevent the removal of undocumented aliens. 5 5 Parole is available to aliens by statute \"for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A). Among other things, parole gives al iens the ability to adjust their status without leaving the United States if they are otherwise eligible fo r adjustment of status, see id. \u00a7 1255(a), and may eventually qualify them for Federal means-tested benefits, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 1613, 1641(b)(4). Temporary protected status is available to nationals of designated foreign states affected by armed conflicts, environmental disaster s, and other extraordinary conditions. Id. \u00a7 1254a. Deferred enforced departure, which \"has no statutory basis\" but rather is an exercise of \"the President's constitutional powers to conduct foreign relations,\" ma y be granted to nationals of appropriate foreign states. USCIS, Adjudicator's Field Manual \u00a7 38. 2(a) (2014). Extended voluntary departure was a remedy derived from the voluntary departure statute, which, before its amendment in 1996, permitted the Attorney General to make a finding of removability if an alien agreed to voluntarily depart the United States, without imposing a time limit for the alien's departure. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(b), U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c (current provision of the INA providing authority to grant voluntary departure, but limiting such grants to 120 days). Some commentators, however, suggested that extended voluntary departure was in fact a form of \"discretionary relief formulated administrative- ly under the Attorney General's general authority for enforcing immigration law.\" Sharon Stephan, Cong. Research Serv., 85-599 EPW, Extended Voluntary Departure and Other Grants of Blanket Relief from Deportation at 1 (Feb. 23, 1985). It appears that ex tended voluntary departure is no longer used following enactment of the Immigr ation Act of 1990, which establishe d the temporary protected status program. See U.S. Citizenship and Immigr ation Services Fee Schedule , 75 Fed. Reg. 33446, 33457 (June 11, 2010) (proposed rule) (noting that \"since 1 990 neither the Attorney General nor the Secretary have designated a class of aliens for nationality-based 'extended vol untary departure,' and there no longer are aliens in the United States benefiting from such a designation,\" but noting that deferred enforced departure is still used); H.R. Rep. No. 10 2-123, at 2 (1991) (indicati ng that in establishing temporary protected status, Congress was \"codif [ying] and supersed[ing]\" extended voluntary departure). See generally Andorra Bruno et al., Cong. Research Serv., Analysis of June 15, 2012 DHS Memorandum, Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Re spect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children at 5-10 (July 13, 2012) (\"CRS Immigration Report\"). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 101 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 13 The practice of granting deferred action dates back several decades. For many years after the INA was enacted, INS exercised prosecutorial discretion to grant \"non-priority\" status to removable aliens who presented \"appealing humanitarian factors.\" Letter for Leon Wildes, from E. A. Loughran, Associate Commissioner, INS at 2 (July 16, 1973) (defining a \"non-priority case\" as \"one in which the Service in the exercise of discretion de termines that adverse action would be unconscionable because of appea ling humanitarian factors\"); see INS Operating Instructions \u00a7 103.1(a)(1)(ii) (1962). This form of administrative discretion was later termed \"deferred action.\" Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm. , INS Operating Instructions \u00a7 103.1(a)(1)(ii) (1977) (instructing immigration officers to recommend deferred action whenever \"adverse action would be unconscionable because of the existence of appealing humanitarian factors\"). Although the practice of granting deferr ed action \"developed without express statutory authorization,\" it has become a regular feature of the immigration removal system that has been acknowledged by both Congress and the Supreme Court. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm. , 525 U.S. at 484 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id. at 485 (noting that a congressional enactment limiting judicial review of decisions \"to commence proc eedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders under [the INA]\" in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g) \"seems clearly designed to give some measure of protection to 'no deferred action' decisions and similar discretionary determinations\"); see also, e.g. , 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(II), (IV) (providing that certain individuals are \"eligible for deferred action\"). Deferred action \"does not confer any immigration status\"\u2014i.e., it does not establish any enforceable legal right to remain in the United States\u2014and it may be revoked by immigration authorities at their discretion. USCIS SOP at 3, 7. Assuming it is not revoked, however, it represents DHS's decision not to seek the alien's removal for a specified period of time. Under longstanding regulations and policy guidance promulgated pursuant to statutory authority in the INA, deferred action recipients may receive two additional benefits. First, relying on DHS' s statutory authority to authorize certain aliens to work in the United States, DHS regulations permit recipients of deferred action to apply for work authorization if they can demonstrate an \"economic necessity for employment.\" 8 C.F.R. an \"unauthorized alien\" not entitled to work in the United States as an alien who is neither an LPR nor \"authorized to be . . . employed by [the INA] or by the Attorney General [now the Secret ary of Homeland Security]\"). Second, DHS has promulgated regulations and issued policy guidance providing that aliens who receive deferred action will tem porarily cease accruing \"unlawful presence\" for purposes Memorandum for Field Leadership, from Donald Neufeld, Acting Associate Director, Domestic Operations Direc- torate, USCIS, Re: Consolidation of Guidance Concerning Unlawful Presence for Purposes of Sections 212(a)(9)(B)(i) and 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act at 42 Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 102 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 14 (May 6, 2009) (\"USCIS Consolidation of Guidance\") (noting that \"[a]ccrual of unlawful presence stops on the date an alien is granted deferred action\"); see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii) (providing that an alien is \"unlawfully present\" if, among other things, he \"is present in the United States after the expiration of the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General\").6 Immigration officials today continue to grant deferred action in individual cases for humanitarian and other purposes, a practice we will refer to as \"ad hoc deferred action.\" Recent USCIS guidance provides that personnel may recommend ad hoc deferred action if they \"encounter cases during [their] normal course of business that they feel warrant deferred action.\" USCIS SOP at 4. An alien may also apply for ad hoc deferred action by submitting a signed, written request to USCIS containing \"[a]n explanation as to why he or she is seeking deferred action\" along with supporting documentatio n, proof of identity, and other records. Id. at 3. For decades, INS and later DHS have also implemented broader programs that make discretionary relief from removal availa ble for particular cl asses of aliens. In many instances, these agencies have made such broad-based relief available through the use of parole, temporary protected status, deferred enforced departure, or extended voluntary departure. For example, from 1956 to 1972, INS imple-mented an extended voluntary departure program for physically present aliens who were beneficiaries of approved visa pe titions\u2014known as \"Third Preference\" visa petitions\u2014relating to a specific class of visas for Eastern Hemisphere natives. See United States ex rel. Parco v. Morris , 426 F. Supp. 9 76, 979-80 (E.D. Pa. 1977). Similarly, for several years beginning in 1978, INS granted extended voluntary departure to nurses who were eligible for H-1 visas. Voluntary Departure for Out- of-Status Nonimmigrant H-1 Nurses , 43 Fed. Reg. 2776, 2776 (Jan. 19, 1978). In addition, in more than two dozen instances dating to 1956, INS and later DHS granted parole, temporary protected status, deferred enforced departure, or extended voluntary departure to large numbers of nationals of designated foreign states. See, e.g., CRS Immigration Report at 20-23; Cong. Research Serv., ED206779, Review of U.S. Refugee Resettlement Programs and Policies at 9, 12- 14 (1980). And in 1990, INS implemented a \"Family Fairness\" program that authorized granting extended voluntary departure and work authorization to the estimated 1.5 million spouses and children of aliens who had been granted legal status under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-603, 100 Stat. 3359 (\"IRCA\"). See Memorandum for Regional Commissioners, 6 Section 1182(a)(9)(B)(i) imposes three- and ten-y ear bars on the admission of aliens (other than aliens admitted to permanent residence) who depart ed or were removed from the United States after periods of unlawful presence of between 180 days and one year, or one year or more. Section 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) imposes an indefinite bar on the admission of any alien who, without being admitted, enters or attempts to reenter the Unite d States after previously having been unlawfully present in the United Stat es for an aggregate period of more than one year. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 103 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 15 INS, from Gene McNary, Commissioner, INS, Re: Family Fairness: Guidelines for Voluntary Departure under 8 CFR 242.5 for the Ineligible Spouses and Children of Legalized Aliens (Feb. 2, 1990) (\"Family Fairness Memorandum\"); see also CRS Immigration Report at 10. On at least five occasions since the la te 1990s, INS and later DHS have also made discretionary relief available to certain classes of aliens through the use of deferred action: 1. Deferred Action for Battered Aliens Under the Violence Against Women Act. INS established a class-based deferred action program in 1997 for the benefit of self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (\"VAWA\"), Pub. L. No. 103-322, tit. IV, 108 Stat. 1796, 1902. VAWA authorized certain aliens who have been abused by U.S. citizen or LPR spouses or parents to self-petition for lawful immigration status, without having to rely on their abusive family members to petition on their behalf. Id. \u00a7 40701(a) (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii) -(iv), (vii)). The INS program required immigration officers who approved a VAWA self-petition to assess, \"on a case-by-case basis, whether to place the alien in deferred action status\" while the alien waited for a visa to become available. Memorandum fo r Regional Directors et al., INS, from Paul W. Virtue, Acting Executive Associate Commissioner, INS, Re: Supple- mental Guidance on Battered Alien Self-Petitioning Process and Related Issues at 3 (May 6, 1997). INS noted that \"[b]y their nature, VAWA cases generally possess factors that warrant cons ideration for deferred action.\" Id. But because \"[i]n an unusual case, there may be fact ors present that would militate against deferred action,\" the agency instructed officers that requests for deferred action should still \"receive in dividual scrutiny.\" Id. In 2000, INS reported to Congress that, because of this program, no ap proved VAWA self-petitioner had been removed from the country. See Battered Women Immigrant Protection Act: Hearings on H.R. 3083 Before the Subcomm. on Immigration and Claims of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary , 106th Cong. at 43 (July 20, 2000) (\"H.R. 3083 Hear- ings\"). 2. Deferred Action for T and U Visa Applicants. Several years later, INS insti- tuted a similar deferred action program for applicants for nonimmigrant status or visas made available under the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (\"VTVPA\"), Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1464. That Act created two new nonimmigrant classifications: a \"T visa\" available to victims of human trafficking and their family members, and a \"U visa\" for victims of certain other crimes and their family members. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 107(e), 1513(b)(3) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(T)(i), (U)(i)). In 2001, INS issued a memorandum directing immigration officers to locate \"possible victims in the above categories,\" and to use \"[e]xisting authority and mechanisms such as paro le, deferred action, and stays of removal\" to prevent those victims' removal \"until they have had the opportunity to avail themselves of the provisions of the VTVPA.\" Memorandum Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 104 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 16 for Michael A. Pearson, Executive Asso ciate Commissioner, INS, from Michael D. Cronin, Acting Executive Associate Commissioner, INS, Re: Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (VTVPA) Policy Memorandum #2\u2014\"T\" and \"U\" Nonimmigrant Visas at 2 (Aug. 30, 2001). In subsequent memoranda, INS instructed officers to make \"deferred action assessment[s]\" for \"all [T visa] applicants whose applications have been determined to be bona fide,\" Memorandum for Johnny N. Williams, Executive Associate Commissioner, INS, from Stuart Anderson, Executive Associate Commissioner, INS, Re: Deferred Action for Aliens with Bona Fide Applications for T Nonimmigrant Status at 1 (May 8, 2002), as well as for all U visa applicants \"determined to have submitted prima facie evidence of [their] eligibility,\" Memorandum for the Director, Vermont Service Center, INS, fr om William R. Yates, USCIS, Re: Centralization of Interim Relief for U Nonimmigrant Status Applicants at 5 (Oct. 8, 2003). In 2002 and 2007, INS and DHS promulgated regulations embodying these policies. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.11(k)(1), (k)(4), (m)(2) (promulgated by New Classification for Victims of Severe Forms of Trafficking in Persons; Eligibility for \"T\" Nonimmi- grant Status , 67 Fed. Reg. 4784, 4800-01 (Jan. 31, 2002)) (providing that any T visa applicant who presents \" prima facie evidence\" of his elig ibility should have his removal \"automatically stay[ed]\" and th at applicants placed on a waiting list for visas \"shall maintain [their] current means to prevent removal (deferred action, parole, or stay of removal)\"); id. \u00a7 214.14(d)(2) (promulgated by New Classifica- tion for of Criminal Activity; Eligibility for \"U\" Nonimmigrant Status , 72 Fed. Reg. 53014, 53039 (Sept. 17, 2 007)) (\"USCIS will grant deferred action or parole to U-1 petitioners and qualifying family members while the U-1 petitioners are on the waiting list\" for visas.). 3. Deferred Action for Foreign Students Affected by Hurricane Katrina. As a consequence of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, several thousand foreign students became temporarily unable to satisfy the requirements for maintaining their lawful status as F-1 nonimmigrant students, which include \"pursuit of a 'full course of study.'\" USCIS, Interim Relief for Certain Foreign Academic Students Adversely Affected by Hurricane Katrina: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) at 1 (Nov. 25, 2005) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2(f)(6)), available at http//www.uscis.gov/sites/default/file visited Nov. 19, 2014). DHS announced that it would grant deferred action to these students \"based on the fact that [their] failure to maintain status is directly due to Hurricane Katrina.\" Id. at 7. To apply for deferred action under this program, students were required to send a letter substantiating their need for deferred actio n, along with an ap plication for work authorization. Press Release, USCIS, USCIS Announces Interim Relief for Foreign Students Adversely Impacted by Hurricane Katrina at 1-2 (Nov. 25, 2005), available at http://www.uscis.gov/sites/defau lt/files/files/pressrelease/F1Student_ 11_25_05_PR.pdf (last visited Nov. 19, 2014). USCIS explained that such Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 105 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 17 requests for deferred action would be \"d ecided on a case-by-case basis\" and that it could not \"provide any assurance that all such requests will be granted.\" Id. at 1. 4. Deferred Action for Widows and Widowers of U.S. Citizens. In 2009, DHS implemented a deferred action program for certain widows and widowers of U.S. citizens. USCIS explained that \"no avenue of immigration relief exists for the surviving spouse of a deceased U.S. citi zen if the surviving spouse and the U.S. citizen were married less than 2 years at the time of the citizen's death\" and USCIS had not yet adjudicated a visa petition on the spouse's behalf. Memoran-dum for Field Leadership, USCIS, from Donald Neufeld, Acting Associate Director, USCIS, Re: Guidance Regarding Surviving Spouses of Deceased U.S. Citizens and Their Children at 1 (Sept. 4, 2009). \"In order to address humanitarian concerns arising from cases involving surv iving spouses of U.S. citizens,\" USCIS issued guidance permitting covered surviving spouses and \"their qualifying children who are residing in the United States\" to apply for deferred action. Id. at 2, 6. USCIS clarified that such relief would not be automatic, but rather would be unavailable in the presence of, for exam ple, \"serious adverse factors, such as national security concerns, significant immigration fraud, commission of other crimes, or public safety reasons.\" Id. at 6. 7 5. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Announced by DHS in 2012, DACA makes deferred action available to \"certain young people who were brought to this country as children\" and therefore \"[a]s a general matter . . . lacked the intent to violate the law.\" Memorandum for David Aguilar, Acting Commis- sioner, CBP, et al., from Jane t Napolitano, Secretary, DHS, Re: Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children at 1 (June 15, 2012) (\"Napolitano Memorandum\"). An alien is eligible for DACA if she was under the age of 31 when the program began; arrived in the United States before the age of 16; continuously resided in the United States for at least 5 years i mmediately preceding June 15, 2012; was physically present on June 15, 2012; satisfies certain educational or military service requirements; and neither has a seri ous criminal history nor \"poses a threat to national security or public safety.\" See id. DHS evaluates applicants' eligibility for DACA on a case-by-case basis. See id. at 2; USCIS, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Toolkit: Resources for Community Partners at 11 (\"DACA Toolkit\"). Successful DACA ap plicants receive deferred action for a 7 Several months after the deferred action progr am was announced, Congress eliminated the re- quirement that an alien be married to a U.S. citizen \"for at least 2 years at the time of the citizen's death\" to retain his or her eligibility for lawful immigration status. Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-83, \u00a7 568(c), 123 Stat. 2142, 2186 (2009). Concluding that legislation rendered its surviving spouse guidan ce \"obsolete,\" USCIS withdrew its earlier guidance and treated all pending applications fo r deferred action as visa petitions. See Memorandum for Executive Leadership, USCIS, from Donald Neufeld, Acting Associate Director, USCIS, et al., Re Additional Guidance Regarding Surviving Spouses of Deceased U.S. Citizens and Their Children (REVISED) at 3, 10 (Dec. 2, 2009). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 106 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 18 period of two years, subject to renewal. See DACA Toolkit at 11. DHS has stated that grants of deferred action under DACA may be terminated at any time, id. at 16, and \"confer[] no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship,\" Napolitano Memorandum at 3.8 Congress has long been aware of the practice of granting deferred action, in- cluding in its categorical variety, and of its salient features; and it has never acted to disapprove or limit the practice.9 On the contrary, it has enacted several pieces of legislation that have either assumed that deferred action would be available in certain circumstances, or expressly direct ed that deferred action be extended to certain categories of aliens. For exam ple, as Congress was considering VAWA reauthorization legislation in 2000, INS officials testified before Congress about their deferred action program for VAWA self-petitioners, explaining that \"[a]pproved [VAWA] self-petitioners are placed in deferred action status,\" such that \"[n]o battered alien who has filed a[n . . has been deported.\" H.R. 3083 Hearings at 43. Congress responded by not only acknowl- edging but also expanding the deferred action program in the 2000 VAWA reauthorization legislation, providing that children who could no longer self-petition under VAWA because they were over the age of 21 would nonetheless be \"eligible for deferred action and work authorization.\" Victims of Trafficking and 8 Before DACA was announced, our Office was consu lted about whether such a program would be legally permissible. As we orally advised, our pr eliminary view was that such a program would be permissible, provided that immigrat ion officials retained discretion to evaluate each application on an individualized basis. We noted that immigration officials typically cons ider factors such as having been brought to the United States as a child in exercising their discretion to grant deferred action in individual cases. We explained, however, that ex tending deferred action to i ndividuals who satisfied these and other specified criteria on a class-wide basi s would raise distinct questions not implicated by ad hoc grants of deferred action. We advised that it was critical that, like past policies that made deferred action available to certain classes of alie ns, the DACA program require immigration officials to evaluate each application for deferred action on a case-by-case basis, rather than granting deferred action automatically to all applicants who satisfied th e threshold eligibility criteria. We also noted that, although the proposed program was predicated on human itarian concerns that appeared less particular- ized and acute than those underlying certain prior class-wide deferred action programs, the concerns animating DACA were nonetheless consistent with the types of concerns that have customarily guided the exercise of immigration enforcement discretion. 9 Congress has considered legisla tion that would limit the practice of granting deferred action, but it has never enacted such a measure. In 2011, a bill wa s introduced in both the House and the Senate that would have temporarily suspended DHS's author ity to grant deferred action except in narrow circumstances. See H.R. 2497, 112th Cong. (2011); S. 1380, 112th Cong. (2011). Neither chamber, however, voted on the bill. This y ear, the House passed a bill that purported to bar any funding for DACA or other class-wide deferred action programs, H.R. 5272, 113th Cong. (2014), but the Senate has not considered the legislation. Because the Supr eme Court has instructed that unenacted legislation is an unreliable indicator of legislative intent, see Red Lion Broad. Co. v. FCC , 395 U.S. 367, 381 n.11 (1969), we do not draw any infere nce regarding congressional policy from these unenacted bills. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 107 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 19 Violence Protection Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-386, \u00a7 1503(d)(2), 114 (and later DHS's) de- ferred action program for bona fide T and U visa applicants. As discussed above, that program made deferred action available to nearly all individuals who could make a prima facie showing of eligibility for a T or U visa. In 2008 legislation, Congress authorized DHS to \"grant . . . an administrative stay of a final order of removal\" to any such individual. William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-457, \u00a7 204, 122 Stat. 5044, 5060 (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(d)(1)). Congress further clarified that \"[t]he denial of a request for an administrative stay of removal under this subsec-tion shall not preclude the alien from applying for . . . deferred action.\" Id. It also directed DHS to compile a report detailing, among other things, how long DHS's \"specially trained [VAWA] Unit at the [U for \"deferred along taken to improve in this area.\" Id. \u00a7 238. Representative Berman, the bill's sponsor, explained that the Vermont Servi ce Center should \"str ive to issue work authorization and deferred action\" to \"[i]mmigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and other violence crimes . . . in most instances within 60 days of filing.\" 154 Cong. Rec. 24603 (2008). In addition, in other enactments, Congre ss has specified that certain classes of individuals should be made \"eligible for deferred action.\" These classes include certain immediate family members of LPRs who were killed on September 11, 2001, USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, Pub. L. No. 107-56, \u00a7 423(b), 115 Stat. 272, 361, and certain immediate family members of certain U.S. citizens killed in combat, National Defense Authorization Ac t for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 1703(c)-(d), 117 Stat. 1392, 1694. In the same legislation, Congress made these individuals eligible to obta in lawful status as \"family-sponsored immigrant[s]\" or \"imm ediate No. 107-56, \u00a7 423(b), 115 Stat. 272, 1703(c)(1)(A), 117 Stat. see Osorio , 134 S. Ct. 2191, 2197 (2014) (plurality opinion) (explaining which aliens typically qualify as family-sponsored immigrants or immediate relatives). Finally, Congress acknowledged the practice of granting deferred action in the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, div. B, 119 Stat. 231, 302 (codified at 10 Five years later, in the Violence Against Wome n and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-162, 119 Stat. 2960, Cong ress specified that, \"[u]pon the approval of a as a VAWA self-petitioner, the alien . . . is eligible at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(1)(K)). One of the Act's sponsors explained that while this provision was intended to \"give[] DHS statutory authority to gr ant work authorization . . . without having to rely upon deferred action . . . [t]he current practice of granting deferred VAWA self- petitioners should continue.\" 151 Cong. Rec. 29334 (2005) (statement of Rep. Conyers). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 108 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 20 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30301 note), which makes a state-issued driver's license or identifica- tion card acceptable for federal purposes only if the state verifies, among other things, that the card's recipient has \"[e] vidence of [l]awful [s]tatus.\" Congress specified that, for this purpose, acceptable ev idence of lawful status includes proof of, among other things, citizenship, lawful permanent or temporary residence, or \"approved deferred action status.\" Id. \u00a7 202(c)(2)(B)(viii). B. The practice of granting deferred action, like the practice of setting enforce- ment priorities, is an exercise of enfor cement discretion rooted in DHS's authority to enforce the immigration laws and the Pres ident's duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. It is one of se veral mechanisms by which immigration officials, against a backdrop of limited enforcement resources, exercise their \"broad discretion\" to administer the re moval system\u2014and, more specifically, their discretion to determine whether \"it makes sense to pursue removal\" in particular circumstances. Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2499. Deferred action, however, differs in at least three respects from more familiar and widespread exercises of enforcement di scretion. First, unlike (for example) the paradigmatic exercise of prosecutorial di scretion in a criminal case, the conferral of deferred action does not represent a decision not to prosecute an individual for past unlawful conduct; it instead represents a decision to openly tolerate an undocumented alien's continued presence in the United States for a fixed period (subject to revocation at the agency's disc retion). Second, unlike most exercises of enforcement discretion, deferred action carri es with it benefits in addition to non- enforcement itself; specifically, the ability to seek employment authorization and suspension of unlawful presence for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i) and (a)(9)(C)(i)(I). Third, class-based deferred action programs, like those for VAWA recipients and victims of Hurricane Katr ina, do not merely enable individual immigration officials to select deserving beneficiaries from among those aliens who have been identified or apprehended for possible removal\u2014as is the case with ad hoc deferred action\u2014but rather set forth certain threshold eligibility criteria and then invite individuals who satisfy these cr iteria to apply for deferred action status. While these features of deferred action are somewhat unusual among exercises of enforcement discretion, the differences between deferred action and other exercises of enforcement discretion are less significant than they might initially appear. The first feature\u2014the toleration of an alien's continued unlawful pres-ence\u2014is an inevitable element of almost an y exercise of discretion in immigration enforcement. Any decision not to rem ove an unlawfully present alien\u2014even through an exercise of routine enforcement discretion\u2014necessarily carries with it a tacit acknowledgment that the alien will continue to be present in the United States without legal status. Deferred action arguably goes beyond such tacit acknowledgment by expressly communicating to the alien that his or her unlawful Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 109 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 21 presence will be tolerated for a prescribed pe riod of time. This difference is not, in our view, insignificant. But neither does it fundamentally transform deferred action into something other than an exercise of enforcement discretion: As we have previously noted, deferred action confers no lawful immigration status, provides no path to lawful permanent residence or citizenship, and is revocable at any time in the agency's discretion. With respect to the second feature, the additional benefits deferred action con- fers\u2014the ability to apply for work authorization and the tolling of unlawful presence\u2014do not depend on background principles of agency discretion under DHS's general immigration authorities or the Take Care Clause at all, but rather depend on independent and more specific statutory authority rooted in the text of the INA. The first of those authorities, DH S's power to prescrib e which aliens are authorized to work in the United States, is grounded in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3), which defines an \"unauthorized alien\" not entitled to work in the United States as an alien who is neither an LPR nor \"authorized to be . . . employed by [the INA] or by the Attorney General [now the Secretary of Homeland Security].\" This statutory provision has long been understood to recognize the authority of the Secretary (and the Attorney General before him) to grant work authorization to particular classes of aliens. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12; 1043, 1048-50 (5th Cir. 1990) (describing the authority recognized by section 1324a(h)(3) as \"permissi ve\" and largely \"unfettered\"). 11 Although the INA 11 Section 1324a(h)(3) was enacted in 1986 as part of IRCA. Before then, the INA contained no provisions comprehensively addressing the employment of aliens or expressly delegating the authority to regulate the employment of aliens to a responsib le federal agency. INS assumed the authority to prescribe the classes of aliens auth orized to work in the United States under its general responsibility to administer the immigration laws. In 1981, INS promulgated regulations codifying its existing procedures and criteria for gran ting employment authorization. See Employment Authorization to Aliens in the United States, 46 Fed. Reg. 25079, 25080-81 (May 5, 1981) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(a)). Those regulations permitted certai n categories of aliens who lack ed lawful immigration status, including deferred action recipients, to apply for work authorization under certain circumstances. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 109.1(b)(7) ( 1982). In IRCA, Congress introduced a \"c omprehensive scheme prohibiting the employment of illegal aliens in the United States,\" Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB , 535 U.S. 137, 147 (2002), to be enforced primarily th rough criminal and civil penalties on employers who knowingly employ an \"unauthorized alien.\" As relevant here, C ongress defined an \"unauthorized alien\" barred from employment in the United States as an alien who \"is not . . . either (A) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or (B) authorized to be so employed by this chapter or by the Attorney General.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) (emphasis added). Shortly after IRCA was enacted, INS denied a petition to rescind its employment authorizat ion regulation, rejecting an argument that \"the phrase 'authorized to be so employed by this Ac t or the Attorney General' does not recognize the Attorney General's authority to gr ant work authorization except to t hose aliens who have already been granted specific author ization by the Act.\" Employment Authorization; Classes of Aliens Eligible , 52 Fed. Reg. 46092, 46093 (D ec. 4, 1987). Because the same statutory phrase refers both to aliens authorized to be employed by the INA and aliens au thorized to be employed by the Attorney General, INS concluded that the only way to gi ve effect to both references is to conclude \"that Congress, being fully aware of the Attorney Genera l's authority to promulgate regula tions, and approving of the manner in which he has exercised that aut hority in this matter, defined 'unauthorized alien' in such fashion as to exclude aliens who have been authorized employment by the Attorney General through the Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 110 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 22 requires the Secretary to gr ant work authorization to particular classes of aliens, see, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(c)(1)(B) (aliens gran ted asylum), it places few limita- tions on the Secretary's authority to grant work authorization to other classes of aliens. Further, and notably, additional provisions of the INA expressly contem- plate that the Secretary may grant work authorization to aliens lacking lawful immigration status\u2014even those who are in active removal proceedings or, in certain circumstances, those who have already received final orders of removal. See id. \u00a7 1226(a)(3) (permitting the Secretary to grant work authorization to an otherwise work-eligible alien who has been arrested and detained pending a decision whether to remove the alien from the United States); id. \u00a7 1231(a)(7) (permitting the Secretary under certain narrow circumstances to grant work authorization to aliens who have received fi nal orders of removal). Consistent with these provisions, the Secretary has long permitted certain additional classes of aliens who lack lawful immigration status to apply for work authorization, including deferred action recipients who can demonstrate an economic necessity for employment. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(c)(14); see also id. \u00a7 274a.12(c)(8) (applicants for asylum), (c)(10) (applicants for cancellation of removal); supra note 11 (discussing 1981 regulations). The Secretary's authority to suspend the accrual of unlawful presence of de- ferred action recipients is similarly grounded in the INA. The relevant statutory provision treats an alien as \"unlawfully present\" for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i) and (a)(9)(C)(i)(I) if he \"is present in the United States after the expiration of the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii). That language contemplates that the Attorney General (and now the Secretary) may authorize an alie n to stay in the United States without accruing unlawful presence under sec tion 1182(a)(9)(B)(i) or section 1182(a)(9)(C)(i). And DHS regulations and policy guidance interpret a \"period of stay authorized by the Attorney General\" to include periods during which an alien has been granted deferred action. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.14( d)(3); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 1100.35(b)(2); USCIS Consolidation of Guidance at 42. The final unusual feature of deferred action programs is particular to class- based programs. The breadth of such programs, in combination with the first two features of deferred action, may raise particular concerns about whether immigra- tion officials have undertaken to substantively change the statutory removal system rather than simply adapting its application to individual circumstances. But the salient feature of class-based programs\u2014the establishment of an affirmative application process with threshold eligibility criteria\u2014does not in and of itself cross the line between executing the law and rewriting it. Although every class- wide deferred action program that has been implemented to date has established regulatory process, in addition to those w ho are authorized empl oyment by statute.\" Id.; see Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor , 478 U.S. 833, 844 (1986) (stating \"considerable weight must be accorded\" an agency's \"contemporan eous interpretation of the statute it is entrusted to administer\"). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 111 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 23 certain threshold elig ibility criteria, each program has also left room for case-by- case determinations, giving immigration officials discretion to deny applications even if the applicant fulfills all of the program criteria. See supra pp. 15-18. Like the establishment of enforcement priorities discussed in Part I, the establishment of threshold eligibility criteria can serve to avoid arbitrary enforcement decisions by individual officers, thereby furthering the goal of ensuring consistency across a large agency. The guarantee of individu alized, case-by-case review helps avoid potential concerns that, in establishing su ch eligibility criteria, the Executive is attempting to rewrite the law by defining new categories of aliens who are automatically entitled to particular immigration relief. See Crowley Caribbean Transp., 37 F.3d at 676-77; see also Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4. Furthermore, while permitting potentially eligible individuals to apply for an exercise of enforcement discretion is not especially common, many law enforcement agencies have developed programs that invite violators of the law to identify themselves to the authorities in exchange for leniency. 12 Much as is the case with those pro- grams, inviting eligible aliens to identify themselves through an application process may serve the agency's law enfo rcement interests by encouraging lower- priority individuals to identify themselves to the agency. In so doing, the process may enable the agency to better focus its scarce resources on higher enforcement priorities. Apart from the considerations just discussed, perhaps the clearest indication that these features of deferred action prog rams are not per se impermissible is the fact that Congress, aware of these feat ures, has repeatedly enacted legislation appearing to endorse such programs. As discussed above, Congress has not only directed that certain classes of aliens be made eligible for deferred action pro-grams\u2014and in at least one instance, in th e case of VAWA beneficiaries, directed the expansion of an existing program\u2014but also ranked evidence of approved deferred action status as evidence of \"law ful status\" for purposes of the REAL ID Act. These enactments strongly suggest th at when DHS in the past has decided to grant deferred action to an individual or class of individuals, it has been acting in a manner consistent with congressional policy \"'rather than embarking on a frolic of its own.'\" United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes , Inc., 474 U.S. 121, 139 12 For example, since 1978, the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division has implemented a \"leniency program\" under which a corporation that reveals an antitrust c onspiracy in which it participated may receive a conditional pr omise that it will not be prosecuted. See Dep't of Justice, Frequently Asked Questions Regarding the Antitrus t Division's Leniency Program and Model Leniency Letters (November 19, 2008) , available at http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/criminal/239583.pdf (last visited Nov. 19, 2014); see also Internal Revenue Manual \u00a7 9.5.11.9(2) (Revised IRS Voluntary Disclosure Practice), available at http://www.irs.gov/uac/Revised-IRS- Voluntary-Disclosure-Practice (last visited Nov. 19, 2014) (explaining that a taxpayer's voluntar y disclosure of misreported tax information \"may result in prosecution not be ing recommended\"); U.S. Marshals Service, Fugitive Safe Surrender FAQs, available at http://www.usmarshals.gov/safesurrender/faqs.html (last visited Nov. 19, 2014) (stating that fugitives who surrender at designated sites and times under the \"Fugitive Safe Surrender\" program are likely to receive \"favorable consideration\"). Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 112 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 24 (1985) (quoting Red Lion Broad. Co. v. FCC , 395 U.S. 367, 375 (1969)); cf. id. at 137-39 (concluding that Congress acquiesced in an agency's assertion of ry \"brought to Congress'[s] attention,\" and further finding implicit congression- al approval in legislation that appeared to acknowledge the regulatory authority in question); Dames & Moore v. Regan , 453 U.S. 654, 680 (1981) (finding that Congress \"implicitly approved the practice of claim settlement by executive agreement\" by enacting the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949, which \"create[d] a procedure to implemen t\" those very agreements). Congress's apparent endorsement of certain deferred action programs does not mean, of course, that a deferred action pr ogram can be lawfully extended to any group of aliens, no matter its characteristics or its scope, and no matter the circumstances in which the program is implemented. Because deferred action, like the prioritization policy discussed above, is an exercise of enforcement discretion rooted in the Secretary's br oad authority to enforce the immigration laws and the President's duty to take care that the la ws are faithfully executed, it is subject to the same four general principles previously discussed. See supra pp. 6-7. Thus, any expansion of deferred action to new classes of aliens must be carefully scrutinized to ensure that it reflects consid erations within the agency's expertise, and that it does not seek to effectively rewrite the laws to match the Executive's policy preferences, but rather operates in a manner consonant with congressional policy expressed in the statute. See supra pp. 6-7 (citing Youngstown , 343 U.S. at 637, and Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders , 551 U.S. at 658). Immigration officials cannot abdicate their statutory responsibilities under the guise of exercising enforcement discretion. See supra p. 7 (citing Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4). And any new deferred action program should leave room for individualized evaluation of whether a particular case warrants the expenditure of resour ces for enforcement. See supra p. 7 (citing Glickman , 96 F.3d at Crowley Caribbean Transp. , 37 F.3d at 676-77). Furthermore, because deferred action pr ograms depart in certain respects from more familiar and widespread exercises of enforcement discretion, particularly careful examination is needed to ensure that any proposed expansion of deferred action complies with these general principles, so that the proposed program does not, in effect, cross the line between executing the law and rewriting it. In analyzing whether the proposed programs cross this line, we will draw substantial guidance from Congress's history of legislation concerning deferred action. In the absence of express statutory guidance, the nature of deferred action programs Congress has implicitly approved by statute helps to shed light on Congress's own understandings about the permissible uses of deferred action. Those understand-ings, in turn, help to inform our consideration of whether the proposed deferred action programs are \"faithful[]\" to th e statutory scheme Congress has enacted. U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 3. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 113 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 25 C. We now turn to the specifics of DHS's proposed deferred action programs. DHS has proposed implementing a policy under which an alien could apply for, and would be eligible to receive, deferred action if he or she: (1) is not an en- forcement priority under DHS policy; (2) has continuously resided in the United States since before January 1, 2010; (3) is physically present in the United States both when DHS announces its program and at the time of application for deferred action; (4) has a child who is a U.S. citi zen or LPR; and (5) presents \"no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion, make[] the grant of deferred action inappropriate.\" Johnson Deferred Action Memorandum at 4. You have also asked about the permissibility of a similar program that would be open to parents of children who have received deferred actio n under the DACA program. We first address DHS's proposal to implement a deferred action program for the parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs, and then turn to the permissibility of the program for parents of DACA recipients in the next section. 1. We begin by considering whether the proposed program for the parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs reflects considerations within the agency's expertise. DHS has offered two justifications for the proposed program for the parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs. First, as noted above, severe resource constraints make it inevitable that DHS will not remove the vast majority of aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States. Consistent with Congress's instruction, DHS prioritizes the removal of individuals who have significant criminal records, as well as others who present dangers to national security, pub lic safety, or border security. See supra p. 10. Parents with longstanding ties to the countr y and who have no significant criminal records or other risk factors rank among the agency's lowest enforcement priorities; absent significant increases in funding, the likelihood that any individu- al in that category will be determined to warrant the expenditure of severely limited enforcement resources is very lo w. Second, DHS has explained that the program would serve an important humanitarian interest in keeping parents together with children who are lawfully pr esent in the United States, in situations where such parents have demonstrated significant ties to community and family in this country. See Shahoulian E-mail. With respect to DHS's first justification, the need to efficiently allocate scarce enforcement resources is a quintessentia l basis for an agency's exercise of enforcement discretion. See Chaney , 470 U.S. at 831. Because, as discussed earlier, Congress has appropriated only a sm all fraction of the funds needed for full enforcement, DHS can remove no more than a small fraction of the individu- als who are removable under the immigration laws. See supra p. 9. The agency must therefore make choices about which violations of the immigration laws it Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 114 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 26 will prioritize and pursue. And as Chaney makes clear, such choices are entrusted largely to the Executive's discretion. 470 U.S. at 831. The deferred action program DHS proposes would not, of course, be costless. Processing applications for deferred action and its renewal requires manpower and resources. See Arizona , 132 S. Ct. at 2521 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). But DHS has informed us that the costs of administering the proposed program would be borne almost entirely by USCIS through the collec-tion of application fees. See Shahoulian (b)(1)(i)(HH). DHS has indicated that the costs of administering the deferred action program would therefore not detract in any significant way from the resources available to ICE and CBP\u2014the enforcement arms of DHS\u2014which rely on money appropriated by Congress to fund their operations. See Shahoulian E-mail. DHS has explained that, if anything, the proposed deferred action program might increase ICE's and CBP's efficiency by in effect using USCIS's fee-funded re sources to enable those enforcement divisions to more easily identify non-priority aliens and focus their resources on pursuing aliens who are strong candidates for removal. See id. The proposed program, in short, might help DHS address its severe resource limitations, and at the very least likely would not exacerbate them. See id. DHS does not, however, attempt to justify the proposed program solely as a cost-saving measure, or suggest that its lack of resources alone is sufficient to justify creating a deferred action program for the proposed class. Rather, as noted above, DHS has explained that the program would also serve a particularized humanitarian interest in promoting family unity by enabling those parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs who are not otherwis e enforcement priorities and who have demonstrated community and family ties in the United States (as evidenced by the length of time they have remained in the country) to remain united with their children in the United States. Like determining how best to respond to resource constraints, determining how to address such \"human concerns\" in the immigra- tion context is a consideration that is generally understood to fall within DHS's expertise. Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2499. This second justification for the progra m also appears consonant with congres- sional policy embodied in the INA. Numerous provisions of the statute reflect a particular concern with uniting aliens wi th close relatives who have attained lawful immigration status in the United States. See, e.g., Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 795 n.6 (1977); INS v. Errico , 385 U.S. 214, 220 n.9 (1966) (\"'The legislative history of the Immigration and Nationality Act clearly indicates that the Con-gress . . . was concerned with the problem of keeping families of United States citizens and immigrants united.'\" (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 85-1199, at 7 (1957)). The INA provides a path to lawful status for the parents, as well as other immedi- ate relatives, of U.S. citizens: U.S. citi zens aged twenty-one or over may petition for parents to obtain visas that would permit them to enter and permanently reside Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 115 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 27 in the United States, and there is no limit on the overall number of such petitions that may be granted. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(b)(2)(A)(i); see also Cuellar de Osorio , 134 S. Ct. at 2197-99 (describing the process for obtaining a family-based immigrant visa). And although the INA contains no parallel provision permitting LPRs to petition on behalf of their parents, it does provide a path for LPRs to become citizens, at which point they too can petition to obtain visas for their parents. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427(a) (providing that aliens are generally eligible to become naturalized citizens after five years of lawful permanent residence); id. \u00a7 1430(a) (alien spouses of U.S. citizens become eligible after three years of lawful permanent residence); Demore v. Kim , 538 U.S. 510, 544 (2003). 13 Additionally, the INA empowers the Attorney General to cancel the removal of, and adjust to lawful permanent resident status, aliens who have been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than ten years, exhibit good moral character, have not been convicted of specified offenses, and have immediate relatives who are U.S. citizens or LPRs and who would suffer exceptional hardship from the alien's removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1). DHS's proposal to focus on the parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs thus tracks a congres- sional concern, expressed in the INA, with uniting the immediate families of individuals who have permanent legal ties to the United States. At the same time, because the temporar y relief DHS's proposed program would confer to such parents is sharply limite d in comparison to the benefits Congress has made available through statute, DHS's proposed program would not operate to circumvent the limits Congress has placed on the availability of those benefits. The statutory provisions discussed above offer the parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs the prospect of permanent lawful st atus in the United States. The cancella- tion of removal provision, moreover, offers the prospect of receiving such status 13 The INA does permit LPRs to petition on behalf of their spouses and children even before they have attained citizenship . See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(2). However, the exclusion of LPRs' parents from this provision does not appear to reflect a congressional judgment that, until they attain citizenship, LPRs lack an interest in being united with their pare nts comparable to their interest in being united with their other immediate relatives. The distinction betw een parents and other relatives originated with a 1924 statute that exempted the wives and minor chil dren of U.S. citizens from immigration quotas, gave \"preference status\"\u2014eligibility for a specially designated pool of immigrant visas\u2014to other relatives of U.S. citizens, and gave no favorable tr eatment to the relatives of LPRs. Immigration Act of 1924, Pub. L. No. 68-139, \u00a7\u00a7 4(a), 6, 43 Stat. 153, 155-56. In 1928, Congress extended preference status to LPRs' wives and minor children, reasoning th at because such relatives would be eligible for visas without regard to any quota when their LPR relatives became citizens, granting preference status to LPRs' wives and minor children would \"hasten[]\" the \"family reunion.\" S. Rep. No. 70-245, at 2 (1928); see Act of May 29, 1928, ch. 914, 45 Stat. 1009, 100 9-10. The special visa status for wives and children of LPRs thus mirrored, and was designed to complement, the special visa status given to wives and minor children of U.S. citizens. In 1965, Cong ress eliminated the basis on which the distinction had rested by exempting all \"immediate relatives\" of U.S. citizens, including parents, from numerical restrictions on immigration. Pub. L. No. 89-236, \u00a7 1, 79 Stat. 911, 911. But it did not amend eligibility for preference status for relatives of LPRs to reflect that change. We have not been able to discern any rationale for this omission in the legislative history or statutory text of the 1965 law. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 116 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 28 immediately, without the delays generally associated with the family-based immigrant visa process. DHS's proposed program, in contrast, would not grant the parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs any lawful immigration status, provide a path to permanent residence or citizenship, or ot herwise confer any legally enforceable entitlement to remain in the United States. See USCIS SOP at 3. It is true that, as we have discussed, a grant of deferred action would confer eligibility to apply for and obtain work authorization, pursuant to the Secretary's statutory authority to grant such authorization and the longstanding regulations promulgated thereunder. See supra pp. 13, 21-22. But unlike the automatic employment eligibility that accompanies LPR status, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3), th is authorization could be granted only on a showing of economic necessity, and would last only for the limited duration of the deferred action grant, see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(c)(14). The other salient features of the proposal are similarly consonant with con- gressional policy. The proposed program would focus on parents who are not enforcement priorities under the prioritiz ation policy discussed above\u2014a policy that, as explained earlier, comports with the removal priorities set by Congress. See supra p. 10. The continuous residence requirement is likewise consistent with legislative judgments that extended periods of continuous residence are indicative of strong family and community ties. See IRCA, Pub. L. No. 99-603, \u00a7 201(a), 100 Stat. 3359, (1986) (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(a)(2)) (granting lawful status to certain aliens unlawfully present in the United States since January 1, 1982); id. \u00a7 302(a) (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160) (granting similar relief to certain agricultural workers); H.R. Rep. No. 99-682, pt. 1, at 49 (1986) (stating that aliens present in the United States for five years \"have become a part of their communities[,] . . . have strong family ties here which include U.S. citiz ens and lawful reside nts[,] . . . have a nd] . . . have contributed to the United States in myriad ways\"); S. Rep. No. 99-132, at 16 (1985) (deporting aliens who \"have become well settled in this countr y\" would be a \"wasteful use of the Immigration and Naturalization Servic e's limited enforcement resources\"); see also Arizona , 132 S. Ct. at 2499 (noting that \"[t]he equities of an individual case\" turn on factors \"including whether the alien has . . . long ties to the community\"). We also do not believe DHS's proposed program amounts to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities, or a legislative rule overriding the commands of the statute. As discussed earlier, DHS's seve re resource constraints mean that, unless circumstances change, it could not as a practical matter remove the vast majority of removable aliens present in the Un ited States. The fact that the proposed program would defer the removal of a subset of these removable aliens\u2014a subset that ranks near the bottom of the list of the agency's removal priorities\u2014thus does not, by itself, demonstrate that the program amounts to an abdication of DHS's responsibilities. And the case-by-case discretion given to immigration officials under DHS's proposed program alleviates potential concerns that DHS has Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 117 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 29 abdicated its statutory enforcement responsibilities with respect to, or created a categorical, rule-like entitlement to immigration relief for, the particular class of aliens eligible for the program. An alie n who meets all the criteria for deferred action under the program woul d receive deferred action only if he or she \"pre- sent[ed] no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion,\" would \"make[] the grant of deferred action inappropriate.\" Johnson Deferred Action Memorandum at 4. The proposed policy does not specify what would count as such a factor; it thus leaves the relevant USCIS official with substantial discretion to determine whether a grant of deferred action is warranted. In other words, even if an alien is not a removal priority under the proposed policy discussed in Part I, has continu-ously resided in the United States since before January 1, 2010, is physically present in the country, and is a parent of an LPR or a U.S. citizen, the USCIS official evaluating the alien's deferred action application must still make a judgment, in the exercise of her discreti on, about whether that alien presents any other factor that would make a grant of deferred action inappropriate. This feature of the proposed program ensures that it doe s not create a categorical entitlement to deferred action that could raise concerns that DHS is either impermissibly attempting to rewrite or categorically declin ing to enforce the law with respect to a particular group of undocumented aliens. Finally, the proposed deferred action program would resemble in material respects the kinds of deferred action programs Congress has implicitly approved in the past, which provides some indication that the proposal is consonant not only with interests reflected in immigration law as a general matter, but also with congressional understandings about the permissible uses of deferred action. As noted above, the program uses deferred action as an interim measure for a group of aliens to whom Congress has given a prospective entitlement to lawful immi- gration status. While Congress has provided a path to lawful status for the parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs, the process of obtaining that status \"takes time.\" Cuellar de Osorio , 134 S. Ct. at 2199. The proposed program would provide a mechanism for families to remain together, depending on their circumstances, for some or all of the intervening period. 14 Immigration officials have on several 14 DHS's proposed program would likely not perm it all potentially eligible parents to remain together with their children for th e entire duration of the time until a visa is awarded. In particular, undocumented parents of adult citizens who are physically present in the country would be ineligible to adjust their status without first leaving the country if they had never been \"inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) (permitting the Attorney General to adjust to permanent resident status certain aliens present in the United States if they become eligible for immigrant visas). They would thus need to leave the country to obtain a visa at a U.S. consulate abroad. See id. \u00a7 1201(a); Cuellar de Osorio , 134 S. Ct. at 2197-99. But once such parents left the country, they would in most instances become s ubject to the 3- or 10-year bar under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i) and therefore unable to obtain a visa unless they remained outside the country for the duration of the bar. DHS's proposed program w ould nevertheless enable other families to stay together without regard to the 3- or 10-year bar. And even as to those families with parents who would become subject to that bar, the proposed deferred ac tion program would have the effect of reducing the Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 118 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 30 occasions deployed deferred action programs as interim measures for other classes of aliens with prospective entitlements to lawful immigration status, including VAWA self-petitioners, bona fide T and U visa applicants, certain immediate family members of certain U.S. citizens killed in combat, and certain immediate family members of aliens killed on September 11, 2001. As noted above, each of these programs has received Congress's implicit approval\u2014and, indeed, in the case of VAWA self-petitioners, a directio n to expand the program beyond its original bounds. See supra pp. 18-20. 15 In addition, much like these and other programs Congress has implicitly endorsed, the program serves substantial and particularized humanitarian interests. Removing the parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs\u2014that is, of children who have established permanent legal ties to the United States\u2014would separate them from their nuclear families, potentially for many years, until they were able to secure visas through the path Congress has provided. During that time, both the parents and their U.S. citizen or LPR children would be deprived of both the economic support an d the intangible benefits that families provide. We recognize that the proposed progra m would likely differ in size from these prior deferred action programs. Although DHS has indicated that there is no reliable way to know how many eligible aliens would actually apply for or would be likely to receive deferred action following individualized consideration under the proposed program, it has informed us that approximately 4 million individuals could be eligible to apply. See Shahoulian E-mail. We have thus considered whether the size of the program alone sets it at odds with congressional policy or the Executive's duties under the Take Ca re Clause. In the absence of express statutory guidance, it is difficult to say exactly how the program's potential size bears on its permissibility as an exercise of executive enforcem ent discretion. But because the size of DHS's proposed progra m corresponds to the size of a popula- tion to which Congress has granted a prospective entitlement to lawful status amount of time the family had to spend apart, and could enable them to ad just the timing of their separation according to, for example, thei r children's needs for care and support. 15 Several extended voluntary depart ure programs have been animated by a similar rationale, and the most prominent of these programs also receive d Congress's implicit approva l. In particular, as noted above, the Family Fairness policy, implemente d in 1990, authorized granting extended voluntary departure and work authorization to the estimated 1.5 million spouses and children of aliens granted legal status under IRCA\u2014aliens who would eventually \"acquire lawful permanen t resident status\" and be able to petition on behalf of their family members. Family Fairness Memorandum at 1; see supra pp. 14-15. Later that year, Congress granted the be neficiaries of the Family Fairness program an indefinite stay of deportation. See Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, \u00a7 301, 104 Stat. 4978, 5030. Although it did not make that grant of re lief effective for nearly a year, Congress clarified that \"the delay in effectiveness of this section shall not be construed as reflecting a Congressional belief that the existing family fairness program s hould be modified in any way before such date.\" Id. \u00a7 301(g). INS's policies for qualifying Third Preferen ce visa applicants and nurses eligible for H-1 nonimmigrant status likewise extended to aliens w ith prospective entitlements to lawful status. See supra p. 14. Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 119 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 31 without numerical restriction, it seems to us difficult to sustain an argument, based on numbers alone, that DHS's proposal to grant a limited form of administrative relief as a temporary interim measure excee ds its enforcement discretion under the INA. Furthermore, while the potential size of the program is large, it is neverthe-less only a fraction of the approximately 11 million undocumented aliens who remain in the United States each year because DHS lacks the resources to remove them; and, as we have indicated, the program is limited to individuals who would be unlikely to be removed under DHS's proposed prioritization policy. There is thus little practical danger that the program, simply by virtue of its size, will impede removals that would otherwise occur in its absence. And although we are aware of no prior exercises of deferred ac tion of the size contemplated here, INS's 1990 Family Fairness policy, which Congress later implicitly approved, made a comparable fraction of undocumented aliens\u2014approximately four in ten\u2014potentially eligible for discretionary extended voluntary departure relief. Compare CRS Immigration Report at 22 (estimating the Family Fairness policy extended to 1.5 million undocumented aliens), with Office of Policy and Planning, INS, Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: 1990 to 2000 at 10 (2003) (estimating an undocumented alien population of 3.5 million in 1990); see supra notes 5 & 15 (discussing extended voluntary departure and Congress's implicit approval of the Family Fairness policy). This suggests that DHS's proposed deferred action program is not, simply by virtue of its relative size, inconsistent with what Congress has previously considered a permissible exercise of enforcement di scretion in the immigration context. In light of these considerations, we believe the proposed expansion of deferred action to the parents of U.S. citizens an d LPRs is lawful. It reflects considera- tions\u2014responding to resource constraints and to particularized humanitarian concerns arising in the immigration context\u2014 that fall within DHS' s expertise. It is consistent with congressional policy, since it focuses on a group\u2014law-abiding parents of lawfully present children who have substantial ties to the community\u2014that Congress itself has granted favorabl e treatment in the immigration process. The program provides for th e exercise of case-by-case discretion, thereby avoiding creating a rule-like entitlement to immi gration relief or abdicating DHS's en- forcement responsibilities for a particular class of aliens. And, like several deferred action programs Congress has approved in the past, the proposed program provides interim relief that would prevent particularized harm that could otherwise befall both the beneficiaries of the prog ram and their families. We accordingly conclude that the proposed program would constitute a permissible exercise of DHS's enforcement discretion under the INA. 2. We now turn to the proposed deferred action program for the parents of DACA recipients. The relevant considerations ar e, to a certain extent, similar to those Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 120 of 137Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 38 32 discussed above: Like the program for the parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs, the proposed program for parents of DACA recipients would respond to severe resource constraints that dramatically limit DHS's ability to remove aliens who are unlawfully present, and would be limited to individuals who would be unlikely to be removed under DHS's proposed prioritization policy. And like the proposed program for LPRs and U.S. citizens, the proposed program for DACA parents would preserve a significant measure of case-by-case discretion not to award deferred action even if the general eligibility criteria are satisfied. But the proposed program for parents of DACA recipients is unlike the pro- posed program for parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs in two critical respects. First, although DHS justifies the proposed program in large part based on considerations of family unity, the parents of DACA recipients are differently situated from the parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs under the family-related provisions of the immigration law. Many provisions of the INA reflect Congress's general concern with not separating individuals who are legally entitled to live in the United States from their immediate family members. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(b)(2)(A)(i) (permitting citizens to petition for parents, spouses and children); id. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1) (allowing cancellation of removal for relatives of citizens and LPRs). But the immigration laws do no t express comparable concern for uniting persons who lack lawful status (or prospective lawful status) in the United States with their families. DACA recipients unquestionably lack lawful status in the United States. See DACA Toolkit at 8 (\"Deferred action . . . does not provide you with a lawful status.\"). Although they may presumptively remain in the United States, at least for the duration of the gr ant of deferred action, that grant is both time-limited and contingent, revocable at any time in the agency's discretion. Extending deferred action to the parents of DACA recipients would therefore expand family-based immigration relief in a manner that deviates in important respects from the immigration system Congress has enacted and the policies that system embodies. Second, as it has been described to us , the proposed deferred action program for the parents of DACA recipients would represent a significant departure from deferred action programs that Congress has implicitly approved in the past. Granting deferred action to the parents of DACA recipients would not operate as an interim measure for individuals to whom Congress has given a prospective entitlement to lawful status. Such parents have no special prospect of obtaining visas, since Congress has not enabled them to self-petition\u2014as it has for VAWA self-petitioners and individuals eligible for T or U visas\u2014or enabled their undocumented children to petition for visas on their behalf. Nor would granting deferred action to parents of DACA recipi ents, at least in the absence of other factors, serve interests that are comparable to those th at have prompted implemen- tation of deferred action programs in the past. Family unity is, as we have discussed, a significant humanitarian concern that underlies many provisions of the INA. But a concern with furthering family unity alone would not justify the Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 121 of 137DHS's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present 33 proposed program, because in the absenc e of any family member with lawful status in the United States, it would not explain why that concern should be satisfied by permitting family members to remain in the United States. The decision to grant deferred action to DACA parents thus seems to depend critically on the earlier decision to make deferred act ion available to their children. But we are aware of no precedent for using deferr ed action in this way, to respond to humanitarian needs rooted in earlier ex ercises of deferred action. The logic underlying such an expansion does not have a clear stopping point: It would appear to argue in favor of extending relief not only to parents of DACA recipi-ents, but also to the close relatives of any alien granted deferred action through DACA or any other program, those relatives' close relatives, and perhaps the relatives (and relatives' relatives) of any alien granted any form of discretionary relief from removal by the Executive. For these reasons, the proposed deferred action program for the parents of DACA recipients is meaningfully different from the proposed program for the parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs. It does not sound in Congress's concern for maintaining the integrity of families of individuals legally entitled to live in the United States. And unlike prior deferred action programs in which Congress has acquiesced, it would treat the Executive's pr ior decision to extend deferred action to one population as justifying the exte nsion of deferred action to additional populations. DHS, of course, remains free to consider whether to grant deferred action to individual parents of DACA recipients on an ad hoc basis. But in the absence of clearer indications that th e proposed class-based deferred action program for DACA parents would be consistent with the congressional policies and priorities embodied in the immigration laws, we conclude that it would not be permissible. III. In sum, for the reasons set forth abov e, we conclude that DHS's proposed prioritization policy and its proposed deferred action program for parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents would be legally permissible, but that the proposed deferred action program for parents of DACA recipients would not be permissible.

As you know, this November 20, 2014 memorandum creating DAPA and Expanded DACA would have granted eligibility for lawful presence and work authorization to over four million unlawfully present aliens. Courts blocked DAPA and Expanded DACA from going into effect, holding that the Executive Branch does not have the unilateral power to confer lawful presence and work authorization on unlawfully present aliens simply because the Executive chooses not to remove them. Rather, \"[i]n specific and detailed provisions, the [Immigration and Nationality Act] expressly and carefully provides legal designations allowing defined classes of aliens to be lawfully present.\" Texas v.

If, by September 5, 2017, the Executive Branch agrees to rescind the June 15, 2012 DACA memorandum and not to renew or issue any new DACA or Expanded DACA permits in the future , then the plaintiffs that successfully challenged DAPA and Expanded DACA will voluntarily dismiss their lawsuit currently pending in the Southern District of Texas. Otherwise, the complaint in that case will be amended to challenge both the DACA program and the remaining Expanded DACA permits. 1 See, e.g. , USCIS, DACA (DACA \"are considered to be lawfully present\"). 2 See DHS, Enforcement of Immigration Laws to Serve National -of- the-Immigration -Laws on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 129 of 137 Post Of fice Box 12548, Austin, Texas 7 8 7 1 1 - 2 5 4 8 ( 5 1 2 ) 4 6 3 - 2 1 0 0 www.texasatto r neygeneral.go v We appreciate the opportunity to continue working with you, and the entire Presidential Administration, to cooperatively enforce federal immigration laws.

Kirchner Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman FROM: Elaine C. Duke Acting Secretary SUBJECT: Rescission of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled \"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children\" This memorandum rescinds the June 15, 2012 memorandum entitled \"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children, \" which established the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\"). For the reasons and in the manner outlined below, Department of Homeland Security personnel shall take all appropriate actions to execute a wind-down of the program, consistent with the parameters established in this memorandum. Background The Department of Homeland Security established DACA through the issuance of a memorandum on June 15, 2012. The program purported to use deferred action\u2014an act of prosecutorial discretion meant to be applied only on an individualized case-by-case basis\u2014to confer certain benefits to illegal aliens that Congress had not otherwise acted to provide by law.[1] (# ftn1) Specifically, DACA provided certain illegal aliens who entered the United States before the age of sixteen a period of deferred action and eligibility to request employment authorization. On November 20, 2014, the Department issued a new memorandum, expanding the parameters of DACA and creating a new policy called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (\"DAPA\"). Among other things\u2014such as the expansion of the coverage criteria under the 2012 DACA policy to encompass aliens with a wider range of ages and arrival dates, and lengthening the period of deferred action and work authorization from two years to three\u2014the November 20, 2014 memorandum directed USCIS \"to establish a process, similar to DACA, for exercising prosecutorial discretion through the use of deferred action, on a case-by-case basis, \" to certain aliens who have \"a son or daughter who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. \" Case 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 133 of 137Prior to the implementation of DAPA, twenty-six states\u2014led by Texas\u2014challenged the policies announced in the November 20, 2014 memorandum in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. In an order issued on February 16, 2015, the district court preliminarily enjoined the policies nationwide.[2] (# ftn2) The district court held that the plaintiff states were likely to succeed on their claim that the DAPA program did not comply with relevant authorities. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that Texas and the other states had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits and satisfied the other requirements for a preliminary injunction.[3] (#_ftn3) The Fifth Circuit concluded that the Department's DAPA policy conflicted with the discretion authorized by Congress. In considering the DAPA program, the court noted that the Immigration and Nationality Act \"flatly does not permit the reclassification of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully present and thereby make them newly eligible for a host of federal and state benefits, including work authorization. \" According to the court, \"DAPA is foreclosed by Congress's careful plan; the program is 'manifestly contrary to the statute' and therefore was properly enjoined. \" Although the original DACA policy was not challenged in the lawsuit, both the district and appellate court decisions relied on factual findings about the implementation of the 2012 DACA memorandum. The Fifth Circuit agreed with the lower court that DACA decisions were not truly discretionary,[4] (#_ftn4) and that DAPA and expanded DACA would be substantially similar in execution. Both the district court and the Fifth Circuit concluded that implementation of the program did not comply with the Administrative Procedure Act because the Department did not implement it through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit's ruling by equally divided vote (4-4).[5] (# ftn5) The evenly divided ruling resulted in the Fifth Circuit order being affirmed. The preliminary injunction therefore remains in place today. In October 2016, the Supreme Court denied a request from DHS to rehear the case upon the appointment of a new Justice. After the 2016 election, both parties agreed to a stay in litigation to allow the new administration to review these issues. On January 25, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 13,768, \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States. \" In that Order, the President directed federal agencies to \"[e]nsure the faithful execution of the immigration laws . . . against all removable aliens, \" and established new immigration enforcement priorities. On February 20, 2017, then Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly issued an implementing memorandum, stating \"the Department no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement, \" except as provided in the Department's June 15, 2012 memorandumCase 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 134 of 137establishing DACA, [6] (# ftn6) and the November 20, 2014 memorandum establishing DAPA and expanding DACA. [7] (#_ftn7) On June 15, 2017, after consulting with the Attorney General, and considering the likelihood of success on the merits of the ongoing litigation, then Secretary John F. Kelly issued a memorandum rescinding DAPA and the expansion of DACA\u2014but temporarily left in place the June 15, 2012 memorandum that initially created the DACA program. Then, on June 29, 2017, Texas, along with several other states, sent a letter to Attorney General Sessions asserting that the original 2012 DACA memorandum is unlawful for the same reasons stated in the Fifth Circuit and district court opinions regarding DAPA and expanded DACA. The letter notes that if DHS does not rescind the DACA memo by September 5, 2017, the States will seek to amend the DAPA lawsuit to include a challenge to DACA. The Attorney General sent a letter to the Department on September 4, 2017, articulating his legal determination that DACA \"was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress' repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result. Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch. \" The letter further stated that because DACA \"has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA. \" Nevertheless, in light of the administrative complexities associated with ending the program, he recommended that the Department wind it down in an efficient and orderly fashion, and his office has reviewed the terms on which our Department will do so. Rescission of the June 15, 2012 DACA Memorandum Taking into consideration the Supreme Court's and the Fifth Circuit's rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated. In the exercise of my authority in establishing national immigration policies and priorities, except for the purposes explicitly identified below, I hereby rescind the June 15, 2012 memorandum. Recognizing the complexities associated with winding down the program, the Department will provide a limited window in which it will adjudicate certain requests for DACA and associated applications meeting certain parameters specified below. Accordingly, effective immediately, the Department:Will adjudicate\u2014on an individual, case-by-case basis\u2014properly filed pending DACA initial requests and associated applications for Employment Authorization DocumentsCase 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 135 of 137that have been accepted by the Department as of the date of this memorandum. Will reject all DACA initial requests and associated applications for Employment Authorization Documents filed after the date of this memorandum. Will adjudicate\u2014on an individual, case by case basis\u2014properly filed pending DACA renewal requests and associated applications for Employment Authorization Documents from current beneficiaries that have been accepted by the Department as of the date of this memorandum, and from current beneficiaries whose benefits will expire between the date of this memorandum and March 5, 2018 that have been accepted by the Department as of October 5, 2017.Will reject all DACA renewal requests and associated applications for Employment Authorization Documents filed outside of the parameters specified above. Will not terminate the grants of previously issued deferred action or revoke Employment Authorization Documents solely based on the directives in this memorandum for the remaining duration of their validity periods. Will not approve any new Form I-131 applications for advance parole under standards associated with the DACA program, although it will generally honor the stated validity period for previously approved applications for advance parole. Notwithstanding the continued validity of advance parole approvals previously granted, CBP will\u2014of course\u2014retain the authority it has always had and exercised in determining the admissibility of any person presenting at the border and the eligibility of such persons for parole. Further, USCIS will\u2014of course\u2014retain the authority to revoke or terminate an advance parole document at any time.Will administratively close all pending Form I-131 applications for advance parole filed under standards associated with the DACA program, and will refund all associated fees. Will continue to exercise its discretionary authority to terminate or deny deferred action at any time when immigration officials determine termination or denial of deferred action is appropriate. This document is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter. Likewise, no limitations are placed by this guidance on the otherwise lawful enforcement or litigation prerogatives of DHS. [1] (# ftnref1) Significantly, while the DACA denial notice indicates the decision to deny is made in the unreviewable discretion of USCIS, USCIS has not been able to identify specific denial cases where an applicant appeared to satisfy the programmatic categorical criteria asCase 1:18-cv-00068 Document 1 Filed on 05/01/18 in TXSD Page 136 of 137outlined in the June 15, 2012 memorandum, but still had his or her application denied based solely upon discretion.
