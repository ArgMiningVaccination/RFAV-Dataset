Just follow these 3 simple steps: 1. Breathe through your belly - the belly breathing; inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth 2. Silently repeat a word, a phrase, or a number (e.g. Love, Peace, 1, 2...) to help you focus. 3. Whenever a thought comes in, simply notice that thought by saying Oh Well silently, let it pass, and return to your breathing. More Tips on Deep Breathing - Turn down the light, sit comfortably and with your back straight in a chair or on the floor , and close your eyes - or make a soft gaze . - Breathe in (through your nose) and out (through your mouth) slowly at the pace of 1...2...3...4 and 4... 3...2...1. - Relax your muscles one part of the body at a time - from your toes to your feet, a nkles, legs, thighs, abdomen, (tummy), back, shoulders, neck, and head, or do it the other way round. - Do not worry about how well you do. Allow relaxation to happen as you go. There is a big difference between allowing it to happen and working so hard to make it happen. - For best results, do this kind of deep breathing once or twice daily for 10 -15 minutes each time . Any time of the day is good, except right after a meal. Based on Clinical Training in Mind/Body Medicine, Harvard Medical Sch ool, June 20 06.

Narrow straps ca n dig into shoulders, causing pain. Two should er straps - Backpacks with one shoulder strap can't share weight evenly. Padded back - A padded back holds sharp edge s on things inside the pack. It makes your backpack more comfortable to wear. Waist strap - A waist strap can share the weight of a heavy load more evenly. To Prevent Backpack Related Injuries, Follow These Tips: Always use both shoulder straps. Carrying a backpack on one shoulder can hurt muscles . Over time It can cause curved spine and hurt your posture as well as your health . Make the straps fit to wear the pack close to the body. The straps should hold the pack 2 inches above the waist. Pack light. The backpack should never weigh more than 15% -20% of your total bo dy weight. To practice this rule , let's do the following exercise: Weight of backpack at 1 5% of your tota l body weight: Body Weight x 0.15 = Weight of backpack at 20% of your total body weight: Body Weight x 0.20 = Organize the backpack to use all pockets inside. Pack heavier items clo sest to the center of your back . Stop of ten at school lockers so you don't carry all the books you need for the day . Bend both knee s, with your feet apart at your shoulders' length, when bend ing down with the backpac k is still on yo ur back . Do not bend over at the waist when wear ing or lifting a heavy backpack . Exercise eve ry day to have a strong body .

Chan School of Public Health, 2017 -2018 53 Nutrition Education Making Sense of the Food Labels (I) (Program Learning Objective ) Session Goal To learn the importance of using the Food Labels as a t ool for healthy eating and develop skills in reading and understanding the Food Labels Teaching Points Food Labels are made based on a 2,000 calories /day diet . In real life, caloric needs are different from person to person. Nutrition Facts on the label are always for one serving . The difference between serving and portion sizes: Serving size: Recom mended and u sed on Food Labels Portion size: Anyone's call - how much food you decide to put on your plate Note: In real life, the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Definition of calories : Units of energy Suggested Activities Circulate a sample fo od label (Bring one from home or choose from the pages below ) Test participants' prior knowledge and skills of label reading by asking a few basic questions about serving size, fats, sugar, or sodium content Emphasiz e the importance of knowing the baselin e numbers as listed in Teaching Points and tested in Pre - and P ost-Surveys Encourage participants to make reading the food labels a healthy habit from now on Student Handout s Trans Fats : Things You should Know Resources Few young adults use nutrit ion labels, new research indicates http://thenationshealth.aphapublications.org/content/48/3/E13 Trans Fats (Video clip) www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp0nc4kY -tc Get the facts on nutrition by reading your food labels www.thenationshealth.aphapublications.org/site/heal thyyou/HealthyYouNutritionFacts.pdf Spanish v ersion: www.thenationshealth.aphapublications.org/site/healthyyou/HealthyYouNutritionSP.pdf Sodium R eduction Campaign Encourages Healthy Choices Among Consumers www.cdc.gov/salt/pdfs/phpsff_massachusetts.pdf 54 Student Handout Trans Fats : Things You should Know Facts about trans fats - Trans fats are artificial fats ( partially hydrogenated fats) made of vegetable oil and hydrogen gas. - Some f ried and baked foods have t rans fats. - Trans fats make foods taste better and last longer. They also provide the desired textures in baked goods. That's why trans fats are a favorite with food makers including restaurants. - When a Food Label lists \"0 trans fat \", it does not mean this food is t rans fat f ree. By law, \"0\" can be listed as long as the food contains less than 0.5 gram of t rans fat s per serving. - Americans eat an average of 6 grams of trans fats a day or almost 5 lbs a year. Possible harms of eating trans fats - Our body can't break down and use tran fats. - Trans fats lower good cholesterol (HDL) and increa se bad cholesterol . - Eating tra ns fats put us at risk for high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, heart disea ses, and even cancer. Check trans fat out in the Food Label - Seeing the \"0 trans fat\" or \"Trans fat free\" claim on the Food Label is not enough. Go on to check the section of Ing redients. - Look for Partially Hydrogenated Fat (= trans fat) in Ingredie nts. If you see the term listed, this food is not trans fat free. Be smart with making your food choices . Going for the Healthy Fats - Unsaturated ( Mono - and Poly-unsaturated) fa ts, such as Omega 3 fats from cold-water oily fish (e.g. Salmon), nuts, and other plant -based foods. - Our body is naturally very good at breaking down and benef iting from the healthy fats. - It is an excellent idea to choose to eat fish and nuts . - Be sure to i nclude plenty of fruits and vegetables in your meals!

Spotl ight Chelsea is the first city in the nation to lead local restaurants to go trans f at Free, thanks to the effort made by MGH Healthy Chelsea Coalition . 55 Nutrition Ed ucation Making Sense of the Food Labels (II) (Program Learning Objective ) Session Goal To learn the importance of using the Food Labels as a tool for healthy eating To develop skills in reading and understanding the Food Labels Teaching Point s Calories, Daily Values (DV), Fats, Protein, Fat-free does not mean c alorie -free Trans Fat: It is the unhealthiest kind of fat . When reading the label, look at the ingredient list for the words \"hydrogenat ed\" or \"parti ally hydrogenated\" as this means the food contains trans f ats. If a product has less than 0.5g of trans fats per serving , it is not against the law for food industry to list it as zero \"trans fat or trans fat free \". Compare: Calories from a gram of fat: 9 ; Calories from a gram of prote in: 4 Definition of Daily Values: A guide to the nutrients in one serving of food. For example, if the label lists 15 percent for calcium, it means that one serving provides 15 percent of the calcium you need each day. The Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 -calorie diet for healthy adults. DV reference ranges: How to understand these ranges? 5% or less range: N ot a significant source of this nutrient Between 10% - 20% range: Not a significant source but not too much 20% or more range: V ery significant source or too much (e.g. sodium/salt) DV for sugar is not listed on a food label Rule of thumb: When it comes to salt and sugar, less is better. Some experts suggest that less than 10% of the daily calories come from salt and sugar. Suggested Activities Circulate the Student Handout s Have the students do Sugar Shockers Activity Encourage the students to start rea ding the food labels now and make it a habit Try checking the food label for peanut butter to practice the skill of detectin g the hidden trans fat Student Materials Let's Learn to Read the Food Labels: What information is important to check?

Information listed on a Food Label is based on a 2,000 calorie diet / day. More Tips Check the serving size and number of servings. If you are eating more than one serving, you are getting mor e calories and more of everything as listed in the label . Check the calories per serving: 40 is low; 100 is medium; 400 is high. Understand Percent D aily Values ( DV): 5% is low; 20% or more is high Limit sodium and added sugar in your me als, snacks, and drinks . Make sure you are getting enough healthy fats, fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals. Updated August 8 , 2019. For more information about Food Label reading in English and other languages, visit www.fda.gov . Nutrition Facts Serving Size Check the suggested serving size . Use this information to guide you to good portion control Servings per container : Check number of servings in the whole container. Tip: Nutrition information on a food label is for 1 serving. If you eat more than 1 serving, remember to multiply . Calories Check calories per serving Tips: Know the following rules of thumb: 40 calories/per serving: Low in calories 100 calories/per serving: Medium in calories 400 calories/per serving: High in calories Watch for calories from Fat - it should be less than 30% DV. Total Fat Look for low saturated f at. Eat no trans fat - look for words like \"hydrogenated\" or \"partially hydrogenated \" (trans fat) in the ingredient list to make sure that the product conta ins no trans fat. Tip: Low saturated fat means 2 grams or less fat per serving. Cholesterol Look for low cholesterol Tip: Low cholester ol means 20 milligrams or less per serving. Sodium (in salt) Look for low sodium Tips: Less salt is better for your health . Low sodium means 140 milligrams or less per serving. Carbohydrates Mainly sugars and starches Tips: 1 gram of carb = 4 calories Dietary Fiber : Look for more fiber per serving. Tips: Good source of fiber means at least 3 gra ms per serving . Excellent source of fiber means 5 or more grams per serving . Sugar : Look for low or no sugar ; watch for added sugar . High sugar means 7 or more grams of sugar per serving. 1 teaspoonful of sugar = 4 grams of sugar Protein Proteins are the building blocks of life in every cell in the human body. They are v ery important for children's health and growth. Tips: 7 grams (1 oz .) protein = 1 serving; 1 gram protein = 4 calories Compare with Fat: 4 - 5 grams (1 oz .) fat = 1 serving 1 gram fat = 9 calories The type of fat is more important than the amount. Trans fat is the most unhealthy type of fat. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat -like stuff in all body cells. Many f ruits and vegetables c ome with fiber. Try to eat 5+ servings of them a day. Whole grain food also has more fiber. Eat less sugar Protein comes from e ggs, fish, lean meat, nuts, seeds, beans , and vegetables like broccoli and brussels sprouts DV: Percent Daily Value It is a guide to the nutrients in 1 serving of food. For example, if the label lists 15% for calcium, it means that 1 serving provides 15% of the calciu m you need each day. Read the Labels to make informed and healthy choices. Eat in small portions. Try to eat food with less sodium (salt) 58 Sample Food Label s From : http://www.fda.gov Keep in mind: - Information listed on a Food Label is based on a 2,000 calorie diet / day. In real life, people may eat more or less than 2,000 calo ries a day. - Food labels are to help us make healthy food choices. - It is a good habit to read the labels. 59 LOTS of research shows that consuming sugary foods and drinks is harmful to your mind and body. We all know that candy, cookies and soda have a lot of sugar in them, but sugar can hide in foods that aren't even that sweet! Here's what to look out for to avoid added sugars . GRANOLA BARS are a quick and easy snack, but next time you reach for one, check the ingredients for molasses, malt extracts, and anything that ends in \" -ose,\" \"syrup\" or \"saccharide.\" These are sugars hiding in your \"healthy\" snack! It's pretty tough to find granola bars without a lot of added sugars that don't taste like cardboard, so a quick, filling, and delicious snack is trail mix. You can even make it yourself! Put together your favorite nuts, seeds and dried fruits - just go easy on the chocolate chips! YOGURT has calcium, protein and probiotics that keep your digestive system healthy, but watch out for ingredients that end in \"syrup\" and \"concentrate,\" because these are added sugars. Don't like plain, unsweetened yogurt? Try mixing in a teaspoon of your favorite fruit jelly or honey! It sweetens the yogurt but has less sugar than if you bought the sweetened kind. JUIC E & SPORTS DRINKS Do you play a team sport, run or weight train? That's awesome - keep it up! But put away the Gatorade and Vitamin Water. These drinks can have over 20 grams of sugar per serving, and a lot of bottles contain more than one serving! If you 're sweating a lot or working out intensely for a long period of time, sports drinks might be a good option, but most people only need water to stay hydrated during exercise. Electrolytes in sports drinks are mostly sodium and potassium, so a couple cracke rs and some banana before/after your workout will do the job without 20+ grams of added sugar. DRESSINGS & SAUCES WHAT?! These foods aren't even sweet! It's true though. Peep the label on your spaghetti and barbeque sauces and favorite salad dressings. I f you see sugar or high fructose corn syrup on the ingredients list, you've got yourself some added sugar. There are lots of ways to jazz up your meat, pasta or salad without added sugar. Instead of BBQ sauce, try a sugar -free dry rub on your chicken! An d lots of brands make tomato sauce and salad dressing without sugar - it just takes an extra look at the label to find them!

Warm -up is an activity that prepares your body for physical exercise at any intensity. It makes your heart beat and breathing faster. What Can I Do to Warm Up? You can use the activity that y ou are going to do for exercise at a slower pace for your warm -up. For example, if you plan to or jog, start with a 10 minute walk or jog at a slower pace than you would normal walk or jog. Then move on to stretching. What Is Stretching? When and How Do I Do It? Stretching is great for you before you start your exercise, but after you have warmed up. Stretching can lower the chance of muscle injuries. It does so by improving your muscle flexibility. When you stretch a muscle, you want to feel pulling of that muscle. To do a stretch, you hold the position for 30 seconds and repeat 2 -3 times. Breathe normally as you go. Stretch safely: Try not to bounce or push too hard. What Is a Cool -Down? Yes, cooling -down is very important! You need to slow down your body after a workout for 5 -10 minutes to help your body recover from the workout. It should include light aerobic exercise like walking or marching, then stretching. Cooling down can help slow down your heart beat and breathing, and lower the c hance for muscle and joint pain.

There are top ranges of flexibility for different sports and activities. Stretching improves flexibility. Range of motion (ROM): The degree of movement your body can perform at a joint. Muscle Stretching : To extend a muscle requires a body movem ent to reach the point of resistance within the range of motion. Active stretch is when the stretching person supplies the force of stretching - you yourself do it. Passive stretch is when someone else or a stretching machine helps to make stretching hap pen - you are helped to stretch. Why stretch? Like all exercises, stretching helps make you feel great. Increase the general flexibility of a body part by stretching tight muscles or joints Prevent the risk of injuries to muscles and joints Improve perfo rmance, function and health (your posture, balance, and quick response) Types of Stretching Dynamic muscle stretch : This type of stretch uses specific movements to prepare the body for a particular activity. It is also called functionally based stretc hing exercise. Static muscle stretch: This type of stretch is a slow and constant stretching exercise. The end position during this type of stretch is usually held for 30 seconds. It helps improve range of motion.

Yo ur goal is to keep daily stress under control ! 8. Stay in close touch with nature every day Take a minute to enjoy the beauty of Mother Nature - listen to the rain drops on tree leaves, look at the flower on the road side .... People who enjoy natural beauties and find peace in them have a better chance to enjoy good health. 9. Choose respect Practice healthy and respective communication skills at all times. Remember: Bullying is against the law. 10. Connect heart to heart with a loved one or a close friend often Love and friendship are also key to good health.
