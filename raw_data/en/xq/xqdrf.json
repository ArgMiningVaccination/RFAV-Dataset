The survey addressed how organisations managed patient safe ty, what incident reporting systems were in place, how information on patient safety was analysed and how information from reported incidents was used to prevent similar errors recurring. In addition to presenting the headline figures to specific questions we wanted to use this information to gain an overall picture of how we ll the NHS is improving reporting and learning from patient safety incidents. Based on key processes as defined by An organisation with a memory, we developed a model to compare and assess trust performance. The performance indicators were: the issue was given a high profile lead; an open culture, in which errors or service failures can be admitted, reported and discussed without fear of reprisal, had been developed; a well-established incident reporting system; patient and service users are involved to encourage learning; the incident reporting system focused on near misses as well as actual incidents; specific training was provided; feedback was given to front-line staff and patients to allow people to see what has changed as a result of incident or near miss reporting; staff and patients identified learning priorities and the developed sound solutions to patient safety problems; and systems facilitated dissemination of learning internally and NHS-wide. Scores were given based on trusts' responses to 17 questions identified from our census. The scoring system and the specific questions we selected for the purposes of comparison are set out below. A2: Who has lead board level executive resp onsibility for patient safety in your organisation? Response Score Chief Executive 1 Other executive board member 1 Lead responsibility is not at executive board level 0 Maximum score: 1 A10: How would your organisation describe its safety culture? Response Score The trust has an open and fair safety culture throughout 3 The trust has a predominantly open and fair safety culture 2 The trust is moving towards an open and fair safety culture 1 The trust has predominantly blaming and closed safety culture 0 Maximum score: 3 B1: For how long has your organisation been op erating a trust-wide patient safety incident reporting system? Response Score Less than a year 1 1 - 2 years 1 2 - 3 years 2 3 - 4 years 2 4 - 5 years 3 5 - 7 years 3 Over 7 years 3 Not operating one 0 Maximum Score: 3 B9:What steps does the trust take to inform patients of the ways in which they can raise their concerns about patient safety? Response Score Response 6 or no responses 0 Response 4 1 1 or 2 from responses 1,2,3 or 5 2 3 + from responses 1,2,3 or 5 3 Maximum score: 3 B10: To what extent does your organisation perceive under-reporting of patient safety incidents, both actual (those that have an impact on patients), and near-misses to be a problem? (a) Actual (b) Near-misses Response Score Score Under-reporting is a major problem within our trust 0 0 Under-reporting is a moderate problem within our trust 1 1 Under-reporting is only a minor problem within our trust 2 2 Under-reporting is not a problem within our trust 3 3 Don't Know 0 0 Maximum score: 3 3 B16/ 17/ 18: How does your organisation ensu re existing/ temporary and contractor staff are aware of the trust's patient safety reporting requirements? Existing Temporary Contractor Response Score Score Score No responses selected 0 0 0 1 response selected 1 1 1 2 responses selected 2 2 2 3 or more responses selected 3 3 3 None of the above selected 0 0 0 Maximum score: 3 3 3 C17: When staff, patients or the public report patient safety incidents or near misses, is it the trust's practice to provide the following? (a) Staff (b) Patients Response Score Score No responses selected 0 0 1 response selected 1 1 2 responses selected 2 2 All responses selected or responses a, b and c selected 3 3 Maximum score: 3 3 D2/ D3: Do all relevant staff and patient groups play a role in the identification of patient safety priorities for action within the trust? D2 Staff D3 Patients Response Score Score Yes 1 1 No 0 0 Maximum score: 1 1 D4/ D5: Do all relevant staff and patient groups play a role in the design and development of patient safety solutions within the trust? D4 Staff D5 Patients Response Score Score Yes 1 1 No 0 0 Maximum score: 1 1 D6/ D7: How does your organisation disseminate lessons learnt across the trust, and with what other organisations do you share lessons learnt? D6 Disseminate across the trust D7 Sharing lessons with other organisations Response Score Score None or one response selected 0 0 2 - 3 responses selected 1 1 4 - 5 responses selected 2 2 6 or more responses selected 3 3 Maximum score: 3 3 E1: What actions have you taken as chief executive to improve patient safety in your trust? Response Score Any response 1 No response or Don't Know 0 Maximum score: 1 E4: To what extent does the system your trust currently has in place enable it to meet this standard? Response Score System enables them fully 2 System enables them in part 1 System does not enable them 0 Maximum score: 2 Figure: Over three-quarters of trusts have made good progress in establishing key processes to improve performance in patient safety Note: The percentage scores are a relative indicator of performance and not an attempt to assign an absolute score to trusts. 020406080100120 31 - 40 41 - 50 51 - 60 61 - 70 71 - 80 81 - 90 91 - 100 Score (per cent)Score (per cent) Number of trusts 31 - 40 3 41 - 50 21 51 - 60 36 61 - 70 104 71 - 80 76 81 - 90 24 91 - 100 3 267 "}
