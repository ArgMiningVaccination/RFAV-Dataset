A successful response to the COVID-19 pandemic requires achieving high levels of vaccine uptake. We tested whether directly contrasting the high efcacy ofCOVID-19 vaccines with the lower efcacy of the annual flu vaccine would increaseintentions to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Design. A pre-registered online study of 481 participants compared four information conditions: (1) no information; (2) COVID-19 Vaccine Information Only; and COVID-19 Vaccine Information combined with flu vaccine information suggesting either (3) 60%efcacy or (4) 40% efcacy; we measured COVID-19 and flu vaccine intentions along with several other vaccine-related variables. Methods. The Prolic platform was used to recruit 481 UK participants (64% female; aged between 18 and 85 years) who had been pre-screened to have intermediate levels ofvaccine hesitancy. After reading a short text ( ~200 words) about COVID-19 vaccines, participants were asked about their vaccination intentions. Results. Providing information about the safety and efcacy of the new COVID-19 vaccines resulted in vaccination intentions that were, on average, 0.39 standard deviations(SDs) higher than those in the no information condition; providing the same COVID vaccine efcacy information in the context of information about flu vaccine efcacy resulted in a further signicant increase in vaccination intentions that were 0.68 SDhigher than those in the no information condition. This positive contrast effect for the COVID-19 vaccine was not associated with reduced flu vaccine intentions. Conclusions. Vaccination intentions can be strengthened through a simple messaging intervention that utilizes context effects to increase perceived response efcacy. Statement of Contribution What is already known on this subject? /C15Very high levels of COVID-19 vaccine uptake are required to attain herd immunity. Previous experience and recent surveys suggest that achieving such high levels of uptake will be challenging. /C15Protection motivation theory predicts that high uptake requires both high threat appraisal and highcoping appraisal.

What does this study add? /C15The results show that providing information about the safety and efcacy of the new COVID-19 vaccines results in higher vaccination intentions than among those who do not receive this information. /C15Providing COVID vaccine efcacy information in the context of information about flu vaccine efcacy results in even stronger COVID-19 vaccination intentions, without undermining flu vaccine intentions. /C15These ndings support the role of response efcacy and suggest that perceived response efcacy canbe boosted via a simple intervention that draws on cognitive theory. Background Along with the introduction of safe drinking water, vaccination is the greatest success of modern public health, saving millions of lives every year. In addition to the direct protection offered to those individuals who receive a vaccine, vaccination indirectly protects those around them by reducing the spread of disease. The latest vaccines to beintroduced are those that provide protection against COVID-19, the disease caused by theSARS-CoV-2 virus. The speed with which these vaccines have been developed is animpressive achievement, given that vaccines typically take decades to develop and get tothe point of approval. Vaccine uptake Nevertheless, it is one thing to have an effective vaccine and another thing to have avaccinated population. The minimum level of coverage of a population required to attainherd immunity against a virus depends on the basic reproductive number R 0of that virus.1 In the case of COVID-19, this coverage was initially estimated at around 70% (Kwok, Lai, Wei, Wong, & Tang, 2020). However, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants ofhigher transmissibility implies that an even higher level of coverage ( >80%) may be required to reach herd immunity. In practice, achieving such a high coverage requires an even greater proportion of the population to be vaccinated (or infected), given that vaccine efcacy is <100%. It is not easy to achieve such high levels of vaccine uptake. For example, although the seasonal flu vaccine is recommended for all individuals above the age of 6 months, levelsof uptake are often low. To illustrate, among US adults, flu vaccine coverage was only37.1% during the 2017 -2018 season, a year in which the flu was associated with particularly high levels of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths (the US Center for DiseaseControl [CDC] estimated there were 79,400 deaths overall in the United States, including 10,300 deaths among working age adults; CDC, 2018). In such cases, the low level of uptake does not reflect a lack of vaccine or major barriers to the access to vaccines, butrather vaccine hesitancy , which the World Health Organization (WHO) denes as 'delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services' (WHO,2014). The level of vaccine hesitancy and the reasons for it can vary by sub-population(Ozawa et al., 2019; Quinn, Jamison, Musa, Hilyard, & Freimuth, 2016). 1The minimum proportion of the population needed to be immunized to achieve herd immunity is 1 - 1/ R0, where R0is the reproduction number.2Colin J. Davis et al.Some of the problems with vaccine uptake can be tackled by economic and policy measures, such as broadening the scope of health insurance and framing vaccination asthe default option. However, vaccine uptake is also affected by people's attitudes andbeliefs (e.g., Murphy et al., 2021). Behavioural scientists have a role to play to better understand the factors affecting vaccine hesitancy, and to explore how we can influence behaviour to boost vaccine uptake. Types of vaccine hesitancy Though media representations often depict polarized pro- and anti-vaccine positions,there is a continuum of attitudes to vaccines that ranges from outright refusal to completeacceptance (e.g., Quinn et al., 2016). Prior to the widespread rollout of COVID-19 vaccination, surveys in the United Kingdom and other countries indicated that most adults expressed an intention to take a COVID-19 vaccine if it were offered (Detoc et al., 2020;Sherman et al., 2020); as we describe below, we observed a similar trend in our ownsurvey. Nevertheless, there remains a signicant minority who do not express a deniteintention to take a COVID-19 vaccine if it is offered to them. It is useful to distinguish twogroups within this minority (e.g., Pierre, 2020). On the one hand, there are those who areextremely hesitant, vulnerable to conspiracy theories, and who may fall into the categoryof 'anti-vaxxers'. Tackling vaccine hesitancy in this group may depend on techniques for reducing the impact of misinformation (Lewandowsky, Ecker, Seifert, Schwarz, & Cook, 2012). On the other hand, there are those who do not reject all vaccines, but who are cautious about the COVID-19 vaccine. Such individuals may not be inclined to take a vaccine simplybecause it is recommended by an authority, preferring to collect further evidence beforemaking their decision. It is this group who are the focus of the present study. Individuals inthis group have ambivalent or even moderately favourable attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine, but are at relatively high risk of not ultimately being vaccinated. We can refer to this group as the 'cautious middle' or 'fencesitters' (Gust et al., 2005). Protection motivation theory Theories from health psychology provide a framework for describing the factorsunderlying vaccine hesitancy and may inform interventions to increase vaccine uptake.One theory that has helped to understand vaccine behaviour is Protection motivationtheory (Maddux & Rogers, 1983). According to this theory, people's motivation to protect themselves is a function of their threat appraisal , that is, their perception of the health threat, and their coping appraisal , that is, their perception of what can be done to reduce or prevent that threat. The theory predicts that high uptake requires both high threatappraisal and high coping appraisal. Threat appraisal Appraisal of a health threat involves considering both the severity of that threat and one's personal vulnerability to it. In accord with protection motivation theory, vaccine intentions are strongly related to risk perception (e.g., Brewer et al., 2007; Ernsting,Lippke, Schwarzer, & Schneider, 2011; Freimuth, Jamison, An, Hancock, & Quinn, 2017).This relationship can explain the lower levels of influenza vaccine uptake amongstyounger people, who tend to be less worried about catching the flu, despite being at highEfcacy information and COVID-19 vaccine intention 3risk for influenza morbidity (Bednarczyk et al., 2015). In the case of COVID-19, there is a relatively high degree of concern about the risks associated with the disease, both withrespect to personal susceptibility to being infected and the consequences of becominginfected (Dryhurst et al., 2020). These high levels of concern can be predicted to promote high vaccination uptake. Coping appraisal An individual's coping appraisal involves considering self-efcacy (one's own ability totake the necessary preventative action), response efcacy (how likely the recommendedbehaviour is to alleviate the threat), and response costs (barriers to performance of thebehaviour, such as anticipated side effects of vaccination). Previous research has found evidence for all three of these factors in predicting vaccine behaviour (e.g., Ehrenstein et al., 2010; Ling, Kothe, & Mullan, 2019; Quinn et al., 2016). Several studies have offered evidence for the influence of perceived response costs. Parents who delay or refuse immunization for their children are signicantly less likely tobelieve that vaccines are safe (Gust et al., 2004). Likewise, parents with stronger beliefsthat vaccination is unhealthy and can harm the immune system are more likely to refusethe combined Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine for their children (Flynn &Ogden, 2004). These studies point to the importance of assuaging safety concerns. Indeed, safety scares can lead to substantial drops in seasonal influenza vaccination (e.g., Rosselli, Martini, Bragazzi, & Watad, 2017). However, not all studies have observed cleareffects of perceived response costs (Camerini, Diviani, Fadda, & Schulz, 2019; Ling et al.,2019). In the case of vaccination, self-efcacy refers to an individual's perception of their own ability to get vaccinated while response efcacy reflects an individual's perception of theefcacy of the vaccine, that is, how effectively it will protect them from the disease. Self-efcacy for taking a vaccine is related to the availability, affordability, and accessibility of the vaccine. Uptake is lower if these factors are perceived to pose an obstacle (e.g., Ling et al., 2019; Quinn et al., 2016). Response efcacy is typically measured using items suchas 'I believe if I receive the flu vaccine, I will be less likely to get the flu'. Responses to suchitems are strongly positively correlated with vaccine intentions and behaviour (Ernstinget al., 2011; Ling et al., 2019; Pareek & Pattison, 2000; for more examples in the case ofvaccination against pandemic influenza, see the systematic review by Bish, Yardley,Nicoll, and Michie, 2011). Systematic reviews of the factors influencing seasonal fluvaccination have consistently found that uptake was associated with higher perceived effectiveness (Chapman & Coups, 1999; Yeung, Lam, & Coker, 2016). Indeed, perceived response efcacy may be the best predictor of vaccine intentions and behaviour. Forexample, Pareek and Pattison (2000) found that vaccine outcome beliefs explained 77% ofthe variance in mothers' MMR vaccine intentions. Similarly, a mediation analysis byErnsting et al. (2011) suggested that the influence of risk perception and negativeoutcome expectancies was limited to an indirect effect on vaccination behaviour via theformation of intentions, whereas positive outcome expectancies had both an indirect anda direct effect on vaccine behaviour. Designing an intervention to boost vaccine uptake Given the need to achieve very high levels of vaccine uptake so as to attain herd immunity,the question of how to boost uptake of COVID-19 vaccines is a pressing concern.4Colin J. Davis et al.Protection motivation theory and the sample of relevant evidence reviewed above suggest potential areas for intervention. In view of the already high levels of threat associated withCOVID-19, the most promising interventions for increasing vaccine uptake are those thatseek to influence coping appraisal. Of these, self-efcacy should be targeted, but in practice this is most likely to involve policy interventions, for example, making the COVID-19 vaccine freely available, placing vaccination centres in highly populated areas,and so on. The remaining two aspects of coping appraisal, response efcacy and responsecosts, are both potential targets for intervention, with the former likely to be particularlyimportant. Beliefs in the safety and efcacy of vaccines are often grouped together under the heading vaccine condence . The WHO has recognized the importance of monitoring vaccine condence and its role in vaccine uptake (Salmon & Dudley, 2020). To date, though, interventions to increase vaccine condence have shown limited success. A review by Brewer, Chapman, Rothman, Leask, and Kempe (2017) bemoaned the absenceof effective interventions to boost condence in individuals for whom it is not high, notingthat, 'we do not know how to reliably increase vaccine condence. Interventions toincrease condence through persuasion and education have had no appreciable orreliable effect on vaccination coverage' (p. 163). A consideration that may be relevant to the perceived response efcacy of COVID-19 vaccines is the fact that the objective efcacy levels are extremely high. When our study was conducted, the outcome of Phase 3 trials had been reported for two COVID-19 vaccines: the Pzer vaccine had an efcacy of 95% (Pzer-Press-Release, and theModerna vaccine had an of 94% (Moderna-Press-Release, 2020). This very highlevel of efcacy can be contrasted with that of more familiar vaccines, notably the annualflu vaccine. The typical seasonal flu vaccine has an efcacy no higher than 60% (Cohen,2017), and the mean for the 15 flu seasons from 2004 -2005 to 2018 -2019 was 40% (CDC, 2019). Thus, the new COVID-19 vaccines have a much higher efcacy than the fluvaccines that have been used for many years. Such a contrast is not merely academic -it may be relevant to the way people consider vaccines and the way vaccine messaging is presented. Explicitly comparing the efcacy ofthe novel COVID-19 vaccines with the more familiar flu vaccine focuses the individual'sattention on efcacy as the key evaluative dimension (Tversky, 1977), drawing attentionaway from other dimensions (e.g., the novelty of the vaccine). Given the focus on efcacy,and the context provided by the much lower efcacy of the flu vaccine, we can expect acontrast effect (Schwartz & Bless, 1992), amplifying the favourable perception of theCOVID-19 vaccine. These considerations led us to predict that providing participants with knowledge about the relative efcacy of the COVID-19 and flu vaccines would increase the stated intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. This potential benet notwithstanding, a potential drawback of the efcacy comparison is the possibility that it could undermine the perceived efcacy of the fluvaccine and lead to a reduced uptake of this vaccine. This would be a very negativeoutcome, as even a very low efcacy (e.g., 20%) flu vaccine has the potential to avertmillions of infections, hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, and tens of thousands ofdeaths, provided coverage is high (Sah, Medlock, Fitzpatrick, Singer, & Galvani, 2018). It would not be rational to reduce one's condence in the flu vaccine based on learning about the higher efcacy of a vaccine developed to tackle a different disease. However, ifpeople tend to overestimate the efcacy of the flu vaccine, this overestimation may bemade salient through the provision of information about the true efcacy.Efcacy information and COVID-19 vaccine intention 5The current study The primary goals of the present study were to test whether this positive contrast effectcould increase intentions to take a COVID-19 vaccine, and to check whether there is anynegative contrast effect on intentions to take an annual flu vaccine. We also sought to (1) determine what the estimated efcacy of the flu vaccine is, and whether this systematically overestimates the true efcacy; and (2) investigate the effect of providinginformation about flu vaccine efcacy on both perceived efcacy and intention to take theflu vaccine. Method Pre-screeningBased on a prior experiment, we expected the distribution of COVID-19 vaccineintentions to be strongly skewed towards high levels of acceptance. That experimentshowed that, overall, vaccine information did not increase vaccine intentions, due to anapparent ceiling effect, but that there was evidence of an effect of vaccine information onthose with intermediate levels of vaccine intentions. We therefore pre-registered ourintention to examine this effect on a sample of participants who had been pre-screened to belong to this 'cautious middle' demographic. For the pre-screening, we asked participants to respond to the statement, 'I intend to take a COVID vaccine' on a 7-point scale from strongly disagree tostrongly agree . Participants were recruited via the Prolic platform. They had already been pre-screenedto be adult residents of the United Kingdom who had English as their rst language andwho had no (self-reported) language disorders and had not been infected with COVID-19(this was a screening variable made available by the Prolic platform, but our experimentalso included a question about infection to exclude participants who had been infected subsequent to the Prolic screening question). We obtained responses from 2000 participants on 11 December 2020 and a further 400 participants on 15 December 2020.The distribution of responses is shown in Table 1. As can be seen, most respondentsshowed strong vaccine intentions. There were 1,021 (23.2%) who fell into the cautiousmiddle category by virtue responding 'Somewhat agree', 'Neither agree nor disagree' or'Somewhat disagree'. Participants The experiment was advertised to these 1,021 individuals, and data collection took placebetween 12 December and 17 December 2020. Following our pre-registered analysis Table 1. Distribution of responses in pre-screening question ('I intend to take a COVID vaccine') Response n % Strongly agree 1,782 40.5 Agree 1,069 24.3 Somewhat agree 507 11.5 Neither agree nor disagre 300 6.8Somewhat disagree 214 4.9Disagree 239 5.4 Strongly disagre 289 6.66Colin J. Davis et al.plan, 81 participants were excluded from the analysis. Of these, 41 had already tested positive for COVID-19 (or believed that they had had COVID-19) and 40 failed one or bothattention checks. These participants were replaced, so that we ultimately had n=100 participants in each of the four conditions. 2Of these, 64% were female, and one person reported their gender as Other. The age of participants ranged between 18 and 85, with a median of 36 and mean of 37.8 years. Stimuli and design The experiment involved a single factor (information condition) between-groups design.Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) no information(participants were asked questions about vaccines and their intentions without receiving any prior information); (2) COVID-19 Vaccine Information Only (participants rst received information about the efcacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines); (3) FluInformation -60% (participants received the COVID-19 Vaccine Information together with the information that flu vaccine efcacy has not exceeded about 60% in recent years);or (4) Flu Information -40% (participants received the COVID-19 Vaccine Information together with the information that the average flu vaccine efcacy in recent years has been40%). The goal of the manipulation of flu vaccine efcacy information was to gauge howsensitive participants were to variations in efcacy. The specic values chosen for conditions (3) and (4) were consistent with different ways of summarizing evidence, and the difference between the values seemed sufciently large that it was feasible thatparticipants might distinguish them. The full set of stimuli for this experiment, as well as our pre-registered hypotheses and analysis plan and the raw data, can be found at https://osf.io/w4nmv/. Procedure The study was self-certied in accordance with the ethics procedure of Royal Holloway, University of London, and all participants provided their informed consent. Participantswere presented with a short text ( ~200 words) about COVID-19 vaccines, describing their safety and efcacy and the positive implications of widespread uptake (participants in theno information condition did not see this text). The full text is reproduced in theAppendix. Following the text, participants were asked two questions about their vaccination intentions, ve questions about vaccine efcacy (two of which elicited the percentages mentioned in the provided text and which thus served as an attention check), one question about their previous vaccination behaviour, one question about whether theyhad previously contracted COVID-19, and two demographic questions. 2Our pre-registration stated that we would aim to recruit 150 participants per condition, or the largest sample that research funds would allow. Given the greater than expected expense of pre-screening to nd participants who met our inclusion criteria, and the greater than anticipated number of participants who reported having had COVID-19 (and therefore had to be excluded) we wereunable to achieve this goal, and opted to stop when we had 100 participants per condition; we did not analyse the data until alldata were collected.Efcacy information and COVID-19 vaccine intention 7Vaccination intentions The rst question asked, 'If you were offered a COVID-19 vaccine tomorrow, how likely isit that you would take the vaccine?'. The second question asked, 'How likely is it that youwill take the flu vaccine in the future?'. Responses to both questions were made using a slider representing an 11-point scale from not likely at all tovery likely . The responses to these questions are the two key dependent variables. Perceived vaccine efcacy This construct was measured using three items from Kim, Pjesivac, and Jin (2019; 2017,adapted from Witte, Meyer, & Martell, 2001). Participants were asked to indicate thedegree to which they agreed with the following three statements on a scale of 1 ( strongly disagree )t o7( strongly agree ): (1) 'I believe the flu vaccine is effective in preventing the flu'; (2) 'I believe if I receive the flu vaccine, I will be less likely to get the flu'; and (3) 'Ibelieve the flu vaccine works in preventing the flu'. The responses were averaged to forma single PVE measure. Attention check These two questions asked about the efcacy of the COVID-19 and flu vaccines: 'The text that you read mentioned the efcacy of (COVID-19 vaccines)/(the annual flu vaccine). Please move the slider to roughly correspond to the efcacy level mentioned in the text'.These questions served as an attention check, to ensure that participants encoded theinformation that was critical to the experimental manipulation. Participants in the noinformation conditions did not see the flu vaccine version of this question (as they werenot presented with any text about the efcacy of this vaccine). Instead, they saw thefollowing question: 'Please give your best guess of the average efcacy of the annual fluvaccine'. Responses to this question provide an index of the general population's knowledge of the flu vaccine efcacy (we expected that this measure would be an overestimate of the true average efcacy). Participants in the no information condition did not see the COVID-19 vaccine efcacy attention check question (as they were not presented with any text about this vaccine'sefcacy). Instead, they saw the following text and question: 'Vaccine efcacy is thepercentage reduction of disease in a vaccinated group of people compared to anunvaccinated group, under the most favourable conditions. For example, a vaccine with100% efcacy would protect everyone who received it from becoming sick. Based on what you have heard of COVID-19 vaccines, what is your best guess of their efcacy?' Responses to this question provide an index of the general population's beliefs aboutCOVID-19 vaccine efcacy. Vaccination behaviour A single question asked, 'Have you already taken a flu vaccine this year?' (yes/no). COVID-19 infection A single question asked, 'Do you know or strongly believe that you have been infected bythe virus that causes COVID-19?' (yes/no).8Colin J. Davis et al.Demographic variables Participants were asked to indicate their age and gender. The experiment tookapproximately 3 min in total. Results Mean vaccine intentions and perceived flu vaccine efcacy for each condition are shownin Table 2. COVID-19 vaccine intentions We pre-registered three planned, directional (i.e., one-tailed) t-tests. A nominal alpha criterion of 0.05 was assumed for testing statistical signicance; after Bonferronicorrection, a conservative criterion of 0.05/3 =0.017 was employed for testing these three tests. The rst test showed that participants who received information about (only)COVID-19 vaccines subsequently showed a stronger intention to take a COVID-19 vaccine(mean =5.53) than participants who did not receive any information (mean =4.61), t (198) =2.77, p=.003, d=0.39. As can be seen in Figure 1, this effect resulted from a shrinking of the distribution in the COVID-19 Vaccine Info Only condition, suggesting that the safety and efcacy information helped to assuage the concerns of some of the morehesitant participants, but did not greatly influence the participants who were alreadyslightly more positive. The second test showed that participants who received the 40% flu vaccine efcacy information subsequently showed a stronger intention to take a COVID-19 vaccine(mean =6.26) than participants who received COVID-19 vaccine information but no flu vaccine information (mean =5.53), t(197) =2.16, p=.016, d=0.31. As can be seen in Figure 1, this effect seems to have been driven by a shift in the distribution. The third test compared participants who received flu vaccine efcacy information (describing either 40% or 60% efcacy) (mean =6.10) with participants who received COVID-19 vaccine information but no flu vaccine information (mean =5.53). There was a numerical difference suggesting greater intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine in theformer group, but this did not quite attain signicance after Bonferroni correction, t (218) =1.96, p=.025, d=0.24. Flu vaccine intentions Mean flu vaccine intentions for the four information conditions are shown in Figure 2. Wepre-registered three planned, directional t-tests concerning the impact of information on Table 2. Means (and SDs) of perceived vaccine efcacy (PVE), flu vaccine intentions (FVI), and COVID- 19 vaccine intentions (C19VI) by information condition Condition n PVE FVI C19VI No information 100 5.09 (1.17) 5.27 (3.24) COVID-19 vaccine info 5.53 (2.30)Flu efcacy 100 5.12 (0.97) 5.84 (3.17) 6.26 (2.48)Efcacy information and COVID-19 vaccine intention 9flu vaccine intentions. The rst test indicated no difference in flu vaccine intentions between participants who received the 40% flu vaccine efcacy information (mean = 5.84) and those who did not receive any flu vaccine information (only the COVID-19 vaccine information; mean =5.78), t(198) =0.13, p=.55. The second test indicated no difference in flu vaccine intentions between participants who received flu vaccine efcacy information (describing either 40% or 60% efcacy; mean =5.80) and those who did not receive any flu vaccine information (only the COVID- 19 vaccine information; mean =5.78), t(203) =0.05, p=.52. The third test indicated no difference in flu vaccine intentions between participants who received the 40% flu vaccine efcacy information (mean =5.84) and those who received the 60% flu vaccine efcacy information (mean =5.76), t(197) =0.17, p=.57. Inspection of the means led us to conduct an additional test. This (two-tailed) test compared flu vaccine intentions for those who received information (mean =5.79) versus those who received no information (mean =5.27). The difference was not signicant, t(169) =1.40, p=.16. Perceived flu vaccine efcacy The correlation between perceived flu vaccine efcacy and estimated vaccine efcacywasr=0.52, which was signicant ( p<.001), but sufciently smaller than 1 to suggest that these are distinct constructs. Figure 3 shows mean perceived flu vaccine efcacy for Figure 1. COVID-19 vaccine intention as a function of information condition.10 Colin J. Davis et al.the four information conditions. As can be seen, there was little indication of any difference between conditions. This was conrmed by the pre-registered planned tests.The rst test indicated no difference in perceived flu vaccine efcacy betweenparticipants who received the 40% flu vaccine efcacy information (mean =5.12) and those who did not receive any flu vaccine information (only the COVID-19 vaccineinformation; mean =5.15), t(195) =0.23, p=.41. The second test indicated no difference in perceived flu vaccine efcacy between participants who received flu vaccine efcacy information (mean =5.14) and those who did not receive any flu vaccine information (only the COVID-19 vaccine information;mean =5.15), t(184) =0.08, p=.47. Relationship between perceived flu vaccine efcacy and intentions To explore the factors affecting flu vaccine intentions, we conducted a multipleregression with age, gender, and perceived flu vaccine efcacy, and (for the subset of participants who were asked to guess) estimated objective vaccine efcacy as predictors; the resulting model explained 26% of the variance in intentions (see Table 3). Most of thisvariance was accounted for perceived flu vaccine efcacy, which explained 25% of thevariance intentions by itself (the zero-order correlation was .50, i.e., greater PVE wasassociated with stronger intentions to take a flu vaccine). The only other signicantpredictor was gender, which reflected a small effect whereby males expressed weaker Figure 2. Flu vaccine intention as a function of information condition.Efcacy information and COVID-19 vaccine intention 11intentions to take up a flu vaccine than females. In particular, estimated objective vaccine efcacy was not a signicant predictor. Other analyses We pre-registered two other analyses. The rst was a one-tailed t-test to test the hypothesis that participants who are given no information about flu vaccine efcacy wouldoverestimate the true efcacy; for the purpose of this test, we used a conservativereference value of 60%. This hypothesis was supported, t(199) =10.55, p<.001, with the mean efcacy estimate being 74%. Figure 3. Mean perceived flu vaccine efcacy as a function of information condition. Table 3.

Discussion The results of this study may have important implications for messaging strategies to boost vaccine uptake. Although our main focus is on boosting COVID-19 vaccine uptake, abetter understanding of how efcacy information influences the public is relevant for other vaccination programmes, notably the annual flu vaccination programme. COVID vaccine intentions There are three main ndings from our study. The rst is that the provision of safety andefcacy information works. Simply providing information about the safety and efcacy ofthe new COVID-19 vaccines resulted in vaccination intentions that were, on average, 0.39SDhigher than those in the no information condition. We are not able to say whether efcacy or safety information was more important, but any appropriate messaging should include both forms of information, to address both response efcacy and response costs.The importance of PVE and safety is consistent with ndings that have been published inthe months since our paper was originally submitted. For example, Kaplan and Milstein(2021) report a study in which representative samples of the US population werepresented with scenarios that varied vaccine efcacy and side effects; results showed thatvaccine acceptance improved when the efcacy increased above 70%. The authorsconclude that, 'our results indicate that expected efcacy is the most important factor in the decision to accept a vaccine' (p. 5). In a study that involved cross-sectional structured interviews with 1,427 elderly people living in Poland, concerns about the efcacy of thevaccine or its potential side-effects were the most frequent justications among those whochose not to be vaccinated (Malesza & Bozym, 2021). Similarly, Han et al. (2021) foundthat lack of condence in the efcacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines were the mostimportant reasons for vaccine hesitancy among the migrant population in Shanghai. The second main nding from our study is that providing COVID vaccine efcacy information in the context of information about flu vaccine efcacy being much lower (40%) resulted in even stronger vaccination intentions; specically, information about flu vaccine efcacy resulted in a further increase in intentions (beyond the provision ofCOVID-19 vaccine information) of an additional 0.31 SD. This effect of context is what we predicted based on a positive contrast effect on the most salient dimension (Schwartz &Bless, 1992; Tversky, 1977). The impact of emphasizing vaccine efcacy further reafrmsthe importance of the psychological dimension of response efcacy, in accord withprotection motivation theory. Another way in which the flu vaccine context may have helped is with respect to the processing of other less salient dimensions. The inclusion/exclusion model of Schwartz and Bless (1992) suggests that context effects may result in assimilation for somedimensions. That is, the juxtaposition of COVID-19 and flu vaccines may have led to theperception that the two types of vaccines are similar on characteristics other than efcacy,such as safety. Assimilation to the characteristics of a more familiar, trusted vaccine islikely to have a benecial effect on attitudes towards a novel vaccine. However, we did notEfcacy information and COVID-19 vaccine intention 13directly measure perceptions of vaccine safety, so this interpretation is somewhat speculative. Flu vaccine intentions The third main nding from our study is that the positive contrast effect for the COVID-19vaccine did not appear to be accompanied by a negative contrast effect on flu vaccineintentions. The utility of the messaging approach that we trialled here would be greatlyreduced if providing information about the flu vaccine efcacy resulted in a reduction inthe number of people receiving flu vaccinations. It is reassuring that our data do not showa negative impact of flu vaccine efcacy information on vaccine intentions. It is possiblethat a larger study with greater power might detect a small negative effect. Nevertheless, weighing this possible cost against the possible benet of increasing vaccination against COVID-19 -a far deadlier disease -we would argue that this is a risk that may be worth taking. Initial indications are that the Northern Hemisphere may follow the SouthernHemisphere in experiencing a relatively modest flu season this year. There will beopportunity to increase flu vaccine intentions next season, and the success of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is likely to be an important influence on this outcome. Estimated objective efcacy versus perceived efcacy As we anticipated, participants who were not given any information about the efcacy ofthe annual flu vaccine tended to overestimate its true efcacy: their mean estimate was74%, whereas the typical efcacy is closer to 40%, and not higher than 60% in any recentyear (Cohen, 2017). However, our data also suggest that the way in which individualsperceive the response efcacy of vaccines is not perfectly related to the percentageefcacy that is measured in clinical trials, and that perceived efcacy is the more importantfactor in determining intentions. Although there was a signicant positive correlation between perceived flu vaccine efcacy and estimated vaccine efcacy, it was by no means perfect. To illustrate, among participants with the maximum possible perceived efcacyscore (i.e., those who strongly agreed that the flu vaccine is effective in preventing the flu),the estimates of vaccine efcacy ranged between 65% and 100%. We might infer that, formany individuals, objective efcacies well below 100% are sufcient to endow a vaccinewith a high level of psychological response efcacy. Likewise, in our regression analysis,perceived efcacy was a signicant predictor of flu vaccine intentions, whereas estimatedobjective vaccine efcacy was not. This aspect of our results is consistent with the important role of perceived response efcacy in protection motivation theory. Limitations A limitation of our study is that our participants are not a representative sample of the UKpopulation, and it is conceivable that the impact of vaccine information would be differentin the broader population. However, we note that the sample included participants drawnfrom all around the United Kingdom, with a wide range of (normally distributed) ages. Another limitation of our results is that we measured intentions rather than actual vaccination behaviour. This reliance on hypothetical behaviour was unavoidable, giventhat the United Kingdom had only just begun COVID-19 vaccination a few days before ourdata collection, and this vaccination was restricted to health care workers and those over80. Nevertheless, previous research has found that an individual's vaccination intention is14 Colin J. Davis et al.a strong predictor of whether they go on to take a vaccine (e.g., DiBonaventura & Chapman, 2005; Godin, V \u00b4ezina-Im, & Naccache, 2010). Likewise, we did not directly measure how the provision of efcacy information changed vaccine condence, althoughintentions may reasonably be considered a proxy for condence. One possible concern about the reliance on self-reported intentions following an experimental treatment is that our design may be vulnerable to demand effects. However,this is unlikely to be a major concern, particularly for the comparative efcacy effect. Weemployed a between-subjects design, which is more conservative and less susceptible todemand effects than a within-subjects design (Charness, Gneezy & Kuhn, 2012). There isno reason why demand effects would be greater for participants who saw flu vaccineinformation in addition to information about the COVID-19 vaccine. Even the overallvaccine information effect is unlikely to reflect demand effects. Recent research indicates that online survey experiments are robust to experimenter demand. Mummolo & Peterson, (2019) replicated a range of experimental designs and showed that providingparticipants with information about experimenter expectations did not alter thetreatment effects -indeed, even nancial incentives to respond in accordance with these expectations failed to consistently induce demand effects. Applications We believe that the comparative efcacy approach that we tested here could be applied in real-world messaging campaigns, and that doing so may help to tackle the problem ofvaccine hesitancy. The size of the effect that we observed was not large, but it is importantto note that our intervention was a single-shot message consisting of 200 words, whichmost participants read in less than a minute. In practice, a public messaging campaignwould present vaccine-hesitant individuals with this message on multiple occasions. Ourexpectation is that this would result in a stronger effect, and that many fencesitters wouldbe encouraged to take up the offer of vaccination. The source of information is likely to be important: Betsch and Sachse (2013) reported experiments showing a backre effect, whereby strong statements that vaccines do not cause risk led to increased concernsabout vaccine harm when the source of the information was a pharmaceutical company. It may be appropriate to target such campaigns at vulnerable populations where lower levels of vaccine condence have resulted in lower vaccination rates. In the United States,Grumbach et al. (2021) found that Black, Latinx, and Asian respondents wereapproximately twice as likely as White respondents to express concerns about vaccineefcacy, and a similar hesitancy has been observed in the BAME community in the United Kingdom (Iyengar, Vaishya, Jain, & Ish, 2021). Globally, there have been reports of low rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in the Middle East, Russia, and Africa (Sallam,2021). It is possible to envisage a modied comparative efcacy message being used inAfrican countries in which mass vaccination programmes in recent years have eliminatedpolio and virtually eliminated meningitis due to type A meningococcus. A potential drawback that might be considered concerns the possibility of discour- aging uptake of lower efcacy vaccines. In principle, messaging that emphasizes the veryhigh efcacy of certain COVID-19 vaccines could be damaging to the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines with lower levels of efcacy. The UK vaccination programme has relied heavily on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which had not yet completed clinical trials at the timeof our experiment. The nal outcome of these trials showed an efcacy againstsymptomatic disease of 74.2%, that is, higher than the flu vaccine but not as high as thoseof the two COVID-19 vaccines to which we referred. Nevertheless, mass vaccination dataEfcacy information and COVID-19 vaccine intention 15show that a single dose of the Oxford -AstraZeneca vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect of 94% against hospital admission for COVID-19-related hospitalization (Vasileiouet al., 2021), and thus it would still be possible to cite very high efcacy data for thisvaccine. More broadly, our study illustrates a comparative efcacy messaging approach that is not tied to the specic vaccines that we referred to, but could be used in any situationwhere a large contrast between vaccine efcacy can be exploited. In theory, if a nation hadaccess to two vaccines, one of which was of much lower efcacy than the other, the typeof messaging that we propose might not be appropriate, and the national health servicemight prefer different forms of messaging. Even in this hypothetical situation, though, thecomparative efcacy messaging approach might be a good option to consider, especially ifit were feasible to hold back doses of the higher efcacy vaccine that could then be offered to more hesitant members of the population. Conclusion The rapid development of several COVID-19 vaccines is a noteworthy achievement formodern medicine. The public health focus has shifted to the successful distribution of thevaccine and the effective messaging that will ensure a high uptake. Drawing onpsychological theory enables us to better understand factors that influence vaccine intentions and behaviour. This perspective suggests a focus on developing messages that boost response efcacy and reduce perceived response costs. The approach demon-strated here shows how vaccination intentions can be strengthened through a simplemessaging intervention that utilizes context effects to increase perceived responseefcacy.

Appendix : Information text presented in experiment All participants except those in the no information condition saw the following text: Many COVID-19 vaccines are in development, and some of these vaccines have already completed 'Phase 3' trials in which thousands of human patients have been given the vaccine. The results from the trials reported so far indicate that the vaccines are safe, with no serious side effects. The most severe side effects reported were fatigue (4%) and headache(2%). Both of these effects resolved shortly after vaccination. Results from the trials reported so far also show that the COVID-19 vaccines have very high levels of efcacy, meaning that they are very effective in protecting people againstinfection. The nal analysis of the Pzer vaccine has reported an efcacy rate of 95%. Final results from the trials of the Moderna vaccine conrm it has 94% efcacy.Nobody who was vaccinated with either of these vaccines developed severe disease. Participants in the flu info -40% efcacy condition then saw the following text: There has never been a '100% effective' vaccine, but these efcacy rates are not far off. Bycomparison, the average efcacy of the annual flu vaccine is 40%. Nevertheless the flu vaccine has prevented millions of infections and saved many thousand lives. If we see a high uptake of COVID-19 vaccination, the result will be a massive reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. This in turn will greatlyreduce health care costs and ensure that our NHS is not overloaded.Efcacy information and COVID-19 vaccine intention 19Participants in the flu info -60% efcacy condition saw the following text: There has never been a '100% effective' vaccine, but these efcacy rates are not far off. Bycomparison, the efcacy of the annual flu vaccine has not been more than about 60% inrecent years. Nevertheless the flu vaccine has prevented millions of infections and saved many thousand lives. If we see a high uptake of COVID-19 vaccination the result will be a massive reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. This in turn will greatlyreduce health care costs and ensure that our NHS is not overloaded. Participants in the COVID-19 vaccine info only condition saw the following text: If we see a high uptake of COVID-19 vaccination the result will be a massive reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. This in turn will greatly reduce health care costs and ensure that our NHS is not overloaded.20 Colin J. Davis et al. "}
