Booking Details - Retreat Intention: To hold space for retreaters to unplug, get clear and restore their mind, body and soul through yoga/movement, meditation, clean eating, breathwork, sound healing and mindfulness training in a supportive group. Who is this retreat for? RESTORE is suited for participants of all wellness levels. This magical 3 day retreat is open to anyone who would like to be steeped in self care to restore themselves. The yoga styles taught will include vinyasa flow (can be adapted to a slow/modified, or advanced practice depending on practitioner's needs), restorative yoga, yoga nidra, breathwork, mindfulness, sound healing and meditation classes throughout the retreat. Vinyasa Flow emphasizes the sequential movement between postures, coordinated with and guided by deliberate breath. The Vinyasa practice becomes a moving meditation that creates strength, freedom and fluidity in the body and mind. *Can be adapted for all levels. Restorative Yoga is a style of yoga that encourages deep physical, mental, and emotional relaxation. There are no standing poses or muscle engagement. The goal is total relaxation by completely letting go of muscle engagement/tension and allowing the floor and/or props to support you. Appropriate for all levels, restorative yoga is practiced at a slow pace, focusing on long holds, stillness, and deep breathing. Yoga Nidra is a form of guided meditation also known as \"yogic sleep\" or \"effortless relaxation\". It's usually practiced lying down in savasana and is accessible to everyone. The practice draws our attention inwards, and we learn to surf between the states of wakefulness and sleep, where our body finds its natural state of equilibrium (homeostasis) where deep healing physically, mentally and spiritually becomes available. It has been shown that 1 hour of yoga nidra equates to the healing benefits of 4 hours of deep, uninterrupted sleep. - Lodging accommodations (if staying on property), all scheduled wellness offerings, all meals (except optional Thursday Dinner out,) and 1 spa treatment (massage.) *Alcohol and additional spa treatments may be purchased a la carte. - $1,100 - Single occupancy $900 - DBL occupancy (per guest) $700 - Restore experience without lodging, [BOOK HERE](https://www.exploretock.com/hill-country-herb-garden-fredericksburg/event/408836/restore-a-3-day-immersion-in-self-care) - 30 TOTAL spaces available. 20 with accommodations 10 without accommodations - At least 3 sets of yoga clothes for practices Comfortable attire for free time, and preferred attire for dinner in Fredericksburg on Thursday night Comfortable shoes Journal for notes during mindfulness sessions Yoga mat Any additional yoga props preferred for practice Personal care items - RESTORE Sample Schedule for Thursday, April 27th 7-7:45am - Coffee/Tea/Fruit available (Garden) 8:00am - Breath-work/Meditation/All Levels Vinyasa Flow Yoga Practice (Event Space) 9:30am - Breakfast (The Restaurant) followed by free time SPA/RESTORE inclusive massage bookings will be running from 10am-5pm 1pm - Lunch (The Restaurant) 2:15pm - Mindfulness Exercise #2 (Event Space) 3:45pm - Restorative Yoga Sequence w/Crystal Singing Bowls (Event Space) 5:00pm - Free Time for the duration of the evening.
