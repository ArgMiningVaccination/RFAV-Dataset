Untreated depression can lead to a variety of emotional and physical issues which affect normal daily life. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has historically been used to treat depression up till today, particularly in Asia. Western medicine typically uses medication and therapy to tackle depression, while TCM adopts a more holistic approach. Read on to understand more about depression from a TCM perspective and some tips to help ease depression. What is depression? Depression is a common mental disorder that causes persistent sadness and a lack of interest or pleasure in previously rewarding or enjoyable activities. Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe ones. These symptoms must last at least 2 weeks and must represent a contrast with previous levels of functioning in order to be diagnosed as having depression.

Possible causes include chemical imbalance in the brain, changes in hormone levels, family history, trauma, certain medical conditions and more. Depression can occur at any time, but it is more prevalent in late teens to mid-20s. According to studies, women are more likely than men to experience depression. Depression from a TCM perspective From a TCM point of view, depression is viewed as a stagnation syndrome. In general, stagnation syndrome can be caused due to stagnation in Qi, Blood, Heat, Food, Dampness etc. In the case of depression, it is commonly known to be caused due to Liver-Qi stagnation.
