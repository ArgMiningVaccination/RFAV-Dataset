A PCP may be a family doctor, a general practice doctor, a pediatrician (for children and teens), or an internist (internal medicine doctor). You may also pick a certified registered nurse practitioner (CRNP) as a PCP. A CRNP works under the direction of a doctor and can do many of the same things a doctor can do such as prescribing medicine and diagnosing illnesses. Some doctors have other medical professionals who may see you and provide care and treatment under the supervision of your PCP. Some of these medical professionals may be: Physician Assistants Medical Residents Certified Nurse -Midwives If you have Medicare, you can stay with the PCP you have now even if your PCP is not in [MCO Name]'s network. If you do not have Medicare, your PCP must be in [MCO Name] 's network.

All [MCO Name] rules, such as prior authorization and specialist referrals, apply to these services. Recipient Restriction/Lock -in Program The Recipient Restriction/Member Lock -In Program requires a member to use specific providers if the member has abused or overused his or her health care or prescription drug benefits. [MCO Name] works with DHS to decide whether to limit a member to a doctor, pharmacy, hospital, dentist, or other provider. How Does it Work? [MCO Name] reviews the health care and prescription drug services you have used. If [MCO Name] finds overuse or abuse of health care or prescription services, [MCO Name] asks DHS to approve putting a limit on the providers you can use. If approved by DHS, [MCO Name] will send you a written notice that explains the limit. You can pick the providers, or [MCO Name] will pick them for you. If you want a different provider than the one [MCO Name] picked for you, call Member Services at [Member Services Phone Number and TTY] . The limit will last for 5 years even if you change HealthChoices plans. If you disagree with the decision to limit your providers, you may appeal the decision by asking for a DHS Fair Hearing, within 30 days of the date of the letter telling you that [MCO Name] has limited your providers. You must sign the written request for a Fair Hearing and send it to: HealthChoices Member Handbook Template 24 HealthChoices 2021 Model Member Handbook Department of Human Services Office of Administration Bureau of Program Integrity -DPPC Recipient Restriction Section P.O. Box 2675 Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17105- 2675 If you need help asking for a Fair Hearing, please call Member Services at [MCO Member Services Phone Number and TTY] or contact your local legal aid office. If your appeal is postmarked within 10 days of the date on [MCO Name ]'s notice, the limits will not apply until your appeal is decided. If your appeal is postmarked more than 10 days but within 30 days from the date on the notice, the limits will be in ef fect until your appeal is decided. The Bureau of Hearings and Appeals will let you know, in writing, of the date, time, and place of your hearing. You may not file a Grievance or Complaint through [MCO Name] about the decision to limit your providers . After 5 years, [MCO Name] will review your services again to decide if the limits should be removed or continued and will send the results of its review to DHS.
