The purpose of the report is to help the Congress adopt authorizing legis- lation that should be in place before it cons iders the 13 regular a ppropriation bills for fiscal year 2004, which begins on October 1, 2003. Ordinarily, this annual re port shows the total amount that the Congress has provided in appropriation acts for programs whose authorization has expired. At the time that this report was prepared, however, only the appropriation acts for defense and military construction had been enacted fo r fiscal year 2003. Authorizations for those programs expire at the end of that year (Public Law 107-314; see Appendix B). Programs covered by the other 11 appr opriation acts are currently funded under a temporary continuing resolution (P.L . 108-2), which expires on January 31, 2003. For those programs, informati on on appropriations is unavailable. That fact is noted on entries in Appendix A, which consequently omits figures and totals relating tounauthorized appropriations.

AndersonActing Director January 15, 2003 OVERVIEW Each year, the Congressional Budget Offi ce (CBO) is required to report to the Congress on unauthorized appropr iations and expiring author izations. That require- ment comes from the Balanced Budget a nd Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, which amended the Congressional Budg et and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Section 221(b) of the Deficit Control Act added the followi ng requirement to section 202(e)(3) of the Congressional Budget Act, as amended: On or before January 15 of each year, the Director [of CBO], after con- sultation with the appropriate committ ees of the House and the Senate, shall submit to the Congress a report listing (A) all programs and activitiesfunded during the fiscal year ending September 30 of that calendar year for which authorizations for appropria tions have not been enacted for that fiscal year, and (B) all programs and activities for which no authorizationsfor appropriations have been enacted for the fiscal year beginning Octo- ber 1 of that calendar year. According to the conference report on the Deficit Control Act, the purpose of that amendment was \"to help Congress use the early months of the year to adoptauthorizing legislation that must be in place before the thirteen regular appropriationbills can be considered.\" THE ROLE OF AUTHORIZATIONS Authorization laws are an outgrowth of the long-standing legislative practice of distinguishing between the laws that set forth federal policies and the laws that fundthem. In general, authorization laws esta blish, continue, or modi fy federal programs. Funding for those programs is then provi ded separately in a nnual appropriation acts. Some authorization laws merge policy a nd funding decisions\u2014in effect, combining an authorization and appropria tion in the same act. They are referred to as direct, or mandatory, spending laws. There are two kinds of authorization laws . The first type is the \"organic,\" or \"enabling,\" statute, which makes broad grants of authority, establishes federal offices or duties, creates federal programs, or permits various activities to be carried out.The second type is a provision that specifi cally authorizes the appropriation of funds1. A point of order is an objection raised by a Member of Congress against a piece of legislation or a procedure on the grounds that it violates the rules of the House or Senate. The Presiding Officer decides whether to sustain or overrule the point of order on the basis of the specific rule and precedents under it. The decision of the Presiding Officer is subject to appeal to the full House or Senate. 2. A special rule is a simple resolution, reported by the House Rules Committee, that sets the terms and conditions for the House's consider ation of a piece of legislation.2 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS either to carry out the various authoritie s or duties established under an organic statute or to achieve other purposes. That kind of authorization may appear in the enabling statute or be enacted in a separate law. This report focuses on the second type of authorization law. In general, those laws are intended to offer guidance to the appropriations committees on the level ofprogram funding to be provide d in annual appropriation acts. That guidance is typi- cally expressed as an authorization of a ppropriations. Such authorizations are pro- vided either for specific dollar amounts (defin ite authorizations) or for \"such sums as are necessary\" (indefinite authorizations). Authorizations of appropr iations may be permanent, or they may cover only particular fiscal years. Authorizations th at have a stated dura tion may be annual (per- taining to one fiscal year) or multiyear (pertaining to two, five, or any specific numberof fiscal years). When such authorizati ons expire, the Congress may choose to extend the life of a program by reauthorizing the activity. The Congress may also extend aprogram simply by providing new appropriati ons for it. However, appropriations that are made available for a program after its authorization of appr opriations has expired are considered \"unaut horized\" appropriations. House and Senate rules\u2014dating from th e 19th century\u2014generally preclude the Congress from considering appr opriations that are not authorized by law. Rule 21 of the House of Representatives prohibits th e inclusion of unaut horized appropriations in a general appropriation bill or in an amendment to a bill. For general appropriationbills, Rule 16 of the Senate restricts amendments that increase an appropriation or adda new item of appropriation unle ss they have been authorized by existing law. Both rules subject the legislation containing the unauthorized appropriation to a point of order upon its consideration by the House or Senate. 1 However, House and Senate rules are not self-enforcing. A point of or der must be raised by an individual Member for the rules to be enforced. In the House, a point of order under Rule 21 may beavoided by a waiver granted under the special rule that governs consideration of the general appropriation bill or amendments. 2 In the Senate, a point of order under Rule 16 cannot be waived in the same manner, but the Sena te rule includes several exceptions. If no point of order is rais ed, an unauthorized appropriation may proceed through the legislative process.UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 3 More than half of all fe deral spending now goes to programs for which the authorizing legislation provides budget author ity. Such direct spending includes fund- ing for most major entitlement programs. (Some entitlements ar e funded in annual appropriation laws, but the amounts provide d are controlled by the authorizing legislation that established the entitlement.) The authorization laws that providedirect spending are typically permanent, but some major direct-spending programs, such as the Food Stamp program and cer tain transportati on programs, require periodic renewal. LISTINGS OF UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS This report covers all appropriated programs that at one time had an explicit auth- orization of appropriations that has expired or will expire this year. Appendix A lists programs that are likely to receive a fu ll-year appropriation for fiscal year 2003 but whose applicable authorization has expire d. Appendix B lists programs for which authorizations expire at or before the end of fiscal year 2003. The appendixes show the number and name of the pub lic law containing the last authorization, the last year that the authorization was in effect, and th e amount authorized in that year. If the authorization was provided for \"such sums as are necessary,\" the report shows the amount authorized as \"indefinite.\" The lis tings of public laws in the appendixes are issued in three separate versions\u2014by House authorizing committee, Senateauthorizing committee, and appropriations subcommittee. The information in this report is drawn from CBO's Legislative Classification System, a database reflecting all public la ws that contain nonpermanent authorizations of appropriations\u2014up to and including laws enacted during the 107th Congress. In general, House and Senate rules require the appropriations committees, in their reports on general appr opriation bills, to identify an y programs that are funded in the bills but lack an authorization\u2014including programs for which explicitauthorizations of appropria tions have never been enacted. This CBO report, in contrast, covers only programs that at one time had an explicit authorization that either has expired or will expire. Also, as mentioned earlier, many laws establishprograms with authorizations of appropriations that do not expire. Both the reports of the appropriations committees and this report exclude programs with that type ofauthorization because its effect is permanent.3. See CBO's reports entitled Unauthorized Appropriations and Expiring Authorizations , released each year in January since 1995. In every year, the to tal amount of unauthorized appropriations may be understated because funding for some unauthorized pr ograms cannot be determined from available sources. In such cases, CBO lists the unauthorized am ount as \"not available\" and does not add it to the total. 4. In the case of the Justice Department authori zations, the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act (P.L. 107-273) was the first freestanding authorization law enacted for certain of the department's activities since 1980. In most previous years, authorities under the 1980 Justice Department authorization law (P.L. 96-132) were extended one year at a time in annual appropriation acts.4 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS PROGRAMS FUNDED IN FISCAL YEAR 2003 WITH EXPIRED AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS Appendix A lists programs a nd activities to be funded by an appropriation for fiscal year 2003 whose authorization of appropriations has expire d. Ordinarily, this annual report shows the total amount that the C ongress has provided in appropriation acts for such programs and activities. At the time that this report was prepared, however,only the appropriation acts for defense and military construction had been enacted forfiscal year 2003. Authorizations for those programs expire at the end of that year (Public Law 107-314; see Appendix B). Programs covered by the other 11 appropriation acts are curren tly funded under a temporary continuing resolution that expires on January 31, 2003 (P.L. 108-2). As noted in the entries in Appendix A, information on appropriations is unavailable for those programs. Thus, this report omits figures and totals relating to unauthorized appropriations. In recent years, the total amount of unauthorized appropr iations reported by CBO has ranged between about $90 billion a nd $120 b illion annually. 3 Although information about specific appropriations for 2003 is currently unavailable for many programs and activities, examples of likely unauthorized appropriations includefunding for the National Institutes of H ealth, the National Ae ronautics and Space Administration, foreign aid, certain hous ing programs, violent offender and crime prevention programs, and seve ral environmental research and water pollution control programs. In 2002, lawmakers renewed se veral major authorizations of appropriations that had expired in earlier years, including the fo llowing (the previous authorization's year of expiration appears in pare ntheses): authorizations for the Department of Justice (1980), the State Department (2001), the Coast Guard (1999), the Customs Service (1992), the Securities and Exchange Co mmission (1999), and th e National Science Foundation (2000). 4 In addition, the Congress enacted laws extending major authorizations that were scheduled to expi re at the end of 2002, such as those for the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies, various agriculture programs, theFood Stamp program, and funding for inte rnational security and military assistance.UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 5 5. The Transportation Equity Act (TEA-21) and the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act (AIR-21) provide contract authority, a form of mandatory budget authority, for certain transportation programs. For some of those programs, the laws also include a limitation on the government's abilityto obligate those funds. Each year, appropriation acts include obligation limitations that may or may notbe the same as those included in TEA-21 or AIR-21. The amounts listed in this report for TEA-21 and AIR-21 reflect levels of contract authority and discretionary authorizations originally provided by thoselaws, not the obligation limitations in them or in appropriation acts.AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS THAT EXPIRE ON OR BEFORE SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 Appendix B lists programs and activities with authorizations of appropriations that expire by the end of fiscal year 2003. The appendix indicates (by public law) the amounts authorized to be appropriated in 2003 for ex piring programs and activities, rather than the amounts actually appropriated in that year. Definite authorizations contained in laws under the jurisdiction of 14 House and 15 Senate authorizing committees that will expire by the end of this fiscal year totalabout $486 billion (see Tables 1, 2, and 3). However, most of that amount (about $393 billion) is authorized in a single law, the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 107-314), which also includes the Maritime Administration and atomic energy defense activities of the Department ofEnergy. Typically, authorizations for defe nse funding are renewe d annually. Another annual reauthorization is the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L.107-306). Most of the authorizations fo r intelligence activities are indefinite and classified. Other major definite authorizations that expire at the end of 2003 include the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (P.L. 105-178, $33.5 billion in authorizations); the 21st Century Appropriations AuthorizationAct (P.L. 107-273, $20.5 bi llion); the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (P .L. 106-181, $13.7 billion); and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fi scal Year 2003 (P.L. 107-228, $13.2 billion). 5 Thus, as in other recent years, the tota l amount of expiring definite authoriza- tions of appropriations is c oncentrated in a handful of laws. Of the 58 laws with authorizations that expire this year, five account for nearly 98 percent of the year's expiring definite authorizations. Conversel y, 27 laws (just under ha lf of the total num- ber due to expire) include definite author izations that sum to $50 million or less for each law and that together make up less than 0.5 percent of the total amount of expir- ing definite authorizations.6 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS Some laws with expiring indefinite aut horizations also invol ve relatively large amounts of funding. Classified spending for intelligence activities is substantial and, as noted earlier, reauthorized annually. Ot her major indefinite authorizations that expire this year include programs under the Qua lity Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-276); the Higher E ducation Amendments of 1998 (P.L. 105- 244); the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-220); the Energy Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-469); and the Children's Health Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-310).UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 7 TABLE 1.
