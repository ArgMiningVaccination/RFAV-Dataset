The focus of the naturopathic philosophy is to uncover the fundamental cause of a disease, dysfunction, or symptom; bring the body into balance, support its ability to heal, and sustain the conditions required for optimal health to thrive in. What is Herbal Medicine? Herbal medicine (or phytotherapy) has been widely used for centuries and today is prescribed by thousands of naturopaths, herbalists and doctors worldwide. Herbal medicines are made from specific plants and plant extracts. Herbal medicine prescribed by a qualified practitioner can support the health of the whole body may be used to assist the functioning of a number of vital systems in the body including the digestive, respiratory, immune, detoxification and nervous systems. I buy supplements from a store, what advantages are there in seeing a qualified Naturopath? People believe that by taking supplements they are enhancing their health. The media is always trying to convince you that you need this great new product. But are you really taking what is best for you? This one size fits all philosophy doesn't work as we are all unique. By visiting a Qualified Naturopath & Registered Medical Herbalist you are professionally prescribed what is right for you and you only. The \"practitioner only\" strength and range of supplements means you are assured of both quality and efficacy of what you are putting into your body. Ultimately, you will be benefiting both your pocket and your health. "}
