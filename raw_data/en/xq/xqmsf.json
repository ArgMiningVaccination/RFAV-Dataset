They must be used with discernment and care, due to their highly concentrated dosage and action.

Our preparations are based on organic essential oils and delivered in the form of capsules, liquids, creams, ointments, vaginal tablets and suppositories. Anthroposophy Anthroposophical medicine is the result of the research of Dr. Rudolf Steiner, in collaboration with Dr. Ita Wegman. According to its principles, humans are consituted of 4 inseparable bodies : the physical body, the etheric body or life force, the astral body for sensations and feelings and the egotical body or spirit. They believe that any imbalance between these 4 bodies could potentially develop into a disease, and use natural substances present in minerals, plants and animal organs to restore that balance and bring back harmony in the person. Each remedy is prepared through the dilution and energization of mother tinctures, using the same technics than for homeopathic remedies. They can then be administered orally or by injections. Floral Elixirs The preparation of floral elixirs, also called \u00ab floritherapy \u00bb, depends on very specific and accurate methods, in particular during the harvest of the plants, their maceration and energization. This delicate preparation ensures their quality and their ability to balance or stimulate our emotions. Our floral elixirs originate from a strictly organic and artisanal production, where the hand of man is involved in all phases of preparation and revitalization. Gemmotherapy Gemmotherapy draws its power of action from the properties of the buds of trees and shrubs (``Gemmae`` in Latin). Created in the 60s by Dr. Pol Henry, a Belgian homeopath, this discipline was later developed and renamed by Dr. Max T\u00e9tau. Our preparations include isolated and combined buds, creating specific and targeted synergies of action. Homeopathy While complying with modern pharmaceutical production standards, our products remain faithful to the classic Hahnemannian approach at the origin of homeopathy. They are manufactured in a specific, traditional way and in small batches, an essential criteria to preserve their quality.

The organic and vibratory signatures therefore produced cannot be found in mushrooms grown above ground and allow us to manage of wide range of diseases. Its efficiency has made mycotherapy an increasingly popular therapeutic tool in recent years.
