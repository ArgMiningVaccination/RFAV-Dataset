What is the difference between the pilules and the essence? A. The essence is a botanical or herbal product. It is a pure extract of flowers known to combat emotional stresses while traveling. The essence is super gentle and perfect for children of any age. It is a rescue remedy for travelers! The pilules are a homeopathic product. They are essentially an energy medicine. The pilules are more treatment or symptom orientated. Q. Can I take both the essence and the pilules at the same time? A. These two products complement each other beautifully. You can take them at the same time especially if you are experiencing unpleasant symptoms while traveling. Or you can alternate them depending on how you feel. Or you can try both and then stick with the one that clearly is more helpful. "}
