We support the goal of outstanding patient care with innovative and effective education, and with research that is both cutting-edge and likely to improve lives. In the clinical arena, we continue to enhance the care we provide to our patients, improving their health outcomes and experience, and to share our best practices nationally and internationally. This year, we are pleased to celebrate the 20th anniversary of our Hospital Medicine Program and its co-founder Joseph Li, MD. One of the first hospital medicine programs in the country, ours has become a national model for hospital-based care. In the research realm, investigators like Rebecca Zash, MD, MPH, who is studying the safety of antiretrovirals in pregnant women and infants, are influencing global health policy. In medical education, we are proud to celebrate innovators like Anjala Tess, MD, who has launched a new and first-of-its-kind Quality and Safety Master's degree program at Harvard Medical School. In addition to highlighting people and programs that have reached milestones or contributed significantly to our mission this year, this report includes data on our clinical volume, academic publications, honors and awards, and research funding. This year, for the first time, we are also pleased to deliver updates from each of the Department's Vice Chairs\u2014leaders in the areas of education, mentorship, research, quality improvement, and network development. We also pause to remember the inspiring lives and the extraordinary, mission-driven contributions of two longtime BIDMC faculty members who died this year, Warner Slack, MD, and Terry Strom, MD. Thank you for taking the time to read this report. Please be in touch should you have any questions or wish to connect on any of the work you read about in these pages. As health care professionals, we all share an overarching mission, and it's through collaboration that we stand to make the most progress and do the most good. Warm Regards, Mark L.

Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 | 3 FROM THE CAO Over the last year, the Department of Medicine has made great strides toward our goal of making care more readily available to our patients. Although Boston's Longwood Medical Area is a medical mecca like no other in the world, it's not always easy for our patients and their loved ones to come here for care. For many people, the time and resources it takes to get to our main BIDMC campus are prohibitive if they're coming from across the city, surrounding suburbs, rural areas, or even other states. This is why I'm so pleased that our network has continued to grow this year to include even more\u2014and even stronger\u2014partnerships with community health centers, hospitals, and practices across our region. Increasingly, BIDMC doctors are providing care to patients in their home communities. We're also making it easier for people to stay with their local physicians for most of their medical care, knowing they will have timely, direct access to our specialists if and when they need it. Many of this year's network highlights are described in greater detail on page 9. I am particularly excited about our plans to be part of a combined system with Lahey Health, New England Baptist Hospital, Mount Auburn Hospital, and Anna Jaques Hospital. In the coming months, we will come together as Beth Israel Lahey Health, with the goal of providing our patients with high-quality, affordable care close to where they live and work. BIDMC will be the academic flagship of the new system, positioning us even better to live up to our mission of providing extraordinary care where the patient comes first. Best Wishes, Kevin Maguire, MS Chief Administrative Officer, Department of Medicine<< Back to Table of Contents Robert Flaumenhaft, MD, PhD, was named Chief of the Division of Hemostasis and Thrombosis, taking over from Bruce Furie, MD, who ran the Division since he and Barbara Furie, PhD, founded it in 2000. Flaumenhaft is an internationally recognized expert in platelet biology and thrombosis research. His laboratory has unraveled the molecular mechanisms that control platelet granule exocytosis and identified new antithrombotic therapies. He has been continuously funded by the National Institutes of Health and has been the recipient of several awards throughout his career, including an Established Investigator Award from the American Heart Association and an Outstanding Investigator Award from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. A Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, he was elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation and serves on the editorial boards of several leading journals. Flaumenhaft shares the Furies' commitment to training the next generation and will continue to lead what has become a top-tier clinical and research program. Ary Goldberger, MD, was appointed Chief of the Division of Interdisciplinary Medicine and Biotechnology (IMBIO), succeeding Vikas Sukhatme, MD, PhD, who recently took on the role of Dean of Medicine at Emory University. A Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a member of the Cardiovascular Institute, Goldberger is an exceptional physician-scientist. He has pioneered the quantitative analysis of complex systems science to basic and translational medicine. His laboratory is at the frontier of nonlinear dynamics, bioengineering, statistical physics, and physiology. His appointment represents a timely new phase in the leadership of the Division of IMBIO, whose members are known for their collaborative research across a broad range of fields, including genomics and proteomics; cellular metabolism in cancer and immunology; sleep-disordered breathing syndromes; and novel biomarkers of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neuroautonomics. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 |5 4 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 During the 2017-2018 Academic Year, several talented members of the Department of Medicine assumed important leadership roles. Each of these individuals is nationally recognized and brings to his/ her new position valuable experience and extraordinary commitment. NEW LEADERS << Back to Table of Contents Grace Huang, MD, was selected as the Vice Chair for Career Development and Mentoring. A hospitalist in the Division of General Medicine, she will lead faculty mentorship efforts, support divisions in their annual performance review processes, and prepare faculty for the Harvard Medical School promotion process. Huang will also work with the Director of BIDMC Epstein Society to promote the careers of recipients of K awards from the National Institutes of Health. As an Associate Program Director in our Internal Medicine Program, she oversees resident evaluation and remediation. Huang serves as Co-Director of the BIDMC Academy of Medical Educators, which holds professional development seminars for faculty. She is also Director of the Rabkin Fellowship in Medical Education, a nationally recognized program that trains education leaders at Harvard Medical School. She was recently appointed the medical school's Interim Director for Academic Careers and Faculty Development. Daniele \u00d6lveczky, MD, MS, a hospitalist in the Division of General Medicine, was chosen as the Diversity and Inclusion Officer for the Department of Medicine. In this newly-created leadership role, she will promote diversity and inclusion in the Department of Medicine. She will also collaborate closely with BIDMC's Office for Diversity, Inclusion and Career Advancement, of which she has been an active member for several years. One of the aims of this position is to increase recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority faculty members, residents, and fellows in the Department. \u00d6lveczky was selected as a Harvard Medical School Academy Medical Education Fellow in 2017 as well as an HMS Miles Shore Fellow. She also served as Co-Chair of the Cross Cultural Interest Group of the HMS Academy. An exceptional physician and mentor, \u00d6lveczky will also work to enhance the patient-provider experience and foster skills in cultural competency. Evan Rosen, MD, PhD, assumed the role of Chief of the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism this year, following the departure of Anthony Hollenberg, MD, who went on to become the Chair of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. Rosen is a Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and an Institute Member at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. He leads a laboratory at BIDMC that focuses on the transcriptional pathways that underlie metabolic diseases like obesity and Type 2 diabetes. In particular, his laboratory has used genomic and epigenomic approaches to identify novel transcription factors and pathways that regulate adipogenesis, lipid handling, insulin resistance and metabolic memory. Previously Program Director for the joint BIDMC and Joslin Diabetes Center Fellowship in Endocrinology and Metabolism, Rosen has built a strong foundation in research and education over more than a decade at BIDMC. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 | 5 << Back to Table of Contents EDUCATION Eileen Reynolds, MD Vice Chair, Education C. Christopher Smith, MD Associate Vice Chair, Education Anjala Tess, MD Associate Vice Chair, Education This year, the Department continued to build on our tradition of exceptional and innovative educational programming. We welcomed 195 Harvard Medical School (HMS) students into our clerkships, 64 new interns into residency, and 56 new clinical fellows. Our annual education retreat focused on the learning environment, developing wellness programs at all levels of learners, and a quality-improvement (QI) tracking system for episodes of professional mistreatment for all trainees. We are excited to expand and assess the use of this QI approach to wellness and professionalism. Our student programs teach one third of all HMS students. The Medical School has now fully operationalized the new Pathways clinical training program whereby students are assigned to a single site for the first two years. Our residency continues to flourish with clinician-educator, global health, and QI tracks. Our recently redesigned research track has attracted outstanding scientists to the residency this past year. We also welcomed the first fellow into our new Hospice and Palliative Care Medicine Fellowship. In addition, building upon our successful clinician-educator track for residents, this year we launched a similar track for fellows. The Department of Medicine and BIDMC continue to expand work on diversity and inclusion. The Department named Daniele \u00d6lveczky, MD, MS, as our first Diversity and Inclusion Officer. (Read more on page 5.) Our Advancement of Women Committee hosted a photography exhibit honoring notable women physicians in the Department's history. And all Division Chiefs and clinical leaders in the Department attended an educational program on unconscious bias. In this report, you will see that education runs through all we do in the Department. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 |76 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 UPDATES FROM OUR VICE CHAIRS << Back to Table of Contents RESEARCH Barbara Kahn, MD, MS Vice Chair, Research Strategy Peter Weller, MD Vice Chair, Research A central mission of the Department of Medicine is the discovery of new information that can lead to the prevention, cure, and improved treatment of human diseases. Research in the Department is also aimed at enhancing the quality of life for those living with chronic diseases. As Vice Chairs of Research and Research Strategy, we consider it a high priority to foster a vibrant, diverse, and collaborative research program with the aim of making discoveries that can eventually be translated into improved medical care. Most of the Department's divisions carry out research ranging from basic science investigation to clinical trials and outcomes research. The research is led by approximately 290 Medicine faculty members with active grants, overseeing nearly 700 trainees and laboratory staff. Research training and mentoring is a high priority, and many of our divisions with active research programs have long-standing National Institutes of Health-funded training grants. Department of Medicine research funding in the 2017-2018 Fiscal Year was over $200 million, consisting of government, foundation, corporate, and donor sources. (See funding details on page 38.)This makes the Department one of the best-funded medical school departments of medicine in the country. BIDMC consistently ranks as a national leader among independent hospitals in National Institutes of Health funding, and the Department of Medicine is responsible for over 68% of that funding. Research in the Department is supported by over 20 technically sophisticated BIDMC research core facilities, many of which are directed by Medicine faculty. This year the Flow Cytometry Core expanded its capabilities with the introduction of new instrumentation focused on microvesicle research. (Read more about this facility on page 28.) In addition, the Transgenic Mouse Core has mastered new technologies that facilitate the alteration of gene expression in mice to investigate their role in disease. A new Functional Genomics and Bioinformatics Core was established to assist with analysis of transcriptomics and epigenomics data bases including single cell analysis. This is in addition to an existing Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Core thereby demonstrating the ability of BIDMC to respond to the growing needs for analysis of large and complex data bases. Our faculty's work is widely published and, again this year, we were well represented in the world's leading scientific and medical journals, including Nature, Science, Cell, and the New England Journal of Medicine. Investigators in the Department are recognized nationally for the excellence of their research as evidenced by their election to the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, and the Association of American Physicians. We have started to highlight Medicine research labs at designated Medical Grand Rounds, with the goal of fostering collaboration between clinicians and researchers, and of making students, residents, and fellows more aware of research opportunities within the Department. We will continue these research-focused Medical Grand Rounds next year. In addition, we aim to facilitate the recruitment of exceptional new research faculty members in several of our divisions.We also plan to foster the involvement of more Medicine faculty and trainees with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, which has cutting-edge platforms and approaches for advancing biomedical science. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 | 7 << Back to Table of Contents CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND MENTORING Grace Huang, MD Vice Chair, Career Development and Mentoring The lifeblood of the BIDMC mission resides in its faculty, and the Department of Medicine honors this through the unique position of Vice Chair for Career Development and Mentoring. Responsible for supporting the career development of over 500 faculty in the Department of Medicine, I'm proud to have succeeded Tony Hollenberg, MD, in this position this past year. I am committed to ensuring a system of mentoring for all Medicine faculty members, supporting divisions in their annual performance review mechanisms, and preparing faculty for the promotion process. I'm pleased to work in tandem with Steve Freedman, MD, PhD, the newly-appointed Director of the Epstein Society, to promote the careers of researchers in the Department. Goals for the upcoming year include: launching a communication strategy to provide faculty access to resources across BIDMC and Harvard Medical School (HMS); conducting a department-wide mentoring needs assessment; implementing division-based efforts to collect clinical feedback; expanding the Epstein Society to support grant-writing efforts across the spectrum of training from residents to junior faculty; and continuing one-on-one HMS CV and career development consultation. QUALITY Mark Aronson, MD Vice Chair, Quality As Vice Chair for Quality, I have the pleasure of working with teams across Medicine to improve the quality of care we provide in ambulatory and inpatient settings. One such team, the Medical Peer Review Committee (MPRC), is a multidisciplinary group made up of clinical leaders from the Departments of Nursing, Medicine, Emergency Medicine, and Pharmacy. Its role is to review adverse events, near misses, and patient complaints. It functions as a pivotal foundation to the Department of Medicine Quality and Patient Safety Program. The Committee, chaired by Alex Carbo, MD, analyzes root causes, identifies any lapse in standards of care, system barriers or gaps, and importantly, opportunities for improvements in care. Many of the root cause analyses and presentations are conducted by residents as part of their Stoneman Quality Improvement Rotation. The committee refers cases to hospital groups and committees for further review or action, as appropriate. Over the past year, 103 cases were reviewed by MPRC. An important recurrent theme in many of these cases has been poor communication and coordination of patients transferring into BIDMC from outside institutions, often leading to patients being admitted to an inappropriate service. This subsequently led to the combined efforts of multiple services in the development of a Transfer Center with the aim of mitigating the risks associated with the care of these very ill patients. Another area of focus for this year has been improving the quality of medicine consults. A central tenet of this initiative has been the development and roll out of an electronic ordering and tracking system. Building upon a model first used for Infectious Diseases, we have developed an order entry and tracking system for 16 Medicine Consult Services. This effort was led by Drs. Lauren Doctoroff, David Feinbloom, Mary LaSalvia, and Jennifer Stevens. This system facilitates timely response to requests and provides needed data on consults including volume, reason, urgency, and timeliness.

CLINICAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY Donald Cutlip, MD Vice Chair, Clinical Care in the Community This year, I have worked with colleagues in the Department of Medicine and across BIDMC to focus on building and strengthening relationships with our network affiliates. I have the pleasure of working with Paul Hart Miller, Administrative Director for Business and Network Development in the Department of Medicine. Our work has centered on the objectives of building a collaborative approach to care across the network, expanding appropriate levels of care to the community, and safeguarding the quality of this care. A few key network successes within the Department this year include: developing a CME series with community partners across primary care and most medical subspecialties that drew some 500 participants; expanding cardiology care at BID-Plymouth to provide elective percutaneous coronary intervention; and partnering with our affiliates to establish and maintain community cancer care centers in Brockton, Needham, and Newburyport. We are now working with our physician group, Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians, and other BIDMC departments to develop a strategic plan for the coming year to coordinate all of our network efforts. We are pleased to support the BIDMC mission of \"extraordinary care, where the patient comes first,\" at BIDMC and for all of our community partners.QUALITY Over the past year, 103 cases were reviewed by MPRC.

The question is whether you are hearing it or not,\" explains Joseph Li, MD, Chief of BIDMC's Hospital Medicine Program. And the story is often complex. \"People come into the hospital with complicated medical issues and often other related issues,\" Li notes. \"I see the role of the hospitalist as part primary care doctor, part ER doctor, and part social worker.\" Li's health care training uniquely prepared him for the demands of being a hospitalist, including his first job as a nurse's aide at a nursing home in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He then attended pharmacy school, and eventually, medical school at the University of Oklahoma. He arrived in Boston in 1994 for residency at New England Deaconess Hospital, becoming Chief Medical Resident in 1998. It was a transitional time in the field of internal medicine, especially hospital-based care. \"Back then, when a person was admitted to the hospital, their primary care doctor was contacted to come and care for them. This didn't always work well because primary care doctors couldn't easily leave other patients at their outpatient practice to care for a hospitalized patient,\" he explains. Also, some patients\u2014referred to as \"unassigned\"\u2014did not have primary care doctors to come care for them in the hospital, Li recalls. Mark Aronson, MD, then Associate Chief of General Medicine and Primary Care, believed that BIDMC could provide higher quality care to hospitalized patients by having internists specifically assigned to inpatient care. \"It was becoming clear that office-based internists were caring for increasingly complex patients and that those demands made it often untenable for them to also care for inpatients in a timely, effective, and safe manner,\" he explains. \"Because we thought that sick patients and distraught families deserved to have doctors available in the hospital at all times, we decided to embrace the hospitalist model.\" Aronson approached Li and a fellow residency graduate, Preetha Basaviah, MD, about heading up the new hospitalist program. They agreed, and it became one of the first in the country. \"We were incredibly fortunate to have hired two brilliant, devoted and spirited young doctors to start our program,\" notes Aronson. Since then, the field has grown exponentially with upwards of 60,000 hospitalists in the country today.

(Basaviah went on to University of California, San Francisco, and then Stanford.) Li's also been highly involved in the American College of Physicians' Hospitalists Publications and has expanded BIDMC's program substantially. BIDMC now boasts over 125 hospitalists, who provide care at four hospitals throughout our growing system. Reflecting on the last two decades of hospital medicine, Li notes that a lot has changed: \"We have so many new medications, electronic medical records, and the internet as a constant source of clinical information, like UptoDate.\" But much has also stayed the same, he adds: \"Our program has always been innovative and physician-led.\" And, in his view, BIDMC hospitalists have always been \"the fiber of the institution in many ways\": they are instrumental in the residency training program; they are the some of the top quality improvement leaders at BIDMC (and arguably the country); and they are critical to the care of 400 inpatients throughout the BIDMC system at any given time. BIDMC hospitalists are also nationally recognized for their contributions to patients and to the field. Li proudly points out that more BIDMC hospitalists have been recognized as Top Hospitalists by ACP Hospitalist magazine than from any other program in the country. This year's celebration of the Hospital Medicine Program's two decades is in many ways a celebration of Li, as his colleagues are quick to point out. \"Joe leads by example and keeps the focus on the patients first, as the top priority in every decision,\" explains Caleb P . Hale, MD, Associate Chief of Hospital Medicine. \"As we celebrate the 20th year of our program, we're celebrating the good it has done for our patients, our doctors, and BIDMC.

But what struck Berwick more than the impressive modern technology was the human interaction and teamwork he witnessed among the 20-30 people on the care team. \"This was a ballet more complex than any dancer ever danced,\" he recalls. \"Amazingly, movingly, they included David's family in all of that. They included me. They asked 'Do you have any questions? Do you have any ideas?' We, the people who loved David, were not watching the team, we were on the team.\" \"He beat the odds,\" Berwick says, crediting this exemplary communication, cooperation, and inclusion with helping to save his brother's life. \"I noticed that everyone had a voice. Sure, the ICU director had a voice, but so did the student nurse.\" He recalls a respiratory therapist questioning one of the physicians on the team about his assessment. Rather than bristle at being challenged, the doctor thanked the respiratory therapist for the correction. \"I have worked in health care for four decades now,\" Berwick reflects, \"and what I saw at BIDMC was care that I had only dreamed of.\" David Berwick was similarly impressed by the care he received once he was well enough to be transferred from the ICU to another medicine floor. \"The team was partnering perfectly; and the nurses were angels,\" he recalls. \"Some people would look back on this experience with regret and fear, but I look back with gratitude because I felt so loved and well taken care of.\" Berwick has been vocal in his praise for the care his brother received at BIDMC, dedicating much of his keynote address at IHI's annual conference this year to the subject. Upon hearing of David's experience, Chair of the Department of Medicine Mark Zeidel, MD, invited Berwick to debrief\u2014not simply to hear about what had gone well, but to learn about areas of potential improvement. The subsequent meeting included several Department of Medicine quality improvement leaders. \"Dr. Berwick applied his keen understanding of care processes to identify a number of things that we can do better,\" Zeidel explains. This includes improved communication and sign-out between the ICU and the floor teams, better and more reliable communication with rehabilitation facilities, and improved design of the waiting and patient support areas in the Finard ICU.

In addition to four decades as a health care industry trailblazer, Berwick spent a harrowing 11 days at his brother's bedside in BIDMC's Finard Medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In March 2017, his younger brother, David, developed sepsis from Legionnaires' disease and, suffering from multiple organ failure, was brought to BIDMC and put on life support. \"We were sure we were going to lose him,\" Berwick recalls. NATIONAL HEALTH CARE LEADER APPLAUDS BIDMC CARE \"The team was partnering perfectly; and the nurses were angels. Some people would look back on this experience with regret and fear, but I look back with gratitude because I felt so loved and well taken care of.\" \u2014David Berwick << Back to Table of Contents Members of the Department, along with partners across the medical center, are currently working on several of these areas. For instance, a new ICU Transition Guide Program aims to mitigate the fear and confusion that patients and families sometimes feel upon transferring from the ICU to a regular medical/surgical floor. To help improve the process, a multidisciplinary team developed a system whereby pre-medical school volunteers are trained to provide individualized assistance to patients and families being transferred out of the ICU. In 2018, the Institute for Patient- and Family-Centered Care recognized the program with a Partnership Award honorable mention. Department of Medicine teams are also studying communication in the ICU with the goal of continuous improvement. A paper published this year in BMJ Quality and Safety by Department of Medicine faculty member Sigall Bell, MD, found that about 50% of ICU patients and family members surveyed nationally say they are hesitant to speak up about some concerns, such as possible mistakes in care. As Bell explains, \"Our goal is to have every patient and family member at any ICU in the country feel like Dr. Berwick did: that they are an integral member of the team and always able to communicate openly and honestly with the care team.\" As Zeidel notes, \"The culture of the Department and BIDMC has never been to rest on our laurels.\" Referring to Berwick's praise, he says, \"This kind of recognition from someone who really understands quality of care is enormously gratifying, but I am extremely proud of the fact that we always focus on what we can do to improve, so that our patients continue to benefit from better and better care.\" Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 | 17 T op left: Intensive Care Unit team members T op right: Donald Berwick, MD Bottom right: David Berwick Effective communication in the ICU is a BIDMC priority given that about 50% of ICU patients and family members surveyed nationally say they are hesitant to speak up about concerns.50%<< Back to Table of ContentsBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 |19 18 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018PATIENT CARE MATTERS Department of Medicine's Clinical Volume at BIDMC's Boston Hub Clinical revenue ................................................................. 72,290,951 Patient days in Associates primary care practice ........................... 40,674 << Back to Table of ContentsBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 | 19 Left: Adam Cheifetz, MD, with a trainee and patient T op right: Suzanne Salamon, MD, with a patientBottom right: Resident Nathan Raines, MD, with a patient<< Back to Table of ContentsDespite the fact that 80% of all internal medicine residency graduates go on to practice in the ambulatory environment (many in the medical specialties), most internal medicine residency programs focus on inpatient training, explains Graham, now faculty in the Department of Medicine and Director of Ambulatory Training and the Primary Care Track. \"The typical inpatient training model impacts all internists, but most vulnerable are those going into primary care who rely on their residency training to prepare them for their careers without any subsequent time in fellowship,\" she says. \"That's how primary care training has been for decades\u2014kind of an afterthought.\" In order to provide residents with a rigorous and comprehensive primary care training experience, the BIDMC Residency Program's Primary Care Track is uniquely designed: after a standard internship year, those residents who opt to join the track spend their junior and senior years participating in a training method known as the \"long block,\" a key feature of BIDMC's program.During the \"long block,\" each academic year is cut into two six-month periods. During one of those, primary care track residents do typical rotations with the other residents; during the other half year, they are immersed in providing primary care at BIDMC's Healthcare Associates (HCA) and a second primary care clinic. Whereas many primary care tracks offer short periods of exposure to primary care, BIDMC's program is longer and immersive. \"Immersion training is more effective. It's more intense. Residents get a sense of what it's like to be a primary care doctor\u2014with large panels of about 200 patients each,\" Graham explains. During their training, primary care residents gain experience that helps them decide on a career path; and for those who go into primary care, the skills they've developed help them significantly once they graduate. \"Ordinarily it takes residents several years post-residency to acclimate to full-time primary care work,\" Graham says. \"But graduates of the BIDMC Primary Care Track are more confident, skilled, and poised to succeed straight out of the gate.\" With its \"long block\" design, the Primary Care Track also emphasizes the importance Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 |21 20 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018When Kelly Graham, MD, was finishing medical school at Georgetown in 2007 with an interest in primary care, her mentors encouraged her to apply to BIDMC. The medical center's Internal Medicine Residency Program had a reputation for its innovative approach to primary care education. Building on a strong foundation, in 2014 the program underwent a transformative shift under the leadership of Howard Libman, MD, and Eileen Reynolds, MD, becoming one of only two programs in the country to offer residents an immersive longitudinal experience in primary care.

Graham believes that establishing longer-term relationships with patients makes the residents' diagnostics and treatment strategies more sophisticated and precise. She also believes that the time spent on long block allows residents to watch disease processes evolve over the weeks to months it often takes to develop the right diagnostic and treatment plan. \"Rather than conduct a battery of tests on a patient you've never seen before, you're able to consider their illness in the broader context of their health and their lives, and evaluate it over time and space.\" And she believes that these two tools\u2014relationship building and time\u2014are essential to being an exceptional primary care physician and can only be taught in this immersive environment.

The program evolved out of an HMS fellowship\u2014funded by Controlled-Risk Insurance Company, Ltd. (CRICO)\u2014 which Tess has led for five years. The fellowship, designed as a pilot program, proved to be an effective approach to teaching quality and safety. \"Traditionally, quality and safety were taught on the job, but we found through the fellowship that a more foundational approach combined with an apprenticeship worked well. Fellowships are limited in number so we decided to design a master's program to create more access for professionals who want the training,\" Tess explains. The inaugural class began the first week of September 2018 with ten students from five different countries. The new HMS master's program is one of the first of its kind internationally. Unlike many quality and safety programs, which are primarily online, it is residential. Enrollees\u2014all graduates from health professional programs\u2014are based in Boston at HMS and have access to Harvard institutions and faculty. The program also draws on the resources and expertise available at BIDMC as well as the other Harvard teaching hospitals. \"Many medical schools have one or two affiliated hospitals, but we have such a network across Harvard,\" Tess notes. She has designed 378 hours of instruction and will be leading several of the courses within the program. Other BIDMC Medicine faculty members include Lauge Sokol-Hessner, MD, Julius Yang, MD, PhD, Patricia Folcarelli, RN, PhD, and Shani Herzig, MD. As the field of quality and safety has evolved over the last two decades, BIDMC and Harvard have consistently been at the forefront\u2014and students will benefit from this exposure. Recently, for instance, the medical center has received international recognition for its groundbreaking initiative to identify, track, and prevent non-physical harms that patients often experience in medical settings. (Tracking physical harms has long been required at hospitals, but addressing non-physical harms is new and unique.) Tess explains that when she came to BIDMC for residency in 1997, she found mentors like Mark Aronson, MD, and Ken Sands, MD, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 |23 22 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018MASTERING HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND SAFETY \"Today quality and safety underlie everything we do in the Department of Medicine.\" \u2014Anjala Tess, MD \"It's like starting to hear in stereo instead of mono,\" explains Anjala Tess, MD, referring to the added dimension that quality improvement and safety training offers physicians.

We need to find out if any antiretroviral medications (ARVs) cause other adverse birth outcomes like stillbirth, preterm delivery or birth defects, in order to determine the best HIV treatment regimen. That's the focus of my work.\" Zash's research in Botswana\u2014often in partnership with her longtime mentor Roger Shapiro, MD, and BIDMC's Botswana Global Health Program\u2014has established her as an internationally known expert on the safety of HIV medications for pregnant women and infants. Her work has informed treatment recommendations and health policy internationally; and over the last 18 months, her landmark findings have resulted in a proverbial roller coaster ride for her and many in the global health world. At the 2017 International AIDS conference, Zash presented results from the Tsepamo Birth Surveillance Study in Botswana on the safety of the drug Dolutegravir when started during pregnancy. At the time, Dolutegravir was becoming the HIV medication of choice in non-pregnant adults because it was more effective in controlling viral load and had fewer side effects than most other ARVs. So when Zash studied its safety during pregnancy and reported that it carried the same low risk of adverse birth outcomes as Efavirenz (a popular ARV, which had already been shown to be one of the safest during pregnancy), several countries welcomed her findings and changed their recommendations to Dolutegravir. However, Zash had reported outcomes among women who started Dolutegravir during pregnancy, and the Tsepamo Birth Surveillance Study took longer to accrue data on women who started Dolutegravir Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 |27 26 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND INFANTS: RESEARCH WITH A GLOBAL IMPACT \"Women of reproductive age make up nearly half of the global population of people living with HIV.\" \u2014Rebecca Zash, MD before pregnancy.

But their then-current instrument did not have adequate magnification to see the microvesicles. During a brainstorming session over a beer at a Dublin pub, Tigges and the engineers sketched a new instrument on a cocktail napkin. They believed it would help address the Boston-based investigators' research dilemma. And it did; this rudimentary sketch eventually led to the development of new instruments with higher resolution than was previously available. This new technology also helped establish BIDMC's Flow Cytometry Core as a world-leader in microvesicle research. When it was first established in 1994, the Core\u2014started by Peter Weller, MD\u2014consisted of just one full-time staff member and a single instrument, which was funded by a $113,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health. With the world's latest technology to offer, the Core has since expanded into a successful enterprise with hundreds of clients. According to Core Director Peter Weller, MD, Vice Chair for Research, Department of Medicine, today the research facility's clients are 60% internal BIDMC investigators and 40% external. Its state-of-the-art flow cytometry instrumentation includes three different models that evolved from the early sketch: the Nanoview, the Moflo Astrios EQ, and the CytoFLEX. These instruments are available to help researchers perform the important work of characterizing microvesicle size, distribution, count, surface protein composition, and RNA cargo. During his 15 years at the Core, Tigges has worked closely with many investigators. Among them is long-time BIDMC researcher Ionita Ghiran, MD, a member of the Division of Allergy and Inflammation and Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School. Born in Romania, Ghiran's international medical training gave him a strong theoretical background, which Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 |29 28 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 While in Dublin, Ireland, in 2008 for a conference, BIDMC Flow Cytometry Project Manager John Tigges wound up talking with engineers from a biomedical instrument company. He described a challenge then facing BIDMC investigators at the Flow Cytometry Core: in order to study microvesicles present in stored blood, they needed a new instrument with higher resolution than their current machine provided. THE CORE OF THE MATTER \"The greatest fulfillment comes when our insights have practical impacts on patient care and outcomes.\" \u2014Ionita Ghiran, MD Total number of requests for Flow Cytometry Core services 2013-20187,400+<< Back to Table of Contents proved advantageous to his later work with the Core. He explains, \"In Romania, you didn't have flow cytometers or kits. Knowing what one component does, you can make individualized solutions.\" Given their technical skills and proclivities, over the years, Ghiran and Tigges have paired up to improve the Core's instruments, often advising the instrument manufacturers on upgrades to the technology. They've also teamed up to use the technology to perform groundbreaking research. As Ghiran notes, \"A lot of the things you don't consider when working with larger cells come into play when working with extracellular vesicles.\" For instance, some of their recent research has looked at the best time of day and method for collecting blood samples based on biological circadian rhythms and other variables. Collecting specimens at different times and in different ways introduces noise into the sample that can lead to misdiagnosis. \"If you're looking at different times of day, you may actually be misdiagnosing what is happening, or undermining the effectiveness of treatment,\" Ghiran explains. \"If you take the sample differently\u2014for instance, the process varies nurse to nurse\u2014you might think everything looks great, but the next day the patient isn't doing well. So we are narrowing down the 'when' and the 'how.'\" While they have received continued funding to explore this further, their preliminary findings suggest that it is generally best to take blood samples early in the morning.The vision of the Core, Tigges notes, has always been \"to stay at the forefront of cytometry, and be here to provide everything we can in an instrument capacity as well as in a scientific capacity. We've tried to be forward thinking.\" While they're both inspired by innovation and are constantly looking at new ways to improve and apply existing technology, Tigges and Ghiran agree that they're most fulfilled by the impact the Core has on patient care and outcomes. Ghiran reflects, \"We both love high-tech 'toys' and using technology to advance science, but the greatest fulfillment comes when our insights have practical impacts on patient care and outcomes.\" Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 | 29 From left: Researcher Ionita Ghiran, MD, with Flow Cytometry Specialist Eric Zigon and Core Project Manager John Tigges<< Back to Table of Contents\"Therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation that effectively battle cancer can be toxic to the cardiovascular system,\" explains Asnani, who joined the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine in 2017. Prior to treatment, it can be difficult to identify which cancer patients are at risk of developing these dangerous and sometimes fatal complications and, in some cases, heart damage doesn't become apparent until many years after cancer treatment has ended. During her medical residency, Asnani cared for a woman in her early 40s who had received high doses of Adriamycin chemotherapy as a teenager. Several decades later, the patient was cancer-free but had developed symptoms of heart failure. By the time Asnani saw the patient, she was in cardiogenic shock and passed away within 48 hours of arriving at the hospital. \"She and her doctors thought she was cured of cancer and in good health. When she developed decreased energy levels and fatigue, it took a while to diagnose her with congestive heart failure and treat her with the appropriate medications.\" This particular experience, says Asnani, led her to pursue the field of cardio-oncology. \"Discussing this case with my mentors made me realize that we need to raise awareness of both the short- and long-term cardiovascular complications that can develop from cancer therapies.\" A physician-scientist, Asnani oversees a team of basic researchers who are working to identify risk factors and markers that could signal the development of cardiac problems following cancer treatments. Using both zebrafish and mouse models, the Asnani lab is focused on understanding the molecular pathways that underlie chemotherapy-induced cardiac toxicity in patients who receive anthracyclines including Adriamycin, which is still commonly used in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 |31 30 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018In recent years, the number of cancer survivors has rapidly increased as a result of both an aging population and the development of highly effective cancer treatments. Cardiologist Aarti Asnani, MD, wants survivors and their caregivers to be aware of an often overlooked side effect of these highly effective cancer treatments.MEDICINE WITH A MISSION \"With all the recent successes of cancer treatment, there is a need to minimize the impact of cardiotoxicity as much as possible.\" \u2014Aarti Asnani, MD The percentage of all cancer patients who were treated with anthracyclines demonstrated signs of heart toxicity within the first year after chemotherapy9%<< Back to Table of Contentstreatment of leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer, and sarcoma. At the same time, Asnani is working to identify cardio-protective therapies that one day could be administered in tandem with chemotherapy to prevent the development of heart damage. A recent estimate finds that as many as 9% of all cancer patients who were treated with anthracyclines demonstrated signs of heart toxicity within the first year after chemotherapy. Asnani reflects, \"With all the recent successes of cancer treatment, there is a need to minimize the impact of cardiotoxicity as much as possible. From a public health standpoint, it will be important to develop new risk stratification and treatment strategies to protect the heart during cancer therapy.\" Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Medicine Annual Report 2018 | 31 << Back to Table of Contents Allergy and Inflammation Babatunde KA, Mbagwu S, Hern\u00e1ndez- Casta\u00f1eda MA, RHY, Ghiran I, Mantel PY.
