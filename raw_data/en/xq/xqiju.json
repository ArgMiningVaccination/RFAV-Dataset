The Department has laid emphasis on the generation of biotech products, processes and technologies for enhanced efficiency, productivity and cost-effectiveness in the areas of agriculture, food and nutritional security; affordable health care and wellness; environmental safety; clean energy and biofuel, bio- manufacturing etc. Skill development programmes have been developed in close coordination with State Governments. The Department has contributed through its various programmes to the National Missions launched by the Prime Minister- Swasth Bharat, Swatch Bharat, Start-up India, Make in India and Digital India. The Department has also risen to the challenge for mitigation of COVID Pandemic by supporting vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, genomics, bioreporsitories and a National Platform (NBRIC) for achievement of Atmanirbharta. Snap shot of achievements: The coordinated efforts of all the stakeholders resulted in supporting more than1642 projects, 2731Scientists and 5145 project fellows, more than 1 Lakh students were trained under Star college scheme, 40 Ramalingaswami Re-entry fellows secured regular appointment, 20,000 rural, SC,ST and Women beneficiaries were supported through Societal programme and more than 25,000 farmers supported thorough Biotech KISAN scheme. has been implemented by DBT with a major focus on improved agriculture, affordable healthcare, clean energy and cutting-edge frontier science as per details given below: - GARBH-ini (interdisciplinary Group for Advanced Research in BirtH outcomes- DBT India Initiative) study aim to discover molecular risk-markers and generate a risk-prediction algorithm for preterm birth which will facilitate timely referral and care for at-risk mothers, thus saving children's lives and reducing morbidity. This programme has established a unique pregnancy cohort comprising of more than 8000 women to study Pre Term Birth (PTB). The GARBH-ini platform comprises of a bio-repository (Rakshita) of well characterized clinical phenotypes which has now expanded to include 750,000 bio-specimens and 450,000 ultrasound images. - The frequency of preterm birth has been found to be around 13%, which is higher than those reported from economically developed (8.6%) or the low-income countries in Northern (7.3%) or Sub-Saharan Africa (12.3%). In addition to the well-known risk factors such as history of preterm birth, short Inter-pregnancy interval and short cervix at 3rd trimester, some less reported factors such as biomass fuel use and exposure to passive smoking as risk factors of PTB have been identified. With respect to BMI at enrolment, both underweight and overweight/obese women were found to have a higher risk of PTB. A first trimester dating formula (called Garbhini-1) has been developed from the biometry of the foetus from mothers enrolled in the cohort which is more sensitive & accurate than global formulae. - AMR Mission will focus on development of new antibiotics, alternatives to antibiotics and diagnostics. Some of the achievements include: - National Centre for Microbial Resource (NCMR), National Centre of Cell Sciences, Pune (an Autonomous Institute of DBT), a National Facility to function as a Bio-repository for resistant microbes/infective agents (Bacteria and Fungi)\" and to carry out collection, storage, maintenance, preservation and characterization of these microbes across the country. - A National AMR-specific Pathogen priority list for India to prioritize R&D work in AMR was developed in collaboration with WHO, Country Office, New Delhi - To address the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) with a holistic and multi-sectoral (One Health) approach, \"India's One Health Initiative\" to combat problems associated with AMR was launched. - India has partnered with Global AMR R&D Hub as a member of Board of Members.
