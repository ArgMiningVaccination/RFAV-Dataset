Although many systematic reviews and meta-analyses have evaluated the preventative effectiveness of the 23-valent pneu- mococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) for pneumococcal dis- eases, its effectiveness in individuals with chronic lung comorbidities, including those in an immunosuppressive state, remains unclear [5-9]. Most studies to date have been randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies, all of which require significant effort and are costly. The test-negative design has been increasingly used to monitor the annual vaccine effectiveness (VE) in several countries [10-13]. Using this study design, Suzuki et al. reported PPSV23 ef-fectiveness of 27.4% for all types of pneumococcal 33.5% for the PPSV23 serotype [14]. The self-controlled case series (SCCS) method is self-matched, thus eliminating the effects of fixed confounders [15]. Pneumonia due to pneumococci as well as many other kinds of pathogens influences the clinical course of patients with lung comorbidities, such as declining lung function, triggering exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or interstitial pneumonia, or interfering ongoing anticancer chemother - apies. Therefore, the prevention of all-cause pneumonia is essential for disease management. To the best of our knowledge, no study has evaluated the VE of PPSV23 against all-cause pneumonia by using the SCCS method. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of PPSV23 in patients with lung comorbidities, including those in an immunosuppressive state, by using the SCCS method. Methods Study design and subjects We conducted a single-center retrospective study with the SCCS method to eliminate the effects of confounders [15].

To evaluate the effectiveness of PPSV23 in these patients, including immunosuppressed individ - uals, we conducted a retrospective study using the self-controlled case series method. Methods: Patients with lung comorbidities who were immunized with PPSV23 in a hospital setting between April 2011 and March 2015 were included. The primary and secondary outcomes were all-cause pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia, respectively, the incidences of which were compared before and after immunization. To calculate the post-immunization rate ratio (RR) of pneumonia compared to that before immunization, the Mantel-Haenszel method was used. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as follows: (1-RR) \u00d7 100%. Results: Data of 110 patients (80% median age, 68.06 years) were analyzed. Chronic lung comorbidities included lung cancer (n: 56, 50.9%), interstitial pneumonia (n: 27, 24.5%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n: 22, 20%), and other chronic lung diseases (n: 5, 4.5%). More than 80% of the patients with lung cancer were immunized during the initial course of anticancer chemotherapy; 92% of the patients with interstitial pneumonia were immunized at the beginning of immunosuppressive therapy. The rates of pre- and post-immunization all-cause pneumonia were 334.34 and 185.06 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. Further, the RR and VE were 0.643 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.449-0.922) and 35.7% (95% CI The rates pre- and post-immuniza - tion pneumococcal pneumonia were 38.33 and 23.36 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. Further, the RR and VE were 0.441 (95% confidence interval inci- dence of both all-cause pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia.

The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Kameda Medical Center (No. 18-029), and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Dec- laration of Helsinki. Data collection The onset of pneumonia was evaluated retrospectively. The di- agnosis of pneumonia was based on the presence of the following clinical and laboratory findings: newly formed consolidation on chest imaging and leukocytosis in peripheral blood or elevated serum C-re- active protein level. Additionally, at least two of the following four criteria had to be met: a body temperature of>37.0\u00b0C; chest symp-toms such as cough, sputum, chest pain, or dyspnea; coarse crackles on chest auscultation; and causative bacteria in the specimen obtained from patients with respiratory tract infections [16]. Pneumococcal pneumonia was defined as a certified positive culture of pneumo-cocci in a specimen obtained from the respiratory tract or blood or positive pneumococcal urinary antigen, based on recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [17]. The prima - ry outcome was the onset of all-cause pneumonia; the incidence rate per 1,000 person-years was compared before and after PPSV23 im-munization. The secondary outcome was the onset of pneumococcal pneumonia; again, the incidence rate per 1,000 person-years was compared before and after PPSV23 immunization. Sample size We assumed that the pneumonia incident rates were 263 per 1000 person-years before PPSV23 vaccination and 96 per 1000 per - son-years after PPSV23 vaccination. Based on a previous study [18], subjects were observed for 1.5 years. A sample size of 100 was re- quired to detect a possible 50% VE (RR: 0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-0.92); owing to the SCCS design, the number of cases was the same as that of the controls. Statistical Analysis To calculate the number of person-days before PPSV23 immu - nization, we followed patients from the beginning of the follow-up period until the date of pneumonia onset or the date of PPSV23 im- munization. The follow-up period started on April 1, 2011, or the date of the first visit if the first visit was later than April 1, 2011. We calculated the number of person-days after PPSV23 immuniza - tion by following up patients from the date of PPSV23 immunization until the date of pneumonia onset or the end of the follow-up period, whichever was first. The follow-up period ended on March 31, 2015, or the date of the last visit if the last visit was earlier than March 31, 2015. To estimate the incidence rates and RRs, only the first onset of pneumonia during the relevant time period was considered, and the observation period was ended at the time of the first onset of pneu- monia. To compare the incidence rate before and after PPSV23 im-munization for a study subject, Mantel-Haenszel RRs (RRMH) and 95% CIs were calculated [19,20]. The RRMH was calculated using the following equation: (pneumonia onset after immunization (ai) \u00d7 observation period before immunization (y0i)/total observation pe-riod (yi))/(pneumonia onset before immunization (bi) \u00d7 observation period after immunization (y1i)/total observation period (yi)). Anal-yses were conducted using person-days, but the results were trans- lated to person-years for ease of interpretation. VE was estimated as (1-RR) \u00d7 100%. To compare categorical variables, Fisher's exact test was used, while comparisons for >3 different continuous variables were made using the Kruskal-Wallis test. P-values <0.05 were consid- ered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using R, version 3.22 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, http://www.R-project.org/). Results A total of 110 patients (88 men, 80%) were included in this study. The total follow-up periods were 38,321 and 47,601 person-days be-fore and after immunization, respectively. Of the lung comorbidities, lung cancer was most frequent (n=56, 50.9%), pneumonia 20.0%). Of all patients, 4.5% other chronic such as (Table 1). The var - ious lung comorbidities significantly varied according to patient age, for example, patients with lung cancer were younger than those with COPD (p<0.001). Table 2 shows the timing of PPSV23 immunization. Most patients with chronic lung diseases were immunized with PPSV23 during the early period of their clinical course. More than 80% of the patients with lung cancer were immunized before the end of first-line chemo - therapy. Additionally, more than 92% of the patients with interstitial pneumonia were immunized at the initiation of long-term steroid ther - apy or during the first immunosuppressant cycle. Among the patients with COPD, more than 90% were immunized after disease exacer - bation, at which point sustained inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy was usually administered because it is recommended by global guide- lines [21]. The rates of all-cause pneumonia were 334.34 and 185.06 per 1,000 person-years before and after immunization, respectively. Re- current all-cause pneumonia was observed in five cases before im-munization and in seven cases after immunization. PPSV23 immu - nization was significantly associated with a reduced rate of all-cause pneumonia onset in those with chronic lung diseases (RR: 0.643, 95% CI: 0.449-0.922). The subgroup analysis also showed a significant re-duction in the onset of all-cause pneumonia in patients with COPD (Table 68.06 38,321 After immunization, 47,601 Lung comorbidities N (%) cancer 56 (50.9) 66 (62.0; 70.0) (20.0) 73.5 (69.3; diseasesa5 (4.5) 60 (56.0; 65.0) Note: Variables are expressed as numbers (percentages) unless otherwise specified; achronic lung diseases other than lung cancer, interstitial COPD; COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Q: QuartileTable 1: Clinical and demographic characteristics of the study subjects.Citation: Aoshima M, Nakashima K, Ohfuji S (2019) Effectiveness of the 23-Valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine in Patients with Chronic Lung Diseas- A Self-Controlled Case Series Study.

Before immunization, pneumococcal pneumonia was diagnosed based on only certified positive sputum culture in three patients and based on both positivity of sputum culture and urinary antigen in one patient. After immunization, pneumococcal pneumonia was diagnosed based on only certified positive sputum culture in two patients and based on both positivity of sputum culture and urinary antigen in one patient. No pneumococcal pneumonia episode was di-agnosed based on only positive urinary antigen before or after immu - nization. The rates of pneumococcal pneumonia were 38.33 and 23.36 per 1,000 person-years before and after immunization, respectively. No case of recurrent pneumococcal pneumonia was observed before or after immunization. PPSV23 immunization was significantly as- sociated with a reduced pneumococcal pneumonia onset 0.441, 95% CI: 0.210-0.926). However, the episodes of pneumococ - cal pneumonia onset were very few, and a significant reduction in the rate of pneumococcal pneumonia was not noted in cases with comor - bidities (Table 4). The VE rates for all-cause and 7.4-79.0%), respectively. this study, we assessed the effectiveness of PPSV23 immuniza - tion by using the SCCS method. Because we think all-cause pneumo- nia is an important factor to be considered in the clinical outcomes of the patients with lung comorbidities, we chose the onset of all-cause pneumonia as the primary outcome. Our data showed that PPSV23 immunization significantly reduced the incidence of all-cause lung comorbidities. Although several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have evaluated the preventative effectiveness of PPSV23 for pneumococ - cal diseases, VE remains unclear [5-9]. As these systematic reviews and meta-analyses included heterogeneous studies with different pop-ulations, case definitions, outcome measures, medical practices, and serotype distributions, the results varied widely.Lung comorbidities and immunization timing N (%) Lung cancer 56 At diagnosis 1 (1.8) Before first-line chemotherapy 28 (50.0) During first-line chemotherapy 16 (28.6) After second-line chemotherapy or later 4 (7.1) Others 7 (12.5) Interstitial pneumonia 27 At initiation of long-term steroid therapy 24 (88.9) During the first cycle of intravenous cyclophosphamide 1 (3.7) After a later cycle of intravenous cyclophosphamide 1 (3.7) Others 1 (3.7) COPD 22 After exacerbation 20 (90.9) Others 2 (9.1) Other chronic lung diseases 5 At initiation of long-term steroid therapy 2 (40.0) Others 3 (60.0) Before immunization After immunization RR 95% CI Pneumonia onset, perioda (pd)Ratea (pd)Ratea diseases 724 1008.13 0 1,625 0 NDcNDcNote: Values in parentheses show the proportions of timing of immuniza - tion for each comorbidity; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Nichol et al. conducted a 2-year retrospective cohort study and found that among elderly persons with chronic lung diseases, PPSV23 significantly reduced pneumo-nia hospitalization and death by 47% and 29%, respectively [5]. In a case-control study, Vila-Corcoles et al. reported that pneumococcal vaccination did not alter the risk of overall pneumococcal pneumonia occurrence in patients with chronic lung diseases. They reported VE of 29%; however, the finding was not statistically significant [7]. In conclusion, the VE of PPSV23 in immunocompromised hosts and pa-tients with chronic lung diseases remains controversial. In our study, most patients with lung cancer and interstitial pneu- monia were expected to be in a potentially immunosuppressive state because of ongoing anticancer chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapies. Vila-Corcoles et al. reported VE of 48% against all-cause pneumococcal pneumonia in a case-control study [6]. Their study included immunocompromised participants such as individuals with cancer (7.9%), undergoing corticosteroid therapy (6.6%), or with chronic lung diseases (37.2%). Some studies showed that the antige - nicity of vaccines was preserved despite an immunosuppressive state. We previously reported that patients with lung cancer undergoing anticancer chemotherapy showed acceptable immune responses to a trivalent influenza vaccine [22]. Another study showed that ongo-ing treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents did not affect the antibody response to pneumococcal vaccination in patients with interstitial pneumonia [23]. These results suggest that immunization during the early period of patients' clinical course is important. During our study period, ICS treatment was recommended for COPD patients with a history of prior exacerbation based on the glob- al guidelines for COPD, GOLD2011 [21]. Ishifuji et al. conducted a prospective observational study and showed that the use of ICS was one of the risk factors for recurrent pneumonia, with an adjusted haz-ard ratio of 1.78 [24]. Several other studies showed an elevated risk of pneumonia in COPD patients undergoing ICS [25,26]. In our study, ICS was administered in COPD patients with a history of disease ex-acerbation; immunization with PPSV23 occurred after exacerbation. We found that PPSV23 immunization was significantly associated with a reduced rate of all-cause pneumonia (RR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.04-0.29); however, (RR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.05-1.18). A previous 7-year retrospective observational cohort study using two large healthcare claims databases with more than 1 million sub- jects reported that adults aged 50 years with chronic lung diseas- es or cancer had a higher risk of pneumococcal pneumonia than did healthy adults [27]. The authors suggested that because the risk of pneumococcal diseases in adults aged 50-64 years was the highest among those with chronic lung disease and cancer, extending pneu- mococcal vaccination to adults aged<65 years with such lung comor - bidities may be desirable. At our institution, patients with chronic lung comorbidities are immunized with PPSV23 irrespective of their age (i.e., aged>65 years or less). Because only vaccine-na\u00efve patients were enrolled in this study, the number of patients in each subgroup was small, and the 95% CIs were widely distributed. Thus, we avoid-ed subgroup analyses and used the overall RR instead. We found higher VE for pneumococcal pneumonia than that re- ported in previous studies. This difference may be explained by differences in patient population and study design. We enrolled pa- tients with chronic lung comorbidities including those in the immu - nosuppressive state. Our study was performed using the SCCS meth - od, which is self-matched and thus minimizes the effects of fixed confounders [15,28]. Due to chronic lung comorbidities, all patients included in this study were carefully followed up under our supervi- sion. Thus, the data regarding pneumonia onset were deemed highly reliable. Hence, we showed the effectiveness of PPSV23 with con- sideration of the effects of potential confounders. A few studies have investigated VE by using the SCCS method for influenza, mumps, measles, and rubella [29-32]. To the best of our knowledge, our study was the first to investigate the VE of PPSV23 against all-cause pneu- monia and pneumococcal pneumonia by using the SCCS method. This study has several limitations. First, the current study was a single-center retrospective study with a small sample size. As we only enrolled vaccine-na\u00efve patients, the number of patients in each sub- group was small; thus, subgroup analysis was avoided. Second, the probability that the event of pneumonia increased the chance of im- munization of PPSV23 caused the relative incidence to be biased to- wards null. Third, serotype specificity was not assessed. Concerning serotype distribution, three different surveillance studies were con- ducted in Japan at the same time as the current study [33-35]. These three studies showed almost identical serotype distribution of pneu-mococcal pneumonia. PPV23 accounted for more than 60% of all serotypes. We participated in one of these surveillance studies [33]. Although the serotype of pneumococcal pneumonia cases included in the current study was not specified, our pneumococcal pneumonia patients were expected not to differ from the general pneumococcal pneumonia population in Japan. Fourth, the indirect effect of pedi-atric pneumococcal conjugate vaccine immunization, the so-called \"herd protection,\" was not excluded. In Japan, a public vaccination subsidy system of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for children aged 2-60 months was implemented in 2011, and a national immunization program was implemented in April 2013. As a result of these pro- grams, the vaccination rate increased and the frequency of pediatric invasive pneumococcal diseases significantly decreased [36]. Fifth, a selection bias might exist; the patients included in this study might not be representative of the general population with chronic lung diseases in Japan. Sixth, the effect of health-conscious behaviors after immu - nization, which might reduce the incidence rate, was not excluded [37]. Seventh, as we used the Mantel-Haenszel method, the onset of repetitive pneumonia was difficult to assess [19,20]. However, very few cases showed the onset of repetitive pneumonia; thus, its effect on the incidence rate was considered negligible. Finally, there might have been other unmeasured confounders. Using the SCCS method, we found that immunization with PPSV23 in patients with lung comorbidities reduced the incidence of both all-cause pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia. Most patients received PPSV23 immunization shortly after the initiation of anticancer chemotherapy, long-term corticosteroid therapy, or ICS therapy. Despite the above limitations, our results suggest that im- munization with PPSV23 was effective. Thus, immunization should be scheduled during the early clinical period in patients with lung comorbidities, including those in a potentially immunosuppressive state. We believe that our results provide evidence for recommending pneumococcal vaccination in persons with pulmonary comorbidities.
