If you've never heard of these before, or never tried one yourself, we're here to fill you in on exactly what a cacao ceremony is, what the benefits are, what to expect and why we love sharing them with guests on retreat. You can view the video [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3-b9SUYIfo) What is a cacao ceremony? A cacao ceremony is really an opportunity for people to come together in an intentional space and enjoy drinking ceremonial cacao whilst perhaps setting new intentions, sharing heart-felt insights, or being led through a meditation or visualisation of some kind. Cacao ceremonies are certainly not new. People in south and central America, especially the Mayan and Aztec cultures, have been enjoying, initiating and sharing cacao ceremonies for thousands of years. Archaeological evidence of cacao's use dates back to 3,900 years ago in Central America, and recent genetic evidence dates cacao's use to 5,300 years ago in the Amazon. Traditionally, these ceremonies were to help communities unite, share, connect and also seed positive intentions and manifestations for the coming natural cycles to help produce healthy crops and abundance in all forms. Above all though, cacao was also used for spiritual, medicinal and ceremonial purposes for inner awakening and creative guidance. Cacao is very revered in these ancient cultures, even today. To this day, many cultures still utilise cacao ceremonially and more recently, this ancient knowledge and the practices have been carried to the western world especially in holistic, spiritual and wellness communities. A cacao ceremony is a beautiful opportunity to connect with yourself on a deeper level and with those sharing the ceremony journey along side you. The cacao offers great insights, creativity and inspiration. It is also well known for its heart opening properties and also its mood-boosting effects, so it can be quite a lively and euphoric experience! Cacao ceremonies also offer an opportunity for deep healing, for introspection, goal setting, self love and transformation. What is ceremonial cacao? So now you have an idea of what a cacao ceremony is, what is ceremonial cacao? In ceremonies, it's not your average 'hot chocolate' that is served! Ceremonial cacao refers to the highest quality, most pure, unheated, unprocessed part of the cacao bean. Ceremonial Cacao should come as paste - sometimes called Cacao liquor. This unrefined paste is made simply by grinding the Cacao Beans and stopping before the cacao butter and cacao powder separate. The best Ceremonial Cacao comes from the heirloom Criollo bean - a native species of Cacao. Most importantly, it is organically and sustainably grown where local indigenous growers and communities are supported, ethically and generously. This cacao doesn't taste quite like the chocolate blocks you may be used to! It is quite rich and can be slightly bitter as it isn't sweetened in any way. What are the benefits of Ceremonial Cacao? Ceremonial cacao contains all of the incredible beneficial properties that the pure cacao bean offers. There's no doubt it is a powerful and positive substance- cacao is known to the Ancient Mayan culture as the 'Food of the Gods' and the active constituent in cacao - theobromine - also translates to 'Food of the Gods' in Ancient Latin. Opens your heart Cacao contains a molecule called theobromine, which is a little like a sister molecule to caffeine. Unlike caffeine, however, its stimulating effects focus more on blood flow and the heart than on the nervous system, so you will likely experience cacao as a more grounded energy source than caffeine. Ceremonial cacao can certainly feel energising but wont tend to make you feel jittery or keep you up at night. Because of the way the theobromine significantly increases blood flow, you will likely experience a heart-opening sensation after drinking cacao. It's common to feel filled up with love, or open and connected to both yourself and to others. Mood-boosting Cacao is well documented for its positive mood-boosting effects. The compounds anandamide and PEA increase serotonin uptake which contribute to an overall feeling of happiness and contentment with each sip. It is also a great source of scientifically proven 'happiness' chemicals including tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylethylamine. Stimulates focus and clarity Cacao increases blood flow (oxygen and nutrients) to the brain. The stimulating effects of cacao can help you to focus longer and deeper on the spiritual practice of the ceremony, like an extended meditation for example. If you often feel fidgety or distracted in meditation, you may notice that in a cacao ceremony you have razor sharp focus! This is also why cacao is becoming more common to enjoy in daily life. If you have a big work day or essay to get through, try a cacao over that coffee! Abundant in health properties Cacao is one of the highest natural sources of antioxidants and one of the highest sources of magnesium known to man. It also contains calcium and magnesium in perfect ratios that are fully absorbable by the body. It is also high in an extensive number of vitamins and minerals, including B vitamins, vitamins A, C and D, calcium, zinc, copper and potassium. You can read more about all the benefits of cacao in its raw pure form in our previous blog [here.](https://escapehaven.com/2019/08/when-chocolate-is-good-for-you/) Spiritual Connection Using this powerful and pure form of cacao in a ceremonial setting ensures that the potent benefits and unique qualities of the cacao are truly experienced. While cacao doesn't have 'psychedelic' properties, it is considered, especially in ancient cultures, to be a form of 'plant medicine' purely because of all of its incredible benefits. It is therefore considered a very safe, accessible and enjoyable way to experience a ceremonial medicine circle. You will likely feel a heightened sense of unity, consciousness or simply a deeper connection to yourself and the world around you. What can you expect in a cacao ceremony? All cacao ceremonies are going to be different depending on where you experience the ceremony and the particular facilitator. In our cacao ceremonies at Escape Haven, our beautiful facilitator will lead you through a relaxing meditation journey on the beach as the sunsets. Sitting in a circle around the bonfire with eyes closed, you will enjoy your ceremonial cacao and likely, you will start to feel the benefits- you may feel yourself dropping into your heart, you may feel positive inspiration coming to you, you may feel yourself in a place of reflection, healing or forgiveness. As you are led through the ceremony, different feelings, emotions and insights are likely to arise, all are welcome. You are then invited to let go of anything that you may like to let go of and set intentions for your ongoing journey from here. This can be an incredibly uplifting and powerful journey. You are always invited and welcome to share anything coming up for you, or you may simply like to be in your own space. Moving through a ceremony with other like-minded women that you have come to know over the week is also a beautiful bonding experience too. The special atmosphere of the tropical beach and sunset adds to the magic. Are cacao ceremonies all the same? Not likely! Cacao ceremonies are always going to be unique and different. If you sit traditionally in south or central america, the experience will likely be very different. The cacao itself is also likely to be very thick and bitter (in the west we seem to have adapted it to more of a western palate!) It is also common for cacao ceremonies to be combined with other modalities such as breathwork, yoga, meditation, song, dance, live music and many other practices that are complimentary to the positive benefits that the cacao stimulates. Likely no two ceremonies you attend will be the same! So simply go with an open mind and open heart and trust the journey! What are the benefits of a cacao ceremony? Cacao ceremonies are becoming more popular, because they are spaces for people to connect with each other in new ways, and they are an opportunity to reconnect with ancient parts of ourselves that remember the simple power of gathering together in community. As mentioned, cacao ceremonies have lots of really special and unique benefits: - Stimulates feelings of love, self love and is heart opening - Inspires a positive mood and gentle feelings of euphoria - Inspired inspiration, creativity and new insights - Initiates healing, reflection and forgiveness - Strengthens bonds and feelings of connection and unity - Promotes compassion, understanding and openness - Helps you to close old chapters and move forwards on your path - Offers clarity, focus, insight and a connection to your intuition and deeper knowing - Can support you to release blocks, recognise patterns and let go - Supports you to find and develop a connection to your highest self & your own power - Enables you to silence the mind and connect to the wisdom and spirit within you Why share cacao ceremonies as a group? On a metaphysical level, cacao serves as a tool for connecting to the energetic space of your heart, as well as to people around you. Cacao ceremonies are special to share in a group environment, especially with a special group of women. They can help to increase the energetic field of our hearts, and when we join together, the field is amplified and woven together. We tend to forget on a daily basis that we are all connected and united. In a cacao ceremony, you can shift the energy into the same frequency or vibration. This may seem a bit woo woo! Yet it's similar to a group of friends going out for cocktails - they are all getting into the same journey together by drinking beverages with the same effect on the body. In the case of cacao, it is a joyous and healing experience for your body, mind and spirit. Depending on the intention of the ceremony this can also be wonderful way to connect with people in a safe, open-hearted environment. As cacao brings people into the same energetic frequency, this often results in deeper, more intimate connection with ourselves and each other. The group enjoys a shared experience of mood elevation, increased vitality, enhanced intuition and empathy, and a more open, present heart. How do I do a cacao ceremony at home? Absolutely! You can purchase ceremonial cacao online and enjoy your own cacao rituals. It's becoming a more common substitute for coffee as it offers a lot of the stimulating and mental benefits of caffeine, without the downfalls of caffeine such as anxiety or 'jitters.' You may like to brew your cacao and sit with it in meditation or whilst journaling. You may even like to share a cacao ceremony with other people in your life. Below is a little recipe if you would like to make your own cacao at home: Ceremonial Cacao Recipe Shave off 1-2 tablespoons of the cacao paste and add to a cup of water in a saucepan on a low to medium heat and stir until the cacao has melted. Once melted, add a pinch of cayenne pepper to 'activate' the cacao Add sweetener of your choice to taste and stir, you can use coconut nectar, agave, maple syrup or raw honey For a creamier and tastier cacao you can add a little milk of your choice such as almond milk or coconut milk and warm through. Remember to take some time sitting with your cacao once it is ready and imbuing it with positive intentions and positive energy. Enjoy your cacao and the benefits it offers you!
