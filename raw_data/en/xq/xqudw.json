Be free. Be well. Make whole. Annie Hi! My name is Anne Lindberg. Most people call me Annie. I am an acupuncturist, herbalist, Ayurvedic and Chinese Medicine practitioner, and yoga teacher. My goal is to help patients engage their inner resources to heal fully. I help patients become pain-free, move freely, feel free. . . . Acupuncture Acupuncture is a 4,000-year-old healing modality that facilitates deep healing from the inside out. Pain, whether physical or emotional, stems from stagnation. Acupuncture stimulates the body's resources to unblock adhesions, and promote unobstructed flow of the body's energy and fluids, enabling the body to efficiently heal itself. . . . Ayurveda Ayurveda is a 5,000-year-old system of natural healing that has its origins in the Vedic culture of India. It is literally the Science of Life, the Science of Longevity. (Ayer = life. Veda = science, knowledge). Ayurveda emphasizes that health is a balanced and dynamic integration of body, mind, spirit, and environment. . . . \"Annie is an incredible healer.
