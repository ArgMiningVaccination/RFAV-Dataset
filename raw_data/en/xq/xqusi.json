Classic Lighting designs, imports and manufactures fine crystal chandeliers, solid cast brass fixtures including Alabaster shades from Europe, and wrought iron frames. The quality of materials we use are unsurpassed. Most of our chandeliers, pendants, sconces, vanities and wall brackets are made from parts imported from Europe and assembled in our factory in Jacksonville Florida. For tighter budgets, we also bring in some product from China, some of which we combine with Austrian, Turkish, or Egyptian crystal or European lead crystal or glass column parts and bobeches. Virtually all of our crystal designs are available in Swarovski Strass crystal or Swarovski Spectra Crystal. Make sure any Swarovski Strass crystal you buy has the laser etched logo inside. We guarantee the authenticity of our crystal. All of Classic Lighting's product is quality inspected and held to the highest standards. We have UL Listing certification by our factory in Jacksonville, Florida. UL listing is critical to insure that your lighting is safe. Ask before buying and verify before installing.
