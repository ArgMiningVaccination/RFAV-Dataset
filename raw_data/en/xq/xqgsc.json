When we know that someone is going to have anesthesia and surgery, there are very good methods of preparing that person for the trauma they are about to experience. I have found that this protocol is very useful. It helps with excessive bleeding and recovery from anesthesia when applied correctly. I have used this protocol with many people and the usual response is, \"My doctor said that he has never seen anyone recover so quickly.\" This is one of the few times that I ever apply homeopathy with a more allopathic intent. Remember that we always prescribe a remedy based on the symptoms of the individual and never in a routine way. Let the person guide you to the remedy. But with surgery that is planned, it is a known event that the body will be experiencing trauma. By following the protocol recovery can be improved tremendously. Arnica is one of the best remedies for any trauma. It also is a very good remedy for recovery from anesthesia. Follow the protocol below: As you can see, the protocol increases the frequency of repetition of doses leading up to the surgery. Just after surgery, the repetition increases a lot then starts to decrease as the body heals. I use this protocol for people that I am not able to manage directly. If I am treating a client and have more direct access to them and know how they are responding, I may change or add a remedy to the post-op protocol depending on how they are responding. Other remedies that I find are helpful are: Any of these remedies when given in the 30C potency at regular intervals appropriate for the case should provide relief for your client. If it is necessary to give the remedy very often to maintain a healing response, then possibly a higher potency will work better. Try the 200C or 1M potency. Remember that homeopathic remedies are energetic in nature and, even though they are medicine, there are no contraindications or compatibility issues with standard allopathic medications. The remedies are not of the physical realm and will not interfere with any other drug. They can be used with great safety in addition to allopathic medications for pain or infection etc. Keep these remedies in mind when someone you know is scheduled for surgery and you may be able to help them more than any other way. Be respectful of the physicians that are also working for the patient. They many times do not know about homeopathy and will resist any other medication that is offered to their patient. This is when being educated about homeopathy and being able to have family administer the remedies according to the protocol can still benefit the person. Keep the conversation going!
