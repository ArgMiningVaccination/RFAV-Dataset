Saam Acupuncture affords breakthroughs in relating to consciousness and unconsciousness as represented by PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), Dr. John Sarno's 'Unconscious Rage\" (and hauntings), and the interpretation of Dreams, vis a vis Saam's Three Levels of Human Needs. This class teaches Saam's Harmonized Combinations derived from the I Ching and its application using Dr. Richard Tan's Balance Method System, especially with the pic graphs used for headaches. Saam's Harmonized Combinations can be used with Tan's Balance Method system to treat any internal illness or pain area on the body. Incorporate meditation with your treatments by having the patient meditate upon the tonification points of the Saam Point Prescriptions. With the Triangulation method, we bring the patient out of their mind while still being in the body. By meditation on the distant points of Saam, we can effectively stretch and move Qi, and provide a great and comfortable meditative treatment for the patient. The Part 5 Posterboard section of the video offers excellent and clear diagrams of the methods for these conditions and more such as an outstanding \"Overthinking\" meditation. This is not only for the patient but for the practitioner to experience through feeling Qi and meditating on the Saam Points.", "sitename": "lhasaoms.com", "date": "2000-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Net of Knowledge is an exciting, new continuing education platform built specifically for TCM and integrative health practitioners.
