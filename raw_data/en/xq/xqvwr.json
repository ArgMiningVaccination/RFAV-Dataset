It presents up-to-date clinical guidelines whichare based on a review of the available published evidence by subject experts,for both inpatient and outpatient care in small hospitals where basic laboratoryfacilities and essential drugs and inexpensive medicines are available. In somesettings, these guidelines can be used in the larger health centres where asmall number of sick children can be admitted for inpatient care. The guidelines require the hospital to have (1) the capacity to carry out certain essential investigations\u2014such as blood smear examinations for malariaparasites, estimations of haemoglobin or packed cell volume, blood glucose,blood grouping and cross-matching, basic microscopy of CSF and urine,bilirubin determination for neonates, chest radiography and pulse oximetry\u2014and (2) essential drugs available for the care of seriously ill children. Expensivetreatment options, such as new antibiotics or mechanical ventilation, are notdescribed. These guidelines focus on the inpatient management of the major causes of childhood mortality, such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, severe malnutrition,malaria, meningitis, measles, and related conditions. They contain guidanceon the management of children with HIV infection, neonates with problems,and of the surgical management of children. Details of the principles underlyingthe guidelines can be found in technical review papers published by WHO. Acompanion background book has also been published by WHO which givesdetails of burden of disease, pathophysiology and technical basis underlyingthe guidelines for use by medical/nursing students or as part of inservicetraining of health workers. The evidence-base underlying these recommen-dations is published on the WHO website as well. (See Further Reading, page301.) This pocket book is part of a series of documents and tools that support the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) and is consistent with theIMCI guidelines for outpatient management of sick children. It is presented ina format that could be carried by doctors, nurses and other health workersduring their daily work and so be available to help guide the management ofsick children. Standard textbooks of paediatrics should be consulted for rarerconditions not covered in the pocketbook. These guidelines are applicable inxviiiHOSPITAL CARE FOR CHILDREN most areas of the world and may be adapted by countries to suit their specific circumstances. Blank pages have been left at the end of each chapter to allowindividual readers to include their own notes\u2014for example, on locally importantconditions not covered in this pocket book. WHO believes that their widespread adoption would improve the care of children in hospital and lead to lower case fatality rates.xixAbbreviations AIDS acquired immunodeficiencysyndrome AVPU simple consciousness scale ( alert, responding to voice, responding to pain, unconscious) BP blood pressureCMV cytomegalovirusCSF cerebrospinal fluidDHF dengue haemorrhagic fever DPT diphtheria, pertussis, DSS dengue shock syndromeEPI expanded programme of immunization FG French gaugeG6PD 6-phosphate dehydrogenase HIV haemolytic uraemic syndrome IM intramuscular injectionIMCI PCV packed cell volumePPD derivative (used in a test fortuberculosis) ReSoMal rehydration solution for malnutrition RDA recommended daily allowance SD standard deviationSP sulfadoxine- pyrimethamine white blood cell countWHO World Health Organization \u00b0C degrees Celsius \u00b0F degrees Fahrenheit diagnostic sign or symptom treatment recommendation CHART 1.

ETATTriage is the process of rapidly screening sick children soon after their arrival in hospital in order to identify: \u2014those with emergency signs , who require immediate emergency treatment; \u2014those with priority signs , who should be given priority while waiting in the queue so that they can be assessed and treated without delay; \u2014non-urgent cases, who have neither emergency nor priority signs. Emergency signs include: obstructed breathing severe respiratory distress central cyanosis signs of shock (cold hands; capillary refill longer than 3 seconds; weak, fast pulse) coma convulsions signs of severe dehydration in a child with diarrhoea (lethargy, sunken eyes, very slow return after pinching the skin\u2014any two of these). Children with emergency signs require immediate treatment to avert death. The priority signs (see below, page 5) identify children who are at higher risk of dying. These children should be assessed without unnecessary delay . 1.1 Summary of steps in emergency triage assessment and treatment The process of emergency triage assessment and treatment is summarized in the Charts on pages 4-16. First, check for emergency signs . Check for emergency signs in two steps: Step 1 . If there is any airway or breathing problem, start immediate treatment to restore breathing. Step 2 . Quickly determine if the child is in shock or unconscious or convulsing, or has diarrhoea with severe dehydration. If emergency signs are found: Call an experienced health professional to help if available, but do not delay starting the treatment. Stay calm and work with other health workers whoSUMMARY OF STEPS IN EMERGENCY TRIAGE ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT3 1. ETAT may be required to give the treatment, because a very sick child may need several treatments at once. The most experienced health professional shouldcontinue assessing the child (see Chapter 2, page 37), to identify allunderlying problems and develop a treatment plan. Carry out emergency investigations (blood glucose, blood smear, haemo- globin). Send blood for typing and cross-matching if the child is in shock,or appears to be severely anaemic, or is bleeding significantly. After giving emergency treatment, proceed immediately to assessing, diagnosing and treating the underlying problem. Tables of common differential diagnoses for emergency signs are provided from page 20 onwards. If no emergency signs are found, check for priority signs: Tiny baby: any sick child aged under 2 months Temperature: child is very hot Trauma or other urgent surgical condition Pallor (severe) Poisoning Pain (severe) Respiratory distress Restless, continuously irritable, or lethargic Referral (urgent) Malnutrition: visible severe wasting Oedema of both feet Burns (major) The above can be remembered with the help of \"3TPR MOB\". These children need prompt assessment (no waiting in the queue) to determine what further treatment is needed. Move the child with any priority sign to thefront of the queue to be assessed next. If a child has trauma or other surgicalproblems, get surgical help where available.SUMMARY OF STEPS IN EMERGENCY TRIAGE ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT41. ETATCHART 2.

Reassess after second infusion: If no improvement, repeat 20 ml/kg as rapidly as possible. Reassess after third infusion: If no improvement, give blood 20 ml/kg over 30 minutes (if shock is not caused by profuse diarrhoea, in this case repeatRinger's lactate or normal saline). Reassess after fourth infusion: If no improvement, see disease-specific treatment guidelines. You should have established a provisional diagnosis by now. After improvement at any stage (pulse slows, faster capillary refill), go to Chart 11, page 16.13 1. ETAT CHART 8. How to give IV fluids for shock in a child with severe malnutrition Give this treatment only if the child has signs of shock and is lethargic or has lost consciousness : Insert an IV line (and draw blood for emergency laboratory investigations) Weigh the child (or estimate the weight) to calculate the volume of fluid to be given Give IV fluid 15 ml/kg over 1 hour. Use one of the following solutions (in order ofpreference), according to availability:\u2014 Ringer's lactate half-strength Darrow's solution with 5% glucose (dextrose); or, if these are unavailable, \u2014 Ringer's lactate.

If there are signs of improvement (pulse and respiratory rates fall): \u2014 give repeat IV 15 ml/kg over 1 hour; then \u2014 switch to oral or nasogastric rehydration with ReSoMal (see page 179), 10 ml/kg/h up to 10 hours; \u2014 initiate refeeding with starter F-75 (see page 184). If the child fails to improve after the first 15ml/kg IV , assume the child has septic shock: \u2014 give maintenance IV fluid (4 ml/kg/h) while waiting for blood; \u2014 when blood is available, transfuse fresh whole blood at 10 ml/kg slowly over 3 hours (use packed cells if in cardiac failure); then \u2014 initiate refeeding with starter F-75 (see page 184); \u2014 start antibiotic treatment (see page 182). If the child deteriorates during the IV rehydration (breathing increases by 5 breaths/min or pulse by 15 beats/min), stop the infusion because IV fluid can worsen the child's condition.141.

If convulsion continues after another 10 minutes, give a third dose of diazepam or give paraldehyde rectally (or phenobarbital IV or IM15 mg/kg). If high fever: Sponge the child with room-temperature water to reduce the fever. Do not give oral medication until the convulsion has been controlled (danger of aspiration). *Use phenobarbital (200 mg/ml solution) in a dose of 20 mg/kg to control convulsions in infants <2 weeks of age: Weight 2 kg\u2014initial dose: 0.2 ml, repeat 0.1 ml after 30 minute Weight 3 kg\u2014initial dose: 0.3 ml, repeat 0.15 ml after 30 minuteif convulsions continue}15 1. ETAT CHART 10. How to give IV glucose Insert IV line and draw blood for emergency laboratory investigations Check blood glucose. If low (<2.5 mmol/litre (45 mg/dl) in a well nourished or <3 mmol/litre (54 mg/dl) in a severely malnourished child) or if dextrostix is not available: Give 5 ml/kg of 10% glucose solution rapidly by IV injection Volume of 10% glucose solution Age/weight to give as bolus (5 ml/kg) Less than 2 months (<4 kg) 15 ml 2-<4 months (4-<6 kg) 25 ml 4-<12 months (6-<10 kg) 40 ml 1-<3 years (10-<14 kg) 60 ml 3-<5 years (14-<19 kg) 80 ml Recheck the blood glucose in 30 minutes. If it is still low, repeat 5 ml/kg of 10% glucose solution. Feed the child as soon as conscious. If not able to feed without danger of aspiration, give: \u2014milk or sugar solution via nasogastric tube (to make sugar solution, dissolve 4 level teaspoons of sugar (20 grams) in a 200-ml cup ofclean water), or \u2014IV fluids containing 5-10% glucose (dextrose) (see App. 4, p. 357) Note: 50% glucose solution is the same as 50% dextrose solution or D50. If only 50% glucose solution is available: dilute 1 part 50% glucose solution to 4 parts sterile water, or dilute 1 part 50% glucose solution to 9 parts 5% glucosesolution. Note: For the use of dextrostix, refer to instruction on box. Generally, the strip must be stored in its box, at 2-3 \u00b0C, avoiding sunlight or high humidity. A drop of blood should be placed on the strip (it is necessary to cover all the reagent area). After 60 seconds, the blood should be washed off gently with drops of cold water and thecolour compared with the key on the bottle or on the blood glucose reader. (The exact procedure will vary with different strips.)161. ETAT For children with severe dehydration but without shock, refer to diarrhoea treatment plan C, p.114. If the child is in shock, first follow the instructions in Charts 7 and 8 (pages 12 and 13). Switch to the present chart when the child's pulse becomes slower or the capillary refill is faster. Give 70 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate solution (or, if not available, normal saline) over 5 hours in infants (aged <12 months) and over 21/2 hours in children (aged 12 months to 5 years).

If the hydration status is not improving, give the IV drip more rapidly Also give ORS solution (about 5 ml/kg/hour) as soon as the child can drink; this is usually after 3-4 hours (in infants) or 1-2 hours (in children). Weight Volume of ORS solution per hour <4 kg 15 ml 4-6 kg 25 ml 6-10 kg 40 ml 10-14 kg 60 ml 14-19 kg 85 ml Reassess after 6 hours (infants) and after 3 hours (children). Classify dehydration. Then choose the appropriate plan (A, B, or C, pages 120, 117, 114) to continue treatment. If possible, observe the child for at least 6 hours after rehydration to be sure that the mother can maintain hydration by giving the child ORS solution by mouth.CHART 11. How to treat severe dehydration in an emergency setting after initial management of shock17 1. ETAT1.2 Notes for the assessment of emergency and priority signs Assess the airway and breathing (A, B) Does the child's breathing appear obstructed? Look and listen to determine if there is poor air movement during breathing. Is there severe respiratory distress? The breathing is very laboured, the child uses auxiliary muscles for breathing (shows head nodding), is breathing veryfast, and the child appears to tire easily. Child is not able to feed because ofrespiratory distress. Is there central cyanosis? There is a bluish/purplish discoloration of the tongue and the inside of the mouth. Assess circulation (for shock) (C) Check if the child's hand is cold? If so Check if the capillary refill time is longer than 3 seconds . Apply pressure to whiten the nail of the thumb or the big toe for 3 seconds. Determine the timefrom the moment of release until total recovery of the pink colour. If capillary refill takes longer than 3 seconds, check the pulse. Is it weak and fast? If the radial pulse is strong and not obviously fast, the child is not in shock. If you cannot feel a radial pulse of an infant (less than 1 year old), feelthe brachial pulse or, if the infant is lying down, the femoral pulse. If youcannot feel the radial pulse of a child, feel the carotid. If the room is very cold,rely on the pulse to determine whether the child may be in shock. Assess for coma or convulsions or other abnormal mental status (C) Is the child in coma? Check the level of consciousness on the AVPU scale: Aalert, Vresponds to voice, Presponds to pain, Uunconscious. If the child is not awake and alert, try to rouse the child by talking or shaking the arm. If the child is not alert, but responds to voice, he is lethargic. If thereis no response, ask the mother if the child has been abnormally sleepy ordifficult to wake. Look if the child responds to pain, or if he is unresponsive toa painful stimulus. If this is the case, the child is in coma (unconscious) andneeds emergency treatment. Is the child convulsing? Are there spasmodic repeated movements in an unresponsive child?ASSESSMENT OF EMERGENCY AND PRIORITY SIGNS181. ETATEMERGENCY TREATMENT FOR THE CHILD WITH SEVERE MALNUTRITION Assess for severe dehydration if the child has diarrhoea (D) Does the child have sunken eyes? Ask the mother if the child's eyes are more sunken than usual. Does a skin pinch go back very slowly (longer than 2 seconds)? Pinch the skin of the abdomen halfway between the umbilicus and the side for 1 second, thenrelease and observe. Assess for priority signs While assessing for emergency signs, you will have noted several possible priority signs: Is there any respiratory distress (not severe)? Is the child lethargic or continuously irritable or restless? This was noted when you assessed for coma. Note the other priority signs (see page 5). 1.3 Notes for giving emergency treatment to the child with severe malnutrition During the triage process, all children with severe malnutrition will be identified as having priority signs , which means that they require prompt assessment and treatment. A few children with severe malnutrition will be found during triage assess- ment to have emergency signs . Those with emergency signs for \" airway and breathing \" and \" coma or convulsions \" should receive emergency treatment accordingly (see charts on pages 4-16). Those with signs of severe dehydration but not shock should not be rehydrated with IV fluids. This is because the diagnosis of severe dehydrationis difficult in severe malnutrition and is often misdiagnosed. Giving IV fluidsputs these children at risk of overhydration and death from heart failure.Therefore, these children should be rehydrated orally using the special rehydration solution for severe malnutrition (ReSoMal). See Chapter 7 (page179). Those with signs of shock are assessed for further signs ( lethargic or unconscious ). This is because in severe malnutrition the usual emergency signs for shock may be present even when there is no shock. \u2014If the child is lethargic or unconscious , keep warm and give 10% glucose 5 ml/kg IV (see Chart 10, page 15), and then IV fluids (see Chart 8, page13, and the Note given below).19 1. ETATCHILDREN PRESENTING WITH EMERGENCY CONDITIONS \u2014If the child is alert, keep warm and give 10% glucose (10 ml/kg) by mouth or nasogastric tube, and proceed to immediate full assessmentand treatment. See Chapter 7 (page 173) for details. Note: When giving IV fluids, treatment for shock differs from that for a well- nourished child. This is because shock from dehydration and sepsis are likelyto coexist and these are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds alone.Children with dehydration respond to IV fluids (breathing and pulse rates fall,faster capillary refill). Those with septic shock and no dehydration will notrespond. The amount of fluid given should be guided by the child's response.Avoid overhydration. Monitor the pulse and breathing at the start and every 5-10 minutes to check if improving or not. Note that the type of IV fluid alsodiffers in severe malnutrition, and the infusion rate is slower. All severely malnourished children require prompt assessment and treatment to deal with serious problems such as hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, severeinfection, severe anaemia and potentially blinding eye problems. It is equallyimportant to take prompt action to prevent some of these problems, if theywere not present at the time of admission to hospital. 1.4 Diagnostic considerations of children presenting with emergency conditions The following text provides guidance for the approach to the diagnosis and the differential diagnosis of presenting conditions for which emergency treatmenthas been provided. After you have stabilized the child and provided emergencytreatment, determine the underlying cause of the problem, to be able to providespecific curative treatment. The following lists and tables provide some guidancewhich help with the differential diagnosis, and are complemented by the tablesin the symptom-specific chapters. 1.4.1 Child presenting with an airway or severe breathing problem History Onset of symptoms: slowly developing or sudden onset Previous similar episodes Upper respiratory tract infection Cough \u2014duration in days History of choking Present since birth, or acquired Immunization history \u2014DTP, measles ( continued on page 21 )201.

Laboratory investigations If meningitis is suspected and the child has no signs of raised intracranial pressure (unequal pupils, rigid posture, paralysis of limbs or trunk, irregularbreathing), perform a lumbar puncture. In a malarious area, prepare a blood smear. If the child is unconscious, check the blood glucose. Check the blood pressure (if a suitable paediatric cuff is available) and carry out urine microscopy ifpossible .

A positive lumbar puncture is one where there is cloudy CSF on direct visual inspection. CSFexamination shows an abnormal number of white cells (>100 polymorphonuclear cells per ml). A cell count should be carried out, if possible. However, if this is not possible, then a cloudy CSF on direct visual inspection could be considered positive.

ETAT1.5 Common poisonings Suspect poisoning in any unexplained illness in a previously healthy child. Consult standard textbook of paediatrics for management of exposure tospecific poisons and/or any local sources of expertise in the management ofpoisoning, for example a poison centre. The principles of the management ofingestion of a few of the more common poisons only is given here. Note thattraditional medicines can be a source of poisoning. Diagnosis This is made from the history by the child or carer, from clinical examination,and the results of investigations, where appropriate. Find out full details of the poisoning agent, the amount ingested and the time of ingestion. Attempt to identify the exact agent involved requesting to see the container, where relevant. Check that no other children were involved. Symptoms andsigns depend on the agent ingested and therefore vary widely\u2014see below. Check for signs of burns in or around the mouth or of stridor (laryngeal damage) suggesting ingestion of corrosives. Admit all children who have ingested iron, pesticides, paracetamol or aspirin, narcotics, antidepressant drugs; children who have ingested deliberatelyand those who may have been given the drug or poison intentionally byanother child or adult. Children who have ingested corrosives or petroleum products should not be sent home without observation for 6 hours. Corrosives can causeoesophageal burns which may not be immediately apparent and petroleumproducts, if aspirated, can cause pulmonary oedema which may take somehours to develop. 1.5.1 Principles for ingested poisons Gastric decontamination (removal of poison from stomach) is most effective within one hour of ingestion, and after this time there is usually little benefit,except with agents that delay gastric emptying or in patients who are deeplyunconscious. The decision on whether to attempt this has to consider eachcase separately and must weigh the likely benefits against the risks with eachmethod. Gastric decontamination will not guarantee that all of the substancehas been removed, so the child may still be in danger.COMMON POISONINGS261. ETATContraindications to gastric decontamination are: \u2014a n unprotected airway in an unconscious child \u2014ingestion of corrosives or petroleum products unless there is the risk of serious toxicity. Check the child for emergency signs (see page 2) and check for hypo- glycaemia (page 177). Identify the specific agent and remove or adsorb it as soon as possible. Treatment is most effective if given as quickly as possible after the poisoning event, ideally within 1 hour. If the child has swallowed kerosene, petrol or petrol-based products (note that most pesticides are in petrol-based solvents) or if the child's mouthand throat have been burned (for example with bleach, toilet cleaner orbattery acid), then do not make the child vomit but give water orally. Never use salt as an emetic as this can be fatal. If the child has swallowed other poisons Give activated charcoal, if available, and do not induce vomiting; give by mouth or NG tube according to table below. If giving by NG tube, beparticularly careful that the tube is in the stomach. Table 5. Amount of activated charcoal per dose Children up to one year of age: 1 g/kg Children 1 to 12 years of age: 25 to 50 g Adolescents and adults: 25 to 100 g Mix the charcoal in 8-10 times the amount of water, e.g. 5 g in 40 ml of water. If possible, give the whole amount at once; if the child has difficulty in tolerating it, the charcoal dose can be divided. If charcoal is not available, then induce vomiting but only if the child is conscious by rubbing the back of the child's throat with a spatula or spoon handle; if this does not work, give an emetic such as paediatricipecacuanha (10 ml for 6 months to 2 year-olds or 15 ml for over 2years); if this does not work, then try rubbing the back of the child'sthroat again. Note: ipecacuanha can cause repeated vomiting, drowsiness and lethargy which can confuse the diagnosis of poisoning. Gastric lavage Only do it in health care facilities if staff has experience in the procedure, andif the ingestion was only a few hours ago and is life threatening, and there hasPRINCIPLES FOR INGESTED POISONS27 1. ETAT been no ingestion of corrosives or petroleum derivatives. Make sure a suction apparatus is available in case the child vomits. Place the child in the left lateral/head down position. Measure the length of tube to be inserted. Pass a 24-28French gauge tube through the mouth into the stomach, as a smaller sizenasogastric tube is not sufficient to let particles such as tablets pass. Ensurethe tube is in the stomach. Perform lavage with 10 ml/kg body weight of warmnormal saline (0.9%). The volume of lavage fluid returned should approximateto the amount of fluid given. Lavage should be continued until the recoveredlavage solution is clear of particulate matter. Note that tracheal intubation may be required to reduce risk of aspiration. Give specific antidote if this is indicated Give general care. Keep the child under observation for 4-24 hours depending on the poison swallowed Keep unconscious children in recovery position. Consider transferring child to next level referral hospital, where appropriate and where this can be done safely, if the child is unconscious or hasdeteriorating conscious level, has burns to mouth and throat, is in severerespiratory distress, is cyanosed or is in heart failure. 1.5.2 Principles for poisons in contact with skin or eyes Skin contamination Remove all clothing and personal effects and thoroughly flush all exposed areas with copious amounts of tepid water. Use soap and water for oilysubstances. Attending staff should take care to protect themselves fromsecondary contamination by wearing gloves and apron. Removed clothingand personal effects should be stored safely in a see-through plastic bagthat can be sealed, for later cleansing or disposal. Eye contamination Rinse the eye for 10-15 minutes with clean running water or saline, taking care that the run-off does not enter the other eye. The use of anaestheticeye drops will assist irrigation. Evert the eyelids and ensure that all surfacesare rinsed. In the case of an acid or alkali irrigate until the pH of the eyereturns to, and remains, normal (re-check pH 15-20 minutes after stoppingirrigation). Where possible, the eye should be thoroughly examined underfluorescein staining for signs of corneal damage. If there is significantconjunctival or corneal damage, the child should be seen urgently by anophthalmologist.PRINCIPLES FOR POISONS IN CONTACT WITH SKIN OR EYES281. ETAT1.5.3 Principles of inhaled poisons Remove from the source of exposure. Administer supplemental oxygen if required. Inhalation of irritant gases may cause swelling and upper airway obstruction, bronchospasm and delayed pneumonitis. Intubation, bronchodilators andventilatory support may be 1.5.4 Corrosive compounds Examples\u2014sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, acids, bleaches or disinfectants Do not induce vomiting or use activated charcoal when corrosives have been ingested as this may cause further damage to the mouth, throat, airway,oesophagus and stomach. Give milk or water as soon as possible to dilute the corrosive agent. Then give the child nothing by mouth and arrange for surgical review to check for oesophageal damage/rupture, if severe. Petroleum compounds Examples\u2014kerosene, turpentine substitutes, petrol Do not induce vomiting or give activated charcoal as inhalation can cause respiratory distress with hypoxaemia due to pulmonary oedema and lipoidpneumonia. Ingestion can cause encephalopathy. Specific treatment includes oxygen therapy if respiratory distress (see page 281) Organo-phosphorus and can be absorbed through the skin, ingested or inhaled. The child may complain of vomiting, diarrhoea, blurred vision or weakness. Signs are those of excess parasympathetic activation: salivation, sweating,lacrimation, slow pulse, small pupils, convulsions, muscle weakness/twitching,then paralysis and loss of bladder control, pulmonary oedema, respiratorydepression.PRINCIPLES OF INHALED POISONS29 1. ETAT Treatment involves: Remove poison by irrigating eye or washing skin (if in eye or on skin). Give activated charcoal if ingested and within 1 hour of the ingestion. Do not induce vomiting because most pesticides are in petrol-based solvents. In a serious ingestion where activated charcoal cannot be given, consider careful aspiration of stomach contents by NG tube (the airway should beprotected). If the child has signs of excess parasympathetic activation (see above), then give atropine 15-50 micrograms/kg IM (i.e. 0.015-0.05mg/kg) or byintravenous infusion over 15 minutes. The main aim is to reduce bronchialsecretions whilst avoiding atropine toxicity. Auscultate the chest for signsof respiratory secretions and monitor respiratory rate, heart rate and comascore (if appropriate). Repeat atropine dose every 15 minutes until no chestsigns of secretions, and pulse and respiratory rate returns to normal. Check for hypoxaemia with pulse oximetry, if possible, if giving atropine as it can cause heart irregularities (ventricular arrythmias) in hypoxic children.Give oxygen if oxygen saturation is 90%. If muscle weakness, give pralidoxime (cholinesterase reactivator) 25-50mg/ kg diluted with 15 ml water by IV infusion over 30 minutes repeated once ortwice, or followed by an intravenous infusion of 10 to 20 mg/kg/hour, asnecessary. Paracetamol If within 1 hour of ingestion give activated charcoal, if available, or induce vomiting UNLESS an oral antidote may be required (see below). Decide if antidote is required to prevent liver damage: ingestions of 150 mg/ kg or more, or toxic 4 hour paracetamol level where this is available. Antidoteis more often required for older children who deliberately ingest paracetamolor when parents overdose children by mistake. If within 8 hours of ingestion give oral methionine or IV acetylcysteine. Methionine can be used if the child is conscious and not vomiting (<6 years:1 gram every 4 hours for 4 doses; 6 years or older: 2.5 grams every 4 hoursfor 4 doses). If more than 8 hours after ingestion, or the child cannot take oral treatment, give IV acetylcysteine. Note that the fluid volumes used in the standardregimen are too large for young children.PARACETAMOL301. ETATFor children <20 kg give the loading dose of 150 mg/kg in 3 ml/kg of 5% glucose over 15 minutes, followed by 50 mg/kg in 7 ml/kg of 5% glucoseover 4 hours, then 100 mg/kg IV in 14 ml/kg of 5% glucose over 16 hours.The volume of glucose can be scaled up for larger children. Aspirin and other salicylates This can be very serious in young children because they rapidly become acidoticand are consequently more likely to suffer the severe CNS effects of toxicity.Salicylate overdose can be complex to manage. These cause acidotic-like breathing, vomiting and tinnitus. Give activated charcoal if available. Note that salicylate tablets tend to form a concretion in the stomach leading to delayed absorption, so it is worthwhilegiving several doses of charcoal. If charcoal is not available and a severelytoxic dose has been given, then perform gastric lavage or induce vomiting,as above. Give IV sodium bicarbonate 1 mmol/kg over 4 hours to correct acidosis and to raise the pH of the urine to above 7.5 so that salicylate excretion isincreased. Give supplemental potassium too. Monitor urine pH hourly. Give IV fluids at maintenance requirements unless child shows signs of dehydration in which case give adequate rehydration (see chapter 5). Monitor blood glucose every 6 hours and correct as necessary (see page 321). Give vitamin K 10mg IM or IV. Iron Check for clinical features of iron poisoning: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The vomit and stools are often grey or black. In severepoisoning there may be gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hypotension,drowsiness, convulsions and metabolic acidosis. Gastrointestinal featuresusually appear in the first 6 hours and a child who has remainedasymptomatic for this time probably does not require antidote treatment. Activated charcoal does not bind to iron salts, therefore consider giving a gastric lavage if potentially toxic amounts of iron were taken. Decide whether to give antidote treatment. Since this can have side-effects it should only be used if there is clinical evidence of poisoning (see above). If you decide to give antidote treatment, give deferoxamine (50 mg/kg IM up to a maximum of 1 g) by deep IM injection repeated every 12 hours; ifASPIRIN AND OTHER SALICYLATES31 1. ETAT very ill, give IV infusion 15 mg/kg/hour to a maximum of 80 mg/kg in 24 hours. Carbon monoxide poisoning Give 100% oxygen to accelerate removal of carbon monoxide (note patient can look pink but still be hypoxaemic) until signs of hypoxia disappear. Monitor with pulse oximeter but be aware that these can give falsely high readings. If in doubt, be guided by presence or absence of clinical signs ofhypoxaemia. Prevention Teach the parents to keep drugs and poisons in proper containers and out of reach of children Advise parents on first aid if this happens again in the future \u2014Do not make child vomit if child has swallowed kerosene, petrol or petrol- based products or if child's mouth and throat have been burned, nor ifthe child is drowsy. \u2014T ry to make the child vomit if other drugs or poisons have been taken by stimulating the back of the throat. \u2014T ake the child to a health facility as soon as possible, together with information about the substance concerned e.g. the container, label,sample of tablets, berries etc. 1.6 Snake bite Snake bite should be considered in any severe pain or swelling of a limb or in any unexplained illness presenting with bleeding or abnormal neurologicalsigns. Some cobras spit venom into the eyes of victims causing pain andinflammation. Diagnosis of envenoming General signs include shock, vomiting and headache. Examine bite for signs such as local necrosis, bleeding or tender local lymph node enlargement. Specific signs depend on the venom and its effects. These include: \u2014Shock \u2014Local swelling that may gradually extend up the bitten limb \u2014Bleeding: external from gums, wounds or sores; internal especially intracranialCARBON MONOXIDE POISONING321. ETAT\u2014Signs of neurotoxicity: respiratory difficulty or paralysis, ptosis, bulbar palsy (difficulty swallowing and talking), limb weakness \u2014Signs of muscle breakdown: muscle pains and black urine Check haemoglobin (where possible, blood clotting should be assessed). Treatment First aid Splint the limb to reduce movement and absorption of venom. If the bite was likely to have come from a snake with a neurotoxic venom, apply a firmbandage to affected limb from fingers or toes to proximal of site of bite. Clean the wound. If any of the above signs, transport to hospital which has antivenom as soon as possible. If snake has already been killed, take this with child tohospital. Avoid cutting the wound or applying tourniquet. Hospital care Treatment of shock/respiratory arrest Treat shock, if present (see pages 3, 15 and 16). Paralysis of respiratory muscles can last for days and requires intubation and mechanical ventilation or manual ventilation (with a mask orendotracheal tube and bag) by relays of staff and/or relatives until respiratoryfunction returns. Attention to careful securing of endotracheal tube isimportant. An alternative is to perform an elective tracheostomy. Antivenom If there are systemic signs or severe local signs (swelling of more than half of the limb or severe necrosis), give antivenom, if available. Prepare IM epinephrine and IV chlorpheniramine and be ready if allergic reaction occurs (see below). Give monovalent antivenom if the species of snake is known. Give polyvalent antivenom if the species is not known. Follow the directions given on theantivenom preparation. The dose for children is the same as for adults. \u2014Dilute the antivenom in 2-3 volumes of 0.9% saline and give intra- venously over 1 hour. Give more slowly initially and monitor closely foranaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions.SNAKE BITE33 1. ETAT If itching/urticarial rash, restlessness, fever, cough or difficult breathing develop, then stop antivenom and give epinephrine 0.01 ml/kg of 1/1000 or IV/SC chlor-pheniramine 250 micrograms/kg. When the child is stable, re-start antivenominfusion slowly. More antivenom should be given after 6 hours if there is recurrence of blood incoagulability, or after 1-2 hr if the patient is continuing to bleed briskly orhas deteriorating neurotoxic or cardiovascular signs. Blood transfusion should not be required if antivenom is given. Clotting function returns to normal only after clotting factors are produced by the liver. Responseof abnormal neurological signs to antivenom is more variable and depends ontype of venom. If there is no reponse to antivenom infusion this should be repeated. Anticholinesterases can reverse neurological signs in some species of snake (see standard textbooks of paediatrics for further details). Other treatment Surgical opinion Seek surgical opinion if there is severe swelling in a limb, it is pulseless or painful or there is local necrosis. Surgical care will include: \u2014Excision of dead tissue from wound \u2014Incision of fascial membranes to relieve pressure in limb compartments, if necessary \u2014Skin grafting, if extensive necrosis \u2014T racheostomy (or endotracheal intubation) if paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing occurs Supportive care Give fluids orally or by NG tube according to daily requirements (see page 273). Keep a close record of fluid intake and output. Provide adequate pain relief Elevate limb if swollen Give antitetanus prophylaxis Antibiotic treatment is not required unless there is tissue necrosis at wound siteSNAKE BITE341. ETATAvoid intramuscular injections Monitor very closely immediately after admission, then hourly for at least 24 hours as envenoming can develop rapidly. 1.7 Scorpion sting Scorpion stings can be very painful for days. Systemic effects of venom are much more common in children than adults. Diagnosis of envenoming Signs of envenoming can develop within minutes and are due to autonomicnervous system activation. They include: shock high or low BP fast and/or irregular pulse nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain breathing difficulty (due to heart failure) or respiratory failure muscle twitches and spasms. Check for low BP or raised BP and treat if signs of heart failure (see page 107). Treatment First aid Transport to hospital as soon as possible. Hospital care Antivenom If signs of severe envenoming give scorpion antivenom, if available (as above for snake antivenom infusion). Other treatment Treat heart failure, if present (see page 106) Consider use of prazosin if there is pulmonary oedema (see standard textbooks of paediatrics)SCORPION STING35 1. ETAT Supportive care Give oral paracetamol or oral or IM morphine according to severity. If very severe, infiltrate site with 1% lignocaine, without epinephrine. 1.8 Other sources of envenoming Follow the same principles of treatment, as above. Give antivenom, where available, if severe local or any systemic effects. In general, venomous spider bites can be painful but rarely result in systemic envenoming. Antivenom is available for some species such as widow andbanana spiders. Venomous fish can give very severe local pain but, again,systemic envenoming is rare. Box jellyfish stings are occasionally rapidly life-threatening. Apply vinegar on cotton wool to denature the protein in the skin.Adherent tentacles should be carefully removed. Rubbing the sting may causefurther discharge of venom. Antivenom may be available. The dose of antivenomto jellyfish and spiders should be determined by the amount of the venominjected. Higher doses are required for multiple bites, severe symptoms ordelayed presentation.OTHER SOURCES OF ENVENOMING361. ETATNotes37 2. DIAGNOSISCHAPTER 2 Diagnostic approach to the sick child 2.1 Relationship to the IMCI approach The pocket book is symptom-based in its approach, with the symptoms following the sequence of the IMCI guidelines: cough, diarrhoea, fever. Thediagnoses also closely match the IMCI classifications, except that the expertiseand investigative capabilities that are available in a hospital setting allowclassifications like \"very severe disease\" or \"very severe febrile disease\" to be defined more precisely, making possible such diagnoses as very severe pneumonia, severe malaria, and meningitis. Classifications for conditions suchas pneumonia and dehydration follow the same principles as the IMCI. Younginfants (up to 2 months) are considered separately (see Chapter 3), as in theIMCI approach, but the guidelines cover conditions arising at birth such asbirth asphyxia. The severely malnourished child is also considered separately(see Chapter 7), because these children require special attention and treatmentif the high mortality is to be reduced. 2.2 Taking the history Taking the history generally should start with the presenting complaint: Why did you bring the child? Then it progresses to the history of the present illness. The symptom-specific chapters give some guidance on specific questions which are important to askconcerning these specific symptoms, and which help in the differential diagnosisof the illness. This includes the personal history, family and social andenvironmental history. The latter might link to important counselling messagessuch as sleeping under a bednet for a child with malaria, breastfeeding orsanitary practices in a child with diarrhoea, or reducing exposure to indoor airpollution in a child with pneumonia.2.1 Relationship to the IMCI approach 37 2.2 Taking the history 372.3 Approach to the sick child 38 2.4 Laboratory investigations 39 2.5 Differential diagnoses 39382. DIAGNOSISAPPROACH TO THE SICK CHILD Especially for younger infants, the history of pregnancy and birth is very important. In the infant and younger child, feeding history becomes essential.The older the child, the more important is information of the milestones ofdevelopment and behaviour of the child. Whereas the history is obtained froma parent or caretaker in the younger child, an older child will contribute importantinformation. 2.3 Approach to the sick child and clinical examination All children must be examined fully so that no important sign will be missed. However, in contrast to the systematic approach in adults, the examination ofthe child needs to be organized in a way to upset the child as little as possible. Do not upset the child unnecessarily. Leave the child in the arms of the mother or carer. Observe as many signs as possible before touching the child. These include \u2014Is the child alert, interested and looking about? \u2014Does the child appear drowsy? \u2014Is the child irritable? \u2014Is the child vomiting? \u2014Is the child able to or breastfeed? \u2014Is the child cyanosed or pale? \u2014A re there signs of respiratory distress? Does the child use auxiliary muscles? Is there lower chest wall indrawing? Does the child appear to breath fast? Count the respiratory rate. These and other signs should all be looked for and recorded before the child is disturbed. You might ask the mother or caretaker to cautiously reveal part ofthe chest to look for lower chest wall indrawing or to count the respiratoryrate. If a child is distressed or crying, it might need to be left for a brief timewith its mother in order to settle, or the mother could be ask to breastfeed,before key signs such as respiratory rate can be measured. Then proceed to signs which require touching the child but are little disturbing, such as listening to the chest. You get little useful information if you listen tothe chest of a crying child. Therefore, signs that involve interfering with thechild, such as recording the temperature or testing for skin turgor, should bedone last.39 2. DIAGNOSIS2.4 Laboratory investigations Laboratory investigations are targeted based on the history and examination, and help narrow the differential diagnosis. The following basic laboratoryinvestigations should be available in all small hospitals which provide paediatriccare in developing countries: haemoglobin or packed cell volume (PCV) blood smear for malaria parasites blood glucose microscopy of CSF and urine blood grouping and cross-matching HIV testing. In the care of sick newborns (under 1 week old), blood bilirubin is also an essential investigation. Indications for these tests are outlined in the appropriate sections of this pocket book. Other investigations, such as pulse oximetry, chest X-ray, blood culturesand stool microscopy, can help in complicated cases. 2.5 Differential diagnoses After the assessment has been completed, consider the various conditions that could cause the child's illness and make a list of possible differentialdiagnoses. This helps to ensure that wrong assumptions are not made, a wrongdiagnosis is not chosen, and rare problems are not missed. Remember that asick child might have more than one diagnosis or clinical problem requiringtreatment. Section 1.4 and Tables 1-4 (pages 19-24) present the differential diagnoses for emergency conditions encountered during triage. Further tables ofsymptom-specific differential diagnoses for common problems are found atthe beginning of each chapter and give details of the symptoms, examinationfindings and results of laboratory investigations, which can be used to determinethe main diagnosis and any secondary diagnoses. After the main diagnosis and any secondary diagnoses or problems have been determined, treatment should be planned and started. Once again, if there ismore than one diagnosis or problem, the treatment recommendations for allof them may have to be taken together. It is necessary to review the list ofdifferential diagnoses again at a later stage after observing the response totreatment, or in the light of new clinical findings. The diagnosis might be revisedat this stage, or additional diagnoses included in the considerations.LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS402. DIAGNOSISNotes41 3.

YOUNG INFANTSThis chapter provides guidance for the management of problems in neonates and young infants from birth to 2 months of age. This includes neonatalresuscitation, the recognition and management of neonatal sepsis and otherbacterial infections, and the management of low and very low birth weight(VLBW) infants. Drug tables for commonly used drugs in neonates and younginfants are included at the end of this chapter, also providing dosages for lowbirth weight and premature babies. 3.1 Routine care of the newborn at delivery Most babies require only simple supportive care at and after delivery. Dry the baby with a clean towel. Observe baby (see chart 12) while drying. Give the baby to the mother as soon as possible, place on chest/abdomen. Cover the baby to prevent heat loss. Encourage initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour. Skin-to-skin contact and early breastfeeding are the best ways to keep a baby warm and prevent hypoglycaemia. 3.2 Neonatal resuscitation For some babies the need for resuscitation may be anticipated: those born to mothers with chronic illness, where the mother had a previous fetal or neonataldeath, a mother with pre-eclampsia, in multiple pregnancies, in preterm delivery,in abnormal presentation of the fetus, with a prolapsed cord, or where there isprolonged labour or rupture of membranes, or meconium-stained liquor. However, for many babies the need for resuscitation cannot be anticipated before delivery. Therefore, be prepared for resuscitation at every delivery, follow the assessment steps of chart 12.ROUTINE CARE OF THE NEWBORN AT DELIVERY43 3. YOUNG INFANTS Compress the chest (see figure on page 44)CHART 12. Neonatal resuscitation Dry the baby with clean cloth and place where the baby will be warm. Look for Breathing or crying Good muscle tone Colour pink Position the head of the baby in the neu- tral position to open the airway, Clear airway, if necessary Stimulate, reposition Give oxygen, as necessary Use a correctly fitting mask and give thebaby 5 slow ventilations with bag. Check position and mask fit Adjust position, if necessary Provide ventilation with bag and mask. If chest not moving well Suction airway Check the heart rate (HR) (cord pulsa- tion or by listening with stethoscope) Continue to bag at a rate of about 40breaths per minute. Make sure the chest is moving adequately. Use oxygen if available. Every 1-2 minutes stop and see if the pulse or breathing has improved. Stop compressions once the HR >100/min. Stop bagging when respiratory rate>30/min. Continue oxygen until pink and active.If HR <60/minCALL FOR HELP!Routine care (see 6.1) Routine care and observe closelyYES Breathing and pink Not breathing, cyanosed NO A B C30 SECONDS 30 SECONDS Observe closely BreathingIf not breathing If HR >60/min443.

Airway Suction airway\u2014if there is meconium stained fluid AND baby is NOT crying and moving limbs: \u2014Suck the mouth, nose and oropharynx, do not suck right down the throat as this can cause apneoa/bradycardia. B. Breathing Choosing mask size: Size 1 for normal weight baby, size 0 for small (less than 2.5 kg) baby Ventilation with bag and mask at 40-60 breaths/minute Make sure the chest moves up with each press on the bag and in a very small baby make sure the chest does not move too much. C. Circulation 90 compressions coordinated with 30 breaths/min (3 compressions: 1 breath every 2 seconds). Place thumbs just below the line connecting the nipples on the sternum (see below). Compress 1/3 the A-P diameter of the chest. Correct position of hands for cardiac massage in a neonate. The thumbs are used for compression over the sternum 45 3. YOUNG INFANTS Inadequate seal If you hear air escaping from the mask, form abetter seal. The mostcommon leak is betweenthe nose and the cheeks.

Neonatal resuscitation463. YOUNG INFANTS3.2.1 Cessation of resuscitation If after 20 minutes of resuscitation the baby is: Not breathing and pulse is absent: cease efforts. Explain to the mother that the baby has died, and give it to her to hold if she wishes. 3.3 Routine care for all newborn babies after delivery (and for neonates born outside and brought tothe hospital) Keep dry in a warm room away from drafts, well covered Keep the baby with the mother, rooming in Initiate breastfeeding within the first hour Let the baby breastfeed on demand if able to suck Give vitamin K (phytomenadione), according to national guidelines 1 ampoule (1 mg/0.5ml or 1 mg/ml) IM once(Do NOT use 10 mg/ml ampoule) Keep umbilical cord clean and dry Apply antiseptic ointment or antibiotic eye drops/ointment (e.g. tetracycline eye ointment) to both eyes once, according to national guidelines Give oral polio, hepatitis B and BCG vaccines, depending on national guidelines 3.4 Prevention of neonatal infections Many early neonatal infections can be prevented by: Good basic hygiene and cleanliness during delivery of the baby Special attention to cord care Eye care Many late neonatal infections are acquired in hospitals. These can be prevented by: Exclusive breastfeeding Strict procedures for hand washing for all staff and for families before and after handling babies Not using water for humidification in incubators (where Pseudomonas will easily colonize) or by avoiding incubators (using kangaroo mother careinstead).ROUTINE CARE FOR ALL NEWBORN BABIES AFTER DELIVERY47 3. YOUNG INFANTSStrict sterility for all procedures Clean injection practices Removing intravenous drips when they are no longer necessary Avoiding unnecessary blood transfusion 3.5 Management of the child with perinatal asphyxia May be the result of a lack of oxygen supply to organs before, during or immediately after birth. Initial treatment is effective resuscitation (see above). Problems in the days after birth: Convulsions : treat with phenobarbital (see page 49), check glucose. Apnoea : common after severe birth asphyxia. Sometimes associated with convulsions. Manage with oxygen by nasal catheter and resuscitation withbag and mask. Inability to suck : feed with milk via a nasogastric tube. Beware of delayed emptying of the stomach which may lead to regurgitation of feeds. Poor motor tone . May be floppy or have limb stiffening (spasticity). Prognosis : can be predicted by recovery of motor function and sucking ability. A baby who is normally active will usually do well. A baby who, a week afterbirth, is still floppy or spastic, unresponsive and cannot suck has a severebrain injury and will do poorly. The prognosis is less grim for babies who haverecovered some motor function and are beginning to suck. The situation shouldbe sensitively discussed with parents throughout the time the baby is in hospital. 3.6 Danger signs in newborns and young infants Neonates and young infants often present with non-specific symptoms and signs which indicate severe illness. These signs might be present at or afterdelivery, or in a newborn presenting to hospital, or develop during hospitaladmission. Initial management of the neonate presenting with these signs isaimed at stabilizing the child and preventing deterioration. Signs include: Unable to breastfeed Convulsions Drowsy or unconscious Respiratory rate less than 20/min or apnoea (cessation of breathing for >15 secs) Respiratory rate greater than 60/minPERINATAL ASPHYXIA483. YOUNG INFANTSGrunting Severe chest indrawing Central cyanosis EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT of danger signs: Give oxygen by nasal prongs or nasal catheter if the young infant is cyanosed or in severe respiratory distress. Give bag and mask ventilation (page 45), with oxygen (or room air if oxygen is not available) if respiratory rate too slow (<20). Give ampicillin (or penicillin) and gentamicin (see below). If drowsy, unconscious or convulsing, check blood glucose. If glucose <1.1 mmol/l (<20 mg/100 give glucose IV. If glucose 1.1-2.2 mmol/l (20-40 mg/100 ml), feed immediately and increase feeding frequency. If you cannot check blood glucose quickly, assume hypoglycaemia and give glucose IV. If you cannot insert an IV drip, give expressed breast milk orglucose through a nasogastric tube. Give phenobarbital if convulsing (see page 49). Admit, or refer urgently if treatment is not available at your hospital Give vitamin K (if not given before). Monitor the baby frequently (see below). 3.7 Serious bacterial infection Risk factors for serious bacterial infections are: Maternal fever (temperature >37.9 \u00b0C before delivery or during labour) Membranes ruptured more than 24 hours before delivery Foul smelling amniotic fluid All of the DANGER SIGNS are signs of serious bacterial infection, but there are others: Deep jaundice Severe abdominal distension Localizing signs of infection are: Painful joints, joint swelling, reduced movement, and irritability if these parts are handledSERIOUS BACTERIAL INFECTION49 3. YOUNG INFANTSMany or severe skin pustules Umbilical redness extending to the peri-umbilical skin orumbilicus draining pus. Bulging fontanelle (see below) Treatment Antibiotic therapy Admit to hospital Where blood cultures are available, obtain blood cultures before starting antibiotics For any of these signs, give ampicillin (or penicillin) and gentamicin (for dosages see pages 62-66) Give cloxacillin (if available) instead of penicillin if extensive skin pustules or abscesses as these might be signs of Staphylococcus infecton Most serious bacterial infections in neonates should be treated with antibiotics for at least 10 days If not improving in 2-3 days the antibiotic treatment may need to be changed, or the baby referred Other treatment Give all sick infants aged <2 weeks 1 mg of vitamin K (IM) Treat convulsions with IM phenobarbital (1 dose of 15 mg/kg). If needed, continue with phenobarbital 5 mg/kg once daily For management of pus draining from eyes, see page 59 If child is from malarious area and has fever, take blood film to check for malaria also. Neonatal malaria is very rare. If confirmed, treat with quinine(see page 140) For supportive care, see page 51 3.8 Meningitis Clinical signs Suspect if signs of serious bacterial infection are present, or any one of the following signs of meningitis.MENINGITIS Peri-umbilical flare in umbilical sepsis. The inflammation extends beyond the umbilicus to the abdominal wall.503. YOUNG INFANTSGeneral signs Drowsy, lethargic or unconscious Reduced feeding Irritable High pitched cry Apnoeic episodes More specific signs Convulsion Bulging fontanelle Do a lumbar puncture (LP) if you suspect meningitis, unless the baby is having apnoea or there is no motor response to stimuli. Treatment Antibiotics Give ampicillin and gentamicin or a third generation cephalosporin, such as ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg every 12 hours (might cause biliary sludge leadingto jaundice)) or cefotaxime (50 mg/kg every 6 hours) for 3 weeks. Alternative antibiotics are penicillin and gentamicin (see pages 65-66). Chloramphenicol is an alternative but should not be used in premature/lowweight neonates (see page 64). If there are signs of hypoxaemia, give oxygen (see page 52). Convulsions/fits Treat convulsions with phenobarbital (loading dose of 15 mg/kg). If convulsion persists, give further doses of 10 mg/kg phenobarbital up to aMENINGITIS Bulging fontanelle - sign of meningitis in young infants with an open fontanelle Normal fontanelle Bulging fontanelle 51 3. YOUNG INFANTSmaximum of 40 mg/kg (see page 49). Watch for apnoea. If needed, continue with phenobarbital at a maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg/day. Check forhypoglycaemia. 3.9 Supportive care for the sick neonate 3.9.1 Thermal environment Keep the young infant dry and well wrapped. A bonnet or cap is helpful to reduce heat loss. Keep the room warm (at least 25\u00b0C). Keeping the young infant in close skin-to-skin contact with the mother (\"kangaroo mother care\") for 24 hours a day is as effective as using anincubator or external heating device to avoid chilling. Pay special attention to avoid chilling the infant during examination or investigation. Regularly check that the infant's temperature is maintained in the range Encourage the mother to breastfeed frequently to prevent hypoglycaemia. If unable to feed, give expressed breast milk by nasogastric tube. Withhold oral feeding if there is bowel obstruction, necrotizing enterocolitis or the feeds are not tolerated, e.g. indicated by increasing abdominaldistension or vomiting everything. Withhold oral feeding in the acute phase in babies who are lethargic or unconscious, or having frequent convulsions. If IV fluids are given, reduce the IV fluid rates as the volume of milk feeds increases. Babies who are suckling well but need an IV drip for antibiotics should be on minimal IV fluids to avoid fluid overload, or flush cannula with 0.5 ml NaCl0.9% and cap. Increase the amount of fluid given over the first 3-5 days (total amount, oral and IV). Day 1 60 ml/kg/day Day 2 90 ml/kg/dayDay 3 120 ml/kg/dayThen increase to 150 ml/kg/day When babies are tolerating oral feeds well, this might be increased to 180 ml/ kg/day after some days. But be careful with parenteral fluids, which can quicklySUPPORTIVE CARE FOR THE SICK NEONATE523. YOUNG INFANTSoverhydrate a child. When giving IV fluids, do not exceed this volume unless the baby is dehydrated or under phototherapy or a radiant heater. This amountis the TOTAL fluid intake a baby needs and oral intake must be taken intoaccount when calculating IV rates. Give more fluid if under radiant heater (x 1.2-1.5) Do NOT use IV glucose and water (without sodium) AFTER the first 3 days of life. Babies over 3 days of age need some sodium (for example, 0.18% saline/5% glucose). Monitor the IV infusion very carefully. Use a monitoring sheet. Calculate drip rate Check drip rate and volume infused every hour W eigh baby daily W atch for facial swelling: if this occurs, reduce the IV fluid to minimal levels or take out the IV. Introduce milk feeding by nasogastric tube or breastfeedingas soon as it is safe to do so. 3.9.3 Oxygen therapy Give oxygen treatment to young infants with any of the following: central cyanosis grunting with every breath difficulty in feeding due to respiratory distress severe lower chest wall indrawing head nodding (i.e. a nodding movement of the head, synchronous with the respiration and indicating severe respiratory distress) Where a pulse oximeter is available, this should be used to guide oxygen therapy. Oxygen should be given if the oxygen saturation is below 90%,and the oxygen flow should be regulated to have a saturation between 92%and 95%. Oxygen can be discontinued once the child can maintain asaturation above 90% in room air. Nasal prongs are the preferred method for delivery of oxygen to this age group, with a flow rate of 0.5 litre per minute. Thick secretions from thethroat may be cleared by intermittent suction, if they are troublesome andthe young infant is too weak to clear them. Oxygen should be stopped whenthe infant's general condition improves and the above signs are no longerpresent.OXYGEN THERAPY53 3. YOUNG INFANTS3.9.4 High fever Do not use antipyretic agents such as paracetamol for controlling fever in young infants. Control the environment. If necessary, undress the child. 3.10 Babies with low birth weight 3.10.1 Babies with birth weight between 2.25 and 2.5 kg These babies are normally strong enough to start feeding themselves after delivery. They need to be kept warm and attention for infection control, butotherwise no special care. 3.10.2 Babies with birth weight between 1.75 and 2.25 kg Sometimes these babies need extra care, but can normally stay with their mothers to provide feeding and warmth, especially if skin-to skin contact canbe maintained. Feeding . Start feeds within 1 hour of delivery. Many of these babies will be able to suck.Babies who can suck should be breastfed.Those who cannot breastfeed should begiven expressed breast milk with a cupand spoon. When the baby is suckingwell from the breast and gainingweight, reduce the cup and spoonfeeds. See the babies at least twice a day to assess feeding ability, fluidintake, or presence of anyDANGER SIGNS (page 47) orsigns of serious bacterial infection(page 48). If any of these signs arepresent, they should be closelymonitored in the neonatal nursery in asimilar way to very low birth weightbabies (see below). The risk of keeping the child in hospital (e.g. acquiring nosocomialinfections), should be balanced withthe potential benefit of obtainingbetter care.HIGH FEVER Keeping a child warm: the child has skin contact with the mother, is wrapped in her clothes, and the head is covered to prevent heat loss.543. YOUNG INFANTSBABIES WITH BIRTH WEIGHT BELOW 1.75 KG 3.10.3 Babies with birth weight below 1.75 kg These babies are at risk of hypothermia, apnoea, hypoxaemia, sepsis, feed intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis. The risks increase the smaller thebaby is. All low birth weight babies should be admitted to the Special Care orNeonatal Unit. Treatment Give oxygen by nasal catheter or nasal prongs if any signs of hypoxaemia Temperature Nurse skin-to-skin between the mother's breasts, or clothed in a warm room, or in a humidicrib if the staff have experience in using them. A hot waterbottle wrapped in a towel can be useful for keeping the baby warm if nopower for heating is available. Aim for a core body temperature of 36-37 \u00b0C with the feet warm and pink. Fluids and feeds If possible give intravenous fluids at 60 ml/kg/day for the first day of life. Best to use a paediatric(100 ml) intravenous burette where 60 drops =1ml and therefore 1 drop per minut e=1m l per hour. If the baby is well and active, give 2-4ml of expressed breast milk every 2 hours through a nasogastric tube, depending onthe weight of the baby (see page 51). If very small babies are under a radiant heater or phototherapy they need morefluid than the \"usual maintenance\"volumes (see page 51), but great caremust be taken to accurately run theintravenous fluid as overhydration may befatal. If possible, check blood sugar every 6 hours until enteral feeds established,especially if baby is having apnoea,lethargy or convulsions. VLBW babiesmay need a 10% glucose solution. Add10 ml of 50% glucose to every 90 ml of4.3% glucose + 1/5 normal saline or usea 10% glucose in water solution. Position for kangaroo mother care of young infant. Note: after wrapping the child, the head needs to be covered with a cap or bonnet to prevent heat loss.55 3. YOUNG INFANTSStart feeding when the condition of the baby is stable (usually on the second day, might be possible in more mature babies on day 1). Start feeds if thereis no abdominal distension or tenderness, bowel sounds are present,meconium passed and no apnoea. Use a prescription chart. Calculate exact amounts for feeding and the timing of feeds. Increase on a daily basis if well tolerated. When commencing milk feeds, start with 2-4 ml every 1-2 hours by nasogastric tube. Some active VLBW babies can be fed with a cup and spoonor an eyedropper, which must be sterilized before each feed. Use onlyexpressed breast milk if possible. If 2-4 ml volume is tolerated with novomiting, abdominal distension, or gastric aspirates of more than half thefeed, the volume can be increased by 1-2 ml per feed each day. Reduce orwithhold feeds if signs of poor tolerance occur. Aim to have feedingestablished in the first 5-7 days so that the IV drip can be removed, toavoid infection. The feeds may be increased over the first 2 weeks of life to 150-180 ml/kg/ day (three-hourly feeds of 19-23 ml for a 1kg baby and 28-34 ml for a1.5 kg baby). As the baby grows, recalculate the feed volume based on thehigher weight. Antibiotics and sepsis Risk factors for sepsis are: babies born outside hospital or born to unwellmothers, rupture of membranes >24 hours, smaller babies (closer to 1 kg). Presence of any DANGER SIGNS (page 47) or other signs of serious bacterial infection (page 48). Initiate antibiotic treatment. Apnoea Caffeine citrate and aminophylline prevent apnoea in premature babies. Caffeine is preferred if it is available. The loading dose of caffeine citrate is20 mg/kg orally or IV (given slowly over 30 minutes). A maintenance doseshould be prescribed (see page 63). If caffeine is not available give a loading dose of aminophylline of 10 mg/kg orally or by intravenous injection over 15-30 minutes (see page 63). Amaintenance dose should be prescribed. If an apnoea monitor is available this should be used.BABIES WITH BIRTH WEIGHT BELOW 1.75 KG563. YOUNG INFANTSDischarge and follow-up of low birth weight babies Low birth weight babies can be discharged when: they have no DANGER signs or signs of serious infection they are gaining weight on breastfeeding alone they can maintain their temperature in the normal range (36-37 \u00b0C) in an open cot the mother is confident and able to take care. Low birth weight babies should be given all scheduled vaccines at the time of birth, and any second doses that are due by the time of discharge. Counselling on discharge Counsel parents before discharge on exclusive breastfeeding keeping the baby warm danger signs for seeking care Low birth weight babies should be followed up weekly for weighing, assessment of feeding, and general health until they have reached 2.5 kg. 3.11 Necrotizing enterocolitis Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC, a bowel infection) may occur in low birth weight babies, especially after enteral feeds are started. It is more common in lowbirth weight babies fed artificial formulae, but may occur in breastfed babies. Common signs of NEC are: Abdominal distension or tenderness Intolerance of feeding Bile-stained vomit or bile-stained fluid up the nasogastric tube Blood in the stools General signs of systemic upset include Apnoeas Drowsy or unconscious Fever or hypothermiaNECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS57 3. YOUNG INFANTSTreatment Stop enteral feeds. Pass a nasogastric tube and leave it on free drainage. Start an IV infusion of glucose/saline (see page 51 for rate of infusion). Start antibiotics: give ampicillin (or penicillin) plus gentamicin plus metronidazole (if available) for 10 days. If the baby has apnoea or other danger signs, give oxygen by nasal catheter. If apnoea continues give aminophylline or caffeine IV (see page 51). If the baby is pale, check the haemoglobin and transfuse if Hb<10 g/dL. Take a supine and lateral decubitus abdominal X-ray. If there is gas in the abdominal cavity outside the bowel there may be a bowel perforation. Ask asurgeon to see the baby urgently. Examine the baby carefully each day. Reintroduce expressed breast milk feeds by nasogastric tube when the abdomen is soft and not tender, the baby ispassing normal stools with no blood and is not having bilious vomiting. Startfeeds slowly and increase slowly by 1-2 ml per feed each day. 3.12 Other common neonatal problems 3.12.1 Jaundice More than 50% of normal newborns, and 80% of preterm infants, have some jaundice. Jaundice can be divided into abnormal or normal: Abnormal (non physiological) Jaundice started on the first day of life Jaundice lasting longer than 14 days in term, 21 days in preterm infants Jaundice with fever Deep jaundice: palms and soles of the baby deep yellow Normal (physiological) Skin and eyes yellow but none of the above Abnormal jaundice may be due to Serious bacterial infection Haemolytic disease due to blood group incompatibility or G6PD deficiency Congenital syphilis (page 60) or other intrauterine infectionJAUNDICE583. YOUNG INFANTSLiver disease such as hepatitis or biliary atresia Hypothyroidism Investigations for abnormal jaundice The clinical impression of jaundice should be confirmed by a bilirubin measurement, where possible. The investigations depend on the likely diagnosisand what tests are available, but may include: Haemoglobin or PCV Full blood count to look for signs of serious bacterial infection (high or low neutrophil count with >20% band forms), and to look for signs of haemolysis Blood type of baby and mother, and Coombs test Syphilis serology such as VDRL tests G6PD screen, thyroid function tests, liver ultrasound Treatment Phototherapy if Jaundice on day 1 Deep jaundice involving palms and soles of the feet Prematurity and jaundice Jaundice due to haemolysisJAUNDICE Treatment bilirubin level Phototherapy Exchange transfusiona Healthy Preterm or any Healthy Preterm or any term baby risk 260 13 220 Day 2 15 260 13 220 25 425 15 260 Day 3 18 310 16 270 30 510 20 340 Day 4 and thereafter 20 340 17 290 30 510 20 340 aExchange transfusion is not described in this pocket book. These serum bilirubin levels are included in case exchange transfusion is possible or in case the baby can be transferred quickly and safely to another facility where exchange transfusion can be performed. bRisk factors include small size (less than 2.5 kg at birth or born before 37 weeks gestation), haemolysis, and sepsis. cVisible jaundice anywhere on the body on day 1.59 3. YOUNG INFANTSCONJUNCTIVITIS Continue phototherapy until serum bilirubin level is lower than threshold range or until baby is well and there is no jaundice of palms and soles. If the bilirubin level is very elevated (see table) and you can safely do exchange transfusion, consider doing so. Antibiotics If suspected infection or syphilis (page 60), treat for serious bacterial infection (page 61) Antimalarials If fever is present and the baby is from a malarious area, check blood films for malaria parasites and give antimalarials, if positive Encourage breastfeeding 3.12.2 Conjunctivitis Sticky eyes and mild conjunctivitis Treat as outpatient Show the mother how to wash the eyes with water or breast milk and how to put eye ointment in the eyes. The mother must wash her hands beforeand after. Tell the mother to wash the eyes and put in eye ointment 4 times a day for 5 days Give the mother a tube of Tetracycline eye ointment OR Chloramphenicol eye ointment To treat the child. Review 48 hours after starting treatment, if not improving. Severe conjunctivitis (a lot of pus and/or swelling of the eyelids) is often due to gonococcal infection. Treat as inpatient as there is a risk of blindness and itneeds twice-daily review. Wash the eyes to clear as much pus as possible. Ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg up to total of 150 mg IM ONCE) OR Kanamycin (25 mg/kg up to total of 75 mg IM ONCE) according to national guidelines.603. YOUNG INFANTSALSO use as described above: Tetracycline eye ointment OR Chloramphenicol eye ointment Also treat the mother and her partner for STDs: amoxicillin,spectinomycin or ciprofloxacin (forgonorrhoea) and tetracycline (forChlamydia) to the STD control guidelines. 3.12.3 Congenital malformations See Chapter 9 (page 227) for: Cleft lip and palate Bowel obstruction Abdominal wall defects Meningomyelocele Congenital dislocation of the hip Talipes equinovarus (club foot) 3.13 Babies of mothers with infections 3.13.1 Congenital syphilis Clinical signs Often low birth weight Palms and soles: red rash, grey patches, blisters or skin peeling 'Snuffles': rhinitis with nasal obstruction which is highly infectious Abdominal distension due to big liver and spleen Jaundice Anaemia Some VLBW babies with syphilis have signs of severe sepsis with lethargy, respiratory distress, skin petechiae or other bleeding If you suspect syphilis, do VDRL test if possibleCONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS Ophthalmia Asymptomatic neonates born to VDRL or women should receive 50 000 units/kg of benzathine benzyl penicillin in a singleintramuscular dose. Symptomatic infants require treatment with: \u2014procaine benzyl penicillin 50 000 units/kg as a single dose daily for 10 days or \u2014benzyl penicillin 50 000 units/kg every 12 hours IM or IV for the first 7days of life and then every 8 hours for a further 3 days. Treat the mother and partner for syphilis and check for other sexually transmitted infections. 3.13.2 Baby of a mother with tuberculosis If the mother has active lung tuberculosis and was treated for less than two months before birth or was diagnosed with tuberculosis after birth : Reassure the mother that it is safe for her to breastfeed her baby; Do not give the tuberculosis vaccine (BCG) at birth; Give prophylactic isoniazid 5 mg/kg body weight by mouth once daily; At the age of six weeks, re-evaluate the baby, noting weight gain and taking an X-ray of the chest, if possible; If there are any findings suggestive of active disease , start full anti- tuberculosis treatment according to national guidelines; If the baby is doing well and tests are negative , continue prophylactic isoniazid to complete six months of treatment; Delay BCG vaccine until two weeks after treatment is completed. If BCG was already given , repeat BCG two weeks after the end of the isoniazid treatment. 3.13.3 Baby of a mother with HIV See Chapter 8 (page 199) for guidance.BABY OF MOTHER WITH TUBERCULOSISDrug doses of common drugs for neonates and low birth weight babiesWeight of baby in kg Dosage Form 1-<1.5kg 1.5-<2kg 2-<2.5kg 2.5-<3kg 3-<3.5kg IV over 250 mg/10 ml AMINOPHYLLINE IS NOT USUALLY 30 minutes Dilute loading dose0.6 ml 0.8 ml 1.0 ml USED FOR TERM BABIES WITH 10mg/kg, then to 5 ml with sterileAPNOEA water, give slowly ml 0.2 ml 2-4 of life 0.15- 0.25- 0.3- Oral: 4mg/kg/dose0.25 ml 0.3 ml 0.4 ml 12 hourly AmpicillinIM/IV: 50 mg/kg Vial 1.5- 2.5- every 12 hours with 1.3 ml sterile water0.6 ml 0.9 ml 1.2 ml 1.5 ml 2.0 ml 2.5 ml 3.0 ml (1st week of life) to give 250 mg/1.5 ml Every 8 hours(weeks 2-4 of life)DRUG DOSES OF COMMON DRUGS FOR NEONATES 623.

YOUNG INFANTSNotes 67 3. YOUNG INFANTS683. YOUNG INFANTSNotes69 4. COUGHCHAPTER 4 Cough or difficult breathing Cough and difficult breathing are common problems in young children. The causes range from a mild, self-limited illness to severe, life-threatening disease.This chapter provides guidelines for managing the most important conditionsthat cause cough, difficult breathing, or both in children aged 2 months to 5years. The differential diagnosis of these conditions is described in Chapter 2.Management of these problems in infants <2 months of age is described inChapter 3, and in severely malnourished children in Chapter 7. Most episodes of cough are due to the common cold, with each child having several episodes a year. The commonest severe illness presenting with coughor difficult breathing is pneumonia, which should be considered first in anydifferential diagnosis (Table 6, page 71). 4.1 Child presenting with cough History Pay particular attention to the following: cough \u2014duration in days \u2014paroxysms with whoops or vomiting or central cyanosis4.1 Child presenting with cough 69 4.2 Pneumonia 72 4.2.1 Very severe pneumonia 73 4.2.2 Severe pneumonia 78 4.2.3 Pneumonia (non-severe) 80 4.2.4 Pleural effusion and empyema 81 4.3 Cough or cold 82 4.4 Conditions presenting with wheeze 83 4.4.1 Bronchiolitis 854.4.2 Asthma 87 4.4.3 Wheeze with cough or cold 91 4.5 Conditions presenting with stridor 91 4.5.1 Viral croup 92 4.5.2 Diphtheria 94 4.6 Conditions presenting with chronic cough 96 4.7 Pertussis 98 4.8 Tuberculosis 101 4.9 Foreign body inhalation 104 4.10 Heart failure 106704.

Most serious episodes are caused by bacteria. It is usually not possible, however, to determine thespecific cause by clinical features or chest X-ray appearance. Pneumonia isclassified as very severe, severe or non-severe, based on the clinical features,with specific treatment for each of them. Antibiotic therapy is needed in allcases. Severe and very severe pneumonia require additional treatment, suchas oxygen, to be given in hospital. Table 7.

In addition, some or all of the other signs of pneumonia or severe pneumonia may be present, such as: infants) \u2014lower chest wall indrawing (lower chest wall goes in when the child breathes in; if only the soft tissue between the ribs or above the claviclegoes in when the child breathes, this is not lower chest wall indrawing) \u2014chest auscultation signs of pneumonia: \u2014decreased breath sounds \u2014bronchial \u2014crackles \u2014abnormal vocal resonance (decreased over a pleural effusion, increased over lobar consolidation) \u2014pleural rub.744. COUGH If pulse oximetry is available, obtain an oxygen saturation measurement in all children suspected to have severe or very severe pneumonia If possible, obtain a chest X-ray to identify pleural effusion, empyema, pneumothorax, pneumatocoele, interstitial pneumonia and pericardialeffusion. Treatment Admit the child to hospital. Antibiotic therapy Give ampicillin (50 mg/kg IM every 6 hours) and gentamicin (7.5 mg/kg IM once a day) for 5 days; then, if child responds well, complete treatment athome or in hospital with oral amoxicillin (15 mg/kg three times a day) plusIM gentamicin once daily for a further 5 days.VERY SEVERE PNEUMONIA Nasal flaring: with inspiration, the side of the nostrils flares outwards Lower chest wall indrawing: with inspiration, the lower chest wall moves in breathing out in out in breathing 75 4. COUGHAlternatively, give chloramphenicol (25 mg/kg IM or IV every 8 hours) until the child has improved. Then continue orally 4 times a day for a total courseof 10 days. Or use ceftriaxone (80 mg/kg IM or IV once daily). If the child does not improve within 48 hours, switch to gentamicin (7.5 mg/kg IM once a day) and cloxacillin (50 mg/kg IM or IV every 6 hours), as described below for staphylococcal pneumonia. When the child improves,continue cloxacillin (or dicloxacillin) orally 4 times a day for a total courseof 3 weeks. Oxygen therapy Give oxygen to all children with very severe pneumonia Where pulse oximetry is available, use this to guide oxygen therapy (give to children with oxygen saturation less than 90%, where there is sufficientoxygen available) Use nasal prongs, a nasal catheter, or a nasopharyngeal catheter. Use of nasal prongs is the best method for delivering oxygen to young infants. Face masks or head masks are not recommended. Oxygen suppliesneed to be available continuously at all times. A comparison of the differentmethods of oxygen administration and diagrams showing their use is givenin section 10.7, page 281. Continue with oxygen until the signs of hypoxia (such as severe lower chest wall indrawing or breathing rate of 70/minute) are no longer present. Where pulse oximetry is available, carry out a trial period without oxygen each day in stable children. Discontinue oxygen if the saturation remainsstable above 90%. There is no value in giving oxygen after this time. Nurses should check every 3 hours that the catheter or prongs are not blocked with mucus and are in the correct place and that all connections are secure. The two main sources of oxygen are cylinders and oxygen concentrators. It is important that all equipment is checked for compatibility and properlymaintained, and that staff are instructed in their correct use. Supportive care If the child has fever ( 39 \u00b0C or 102.2 \u00b0F) which appears to be causing distress, give paracetamol. If wheeze is present, give a rapid-acting bronchodilator (see page 88). Remove by gentle suction any thick secretions in the throat, which the child cannot clear.VERY SEVERE PNEUMONIA764. COUGHEnsure that the child receives daily maintenance fluids appropriate for the child's age (see section 10.2, page 273), but avoid overhydration. \u2014Encourage breastfeeding and oral fluids. \u2014If the child cannot drink, insert a nasogastric tube and give maintenance fluids in frequent small amounts. If the child is taking fluids adequately by mouth, do not use a nasogastric tube as it increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia . If oxygen is given at the same time as nasogastric fluids, pass both tubes through the same nostril. Encourage the child to eat as soon as food can be taken. Monitoring The child should be checked by nurses at least every 3 hours and by a doctor at least twice a day. In the absence of complications, within two days thereshould be signs of improvement (breathing not so fast, less indrawing of thelower chest wall, less fever, and improved ability to eat and drink). Complications If the child has not improved after two days, or if the child's condition has worsened, look for complications or other diagnoses. If possible, obtain achest X-ray. The most common complications are given below. Staphylococcal pneumonia . This is suggested if there is rapid clinical deterioration despite treatment, by a pneumatocoele or pneumothorax witheffusion on chest X-ray, numerous Gram-positive cocci in a smear of sputum,or heavy growth of S. aureus in cultured sputum or empyema fluid. The presence of septic skin pustules supports the diagnosis. Treat with cloxacillin (50 mg/kg IM or IV every 6 hours) and gentamicin (7.5 mg/kg IM or IV once a day). When the child improves, continue cloxacillin orally 4 times a day for a total course of 3 weeks. Note thatcloxacillin can be substituted by another anti-staphylococcal antibiotic suchas oxacillin, flucloxacillin, or dicloxacillin. Empyema . This is suggested by persistent fever, and physical and chest X-ray signs of pleural effusion. Diagnosis and management are described in section 4.1.4, page 81. Tuberculosis . A child with persistent fever for more than 2 weeks and signs of pneumonia should be evaluated for tuberculosis. If another cause of the fevercannot be found, tuberculosis should be considered and treatment fortuberculosis, following national guidelines, may be initiated and response toanti-Tb treatment evaluated (see section 4.8, page 101).VERY SEVERE PNEUMONIA77 4.

The right lung (left side of the illustration) is collapsed towards the hilus, leaving a transparent margin around it without lung structure. In contrast, the right side (normal) demonstrates markings extending to the periphery (X-ray). Hyperinflated chest. Features are an increased transverse diameter, ribs running more horizontally, a small contour of the heart, and flattened diaphragms (X-ray). 784. COUGHChildren who are HIV positive or in whom HIV is suspected . Some aspects of antibiotic treatment are different in children who are HIV positive or in whom HIVis suspected. Although the pneumonia in many of these children has the sameaetiology as in children without HIV, PCP , often at the age of 4-6 months (seepage 217) is an important additional cause which must be treated when present. Give ampicillin plus gentamicin for 10 days, as above If the child does not improve within 48 hours, a switch to ceftriaxone (80 mg/ kg IV once daily over 30 minutes) if available. If it is not available, givegentamicin plus cloxacillin, as above. Also give high-dose cotrimoxazole (8 mg/kg of trimethoprim and 40 mg/kg of sulfamethoxazole IV every 8 hours or orally 3 times a day) for 3 weeks. For the further management of the child, including PCP prophylaxis (see HIV Chapter, page 199). 4.2.2 Severe pneumonia Diagnosis Cough or difficult breathing plus at least one of the following signs: lower chest wall indrawing nasal flaring grunting (in young infants). Check that there are no signs of very severe pneumonia, such as: \u2014central cyanosis \u2014inability to lethargy or unconsciousness \u2014severe respiratory distress. In addition, some or all of the other signs of pneumonia may also be present: fast breathing: \u2014bronchial breath sounds \u2014crackles \u2014abnormal vocal resonance (decreased over lobar consolidation) \u2014pleural rub.SEVERE PNEUMONIA79 4. COUGHA routine chest X-ray rarely gives information which will change the manage- ment of severe pneumonia and is therefore not recommended. Treatment Admit or refer the child to hospital. Antibiotic therapy Give benzylpenicillin (50 000 units/kg IM or IV every 6 hours) for at least 3days. When the child improves, switch to oral amoxicillin (25 mg/kg 2 times a day). The total course of treatment is 5 days. If the child does not improve within 48 hours, or deteriorates, look for complications and treat accordingly (see above, as described for very severepneumonia, page 58, and below for suspected HIV). If there are no apparentcomplications, switch to chloramphenicol (25 mg/kg every 8 hours IM orIV) until the child has improved. Then continue orally for a total course of10 days. Oxygen therapy If readily available, give oxygen to any child with severe lower chest wall indrawing or a respiratory rate of 70/minute. See section 10.7 (page 281). Supportive care See above (page 75), as described for very severe pneumonia. Monitoring The child should be checked by nurses at least every 6 hours and by a doctor at least once a day. Record the respiratory rate and temperature, and note thechild's level of consciousness and ability to drink or breastfeed. In the absenceof complications, within two days there should be signs of improvement (slowerbreathing, less chest indrawing, less fever, and improved ability to eat anddrink). Complications Children who are HIV positive or in whom HIV is suspected Give ampicillin plus gentamicin for 10 days, as for very severe pneumonia If the child does not improve within 48 hours, switch to ceftriaxone (80 mg/kg IV once daily over 30 minutes) if available. If it is not availablegive gentamicin plus cloxacillin, as for very severe pneumonia.SEVERE PNEUMONIA "}
