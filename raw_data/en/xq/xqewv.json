Actually, the true challenge of complementary medicine has little to do with whether a philosophy can be tested or not. The real challenge concerns how such therapeutic approaches can be assessed while acknowledging that they do indeed conflict with many notions which science holds dear, such as reductionism and the totality of grouped averages. Such factors may be irrelevant to the medical treatment of individuals. Many holistic therapists do plainly not accept these parameters of so-called science, because they stand in conflict with core aspects of a distinctive paradigm of health. As Mason et al say, \"many practitioners argue that research methods dissect their practice in a reductionist manner and fail to take into account complementary medicine's holistic nature.\" [2] The broad inapplicability of such a simplistic reductionist approach is specifically mentioned in this article as NOT a road forwards. Yet, Dr Hall continues, \"if proponents of complementary medicine want to be scientific, they should be able to follow the same rules of scientific experimentation that everyone else follows; if they want to believe that there is something more,\" they should call it philosophy and not attempt to test it.\"[1] Again, lamentably, the writer has not absorbed the main thrust of the article - the rules are not the same because of a fundamental incompatibility in the parameters of these two disciplines. As Mason et al insist: \"Complementary medicine has a different philosophy from conventional medicine.\" [2] CAM strives to initiate and coordinate \"a process of self healing within a holistic view of health,\" [2] \"as well as promoting wellness,\" [2] which involves being \"tailored to the individual.\" The poet Auden, himself a doctor's son, said: \"healing, Papa would tell me, is not a science but the intuitive art of wooing Nature.\" [3]. Doctors, he insisted, should not \"insult me with soothing fictions,\" [3] nor \"atom-bomb your sick and over-kill it,\" [3] but should aspire to \"what all doctors should be but few are,\" [3] for \"every sickness is a musical problem...and every cure a musical solution.\" [3] Plainly, this does not involve \"a standard regimen, defined in a protocol [or]...exactly the same treatment.\" [2] Therefore, to insist that the 'rules of science' must apply to all other fields of knowledge amounts, at the very least, to a gross \"misrepresentation of the holistic essence of complementary medicine.\" [2] Nor does complementary medicine \"want to be scientific\"; indeed such is a tautology - the two are broadly incompatible systems - one dominated by reductionism and the other by a phenomenological approach to reality. Problems adhere to each method - reductionism solely invokes representations of the world as [periodically revised] models of reality, valid so far as they go; phenomenology claims to be only interested in the world as it is in all its deep and wide holistic reality. Holism is not and never can be described through reductionism. This much is axiomatic, pivotal and so blindingly obvious. While Mason et al say that \"holism, which is central to the philosophy and practice of much complementary medicine, needs to be better understood, \" [2] yet, it is very apparent that many medical practitioners have a very shallow grasp of what holism is. They prefer instead to view sickness solely at surface level. Wholes cannot be treated via the route of parts, for, to believe such would be like regarding apples as oranges. Chemical reactions, no matter how complex, are NOT living processes; they are at best only an analogue of them - representations, rather than the world as it is. Likewise, the grouped averages of pooled data from 'clinical trials' are too blunt a weapon for consideration of the treatment not of 'disease entities' [so-called] but of individual people. All this is plainly self- evident to those people who have actually studied these subjects, and for those who clearly have not, silence might be a more dignified response - or at least genuinely detached interest. People like Dr Hall probably believe that as for \"its founders modern science was a divine and changeless knowledge,\" [5] rather than that it is \"a merely historicized secular knowledge, human and variable, changing in response to private or public interests such as many contemporaries hold.\" [5] The situation is probably far worse than many scientists imagine - scientific knowledge is more like \"a function of the context in which it is considered and that the context may be likened to the historical shelf of books within which a coherent meaning for the text is sought.\" [5] It is also apparent that much that passes for 'scientific knowledge' is arrived at by \"shelving books differently to stimulate new theoretical positions,\" [5] that is by looking at things with a different theory in mind. A major problem is that facts do not exist in isolation from human knowledge; indeed, they tend to be \"functions of human culture.\" [5] On this basis, scientific knowledge is neither detached nor objective, but a time-bound function of human culture and \"internally \"scripted,\" or better, \"programmed\" in anticipation of what is to be constituted by its action in the world when the conditions are right.\" [5] It is also \"\"dressed\" for a community that is local, historical, economic, religious, and political,\" [5] and should more realistically be viewed \"in a moral and political context, laden with conflicting values and clashes of power.\" [5] As Heelan insists: \"theory is not the culmination of science, because theory does not disclose worldly horizons without the social-historical- instrumental context of the laboratory...data gathering is not its culmination, because data are not self-disclosing...the terminal output of scientific research...is by contrast the disclosure of new horizons of experiential Being.\" [5] Presumably, medical practitioners like Dr Hall will either claim this is all gobbledygook, or fail to see the true nature of the 'science' they love. The upshot simply is that to cling doggedly on to the now-eclipsed modernist view that science is absolute and objective knowledge universally valid in all times and places, is simply not an option in this century. Einstein's theory of scientific knowledge progressing solely through the funerals of scientists themselves, though relevant here, is merely an amusing attempt to denote their dogmatism. Arguably, they need to consider, \"that illness has a corrective purpose, showing the underlying disharmony in people's lives,\" [2] and that CAM attempts to \"tackle the underlying cause for example, by releasing suppressed anger, forgiving, or reducing stress by changing job or being more accepting of circumstances.\" [2] These healing modalities also indicate \"how to improve the healing process,\"[2] and insist \"human experience should be retained as central (not marginalised, as often occurs in reductionist methods).\" [2] They do indeed \"woo Nature,\" as Auden's father maintained. Unlike allopathy, they do not attack the chemical and physical components of the body machine, to bring about therapeutic effects - what Auden refers to as 'atom-bombing the pituitary' - but gently induce whole change within the entire organism. How on earth can reductionist trials measure that? Health is not the simplistic issue it was once supposed to be. As Mason et al propose: \"researchers need to tackle the complex issues in researching complementary medicine. Studies should be designed to enable a valid evaluation of complementary medicine.\" [2] \"Research into complementary medicine has a challenge not to miss the \"more\"...\" [2] I'm afraid these quotes pretty clearly demonstrate that medical practitioners like Harriet Hall refuse to \"see the more,\" and therefore fail to grasp the essence of the article. I'm afraid her letter is largely founded upon a \"misrepresentation of the holistic essence of complementary medicine,\" [2] a denial of its relevance to medicine and the more central role its health paradigm deserves. A relevance that might well go under-appreciated by some medical practitioners, but which patients increasingly value. In any case, if Dr Hall chooses to believe science is just empiricism, then she should think again; science is also a philosophy in its own right, and no 'fact' stands entirely naked of its tightly adherent body of theory. As Berlin states, \"the concept of fact is itself problematic...all facts embody theories...or socially conditioned, ideological attitudes.\" [4] And who would be bold enough to claim that any particular 'socially conditioned attitude' - no matter how dominant in one historical epoch - is valid for all people, at all times and in all places? In which case, then 'science' stands like some hard-faced bully barring the door to any progress, and more closely resembles the attitude of the Church than \"Galileo, the father of modern mathematical- experimental science..[who] denied other sources for science than [sola] Natura, and he insisted on the foundational value of exemplary experience, i.e., of \"well-chosen experiment.\" [5].
