This Racial Equity Action Plan represents our robust and ongoing commitment to improve the health of our community, the way we deliver services, and the experience of our own staff. We have made progress, and we still have a long way togo. As public health and health care professionals, we see firsthand the unacceptable, unconscionable disparities in San Francisco that lead to poor health outcomes for our patients and in the communities we serve. We have worked hard to, for example, reduce hypertension and premature birth rates for Black/African -American residents.Our workforce is not immune to the impact of these disparities. This Racial Equity Action Plan outlines our continuing and resolute effort to eliminate the racism that our own staff experience. Over the last five years, with equity as a departmental priority, SFDPH has focused on adding leadership and processes to advance equity in clinical care and services, and has seen some success. For example, we have more than 700 leaders who have taken an intensive, 32-hour cultural humility class, and expect them to be key resources for us all as we implement the goals in this plan. Additional current and future efforts are outlined in this document. Over the next three years, we will hold ourselves accountable to this work, including strengthening our human resources policies so that we improvediversity and inclusion in our staff, and on realizing an inclusive, antiracist workplace culture. The plan is living document, and will be modified and updated as we refine ourefforts. The COVID- 19 pandemic makes the first of these three years somewhat difficult to predict, but I am confident that we will adapt and continue to make progress. We are resourceful and resilient, and our commitment to the actions outlined in this plan is unshakable.

This includes changes in the Department Director, Human Resource Director , Communications Director, Behavioral Health Director, Chief Information Officer, and SFHN Chief Medical Officer. These changes have not disrupted PHD and SFHN services but have impacted the pace of struct ural changes in the organization such as prog ress on equity issues. In the last 3 years, the San Francisco Health Department (SFDPH) has focused on building infrastructure to support the advancement of equity. This includes dedicated staffing, funding , teams, and processes across the department, all working on goals for both health equity and workforce equity. Equity leaders and senior leadership from all areas of the SFDPH have collaborated to create interna l annua l equit y action plans over the last several years - including goals for community healt h outcomes, funding, progr amming, and internal work force equity improvements. The process for the dev elopment of this Racial Equity Act ion Plan (REAP) was s upported by the departm ent's current equity infrastructure and built on ex isting plans. Since the SFDPH employs over 8,000 staff and much of the REAP temp late invol ves work force-r elated items, the primary new work needed for the SFDPH REAP falls mainly within the r esponsibility of the department's Human Resources (HR) dep artment. While other areas in the SFDPH, especially ZSFG and LHH, have achieved measurable progress in developing equity processes, the HR department had not yet developed significant inter nal equity resources, prior to the REAP development process. This lag in equity progress may be related to the transition in HR leadership in the fall of 2019 and the HR focus on decreasing hiring times for necessary medical staff during the last year. One major SFDPH equity goal for fiscal year 2019-2 0, set forth in the SFDPH Equity Plan for the year, was to have each section of the SFDPH establish a designated Equity Lead, an Equity Team or Council, and an annual Equity Action Plan. This goal was met by the majority of the department: ZSFG, Laguna Honda, Jail Health and Population Health fully met the goa l in FY 19-20. Behavioral Hea lth and Primar y Care made sig nificant strides and should be fully comple ted in 2020. The central administrative sections - IT, Finance, Human Resources - missed part of the goal in one or another area. This meant that the Human Resources area had not yet established an equity council, equity lead , or established plan that could sup port the deve lopment of the REAP. Fortunately, with the structural goals well established during the REAP development process, the HR equity infrastru cture was quickly defined. Leadership from all areas of HR formed the council and a Government A lliance on Racial Equity (GARE) trained mem ber of t he People Development Team served as the Equity Lead. These positions will continue going forward, giving HR the internal support needed to implement the plans laid out in this document. The newly formed HR Equit y Team met regularly over the summer to assess which of the REAP actions and indicators might already be in place, which could easily be launched, and which would require significant policy or practice change. From this list, the team defined gaps and assigned the most closely associat ed HR unit leader to develop a prop osal for action. Thos e prop osals were evaluated and finaliz ed by the team , and then given to the Office of Health Equity (OHE) to evaluate. 6 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANThe Office of Health Equity staff then requested input from the Equity Leads for the major divisions. These leaders contribute d curren t or plann ed activities that fit the areas in question and proposed priorities and timelin es for the listed activities. Each lead is the owner of the equity plan for their area, all of which involve improvements that impact workforce equity, but also health disparities and community programs. Each Lead also works with an equity council or team that have contr ibuted to their past annua l equity plans, and helped review and contribute to the REAP. 4. The pla n was reviewed by department leadership - both divisional and executive - during the first two weeks of December. This was done through consultation with their area Equity Leads and teams, as well as at the Equity Governin g Council (EGC) meeting for December. The EGC includes the executive leader of every major section or division. The EGC meets every oth er month (except March-N ovember 2020 due to COVID-19 disruptions) and reviews the S FDPH equity plan. Input from all of these groups was integrated into the report and it was submitted to the Health Commission for final review at its December 15, 2020 meeting. This meeting also gave the p ublic an opportunity to review and c omment on the plan. It is important to note the impact of the COVID-1 9 pandemic on all aspects of the SFDPH since January, 2020, including the department's planning process in developing the REAP. A significant proportion of the workforce is or has been deployed and much of the department's focus and resources has been devoted to COVID-19 prevention and response efforts. In additio n, all but one staff member from the SFDPH Office of Health Equity has been deployed during the pandemic. Consequently , the REAP process has lacked elements usually present in the Equity planning process, especially multiple opportunities for staff to give input on the activities and priorities. This plan would norma lly have sta rted with st aff, through the Depart ment -level Equity Leadership Team or through ideas generated by Equity Champions (both are generally front-l ine staff or managers). It is fortunate that the SFDPH had engaged in equity plann ing for severa l years prior to the developed of the REAP. The depa rtment has therefore been able to utilize input from SFDPH staff given over the last 3 years, in Board of Supervisor/Health Com mission hearings, and through our past planning processes, in the development of this plan. Although our ideal process would have included multiple rounds of input from the Equity Governing Council and the Executive Team, our department's current necessary focus on the pandemic prevented this from occurring. However, the Equity Govern ing Council and Executive team s have contributed feedback. We move forward confiden t that the REAP goals and activities in year one reflect the department's shared vision across its divisions. As the REAP is a living document, the SFDPH will continue to work together to ensure goals and activities for years two and three will be r efined to reflect the evol ving needs of the department. 7 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANDepartment Background The mission of the San Francis co Health Department (SFDPH) is protecting and promoting health and well-b eing for all in San Francisco. The SFDPH is an integrated health department with two primary roles and two major divisions to fulfill its mission: 1.The P opulation Health Div ision (PHD) is r esponsi ble for the health of the populati on. PHD addresses public health conc erns, including consumer safety, health promotion, and pr evention, and the monitoring of threats to public health. PHD implements traditional and innovative publ ic health interventions. PHD staff ins pect restaurants, promo te improved air and water quality, tracks communi cable disease, and educates San Franciscans on health issues such as tobacco and substance use. PHD staff also promote ped estrian safety, participat e in an ambitious campaign to eliminate new HIV infections, and provi des technical assistance to nei ghborhood corner stores to increase healt hy food options for residents. PHD contribut es to t he health of SFDPH's patient through provisio n of population health date and data analysis to the Sa n Franc isco Healt h Network. 2.The San Francisco Health Network (SFHN) provides direct health to over 100,000 in dividuals per year, regardless of health in surance status. Th e SFHN includes neighborhood health clinics, t wo hospitals , including Zuckerberg Sa n Francisc o Ge neral Hos pital and Laguna Honda Hosp ital and Rehabilitation Center, behavioral health services, Maternal, Child, an d Adolescent Healt h, and Jail He alth Service s. 3.The SFDPH Central Administration includes Finance, Human reso urces, Office of Health Equity, information technol ogy, Security, Complia nce and Privacy, Lean Change Management, and the Office o f Policy and Planning, which all support the work of SFDPH's two divisions and promote integration. The mission of the Department of Publ ic Health is only achieved when the health and well-b eing of marginalized communi ties are brought up to the standards enjo yed by more privileged groups in San Francisco. The disparities we see are longsta nding and eliminating them will r equire radical chang e in the public health and healthcare services. Equity is an increasingl y centr al concern in both the public h ealth an d healthc are delivery fields. Decades o f research have established cl early that unequal social conditions play a large role in hea lth (also know n as the soc ial determinants of health ); a commu nity faced with socioeconomic disparities will also have health dispariti es. We see this real ity very c learly in the poor health of the Black, ind igenous and peop le of color (BIPOC) liv ing in San Francisco. The ultimate disparity, premature death, starkly illustrates th e severity of that gap. Life expectancy fo r Black/African Americans is the lowest of all races /ethnicities in San Francisco, followed closely by Pacific Islander. Based on data from 2013, a B/A A man in San Francis co could expe ct to liv e 71 years, nearly 10 years less than White , Asian, or Lati no man living he re wh o can expect to live into his 80s. On the other end o f the life-c ourse, Black/African American infants are five times m ore likely than White infants to di e before th eir first birthday. Hea lth equity was the initial focus of SFD PH efforts to address racism. 8 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANIn 2014, a SFDPH cross-d ivisional committee conv ened and established t he Blac k/Afri can Ame rican Health Initiative (BAA HI) both in the health of Sa n Francisco Black/African American resident s, their exp erience wit h SFDP H services, and in the work experience o f our Black/African American staff. The programs and change s implemented fro m BA AHI have been f ollowed in some areas of improvement in the health f or Black/ African Americ an residents. These improvements range from reduced hypertension rates, redu ced premature birth rates, reducing Hepatitis C rates, and im proving retention in HIV care. These nasc ent gains in the health of B/AA residents have not been matched by improvements in workforce equ ity. This is not due to a lack of acknowledgment of the problem. It was deci ded early on that B AAH I could not be effective by f ocusi ng only o n medica l conditi ons. Health equi ty researchers have well established that racial health disparities are in part due to inequities in the qualit y of healthcare d eliver ed to racial mino rities. Th ose differences in care have been correlated with the level of bias among healthcar e staff (explicit or implicit), and with policies and practices that have inequitable impacts on B/AA pa tients . These disparities will begin to shift whe n the healthcare and public health communities make different choices about how to deliver services and allocate reso urces in ways tha t advance equity. BAAH I was the beginning of an effort for SFDPH staff and leadership to become educated and engaged in making these changes. The biases that can impact pati ents can also impact staff. These biases may influence the way in which staff a re treated, opportuni ties for advan cement, and overall experience at work. Di sparities in hiring in management classes results in the experie nces and perspect ives of BIPOC staff mem bers being absent when policy decision are made . Additionally, there is a large gap in average salary and position of m ultiple minority groups and white and Asian employe es in aggregate. In 2018, the Board of Supervisors held two hearings on discrimination against Black/African America n employees, at which many SFDPH e mployees were present and shared s tories of dis parate treatme nt across many of the areas highlighted below. At these hear ings, and a follow -up hearing in 2019 , Black employees and allies identified shared expe riences of over-e nforceme nt of rules, lack of access to oppo rtunity and generally negative experiences across all city age ncies. As a result, Ma yor Lo ndon Breed issued a Directive which charged all departments with analyzing data on discipline and termination that would enable departm ents to highlight racial disparities within t he workfo rce. The results, produced in early 2019, presented disparities in the frequency and seve rity of dis ciplinary ac tions Isla nders SFDPH employees (and all BIPOC staff to some degree) com pared to white and Asian staff. Eliminating these workforce disparities mea ns committing to sustained, systemic change. SFDPH utilizes the Government Alliance on Race and E quity (GARE) Framework which highl ights three main stag es in the advancement of racial equity in an organizatio n: No rmali ze, Org anize, and Ope rationa lize. The normalizing stage has t he goal of making equity a visible and prio ritized part of normal wo rk. Including equity amo ng the Department's s even key priorities, our True North, has elevated equity in Departme nt planning and decision making. No rmaliz ing must also involv e increas ed knowledge and communication skills for staff regarding racism and equity. Over the last 5 years, SFDPH training and Human Resour ces staff have developed and deployed multiple trainings on identifying and eliminat ing interpersonal and ins titutional racism. Resources have been dedicated to staff education about the impact o f bias and inequitable policy on hiring and disciplinary decisions. SFDPH deplo yed an equity training program with the Human R ights Commission to t rain staff in foundational in formation. Raci al equity defi nitions and princ iples are also included in an added day of orienta tion. Questions were added to the 2019 staff engage ment survey to g auge the baseline level of normalization of these issues for staff , and staff awarene ss of current efforts. Ther e is st ill work to do on this as evidenced by the survey resul ts, referenced in the next section. Normalizi ng racial equity is key t o creating the shared understanding and purpose needed to succeed in the Org anize and Ope rationalize stages of the GARE framework. 9 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANIn parallel with nor malizing, SFDPH has focused in the last 2 years on the O rganizing stag e of the GARE framework. The orga nizing stage refers to the Department's equity infra structure, including lea dership, staffing, data and resources. Managers and director positions wi th equity-s pecific roles hav e been added in each major area to supp ort local equity efforts. These Equity Leads deploy and monitor programs and c raft policy rec omme ndations. SFDPH formed the Office of Health Equit y in 2019 to assure that these resources are used ef ficiently and in alignme nt. The intro duction of staff focused on equity brings the risk that other part s of the department will assume they don' t have a ro le in the changes that nee d to be ma de. To com bat th is danger, SFDPH has set th e expectation that all senior leaders take active respo nsibility for a dvancing eq uity. All executive leaders ( those reporting to the Director, Deputy Director or Chief of Operations ) participate in the Equity Governing Council. The Counci l set the prio rities for equity initiatives, dev elops strategies, and approves policies. For managers and line staff , the formal roles introduced have been heavily weighted toward lear ning an d development. Staff have mu ltiple opportunities to participate in advanci ng equity; over 80 staf f have been applied and been accepted as Equity Champion in their area (a year-l ong commitment), dozens of staff si t on the E quity Leadership Team that advises the equ ity counci ls or teams across the department. Lastly, the operationali ze stage targets policy, pra ctice and pr ocess change. Operat ionalizing equity in our cli nical services has focused on B/AA health, reflecting the stark severity of the heal th disparities in this co mmunity. The changes t o policy and practice have incl uded: B/AA health targets in the quality goals in all a reas, designing health p rograms with B/AA staff and c ommunity guidance, and c linical workgroups focused on B/AA health. In the workforce equity area, SFDPH leaders have also taken some steps forward. The Of fice of He alth Equity and Hu man Resources collaborated to craft and introduce a res pectful workplace standa rd in the employee handb ook. Various equity leaders and staff developed a response t eam plan to a ddress workplace conflict that is currently being staffed. Human Reso urces staff have also done significant data review to docu ment area s of disparate hiring, discipline, and advancement. How ever, the activities to date have made relatively mo dest progress toward an equitable workpla ce for st aff. The activities in this plan move us toward more signi ficant and tangible outco mes. The following is a timeline of activities und ertaken to date that have focus ed on improving repr esentation, inclusion and fa irness for staff of color across the department. 10 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLAN2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020SFDPH hired a permanent director of BAAHI as a member of the Executive Leadership Team to expand BAAHI and ensure sustained leadership support.The charter for BAAHI included a workgroup for Workforce Diversity and another for Cultural Humility. From 2015 to 2019, SFDPH has contracted with a nationally recognized racial equity consultant, Dr. Kenneth Hardy, todesign and implement cultural humility trainings for SFDPH staff.To date over 700 executives, managers and key front -linestaff have completed this 32-hour cultural humility training.Equity wasincluded as part of the workforce strategic planning for the department. Hiring managers were required to do an online training on mitigating bias in hiring annually.SFDPH introduced a required standard for diversity in racial, gender identity and sexual orientation of hiring panel members, with these characteristics reported and reviewed by HR before interviews proceed. Positions were added or repurposed to establish managers to serve as Equity Leads in all major sections.HR began a training series on managing for equity, mitigating bias. Employee orientation was expanded to an additional day to include training on racial equity, sexual orientation and gender identity.OHE was established with approval for a manager position to oversee workplace equity programs.A standard forrespectful workplace behavior was added to the employee manual which was signed by allemployees. All staff were required to take 4 hours of equity training annually, to be documented as part ofthe annual performance review. As part of a declaration on anti- racism, the Health Commission committed to develop a plan to improve the employment experience of B/AA staff, as measured by the Employee Engagement Survey and HR data related to hiring, opportunity for advancement, discipline rates, and dismissal rates. 11 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANTimeline ofActivity SFDPH joined Government Alliance on Race and Equity (GARE), with a commitment to correct racial inequity.Current Workforce D emographic Data SDPH includes 2 divisions, encompassin g 7 o perat ional areas, 3 administrati ve sections, with many units within each of these and dozens of physical sit es. Characterization of the racial or ethnic make-u p of the staff generally obscures th e reality that racial make-u p is very different between sections. Ce rtain divisions have higher representations of cert ain races/ethn icities. Laguna Honda and Jail Health have high representation of Filipinos, 37.4% of staff and 26. 0% of staff resp ectively. This trend reflects the high number of Filipinos employed in Nursing. White employees are more common in Central Admini stration at 41.5% of staff an d Whole Person Integrated Care at 40.4% of staff than the rest of SF PDH. Higher representation of wh ite employees in managements and among providers may explain this trend. Asians are espec ially common in Finance (55.4% of staff) to the exclusion of other races/ethniciti es, especially Black /African Americans c omposing only 5.1% of staff. Fa hows highest conc entration of Black/African American staff at 24.6% of total staff. The Call Center has the most Latinx staff at 3 2.4% of staff. In general, the Call Center and Facilities and Maintenance have a high percentage of BIPOC em ployees compared to other areas. The m ismatch between the large proportion of Latino patients and the relatively smaller number of Latino clinical staff at the SFDPH hospitals a nd clinics leaves those community me mbers without prov iders who sha re their backgroun d. The differences between areas are largely e xplained by the predominance of BIPOC employees in lower paid job class es, or in the relatively small r anks of senior management. Black/African Americans employees are c oncentrated in either l ower paid clerical and service jo bs or higher paid management jo bs with less distrib ution in between, dragg ing median sal aries below other major ethnic/racia l groups at SFDPH. White employees show high rep resen tation in higher pa id job groups (e.g., management, phy sicians, advanced practice providers, an d clinical profe ssional)and almost no representation in lo wer paying clerical and service jobs. Filipinos are very concentrated in Nursing and l ower paying job grou ps, such as racial 1% 12 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANNote: The Office of R acial Equity worked with the SF Control ler and Department of Human R esources to produce a report pur suant to its ordinance; this report was released on Marc h 10, 2020 to Mayor London Breed and the SF Board of Supervisors. As a follow-u p to the Phase I report publication, ORE will work with DHR, the Office of the Controll er and City Departments on producin g Phase II analysis. The Phase II r eport will provide a more granular review of the intersectio n of department-s pecific employment decisions an d race as well as gender, namely for hiring, prom otions, professional development, t erminations, and compensat ion decisions for all City employees. In the meantime, basic departmenta l workforce demographi c data has been provided by DHR to departments.Clerical, and Service. Latinx employees have highest representation in Clerical and Service jobs, mid-range representation in mid-level jobs (e.g., clinical professionals and non-clini cal professionals), and les s representation in the highest paying jobs (e.g., physicians, Nursing, and Management). Because jobs in lower class designations generally have lower pay, the disproportion ate number of BIPOC staff in these designations impacts the average pay for these groups. The gap in median pay by race/ethnicity ranges from 40 percent higher than the SFDPH median ( white) to 20% lower than the med ian (Black/Afri can Ameri cans). Only white staff have a higher median salary than SFDPH in general. In most divisions, white employees tend to make t he highest median salary and Black/African American the lowest, with a few exceptions. Asian employees make a higher median salary than white employees (who in these cases make the second highest median salaries)- Filipino staff have the highest median salary at MCAH, and Filipinos, and Asian staff are higher on average in Whole Person Integrated Care. Black/African Americans have the second highest median salary in Human Resources, the third lowest at MCAH, the second lowest behind Latinx at Primary Care, and the second lowest be hind Filipinos in Finance. Hiring and promotion are areas that, when appropriately implemented, can provide opportunity. However, this is a slow process as most SFDPH employees stay with the department for many years. That means that it is crucial tha t we take every hiring, recruitment and promotion as valuable limited opportunities for expanding the make-u p of our staff. 13 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANResults from Department Assessment and Employee Engage ment Survey With over 7,000 e mployees, SFDPH utilizes both divisional and dep artment-wide Employee Engagemen t Surveys to learn the needs and thoughts of employees across dozens of sites. Surveys are conducted of the hospit al and p rimary care staff as required by vario us regulations, and as standard business practice in healthcare. T he last department-l evel Employee Engagement Survey was con ducted in the sp ring of 2019, with a smaller follow-u p survey conducted in the fa ll of 2020. The 2019 survey had a robust sample size of 65% (4,956 resp ondents) of SFD PH employees , the surv ey results highlight staff engagement at 3 .76 out of 5, which is lower in comparis on to peer health care organizations. The survey ask ed 58 questions on topics includ ing leadersh ip, communication, benef its, diversity, resp ect, staffing levels, and career advancement opportunities. No table results sho w that employees like t heir work and are dedicated to the mission. Ho wever, it also showed that staff felt burdened by deficiencies in resources, staffing and communication. In 202 0, a smaller interim survey was done bet ween the full staff survey planned for every 2 years. 100 90 8070 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 I feel comfortable talking about race and racism in the workplace2019 I understand governement action and policies contribute to the difference inhealth between racial/ethnic groups. All Asian White Black Latinx 2020 14 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANSurvey responses were disaggregated by race and ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, work area, and job classification to look for differences that might be obscured by averages. Racial differences were seen in the way employees answered nearly every question. On over 96% of survey questions, Black/African American staff gave less favorable scores than the rest of the organization. For example, on the2019 survey only 41% of Black employees agree that there is a climate of trust in their unit, and only 29% judge the communication between leadership and staff to be effective. Latinx employees rated these issues only slightly higher. In particular, Black employees agreed that staff were shown respect at DPH at a much lower rate than employees generally; 45% vs. 60% This gap is even wider in questions that specifically refer to race. There were also eight questions added by the Office of Health Equity to assess the knowledge and experiences employees have around issues of racism and equity. These results were concerning in a few areas. About 70% of staff agreed that government actions contribute to health disparities, a description of structural racism. This is positive, but not yet at the goal of over 80% set in the SFDPH 2019 Equity Plan. Only 51% of employees answered favorably to the statement, \"I am comfortable talking about race and racism in the workplace.\" with wide variation; only 42% of Black/African American employees agreed with this statement. White employees stood out in being comfortable talking about race and racism in the workplace \u2014at least 13 percentage points higher than all other major race/ethnic groups. Black/African Americans were also less likely to hold favorable views on questions of fair treatment than other races. Black/African Americans were 17 percentage points less likely than the average staff member to agree or strongly agree \"Managers in my department treat clients/patients from all racial/ethnic groups with respects\". They were 21 percentage points less likely than their colleagues to agree or strongly agree that \"Staff in my department treat staff from all racial/ethnic groups with respect.\" This suggests the possibility that Black employees could play an important role ensuring respectful treatment for patients andclients. Multiple changes were made in response to these results. Trainings and discussion groups were expanded. Communication about equity efforts was increase. Equity Leads made progress in developing Equity Councils and plans in their areas. Notably, an Equity Champions program offered release time for 80+ staff members to discuss and work on equity in their area. Those efforts have had some impact. The 2020 interim Employee Engagement Survey showed changes in important metrics. There has been substantial improvement in the number of employees aware of how government action produces health disparities (up 20.1%) and employee involvement in advancing racial equity (up 10.5%). Black and White employees express increased comfort in talking about race/racism in the work place, up 30.5% and 22.1% respectively. Black employees are more likely now to say that staff treat clients from all racial/ethnic groups with respect, up 13.9%. Their agreement that managers treat staff from all racial/ethnic groups with respect is up also by 6.2% This is good news and evidence that culture and experiences can be improved. There are still areas of concern. Latinx employees are slightly less likely to say managers treat staff from all racial/ethnic groups with respect, down 3.8%. Asian employees have made little change in feeling comfortable talking about race and racism in the workplace and being involved in advancing racial equity. Further efforts to improve culture and spread the responsibility for equity will continue. This plan describes trainings and policy changes that will improve discipline, promotion and culture. These activities will move us even further to improve the level of respect and welcome for all staff. 15 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANThePlanTheCity andCounty ofSan Francisco (City) iscommitted to equal employment opportunity .ItistheCity's policy toensure: equal opportunity and onmerit andwithout discrimination ;reasonable accommodations that require them .TheCityprohibits discrimination andharassment onthebasis ofsex,race, age, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition (associated with cancer, ahistory ofcancer, orgenetic characteristics), HIV/AIDS status, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, military andveteran status, orother protected category under thelaw.1Hiring and Recruitment Identify, Attract, Inv est in andRetain a Diverse City Workfor ce Racial homogeneity within hiring and recruiting networks reproduce historical inequities in access to family-s ustaining, living wage jobs. Therefore, cultivating an inclusive workforce requires intentional efforts in and with diverse, underrepresented and underserved communities. This includes assessing the most basic barriers to access that influence the City's applicant pool, and developing a clear, intentional outreach strategy. Further, partnering creatively within new outlets, community-b ased organizations, BIPOC professional netwo rks, re-entry progr ams, SFUSD and community college systems will cultivate a rich pool of divers e candidates. - Office of Racial Equity 17 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANDepa rtment Goal DPH's goal is to recruit and hire a highly engaged workforce that reflects the diverse community we serve. Gentrification, economic disenfranchisement, and the forced outw ard migration has disrupted the Black communities that once supported San Francis co's Black families. At the same time, the uneq ual impact of the Great Rece ssion and long-standing employment discrimination have suppressed incom es for communities of color. Even when BIPOC residents are employed they are disadvantaged by pay inequi ties, racial bias in promotion and severe discipline. SFDPH is the primary source of healthcare and health promotion for low-income communities of color, so these famil ies impacted by racism are our clients and patients, including essential workers, undocument ed residents, and people experiencin g homelessness. This means we must value and prioritize a workforce with direct, first-hand experie nce working in and with these communities, including staff reflecting their racial and ethnic diversity and life exper iences. We will need intentional actions to build a workforce that is able to directly address the racialized structural barriers to health that impact the communities we serve. Hiring practices, processes, and policies must be actively anti-r acist. The first step is to look across classifications to identify inequitable representation and find ways to encourag e talen ted people from those community to apply. However, since many SFDPH positions requi re specialized training, certification or licensing, many potential applicants will need support to meet qualifications. SFDPH currently has a variety of internships, training programs, and other pipelines bring people into healthcare positions. Unfortunately, these programs are small, uncoord inated, and not evaluated for their impact on the diversity of the applicant pool. We know that failures in recruitment are not the only reason for diminished racial diversity in higher level positions. We must also identify and address barriers to successfully applying for positions. Arcane or confusing processes have been criticized anecdotally for many years, some of which derive from civil service rules that impact all city departments. Improving these aspects of the hiring process-u nnecessary or redundant questions, irrelevant requirements, unneeded background checks, degree inflation, and bias in interviewing- will take coordinated effort across many agenci es, labor organizations, and regulators. Our aim is to reexam ine all levers to eliminate racial bias in our hiring practices.Focus AreaKeygoals Develop new recruitment strategies that increase the diversity ofapplicants.Implement a monthly and quarterly tracking system in Human Resources to monitor for racial bias in recruitment and hiring practices Develop skills -based training for managers in recognizing and interrupting personal bias, and the use of standard practices in all decisions impacting the workforce.Develop tools andsystem - wide protocols for equitable best practices in the Pre -and-Post Selection Referral processes.

Lastly, acknowledging and res pondi ng to any potential inequitable impacts of the COVID-1 9 pandemic on frontline City workers will be essential. - Office of Racial Equity 30 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANDepartment Goal As a large or ganization with hundreds of classific ations, it can be diffi cult to ensure that all employe es have the same ease of acces s to comm unications. This can impact their ability to see opp ortunities for advan cement. Further, wh ile promotions are usually based on the Civil Services exam process, withou t clear preventative measur es, it is possible that some employe es are more s upported in career growth and encourag ed to ap ply for p romo tional positions This can happen inadvertently as managers make a cting assignments, assign lead pay , or assign special projects. This can lead to signif icant inequit ies in who is eventually qualifie d and selected for PCS pr omotive positions and who therefore receives higher pay. Workforce demograp hic assessment by ra ce/ethnicity by clas sification and pay reveal significant pay disparities. Black, Indigenous, Hispani c, and peoples minoritized as POC (Asian and Filipino pop ulations excepted) staff constit ute a higher proportion of employees in lowe r-paying classifications. H igher -paying classificati ons are generally populated by white and Asian American staff, espec ially in mid-manage ment positions. DPH m ust improve on its ability an d commitment to offer op portunities for advan cement for all staff. Correcting this imbalance will require tangible action s that benefit employees fr om diverse backgrounds , particularly those in some of the lowest paying classifications. We also need to retain the BIPOC st aff we do have. Black and African A merican staff experience the highest p ercentage of probationary release, almost double in comparison to white and Asian Ame rican staff . We may have succeeded in hiring candidates from variou s diverse backgr ound, but without sufficient reten tion and pro motion we cann ot cor rect the legacy of institutional a nd individ ual biases that have led to current inequities. Most managers at DPH work in a fa st-paced, complex enviro nment. DPH managers are expecte d to be technical experts as well as people experts. Lack o f a clear understandi ng of management responsib ility means that some managers are unable to effecti vely manage their team s beyond \"getting the work done\". HR needs to clar ify - via job postings and ongoing training - that managers are res ponsible for their team memb ers' growth and engagement, not just productivity. These are insepara ble elements. To achieve growth and engagement, managers must recognize t heir role as a care er coach and a profess ional m entor for each employee on their team. This will ensur e that employees from marg inalized backgrounds have the suppo rt for career advancement and pay advocacy that they currently lack. I t will also allow managers and executive leaders to be held accountable for whom they appr ove for which AAE or promotion.Focus Area2Keygoals Collaborate with Merit, hiring managers and Directors to review current postings and ensure standard processes are used for pre -and-post selection referrals.Develop new communication tools to ensure employees have equal access to information, resources and opportunities atorientation and in their ongoing employment.The Office of Health Equity will partner with HR implement as 360-Degree Anti-Racist Practice Leadership Surveys, which will be used to highlight opportunities to improve cultural competence, and increase equitable management practices.A review process to identify classifications with poor mobility and develop a diversification plan with focus on diversified recruitment pathways -new upward paths will create meaningful employee retention.Create and implement an equitable and inclusive hiring and promotion policy, with integration of the Office of Health Equity and Equity Leads.Create and implement protocols to track hiring selections for each area and use racial impact analysis tools to detect disproportionate outcome that suggest bias.

Some employees, receive extra scrutiny from supervisors leading to worse performance reviews, missed promotion opportunities, and termination. 1 This additional scrutiny is a result of a biased feedback loop in which some employees are seen as less skilled because of consistent or prolonged unemployment. This cycle must be stopped. Higher rates of corrective action and discipline negatively impacts a department's ability to successfully recruit, retain, and engage employees of color, specifically Black and Latinx employees. 2 Thus, supervisors should be aware of their own biases, evaluations and reviews must be standardized, and, most importantly, managers should always center the needs of their employees.

Across multiple indicators, dis pariti es in BIPOC employees have worse outcomes (as reflected in t he 2019 and 2020 Cor rective and Disciplinary Actions report issued by the Department of Human Resources).

Regardless of t he reason, chan ges in HR and man agement processes are required to correct the resulting injustice. The Department of Public Health's goal is to refor m disciplinary processes, practices, and pol icies to eliminate disproportional disciplinary and corrective actions (written reprimands , suspensions, term inations, etc.), and separations (i.e. medical relea ses, probationary releases , etc. ).

When white men make up 85% of all senior executive and board members in America, it is difficult to imagine how women and people of color can see themselves in a leadership position. 1 In general, a department's leadership determines multiple aspects of the workforce, who gets hired, where the money goes, what projects are greenlit. Thus, it is more likely that a diverse leadership that carries shared values with their staff, will better uplift the staff. In fact, all employees, both white and employees of color, benefit from a people of color -led department. 2 Even the community will benefit because a diverse leadership will be better connected with the community, thus being able to create far more robust and innovative ways to support them. -Office of Racial Equity 47 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANDepartment Goal The role of leadership in c reating a culture of equity is multi -layered. Leaders serve as role models, set cultural norms, drive both positive and negative work experiences for staff, and act as either a bridge or a barrier to the advancement of staff. Leaders who come from marginalized communities he lp congruent staff at lower levels envision advancement. Relationships with these leaders also gives their peers leaders positive ex periences which can help them combat personal biases. DPH has notable raci al dive rsity in the executive team. Howeve r, oth er levels of senior management have less diversity, middle management even less. This means that management staff in underrepresented categori es have fewer mentors than other staff. DPH is f ocuse d on diversifying this middle level of leadership th rough internal promo tion and improved recrui tmen t and hirin g practices. Still, repres entation is not t he only role le aders have in creating a culture of equity . As noted in th e discipline section above, s ome employees at DPH on average are subject to more discipline and fewer promotional opportunities than others. We cann ot wait for more dive rse hiri ng to a dvance e quity for these current employees. The way staff are treated-p romoted, disciplined, devel oped or valued-i s strongly influenced by the choices of their manager. Managers will need to learn how to best manage personal biases (even implicit ones) and model respectful and equitable treatment of BIPOC staff members. Directors and senior execu tives need to model fa ir treatment of their BI POC di rect-r eports, and hold the mangers they oversee acc ountable for doing the same. Managers have significant influence on workplace cul ture and operational practices, and have a significant r ole in cha nging them. The full successful partic ipatio n of managers in t hese changes will take new kinds of management traini ng and new st andards for assessment . Many managers wh o will h ave to do thi s work have not experienced racial discrimination, or other types of marginalization.

In order to do that, it is important to recognize having both the hard and soft skills needed to perform certain tasks is a form of privilege. It is equally important to realize that employees of color are more likely to repeatedly prove their capabilities rather than being evaluated by their expected potential. 1 By intentionally investing in the specific professional development of each staff, the department can uplift an employee's journey to developing new skills rather than scrutinizing for a lack of skills.

Racial homogeneity is not only found in hiring and recruiting, it permeates throughout organizational culture, policies, and procedures. It also can take form as coded, traditional standards, such as \"professionalism,\" that ultimately centers whiteness. 1 This factor takes an immense mental health toll on underrepresented employees who do not feel like they belong. Departments must actively work to create a culture of inclusion and commit to ongoing assessment to uncover gaps in policies and procedures that create a culture of othering. Changes in organizational culture starts and continues with the needs of the employee. These needs are discovered by fostering intentional relationships with underrepresented employees, specifically women, trans employees, Black employees, indigenous employees, employees of color, and employees living with disabilities. -Office of Racial Equity 63 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANDepartment Goal For the past 2 years, DPH, under the leadership of the Director of Health Equity, has built an infrastructure to promote a culture of inclusion and belonging for BIPOC staff and staff from other unde r-represented groups. Our goal is to further this work through multiple modalities: continuous assess ment with surveys and open forums; creating spaces for staff to learn and share ground truth; enforcing accountability for a culture of belonging through policy and comm unication. The last two employee engagement surveys issued in 2019 and 2020 included 6 questions ar ound staff's perception o f equity, inclusion an d belonging. We plan to continue asking these questions on an annual basis to collect long term data on staff's experience across the department. Results stratified by race from the 2019 survey demonstrated tha t Black/African employees see their experiences in the department differ ently than other employees. For example, only 57% o f B/AA staff agree or strongly agree with the statem ent \"managers in my department treat staff from all racial and ethnic groups with respect\" compare d to 74% o f all staff who answered favorably to that a nswer. In response to this data, the Equity Champions prog ram was developed to increase the number of people committed to uplifting equity and challe nging inequity as t hey saw it. The discussio n forums on Black health and experience were expanded to include additional sites. Other activities, tailored to specific site s, were initiated by the Equity Leads across the department. As seen in the Survey section above, there have been some positive changes in staff r eported ass essments of DPH commitment to equit y and culture of respect. Our goal is to continue to deepen our relationshi p with B/AA staff and staf f from other historically under- represented groups, while providing more spaces where all staff can learn about equity from a historical, systemic, and inter-p ersonal personal perspecti ve so everyone can contri bute to building a culture of inclusion and belonging. At the same time, we will also wor k on policies, an accountability structure and communication from d epartment and division leadership to ensure managers and superv isors take ownership for creating and maintaini ng an envir onment in which staff members from under-r epresented communities will be respected and their perspect ives meaningfully incor porated in decision making processes.Focus Area6 1Aysa Gray, TheBiasof'Professionalism' Standards, Stanford Social Innovation Review (Jun. 4, 2019) https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_bias_of_professionalism_standards.Keygoals The development of resource groups to support staff in marginalized groups.Development, enforcement and evaluation of policies establishing acceptable workplace interactions.Include regular assessments of climate in the staff engagement survey with the ability to identify areas of concern, and track progress over time. 64 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANObjective 6.1 Foster an intentional organizational culture that is committed to inclusion andbelonging.

Policies and budget decisions made by these Boards and Commissions must be assessed through a racial equity lens. -Office of Racial Equity 77 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANDepartment Goal Since it s inception in 1985, San Francisco Mayors h ave ensured , through t heir appoin tments, that the Health Commission has been comprised of a diverse group of individuals representing different groups of races, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations. Mayor Diane Feinstein also began a tradition of appointin g at least one Health Commissioner who is HIV positive to represent the perspectives of this important group. The Health Commission membership has historically included medical providers, community advocates, consumers, and other individuals with public health expertise. The Health Commission has responsibility to track, make inquiries, and provide guidance on D PH activities and the department's budge t. This includes monitoring the implementation of the DPH Racial Equity Action Plan in its public meetings. The Health Commission is c ommitted to equitable decision making and will adopt an equity tool in 2021. The He alth Commission will reque st that DPH presentations to the Health Commission use an equity lens by including equity-r elated data and goals, in addition to information on comm unity involvement and community impact. As the Governing Body of the DPH, the Health Commissioners also serve as role model s and set cultural norms for the department through action on official policy in addition to how they carry out their roles in public meetings. The Heal th Commissioners are committed to completing ongoing equity trainings to ensure they are up -to-date in their understanding of racial equity paradigms and issues facing underserved and underre presented communities in San Francisco. They will hold the DPH Director of Health to the se same high standards by adding a \"Health Equit y\" category to the personnel evaluation of this most senior DPH leader. The ultimate Health Commission goa l is to ensure th at racial equity is a foundational value within DPH culture that is demonstra ted through all of the department's activities including budget decisions; contracting of services to community pr oviders; provision of clinical services; human resource practices; and community programs.Focus Area7Keygoals Establishing anequity review process using a standardized equity toolRequest information about equity in presentations to thecommissionAdd a \"Health Equity\" category to the Health Director's performance evaluation 78 San Francisco Department of Public Health RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLANObjective 7.1 Ensure a diverse and equitable board and commission members that match the community being served.
