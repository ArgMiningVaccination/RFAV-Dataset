She has cared for my family of seven for five years. My family is three generations so there is a variety of issues that Dr. Tetlow has helped us navigate including food allergies, gut health, cardiovascular health, stroke prevention, muscular and skeletal support, hormone support, antiviral support, antibacterial support, weight gain, loss, and maintenance, methylation support, Lyme Disease, and more! Dr. Tetlow empowers her patients by teaching them. She provides resources during appointments and is accessible through the portal for questions and feedback. In addition, Dr. Tetlow offers presentations on topics of interest for her patients. I have had the privilege of attending a few of the presentations and the amount of time, effort, and information that goes into the presentation is unbelievable. I highly recommend that you check one out! Always infusing her practice with the latest research, you can rest assured that you are working with cutting edge treatments and protocols. Thank you to Dr. Tetlow and everyone at PIM for working together to provide exemplary care for my family and me. - Desiree B. \"I first met Dr. Tetlow in June of 2014, when I was at the end of my rope. I had been sick for five years with what had been diagnosed as Mixed Connective Tissue Disease as well as Fibromyalgia and Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. While I liked the Rheumatologist that I was seeing, she could only provide medication for symptom treatment. Each medication produced terrible side effects that were worse than the symptoms, one of which resulted in a serious allergic reaction. I had asked about diet, supplements, and lifestyle changes, but as a traditional physician, she was unable to offer any guidance. I had resigned myself to living with chronic pain and fatigue. From my first appointment, I felt hope for the first time in five years. Dr. Tetlow was clearly a different kind of doctor. She took the time to really listen, and reassured me that I could improve. The first testing (micronutrient) results showed that I had significant deficiencies that were exacerbating my illnesses. Correcting nutritional deficiencies, tackling issues with my microbiome, understanding my genetics, and looking at lifestyle changes have all produced a significant improvement in my symptoms, and I truly believe I have reversed the progression of disease. Most recently, after an increase in symptoms, Dr. Tetlow recommended a toxin screen, which surprisingly showed an exposure to mold. I had my house tested, and sure enough, I had a mold issue that was negatively impacting my health (and probably the health of my family). I was able to mitigate the issue and am feeling much better. No standard medical doctor would have ever thought to test for mycotoxins, and I would have continued to suffer for as long as I lived in that house. The experience at Philadelphia Integrative Medicine is completely different from any standard medical practice. Not only is Dr. Tetlow a great medical detective, searching for the root cause of illness, she is a truly wonderful person. She listens, validates, coaches you through the rough times and celebrates the victories with you. At PIM, you experience an incredible combination of cutting-edge medicine with tremendous kindness and caring. For me, it has been uplifting, healing and absolutely life-changing. Many thanks to everyone at PIM!\" -Karen Randall \"I am a patient and wanted to take a quick moment to say how wonderful I think PIM is. PIM very quickly identified 3 major areas that needed work. She put together a clear plan, explained it in a way that was very easy to understand and has been executing on that plan. She has been patient, a good listener, very organized and extremely knowledgeable. I am really impressed how much knowledge she has learned. She hasn't left any \"rock unturned\" at this point. She is providing the most comprehensive care I have ever had. She simply is the best health practitioner that I have ever worked with and that says a lot because I have worked with a lot of different practitioners.\" \"After one visit with Dr. Tetlow, I had tangible things I could do to improve my health. In the past, I have visited my primary care physician only to be referred to several specialists that could not give me clear answers or solutions. My health was broken down into individual problems and only my symptoms were treated. Dr. Tetlow saw my issues as a whole and taught me how they interact with each other and affect me overall on a daily basis. She looked into the root of my problems and we discussed how we could begin to permanently resolve them. She devised a personalized plan for me that included steps to making lifestyle changes instead of expecting me to overhaul my life at once. She is realistic, optimistic, kind and understanding. I believe I will be able to achieve optimal health with her plan and will no longer need to settle for feeling my less-than-best.\" - Denise R \" I couldn't be happier with the practice. The service I am getting is unparalleled. Since being switched to the compounded thyroid medication and a few tiny tweaks, I feel worlds better! I can't describe the way I feel. I don't feel perfect, but balanced, and I still have work to do, but wow!\" - Colin G \"I gained wisdom and learned from Dr. Tetlow's experience in integrative patient care and diagnostic testing. I appreciated everything within this opportunity, Dr. Tetlow's time, her energy, her staff at PIM and her sincerity. It was a great experience. Every member of Dr. Tetlow's staff is great.\" - Dr. Azam, Clinical Mentoring Client \"Dr. Tetlow gave me a path to improve my bone density through supplements, since I chose not to take the pharmaceuticals. In one year, my hips increased 19.5%. Dr. Tetlow has given me hope and faith that a natural, nutritional approach DOES work.\" - Marty R. \"Dr. Tetlow modeled for me multiple aspects of integrative medicine, all the way from explaining advanced special lab testing and supplements' mechanisms of actions to how to run a private practice. I love and appreciate that she is so willing to help on all levels of my learning curve. I particularly love how methodical, clear and energetic Dr. Tetlow is, both in advising me and working with patients.\" - Kea Gilbert, MD, Clinical Mentoring Client \"My overall health and well-being have improved tremendously since I began seeing Dr. Tetlow. After years of frustrating joint and back pain coupled with almost constant fatigue, Dr. Tetlow methodically analyzed my situation and recommended a program that has helped me feel much, much better. She is a wise and caring practitioner and I am grateful to have her on my healthcare team.\" - M.W. \"I had an amazing experience and a chance to better understand what Integrative Medicine is. Mentoring started with identifying my personal and professional goals. The program continued with direct exposure to Integrative Medicine cases where I was able to see the art of Integrative care in action. Through shadowing Dr. Tetlow, I learned so much about myself that I was able to create a new model for my professional and financial goals. By applying an integrative approach, I have confidence that I will be able to start my own medical business in the next year.\" Yuriy Ilkovych, MD, Clinical Mentoring Client \"I was a healthy and energetic 25-year-old when in 2015 I started having terrible GI discomfort. I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and found (the) approach of throwing pharmaceuticals at a few of my symptoms without any real quantitative data or understanding, frankly, unsettling. Beyond still suffering from many symptoms, I needed a physician who would listen to my concerns with earnest and treat ME, not just my disease. Dr. Tetlow made me feel more at ease and listened to than I had in the previous 15 months with my other doctor(s). She made me feel like I had the right to be there, to ask questions, and most importantly to champion my own health. She listened to my concerns from the obvious physical ailments to the more nuanced emotional struggles of dealing with a new life-long disease. In just the four months I have been seeing Dr. Tetlow and the team, I have been transformed. Things I was unaware even being 'wrong' - things I had just learned to live with thinking they were 'just me' - began to remedy themselves. My energy level returned in dramatic fashion, swelling I had attributed to weight gain and steroids vanished, and I felt more myself than I had in more than 2 years. The Hello Health portal is always there to give me same-day feedback on any question I might have for the team, and it really gives me a sense of ease that I'm no longer in this alone.\" - Colleen \"In so many ways I am very, very grateful to Dr. Tetlow. Right from my first visit in the spring of 2014, Dr. Tetlow encouraged me to be my own authority. My feelings, concerns and questions were of importance to her. \"All of me\" figured into her perspective of my health picture. This told me that Dr. Tetlow truly respects me as a fellow human being, first and foremost. I am 66 years old and I can say with clear honesty that Dr. Tetlow has helped me resolve long-standing health issues. And I am confident that Dr. Tetlow will continue to be able to help me stay healthy. It is evident to me that Dr. Tetlow has a broad knowledge base in her field of Integrative Medicine as well as a curiosity and desire to bring forth new ideas and approaches into her practice. All of which is strengthened by her belief in the body's innate wisdom to heal. Not secondary to all I have just written, Dr. Tetlow also introduced me to Mindfulness. This has been another crucial piece towards my reaching better health I continue to learn and benefit so much from being a patient of Dr. Tetlow's. She has also chosen marvelous individuals to work with her. All respond with kindness.\" \"Dear Dr. Tetlow, I just had to write you and share my dramatic experience since I've begun another yeast reduction protocol. Since the last yeast protocol, I have included Digestyzymes at every meal, Calcium D-Glucarate twice a day and spacing the probiotic support early in the AM and late in the PM so as not to interfere with the Nystatin dosing. I have also pre-prepared quinoa and faro, and have whole grains now twice a day. The results are nothing short of dramatic!! I'm ecstatic because I feel like I have my wonderful, happy body and energy level back again! I have felt a distinct increase in my metabolism over the past three to four days and a distinct signaling of hunger throughout the day that I had completely lost up until now. For so many months, I couldn't understand why I wouldn't feel hungry, even after a long run in the morning without having eaten any food ahead of time. In the \"old\" days I would have been famished after training hard and so, I thought I was just getting older and my brain wasn't sending hunger messages clearly any longer due to hormonal shifts. Well! The last few days, without changing ANYTHING in my diet, eating a good amount of food throughout the day and only introducing grains twice a day, I began getting hunger signals at appropriate and anticipated times of the day! My body has leaned down WHILE eating exactly the same and even more healthy food in the last few days. I feel like my good old self!! No bloating, no holding onto extra water or even fat!! It appears that I am metabolizing fat stores like I used to! I am waking up feeling more alive and energized than I have in, I don't know HOW long!! This is a remarkable turn of events! I am beyond ecstatic! With your knowledge and guidance, you have helped release my body from the chains of illness. I just can't get over it, and I wanted you to know as my physician, as a scientist, the results that I'm experiencing from being 100% dedicated to the protocols we outlined and to healing my gut. I want to broadcast to the world to test their GI microbiome health and that a majority of the obese population would find the source of their struggles right there! With continued gratitude, Your \"blown away\" patient, Ginger\" \"The staff is very friendly and they have a great approach to scientific, holistic health. I'm so grateful to have a place that does functional medicine well. They do their best and are good at making it affordable too.\" - Derek "}
