The company has been engaged in developing animal welfare standards and applying them to a growing number of product categories in its stores since 2005. The following animal welfare standards for laying hens were developed after more than 200 visits to laying farms and consultation with farmers, poultry geneticists, pullet growers and animal welfare scientists. The standards are designed to improve the level of animal welfare and meet the expectations of Whole Foods Market customers. Standards were developed for each System Category (production system) in which laying hens are raised for eggs sold at Whole Foods Market. The intention of these standards is not to imply that one production system is better than another, but rather that each system is unique and has different ways to achieve good animal welfare. All standards for a System Category must be met to receive certification to that System Category. During inspections of each farm, information and photographs are collected. The information is then reviewed, corrective actions issued if required and, when all standards have been met, certification awarded for a specific System. Inspections are conducted by independent inspectors or by the Whole Foods Market Quality Standards Coordinator for Animal Products. All inspections are reviewed by the inspection company's oversight staff and/or their animal welfare consultant before certifications are issued. The inspection process is designed to determine whether each farm meets all required standards and to work with the farm to correct any outstanding issues for a successful certification. Traceability of eggs from laying house to carton is required for assurance that all eggs are produced in the System Category stated on the carton. Each farm is inspected every 15 months so that over time, all farms are assessed during each season, preventing farms from being seen repetitively at their best or at their worst. Further stipulations: No standard in this document may supersede local, regional or national regulations or laws. If in a particular situation or circumstance a standard as written might compromise the welfare of birds in the producer's care, the producer should contact Whole Foods Market Quality Standards for determination. Copyright 2015: Whole Foods Market IP, L.P. Version 6 2 System Categories: Unacceptable: Cages, enriched colony cages and basic cage-free systems are not permitted by Whole Foods Market Animal Welfare Standards for Laying Hens. Cage-Free Plus: Birds must be able to move about freely in housing. They must be able to dust bathe and forage in high-quality litter, to perch and to isolate themselves or escape aggressive flock mates. Birds live entirely in housing or might have access to an outdoor area that does not meet all requirements for the Outdoor Access System Category. Beak trimming is permitted, but only within strict guidelines on length and balance to maintain functional use as in their natural state. Infrared trimming is strongly encouraged. Outdoor Access: All standards for the Cage-Free Plus System Category are required for Outdoor Access. Additionally, birds must have access to an outdoor area that is at least equal to the area of the house for at least half of daylight hours. Water is required in the outdoor area; shade and cover must accommodate at least half the number of birds outdoors. Pasture Raised*: Birds live in permanent housing and have access to grassland or rangeland throughout the day. Cover and shade must accommodate 75% of the birds outdoors, be visible from the house and distributed throughout the pasture to encourage birds to use the entire outdoor area. Rangeland is preferred as it provides shade and cover in a natural setting that encourages natural behavior. Grassland must be maintained with at least 50% vegetative cover, measured from 15 feet outside the perimeter of the house. Beak trimming is permitted, but only within strict guidelines on length and balance to maintain functional use as in their natural state. Infrared trimming is strongly encouraged. Mobile Houses on Pasture*: Birds live outdoors with mobile housing available for laying eggs and secure roosting at night. Mobile housing must be moved frequently to ensure at least 75% vegetative cover is maintained on grassland or birds have continuous access to rangeland environments. Shade and cover must accommodate all birds in the flock. Beak trimming is prohibited. *For pasture system claims, if birds are restricted from grassland or rangeland for more than two but less than six calendar months per year due to snow cover or weather, the claim must be qualified by the term \"seasonal\" on the carton.

Version 6 7 Section 2: Health and Wellbeing 2.1: Strain selection: All systems Strain selection must be based on suitability to the system in which birds will be raised and must focus on welfare traits as well as production targets. If problems such as high mortality, chronic feather pecking or feather loss are seen, alternate strain selection must be explored. Note: High productivity is frequently a criteria for strain selection, but productivity levels are often predicated on specific temperature, lighting and environmental conditions. Some strains may not produce as expected in outdoor environments and could exhibit increased negative issues such as poor feather condition and/or aggressive behavior. Similar issues can occur when birds that perform well in outdoor environments are chosen for indoor systems. 2.2: Placement of birds: All systems Placement of chicks or pullets must begin within 2 hours of delivery to the farm and must be completed without interruption. 2.3: Spent hens: All systems Sourcing hens that are past the peak of lay and/or have been depopulated from other farms is prohibited. 2.4: Prohibited substances: All systems 2.4.1: Medications Administration of antibiotics, sulfa drugs or ionophores to individual birds or flocks is prohibited. 2.4.2: Mammalian or avian by-products Mammalian or avian by-products in feed are prohibited with the exception of dairy probiotics or eggs. 2.4.3: Growth hormones Administration of growth hormones is prohibited. 2.5: Health and functioning: All systems Birds must be maintained in a healthy and functioning state. Ill or injured birds must be removed from the flock immediately upon discovery and action taken in accordance with Standard 2.6. Dead birds must be removed from the flock immediately upon discovery. If birds are kept in a hospital pen, it must meet all standards in Section 5 of this document. Note: Signs of poor health or poor function include poor feather condition, feather loss, heat stress, morbidity, low egg production for the strain and injuries from aggressive behavior of flock mates. 2.6: Reduction of suffering: All systems Ill or injured birds must not be allowed to suffer. Treatment must not be withheld from ill or injured birds. o If treatment includes prohibited medications, the eggs from treated birds must be withdrawn from supply and Whole Foods Market Quality Standards contacted. Birds that are ill or injured and have been removed from the flock must be permitted to recover, given treatment if necessary or euthanized. Copyright 2015: Whole Foods Market IP, L.P. Version 6 8 All persons who work within proximity of the birds must be able to recognize signs of illness and injury and trained to take action to reduce suffering. A person competent to euthanize ill or injured birds must be able to respond promptly. Only preferred or acceptable methods of euthanasia are permitted. Note: Acceptable methods of euthanasia are cervical neck dislocation or use of an individual controlled atmosphere killing (CAK) chamber. Decapitation is acceptable but not preferred. 2.7: Feather condition: All systems Feather condition must be monitored at least monthly. There must be a plan in place to respond to feathering issues. If feather condition drops below the scores defined for each type of system below, the response plan must be implemented immediately to identify causes and correct the problem. If a sudden flock-wide feather loss event occurs, Whole Foods Market Quality Standards must be notified immediately and provided with a corrective action plan for rectifying the situation. 2.7.1: Cage-Free Plus Feather condition for the flock must not exceed a score of 2 at 25 weeks, 3 at 35 weeks, 3.5 at 45 weeks and older. 2.7.2: Outdoor Access Feather condition for the flock must not exceed a score of 1.5 at 25 weeks, 2.5 at 35 weeks, 3 at 45 weeks and older. 2.7.3: Pasture Raised Feather condition for the flock must not exceed a score of 1 at 25 weeks, 1.8 at 35 weeks, 2 at 45 weeks and older. 2.7.4: Mobile Houses on Pasture Feather condition for the flock must not exceed a score of 1 for the first 30 weeks and 1.5 at 45 weeks and older. Note: Whole Foods Market considers feather condition to be an important indicator of bird welfare. Our goal is that feather condition is maintained at an acceptable level throughout the life of the flock, with the exception of molting. Feather condition will be evaluated against the preceding criteria throughout the life of the flock and reviewed to determine progress. See Appendix IV for scoring guide. 2.8: Integrated production: Mobile Houses on Pasture All birds, from chicks through end of lay, must be raised on the same farm or on a neighboring farm that is a member of the same integrated local cooperative or production group. After brooding, young birds must be provided with resources and given exposure to outdoor environments in the same forms they will experience where they will be placed. o These resources include feeding and drinking system, perches, nests and enrichments. Birds must remain in the same flock throughout their lives. The brooder/pullet grower designated by the local cooperative or production group must achieve a Mobile Houses on Pasture distinction. o Outdoor environments must match their destination farms in type of vegetation and area to which birds have access. o Birds must be accustomed to similar management practices and human contact as they will experience on the destination farm.

Version 6 16 Section 7: Requirements for Free Range, Outdoor Access or Pasture Raised Production Claims 7.1: Free range or outdoor access claims: To make the claims of \"free range\" or \"outdoor access, all standards for Outdoor Access must be met and restriction from outdoor access must total no more than 2 seasonal months, as defined in 6.6.1. If all standards for Outdoor Access are met and a producer restricts access to the outdoors for between 3 and 6 seasonal access months, use of the marketing terms \"free range\" or \"outdoor access\" is prohibited unless the seasonal aspect of the outdoor access is clearly stated in the claim, such as \"seasonally free range\" or \"seasonal outdoor access.\" 7.2: Pasture raised claims: To make the claim \"pasture raised,\" all standards for Pasture Raised must be met and restriction from grassland or rangeland must total not more than 2 seasonal months as defined in 6.6.2. If all standards for Pasture Raised are met, and a producer restricts access to grassland or rangeland for between 3 and 6 seasonal months, use of the term \"pasture raised\" is prohibited unless the seasonal aspect of pasture access is clearly stated in the claim, such as \"seasonal access to pasture\" or \"seasonally pasture raised.\" Any farm achieving Mobile Houses on Pasture, regardless of whether birds live on grassland or rangeland, may make the claim \"pasture raised\" without qualification. All pasture raised claims must be approved by Whole Foods Market Quality Standards. Copyright 2015: Whole Foods Market IP, L.P. Version 6 17 Appendix I: Definitions Animal by-products Feed ingredients derived from the slaughter process Blinds Objects birds can hide behind, such as vertically placed boards, nest structures that sit in the middle of the floor, etc. Blinds provide an area of limited visibility where birds can seek protection from aggressive flock mates. Cage A cage is any boxlike enclosure of bars, slats or wires, or a brooding structure composed of drawers or compartments, within which birds are confined. Cover Because of their innate fear of overhead predators, chickens seek out areas where they can be under objects that make them feel safe, whether indoors or out. In their native habitat, this would be bushes and low-growing trees and plants. Indoor cover: Low objects or installations birds can go under for protection. Outdoor cover: Natural vegetation, low objects or structures that birds can go under for protection. Enrichment An object provided in the environment that is not a behavioral need (such as perches or litter) but provides novelty and stimulation. Provision of enrichments significantly reduces feather pecking behavior. Enrichments can be suspended over the scratch area or platform, or can be placed on the floor itself, such as a bale of hay or straw. Several studies have found that some of the more effective enrichments to be suspended are pieces of braided rope or string that birds can unravel. To be effective, enrichments should be provided early in the birds' lives. Farm A production system, owned and operated as one farm that may be composed of one or more sites that are close in proximity. Farm plan A written outline of farm practices and protocols that both ensure consistency in farm operations and provide a guide for anyone who steps in to manage the farm, such as during family vacations or emergencies. Feather loss Different from feather pecking, feather loss is generally the response of large numbers of birds to stressors in their environment. Feed-related issues are the most common cause of feather loss. Feed can be rancid or spoiled, it can suddenly be mixed differently with slightly different ratios of components, or the amount of feed can be inadequate. Sudden changes in lighting or air quality can also stimulate a spontaneous molt, as can other stressful conditions such as heat, cold, disease and lack of adequate amounts of water.

Fresh feed Fresh feed is that which is provided newly each day rather than left over from the previous day. This is especially relevant in systems where feeders are filled manually. Fresh feed must not be compromised in quality. Friable Dry and crumbly, a qualifier for functional litter. Hospital or sick pen An area where birds that are injured or ill can recover. If a bird's injury or illness is severe, it must be euthanized. Integrated production A group of farms in a local area that work together as a cooperative or small community production group that might share stages of production and that use mobile houses. Lux A unit of illumination that is used for defining the amount of ambient light in an area. Morbidity The state of being unhealthy. Outdoor-based systems Systems in which birds primary living space is outdoors. Outdoor environments Rangeland A type of outdoor environment comprised of a variety of tall plants, forbs, shrubs, bushes, rocks, woodlands, orchards, etc. that attracts birds by providing cover, shade and foraging. Rangeland vegetation must be visible to birds from the door of the house and close enough to be accessible to the birds. Essential attributes of a rangeland environment are overhead cover to encourage ranging and vegetative material that stimulates foraging. Trees, bushes and tall plants are examples of overhead cover. Fallen branches, twigs and leaf litter are examples of productive and interesting foraging opportunities. Although there can be areas of bare ground, the environment that provides cover, shade and foraging must meet the requirements of Standard 6.9. Grassland A type of outdoor environment with more than 50% rooted vegetative ground cover composed primarily of low growing grasses, legumes and herbs. Grassland vegetation must begin within 15 feet from the door of the house. Important attributes of a grassland environment are that the vegetation is edible and dense enough to be attractive to birds. The minimum vegetative cover requirement of 50% averaged throughout the outdoor area, but excluding the area within 15 feet of the house, must be met at all times to be considered grassland.

Version 6 19 Outdoor management plan Farm protocols and practices that result in continuously robust outdoor environments for the birds, including rotation protocols, inspection criteria and management of stocking rate, contamination, cover and shade. Pecking behavior Feather pecking Feather pecking can range from gentle pecks to the ends of the feathers to vigorous pecking that can cause bleeding which exacerbates pecking and can lead to cannibalism. Vent pecking Generally caused by attraction to a drop of blood on the vent. Most common with young hens at the onset of lay. Aggressive pecking Generally focused on the head or neck, this type of pecking is related to aggression and so is a different issue with different causes than feather pecking or vent pecking. Perches Perches are rails, usually in an angled frame that enable birds to grasp the rail and balance in their sleeping posture. Perches are elevated above the floor or platform. Sections of slats that are raised above the floor level, even when constructed of boards with spaces between, do not qualify as perches. Staging platform or rail A rail or platform in front of nests to provide birds with a place to stand as they wait for a nest and as they perform nesting rituals. Traceability Protocols and records that show the path of eggs from hen to carton in Whole Foods Market stores to ensure all eggs in cartons are from farms that have been validated by a third party to meet Whole Foods Market Animal Welfare Standards for Laying Hens rated for the same System Category and have also met either FDA requirements for egg packing facilities or Whole Foods Market Food Safety Standards for Small Farms.
