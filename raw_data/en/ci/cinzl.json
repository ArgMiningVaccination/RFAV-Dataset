The rash may be located on or near the genitals or anus but could also be on other areas like the hands, feet, chest, or face Mpox is spread through close contact and can be transmitted to anyone regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity. It can be spread by direct skin-to-skin contact with infectious rash, scabs, or body fluids. This can include household and/or intimate contact. Spreading can also occur when contacting contaminated items, such as clothing. It may be transmitted through contact with respiratory secretions; however, it is not an airborne illness. Mpox is NOT spread through casual, brief conversations or walking by someone with Mpox, like at a grocery store. Contact a healthcare provider right away to talk about diagnosis, testing, and treatment options. If you do not have a health care provider, please contact the ADH call center at 1-800-803-7847 to locate a local health unit near you. Antiviral drugs are also available for the treatment of the illness. Although most cases are self-limiting without treatment, you might need treatment if you have severe disease, are immunocompromised, have a history of atopic dermatitis or other active exfoliative skin conditions, are pregnant or breastfeeding, or have a concurrent disease or other comorbidities. Decisions about treatment should always be discussed with your medical provider. Treatment can also be used when lesions develop in the eyes, mouth, or other anatomical areas where Mpox virus infection might constitute a special hazard (e.g., the genitals or anus). - Currently, there is no treatment explicitly approved for Mpox virus infections. However, antivirals developed for use in patients with smallpox may prove beneficial against Mpox. TPOXX is an antiviral medication being used as an investigational treatment. If your medical provider feels this would benefit you, please contact ADH at 1-800-803-7847. There are vaccines available for people who meet the criteria. It is recommended that you talk with your healthcare provider before being vaccinated. The preferred vaccine to protect against Mpox is Jynneos, which is a two-dose vaccine. It takes 14 days after getting the second dose of Jynneos for its immune protection to reach its maximum. The vaccine is not effective once symptoms have started. Vaccine Location Map For Providers Testing is currently available through several large commercial laboratories, including LabCorp, Quest, Aegis, Sonic Healthcare, and Mayo Labs. For providers planning to test through a commercial lab, there is no need to contact ADH prior to testing. For providers needing to test through ADH's Glen F.
