An EUA is a process to facilitate the availability and use of: 1.A new treatment or test 2.An existing treatment or test for a new indication In effect for as long as the public health emergency lasts Goal: provide access to medical products that may potentially be used when there are no adequate, approved, and available options. Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) FDA Approval Approval based on the \"best available evidence\" Balance the potential risks and benefits of the products based on the data currently available. Can be revised or revoked by the FDA at any time as evaluation of data continues and patient needs during the public health emergency.Approval based on \"substantial evidence\" that the drug is effective for its intended use The benefits of the drug outweigh its risks when used according to the product's approved labeling. Can be revised or revoked by the FDA for safety or effectiveness reasonsFor use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 16 years of age and olderProduction Timeline https://www.fda.gov/media/144325/downloadTrial Design Phase 2/3 randomized (1:1), double-blinded placebo-controlled, multi-center, multi-national study to evaluate safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine - US, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, South Africa, Turkey Participants 43,448 participants (21720 vaccine, 21728 placebo) Primary Endpoints1.

History of SARS-CoV-2 infection Yes Current SARS-CoV-2 infection Yes - but defer until recovery from acute illness and criteria met to discontinue isolation Previously received passive antibody therapy for COVID-19Yes - but defer for at least 90 days to avoid interference of the treatment with vaccine- induced immune responses Known SARS-CoV-2 exposure (i.e., community/outpatient setting, congregate setting)Yes - consider waiting until after quarantine period Vaccination of Special Populations Pfizer-BioNTechand ModernaCOVID-19 Vaccines Recipient ConsiderationsOk to receive COVID-19 Vaccine? Underlying medical conditionsYes - if no contraindications Immunocompromised Yes - if no contraindications. Counsel on: 1.Unknown vaccine safety and efficacy profiles 2.Potential for reduced immune response 3.Need to continue to follow all current public health guidance Pregnant Per guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, if a woman is part of a group (e.g., healthcare personnel) who is recommended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and is pregnant, she may choose to be vaccinated. A discussion with her healthcare provider can help her make an informed decision. Considerations for vaccination: level of COVID-19 community transmission personal risk of contracting COVID-19 (occupation or other activities) risk of COVID-19 to her and to fetus efficacy of vaccine known side effects of vaccine lack of data about vaccine in pregnancy Breastfeeding/lactating Per guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, If a woman is part of a group (e.g., healthcare personnel) who is recommended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and is breastfeeding/lactating, she may choose to be vaccinated.Contraindications & Precautions to mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination Pfizer-BioNTechand ModernaCOVID-19 Vaccines Contraindication: Known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or to any of its components Precaution: Immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components Should avoid additional doses of either mRNA vaccine unless evaluated by an allergist- immunologist and it is determined safe to receive (e.g., under observation, in medical setting) Any immediate allergic reaction to any other vaccine or injectable therapy (i.e., IM, IV, SQ vaccines or therapies not related to a component of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine) Immunocompromised persons, those receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to the vaccineIngredients included in mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Description Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate Sodium acetate sucrose sucroseWhat is NOT in the vaccines NO pork NO gelatin NO fetal cells NO microchip NO live/attenuated/inactivated virus NO egg NO preservative NO adjuvantDistinguishing allergic reactions from other types of reactions Characteristic Immediate allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)Vasovagal reaction Vaccine side effects (local and systemic) Timing after vaccination Most occur within 15-30 minutes of vaccination Most occur within 15 minutes Median of 1 to 3 days after vaccination (with most occurring day after vaccination) Signs and symptoms Constitutional Feeling of impending doom Feeling warm or cold Fever, chills, fatigue Cutaneous Skin symptoms present in ~90% of people with anaphylaxis, including pruritus, urticaria, flushing, angioedemaPallor, diaphoresis, clammy skin, sensation facial warmthPain, erythema or swelling at injection site; lymphadenopathy in same arm as vaccination Neurologic Confusion, disorientation, dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, loss of consciousnessDizziness, lightheadedness, syncope (often after prodromal symptoms for a few seconds or minutes), weakness, changes in vision (such as spots of flickering lights, tunnel vision), changes in hearingHeadache Respiratory Shortness of breath, wheezing, bronchospasm, stridor, hypoxiaVariable; if accompanied by anxiety, may have an elevated respiratory raten/a Cardiovascular Hypotension, tachycardia Variable; may have hypotension or bradycardia during syncopal eventn/a Gastrointestinal Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea Nausea, vomiting Vomiting or diarrhea may occur Musculoskeletal n/a n/a Myalgia, arthralgia Vaccine COVID-19No Yes YesNeither Contraindication nor Precaution to mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine History of allergic reactions not related to vaccines, injectable therapies, components of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, or polysorbates, including: Food Pet dander Venom Environment Oral medications Latex Eggs GelatinSafety Monitoring Post Vaccination Patient Counseling for Vaccination BEFORE Vaccination Counsel on the expected local and systemic post-vaccination symptoms Complete the series even if they develop post-vaccination symptoms (that are not contraindications) AFTER Vaccination Protection from vaccine is not immediate - will take 1-2 weeks after second dose to be considered fully vaccinated No vaccine is 100% effective - continue to follow public health guidance to protect themselves May take antipyretic or analgesic for treatment of post-vaccination symptoms Routine prophylaxis to prevent these symptoms is not recommended at this time due to lack of information on impact on vaccine-induced antibody responseResources for healthcare providers with questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines: MDH: health.covid.vaccine@state.mn.us or call 651-201-5414, pm CDC: 1-800-232-4636 (800-CDC-INFO) Coronavirus Disease 2019 Questions open 24 hours, 7 days a week, including holidays, CDC INFO | CDC Pfizer "}
