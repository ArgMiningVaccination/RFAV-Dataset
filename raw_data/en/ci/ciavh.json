When I was introduced to essential oils and experienced the healing powers of the plant world, I knew that I had found my passion. I decided to work towards aromatherapy certification and learn more about the healing properties of essential oils to intelligently and safely share my knowledge to help others. After 6 months of researching schools I chose the Essence of Thyme College of Holistic Studies and it was one of the best decisions that I made in my life.\" \u2014 Mary Monteiro Yvonne Brodka Taking the Essence of Thyme aromatherapy program was one of the best decisions of my life. I've always had a love for essential oils and when I found the Essence of Thyme online course I knew it was time to start my journey into the world of holistic medicine.

I highly recommend this program to anyone interested in learning or furthering their education in aromatherapy. "}
