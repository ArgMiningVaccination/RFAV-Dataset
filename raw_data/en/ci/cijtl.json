This is a unique place\u2014one that balances on the twin foundations of faith and science. Being a student here will expose you to a group of faculty and staff members who have chosen to be part of this experience we call Loma Linda. They have chosen to work here because they share in the belief that this is a special place. We emphasize what we call mission-focused learning. This means that what we offer centers on more than producing knowledgeable professionals because we believe that who you are is even more important than what you know. To assist in this lifelong process, we are encouraging the enculturation of our seven core values, known by the acronym JCHIEFS. These values are Justice, Compassion, Humility, Integrity, Excellence, Freedom, and Self-Control/Purity. I encourage each of you to search your own heart and nd ways to strengthen these virtues in everything you do. You also will nd an incredible mixture of cultural diversity on our campus. Revel in our similarities and differences, and use each interaction to help you understand the issues that separate us. With understanding comes acceptance. And with acceptance come peace and fellowship. Use your time at Loma Linda to seek out those from other countries and cultures from whom you can learn and gain greater understanding. We will all be better as we tear down those barriers that often separate us.All this uniqueness is centered on the profound belief that God is here, active in the lives and experiences of each of us. Through our weekly University at Worship, the prayers of faculty members in class, and the daily interchanges across campus, I invite you to join me in getting to know Him better. Place your future in His hands. Have condence in His leading. Seek out opportunities to fellowship and grow in His love. Thank you for joining our campus family. I hope it will become as special to you as it has for so many of our 47,000 alumni. Cordially yours, Richard H. Hart, M.D., Dr.P .H. President Loma Linda University10 Programs, Degrees, and Certicates Programs, Degrees, and Certicates The degree and certicate curricula at Loma Linda University are under continuous review and are, therefore, subject to change and improvement without prior notice, as the need occurs. The University also offers nondegree and short courses throughout the United States and globally to meet the continuing education and extension program needs of alumni, health professionals, and lay persons in the church and in the community. Most degree courses are approved for continuing education credit. School-specic certicates are awarded upon completion of organized programs of study at the postsecondary level. Students register for courses through the Ofce of University Records; but certicates are issued by the school, which maintains records of the certicates and their awarding. Financial aid is not available to students registered in school- specic programs. See school programs in each school for a listing of school-specic certicates available. The Faculty of Graduate Studies oversees Ph.D. and research master's degrees, as well as combined degrees programs.

In 1905, the University (formerly College of Medical Evangelists) was founded\u2014through a series of divine providences\u2014at Loma Linda, California, by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The School of Nursing began in 1905. In 1909, the College of Medical Evangelists received its charter as a medical school with the express purpose of preparing physicians who could meet the needs of the whole person. Both schools emphasized the need for healthful living as a part of medical care\u2014a revolutionary concept in 1905. The University was designated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as a center for educating health professionals. The original schools\u2014Nursing and Medicine\u2014have been joined by Allied Health Professions, Behavioral Health, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Religion; and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. University curricula are approved by their respective professional organizations. From its small beginnings, the University has achieved widespread recognition, having sent more of its graduates into international service than has any other university. It remains committed to the vision of its founders and is sustained by its close association with the church. From 1913 to 1962, the University operated within health facilities in two cities: Loma Linda and Los Angeles. In September 1962, all health professional education was consolidated at Loma Linda. In 1967, Loma Linda University Medical Center opened in its new three-tower facility \u2014a landmark cloverleaf structure. The medical center continues on the cutting edge of health care, providing excellent service for patients and expanding educational opportunities for students. In 1990, the Board of Trustees designated Loma Linda University a health sciences university\u2014part of a complex that includes Loma Linda University Medical Center, faculty practice plans, and afliated institutions. The University is a leader in the eld of health sciences education, research, and service. The most current campus census gures (Spring 2020) indicate that the core of the combined faculties consists of 2,107 full-time faculty. Part- time and voluntary faculty (1,327\u2014largely clinicians in the professional curricula) bring the total to 3,434. As of Autumn Quarter 2019, 553 students from 78 countries outside the United States are represented in the enrollment of 4,462. A century of service Today, the original 1905 property is part of an expanding health sciences campus that includes: six medical facilities, licensed for approximately 1,076 beds\u2014 Loma Linda University Medical Children's Hospital (LLUCH), 1993; University Medical Center East Campus Hospital (LLUECH), 2003; licensed under LLUMC as Loma Linda University Community Medical Center (LLUCMC), 1993\u2014formerly known as Loma Linda Community Hospital; Loma Linda University Heart and Surgical Hospital (LLUHSH), 2009;Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center (LLUBMC)\u2014an acute psychiatric care facility\u20141991; Loma Linda University Medical Center-Murrieta, 2011. twelve Loma Linda University Health (LLUH) institutes, two LLUH- related research centers, and various school-related research centers (see Learning Environment (p. 20)).

Mankind's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise in an environment permeated by religious values benets the individual and society and advances the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. \"Wholeness means the lifelong, harmonious development of the physical, intellectual, emotional, relational, cultural, and spiritual dimensions of a person's life, unied through a loving relationship with God and expressed in generous service to others. \" Quoted in \"The Grace of Wholeness\" by Gerald R. Winslow, Ph.D., SCOPE , Spring 1999. Also quoted as the adopted denition of wholeness in the Loma Linda University Wholeness Inventory. Core Values of Loma Linda University The University afrms these values as central to its view of education: JUSTICE\u2014 The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renouncing all forms of unfair discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith could be genuine only when it led the believers to \"seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphans, [and] plead for the widow. \" COMPASSION \u2014The sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and sufferings of others. Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan, which Loma Linda University has taken as a central symbol of its work. HUMILITY\u2014 The willingness to serve others in a sacricial manner, and the self-respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance. INTEGRITY \u2014The quality of living a unied life in which one's convictions are well-considered and match one's actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. EXCELLENCE \u2014The commitment to exceed minimum standards and expectations. FREEDOM\u2014 The competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery but to freedom. PURITY/SELF-CONTROL\u2014 The commitment to be morally upright and moderate in all things, with complete control over one's emotions, desires, and actions. Institutional Learning Outcomes Loma Linda University's institutional learning outcomes (ILOs) for students are assessed throughout the degree programs within the University appropriate for the discipline and degree. The Ofce of Educational Effectiveness works with these programs to guideLoma Linda University 2020-2021 19 their assessment. For more in-depth information about LLU's ILO assessment, please see < http://www.llu.edu/central/assessment>. (http://www.llu.edu/central/assessment/ ) Critical thinking: Students demonstrate critical thinking through examination of ideas and evidence before formulating an opinion or conclusion. Information literacy : Students demonstrate the ability to identify, locate, evaluate, utilize, and share information. Oral communication : Students demonstrate effective oral communication skills in English. Quantitative reasoning : Students demonstrate the ability to reason and develop evidence-based decisions using numerical information. Written communication : Students demonstrate effective written communication skills in English. Mission-focused learning outcomes Loma Linda University's three mission-focused learning outcomes (MFLOs) are rmly rooted in its mission, vision, and values ( p. 18). Because mission-focused learning is LLU's culture, the University is developing specialized assessment processes to ensure integration of these outcomes over time. Wholeness : Students integrate wholeness in their personal and professional lives: Loved by God, growing in health, living with purpose in community. Values : Students integrate LLU's Christ-centered values in their personal and professional lives. University Mace, Coat of Arms, and Seal Traditionally, the ceremonial mace represents the authority vested in the highest ofcer of a governing body. In an educational institution, the authority symbolized by the mace derives from respect for the authority of knowledge and for the rights and value of the individual. Thus the leader of an academic community assumes the obligation and challenge to ensure for its members a climate conducive to growth in knowledge and grace. The construction of the ceremonial mace of Loma Linda University evokes further ideas. Its two metals, bronze and aluminum, suggest the value of lessons both ancient and contemporary. Rather than lying prone, an instrument to be wielded, this mace stands upright in celebration of the human spirit. Its open construction implies free exposure to questions, ideas, and conflict. The eight vertical supporting elements (at three points bound together as for strength and stability in unity) uphold a graceful oval that points outward to the universe, the province of inquiry. Within the oval, the University seal appears to float unfettered. The basic design of the coat of arms and the seal of Loma Linda University \u2014established in 1905 as the College of Medical Evangelists\u2014is a contemporary modication of the shield, a heraldic device. Within the seal, the Christian cross\u2014a universal symbol\u2014acknowledges the role of Jesus Christ as Savior and Redeemer. The lighted torch\u2014part of our logo since 1959\u2014suggests the illuminating power of knowledge and the central role of the Holy Spirit in teaching andhealing. It also references the institution's call to serve as a light to the world. The ancient staff of Aesculapius, long associated with medicine\u2014and part of our logo since the 1920s\u2014represents in the modern and broad sense the combined services of all the healing arts and sciences. Across the base of the shield, the open book symbolizes the Word of God\u2014the foundation of all truth, the source of the Christ-centered commission, the inspiration for all endeavor of humanity for humanity. Framing the shield are, at the left, the branch of oak leaves and acorns, presented in ancient times to honor the civic contribution of one who had saved his brother-citizen's life; and, at the right, the laurel branch, presented to honor personal achievement. Shown together, the oak and laurel branches form a wreath\u2014suggesting that the life-saving and life- enhancing work of the health sciences brings with it an obligation to act honorably, courageously, and selflessly. The emblems of the seal imply that one who has the privilege of learning also has the obligation of valor and honor. On the scroll below the shield is the motto\u2014adopted in 1955 on the occasion of the ftieth anniversary of this institution\u2014\"To Make Man Whole. \" A Unique University Loma Linda University has always combined a devotion to academic excellence with a concern for spiritual values and a high sense of mission. The motto of the University, \"To make man whole, \" illustrates the sense of destiny felt in the University community to act its part in God's ongoing plan for healing and restoring human beings to live with Him in wholeness, both now and in eternity. While Loma Linda University has changed in many ways since its beginning in 1905, the biblical principles that provide its foundation have remained unchanged. Seventh-day Adventist heritage Loma Linda University is owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and has deep commitment to respecting the rich diversity of its student body. Students come from many different faiths, and respect and sensitivity for all people\u2014regardless of their culture or ethnicity\u2014are viewed as a part of true Christianity. This University has a tradition of religious liberty, and it highly respects students' religious values that differ from those of this academic community. The various perspectives of spiritually committed students are considered to be enriching to this campus and its educational environment. Our unique features Two distinctive features of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which are a part of the Loma Linda experience, become evident to rst-time students. The rst is the concept of Sabbath rest, which reminds us of God as Creator. Adventists realize this in part by celebrating Saturday as the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. During these hours, University ofces, laboratories, libraries, study halls, and recreation facilities are closed to give time for physical and spiritual renewal and worship. A second distinctive feature worth noting is the emphasis on health and wellness. Students will be able to exercise in our recreation and wellness center, a health-and-tness complex that received a national award for excellence in utility and design. Cafeterias on campus feature20 Spiritual Life well-prepared vegetarian meals. Note also that the University holds that a drug-, alcohol-, and tobacco-free lifestyle is essential for achieving the goal of \"wholeness. \" This means that all students agree to refrain from the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other \"recreational\" drugs while enrolled at the University. Spiritual Life Worship experiences represent a critical dimension of the educational experience at Loma Linda University and are available to the student many times throughout the week. In addition to regular Friday evening and Saturday services, many class, school, club, and University activities include a component of worship and praise to God. University at Worship services In keeping with the commitment of our mission, Loma Linda University students have special requirements, such as University at Worship attendance each Wednesday morning in the University Church. These programs provide a variety of opportunities to integrate faith and learning. Undergraduates who live in the residence halls are also expected to attend worships in the residence halls each week. Religion classes Classes in religion are part of the core curriculum in each of the University's schools and programs. These classes deal with the study of the Bible, ethics, clinical ministry (which concentrates on ways to understand and meet the spiritual needs of patients in a manner that is noninvasive and individually appropriate), and a variety of other issues related to the student's eld of study and personal spiritual journey. All students who choose Loma Linda as their university make a commitment to conduct their lives in a manner that reflects their sense of responsibility for the honor and integrity of the University and of themselves as members of its community. Learning Environment Loma Linda University is dedicated to creating a learning environment that promotes the lifelong pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, and skills used for selfless service to humankind. Through intentional educational strategies, Loma Linda University interweaves its vision, mission, and core values with its student learning outcomes. The University's mission of wholeness gives focus to the learning environment that balances mind, body, and spirit (psycho-social-physical-spiritual) and gives meaning to the motto of mission-focused learning. In this health-care institution, critical and analytical thinking skills in the health, behavioral, and natural sciences are blended with a commitment to spiritual and moral development. Loma Linda University pledges to students, staff, faculty, alumni, and the local and global communities its commitment to upholding integrity, valuing diversity, engaging with the community in service learning scholarship, and honoring the process of ongoing self-assessment for the purpose of continuous quality improvement. The University and each of its schools, programs, and classes provide clearly dened student learning outcomes and measurable performance indicators to create a learning atmosphere that is clear and focused. The University is engaged in systematic academic program review. Curricular maps are maintained for each program to assure alignment between student learning outcomes and planned academic activities.Program review follows carefully developed schedules as outlined in school-specic assessment matrices. Loma Linda University is committed to using assessment data to guide academic and scal master planning for the University. The total resources of the University offer a wealth of opportunity to the student with initiative and willingness to develop individual capacity to the fullest extent. The academic resources, afliated clinical facilities, and community agencies constitute a rich educational environment both in classroom instruction and in guided experience. Major facilities utilized for clinical afliations and internships include the University Medical Center; the Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center; and numerous other hospitals and agencies located in the Redlands, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Los Angeles areas; as well as throughout the United States and abroad. In addition, students nd varied opportunities for service and learning in the immediate University community, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs. University student mission-focused learning opportunities SAC Health System (SACHS) Social Action Community Health System (SACHS) is a federally qualied health center afliated with Loma Linda University Health. It provides low-cost health services at several sites in the Inland Empire, including the new San Bernardino campus and the established SAC Norton campus. These clinical facilities provide educational opportunities for students and residents from Loma Linda, enabling them to become involved with patient care and community initiatives. This clinic network provides a wide spectrum of primary and specialty medical, dental care, and mental health services, and is an ideal site to work cross-culturally to develop an understanding of diverse populations. The San Manuel Gateway College is an integral part of the San Bernardino campus and provides certicate-level programs to high school graduates entering the health-care work force. Loma Linda University students interact with and assist in these training programs. Community-Academic Partners in Service (CAPS) Community-Academic Partners in Service (CAPS) is a Loma Linda University program directed by the Institute for Community Partnerships. The program serves as the on-campus hub for connecting students and staff with volunteer opportunities in the San Bernardino area that are mutually benecial and sustainable, that meet needs expressed by the local community, and that develop in students a lifelong passion for service. The numerous short-term and long-term community- engagement opportunities range from mentoring high school students, after-school tutoring, health education, college preparation, adult job skills, children's ministry, and a family soccer league. In addition to directly coordinating several programs, CAPS also works closely with local organizations to provide volunteer support for programs and events, and also facilitates students' service learning and community service placement needs. To serve, students create a volunteer interest prole and list interests and availability on the CAPS online volunteer system. They can sign up for upcoming service opportunities, or they will be notied when opportunities in line with their interests are available. More information on volunteer opportunities can be found by visiting the CAPS website: <caps.llu.edu (http://caps.llu.edu/ )>; by calling (909) 651-5011; or by visiting the CAPS ofce in the Councilors Student Pavilion, Room 1402.Loma Linda University 2020-2021 21 Del E.

Finances and employment United States immigration regulations and Loma Linda University require that international students must be prepared to provide an advance deposit and must provide documentation that additional funds will be forthcoming to meet school expenses. The deposit will be held by the University during the program of study and will be applied to the last quarter's tuition charge. Alternatively, the deposit may be refunded, less any outstanding balance on the account, if the student is denied a visa or terminates their program. Scholarships and assistantships for international students are scarce. The student should contact the Loma Linda University Financial Aid ofce and speak with a nancial aid advisor regarding availability and application information. F- and J-visa international students must obtain written authorization from International Student and Scholar Services before accepting any on- campus employment. Off-campus employment requires prior issue of a work permit by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. F- and J- visa students must limit their employment to 20 or fewer hours per week while registered for courses and while classes are in session. Regulations allow full-time work (40 hours or fewer per week) during school breaks and summer vacations (if a student's program allows summer quarters off). For questions, please call International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. Visas F-1 student visas Loma Linda University is authorized by the United States Department of Homeland Security to issue F-visa applications (i.e., I-20 forms). The F-1 student visa is the visa of choice for most international students coming to Loma Linda University. This visa allows some non-degree study (certicates and internships). Degree-earning students are subject to study load requirements and are allowed limited on-campus employment. The I-20 is issued after a student: has been accepted into a program and all ofcial transcripts (mark sheets) have been appropriately evaluated and received by the University, has paid the advance deposit, as required by their program, and has documented their nancial plan for the chosen program. International Student and Scholar Services can be contacted at 909/558-4955 for further information regarding the F-1 student visa and the regulations governing this visa.26 Division of General Studies J-visa exchange program Loma Linda University has an approved exchange visitor program under the U.S. Department of State. This J-visa exchange program is authorized to sponsor/host degree-earning students, non-degree (continuing education) students, student interns, short-term scholars, visiting professors, and research scholars. A J-visa application form (DS-2019) is issued after an exchange visitor has been accepted into a program, scholar position, or professor position; and has documented their nancial plan (including health insurance for the J-1 and all J-2 dependents). Loma Linda University also hosts exchange visitors who are sponsored by other organizations (e.g., Fulbright scholars). As a hosting institution, Loma Linda University has limited authority over these exchange visitors since the authority resides with the sponsoring organization. Under current exchange visitor regulations, J-2 dependents are allowed to enroll part or full time at Loma Linda University. Also, their credits earned can either be degree or non-degree applicable. J-1 exchange visitors are allowed to work; but employment guidelines differ, depending on the exchange category. Contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955 for further information and regulations governing the exchange visitor program. Other visas International students may enter the U.S. on a wide variety of visas. However, a visa may have to be changed before a student can commence academic studies at this University. For further information regarding regulations and study options for specic visa types, contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. Transfer students International students currently attending other schools in the United States who have either an I-20 or a DS-2019 and who wish to attend Loma Linda University must do a school-to-school transfer. The timing of a transfer is critical in order to maintain visa status; therefore, it is important to consult with an international advisor at each school as soon as the acceptance letter is received. Study load Both the F- and J-student-visa regulations require the successful completion of a full study load during each quarter of every academic year (as dened by each program). A minimum of 12 units per quarter is usually considered full time for an undergraduate program; eight units per quarter is considered full time for a graduate program. In any quarter in which there will be a reduced study load, prior approval is needed from an international student advisor in International Student and Scholar Services.

Any single student who prefers to live on campus may do so providing accommodations are available; students are expected to live on campus unless they meet criteria as follow. married 21 years of age or older in a graduate program living with their parents Students who wish to live off campus but who do not meet one of the foregoing requirements may petition the vice president for student experience for a possible exception. This should be done well in advance of registration to allow the student adequate time to plan. Additional information about campus housing can be obtained from the housing website at < llu.edu/central/housing (http://www.llu.edu/central/ housing/ )>.32 Student Life The student must keep the University informed of their current address, telephone number, and other contact information. Marriage A student who marries or changes marital status during the academic year must provide the school with advance written notication of the change in status in order to keep school records correct and up to date. It is wise for students to make every effort to schedule their wedding ceremonies during academic recesses. Name change Currently enrolled students may change their names on University records when they provide evidence (e.g., certied copy of a marriage certicate) that the name change is ofcial. In addition to ling with the Ofce of University Records on University Records forms a request for change of name, the student must present a current ID card or other form of picture ID with their name as it appears on University records, along with ofcial documentation of the name change. Name changes must be processed no later than six months prior to graduation if the new name is to appear on the diploma. Professional apparel Clinic and laboratory apparel are distinctive articles of dress specied by the department or school. They are to be worn only in the manner prescribed and under the conditions specied in the school or department dress code. Student uniforms are to be maintained in clean, presentable condition. Information on the required professional dress is provided in Section III of this CATALOG and in the University Student Handbook . Personal appearance Students in the classroom or clinical environment must exhibit personal grooming consistent with expectations of the health-care institution, the profession, the school, and the University. Specic guidelines regarding grooming and attire are provided in Section III of this CATALOG and in the University Student Handbook . Personal property The school assumes no responsibility for the loss of the student's personal property, instruments, or other items by theft, re, or unknown causes. The student is expected to assume responsibility for the safekeeping of personal belongings. Cars and transportation Because the student is responsible for transportation arrangements and costs for special projects and off-campus clinics, it is advantageous for the student to have access to a car. The University enforces trafc rules and regulations as provided for by the State of California Vehicle Code. It is the sole responsibility of the driver of any vehicle on University property to become familiar with these regulations. Drivers are held responsible for any infraction of the regulations. Copies of the brochure entitled Loma Linda University Trafc and Parking Regulations are available at the Department of Security. Vehicles used by students on campus must be registered with the Department of Parking. Returning students must renew the registration of their vehicles online with the Department of Parking annually in September.Condentiality The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 requires that all health-care professionals maintain the highest level of condentiality in matters pertaining to clients. Discussions or written assignments relating to client information, either health related or personal, may not include identifying data. Clients' privacy and rights are to be protected. Failure to maintain condentiality could result in legal action. For additional information, see Introduction to HIPAA at <https://one.lluh.org/ vip/Departments/LLUSS-Departments/HIPAA-Information/HIPAA-Help/ Introduction-to-HIPAA (https://one.lluh.org/vip/Departments/LLUSS- Departments/HIPAA-Information/HIPAA-Help/Introduction-to-HIPAA/ )>. Substance abuse As a practical application of its motto, \"To make man whole, \" Loma Linda University is committed to providing a learning environment conducive to the fullest possible human development. Because the University holds that a lifestyle free of alcohol, tobacco, and recreational/illegal drugs is essential for achieving this goal, it maintains policies that foster a campus environment free of these substances. All students are expected to refrain from the use of tobacco, alcohol, or recreational or illegal mind-altering substances. Possession or use of these substances may be cause for dismissal. For details regarding the University's drug-free environment\u2014as well as information regarding prevention, detection, assessment, treatment, relapse prevention, condentiality, and discipline\u2014see the Loma Linda University Student Handbook , Section V, University Policies: Alcohol, controlled substances, and tobacco policy. Sexual harassment Sexual harassment is reprehensible and will not be tolerated by the University. It subverts the mission of the University and threatens the well-being, educational experience, and careers of students, faculty members, employees, and patients. Because of the sensitive nature of situations involving sexual harassment, and to assure speedy and condential resolution of these issues, affected students should contact the ofce of the dean of the school in which they are enrolled. A more comprehensive statement of the policy regarding sexual harassment and sexual standards can be found in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook , Section V, University Policies. Employment It is recommended that students limit work obligations (outside employment for income) that divert time, attention, and strength from the arduous tasks of class preparation, clinical practice, and/or training in their chosen career. A student wishing to work during the school year should consult the ofce of the dean of the school in which s/he is enrolled regarding employment restrictions or prohibitions. Employment for international students International students must obtain written authorization from International Student and Scholar Services before accepting any on- campus employment. Off-campus employment requires prior issue of a work permit by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. F- and J- visa students must limit their employment to 20 hours or fewer per week while registered for courses and while classes are in session. RegulationsLoma Linda University 2020-2021 33 allow full-time work (40 or fewer per week) during school breaks and summer vacations (if students' programs allow summer quarters off). For questions, please telephone International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. Academic authority The ofce of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled is the nal authority in all academic matters, with the exception of general education requirements, and is charged with the interpretation and enforcement of academic requirements. Any exceptions or changes in academic requirements, graduation requirements, or grades are not valid unless approved by the dean. Any actions taken by individual faculty members with regard to these matters are advisory only and are not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Academic integrity The academically dishonest act considers that academic dishonesty intentionally violates the community of trust upon which all learning is based, intentionally compromises the orderly transfer of knowledge from teacher to student, and is inconsistent with good professional and moral behavior. Accordingly, the penalty for academic dishonesty is severe. Acts of dishonesty include but are not limited to the following: theft falsifying or changing grades or other academic records plagiarism or excessive paraphrasing of someone else's work knowingly giving, obtaining, or falsifying information during examinations or other academic or professional practice assignments using unauthorized aids during examinations loud and disruptive behavior during lectures, demonstrations, or examinations excessive unexcused absences from classes or from clinical assignments \"Examinations\" are dened as regularly scheduled tests, quizzes (scheduled or unscheduled), nal examinations, comprehensive assessments, take-home tests, open-book tests, and any other assignment given by an instructor or preceptor whether for a grade, points toward a grade, or for zero points (e.g., a learning exercise). Instructors and students are responsible for reporting instances of academic dishonesty for investigation. An instructor may take immediate action during an examination or other point-generating activity in order to maintain the integrity of the academic process. Substantiated violations are to be brought before the designated disciplinary body for action. Disciplinary action may include receiving a failing grade on the examination or assignment, receiving a failing grade in the course, suspension, or permanent dismissal from the program. Conduct Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner during didactic and clinical training. Professional conduct includes, but is not limited to, punctuality and respect for other people, their property, and their right to learn. It also includes an appropriate respect for those in authority. Students of Loma Linda University are expected to behave in a manner that will not bring criticism upon themselves, the program, the school, or the University.Because students may be exposed to patients' relatives and friends in any public place, and because their conversations and their attitudes have an effect on those around them, students are asked to observe the following principles. Any information given to the student by a patient or contained in a medical record must be held in strict condence. Therefore, the discussion of a patient's diagnosis and treatment or other clinically related topics should be extremely guarded. A patient's family and community people may be listening and may incorrectly interpret the things discussed. Careless talk may lead to malpractice litigation. A joking or casual attitude toward illness and medical treatment should not be displayed since it may seem uncaring and be disturbing to those who are ill and suffering, as well as to the family members. Student and staff behavior in professional situations may be the deciding influence for or against Christian beliefs, values, and a health-enhancing lifestyle. An in-depth description of the professional conduct expected of students is contained in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook. Grievance procedure Grievances related to sexual harassment, racial harassment, or discrimination against the disabled shall be pursued in accordance with University policies specically relating to these items. Grievances related to academic matters or other issues covered by specic policies shall be made pursuant to the policies of the school in which the student is enrolled. A student who questions whether the process provided by the school has followed the policy of the school in regard to their grievance may request that the Ofce of the Provost conduct a review of the process used by the school in responding to their academic grievance. Students who believe that an error has been made or that they have been dealt with in an inappropriate manner by an ofce or nonacademic department of the University such as records, student nance, student affairs, health services, or Drayson Center, may seek correction by the following steps: 1.The student may put their complaint in writing and provide it to the head of the department or ofce involved. The student may request an appointment and discuss this matter with the department head. The department head will make a decision and provide a written answer to the student within 14 days of receiving the student's written complaint or meeting with the student, whichever is later. If the answer is not satisfactory to the student, they may\u2014 2.Put the complaint in writing and send it to the vice president for student experience for review. The matter will be considered at the next meeting of the dean's council, and the student will be informed in writing of the council's response within seven days of the council's consideration of the complaint. An individual may contact the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education for review of a complaint. The bureau may be contacted at 2535 Capitol Oaks Drive, Suite 400, Sacramento, CA 95833; email, http:// www.bppe.ca.gov (http://www.bppe.ca.gov/); telephone, 926/ 431-6924. Copyright violations The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, USC) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material. Under certain conditions specied in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specic conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be34 Academic Policies and Information \"used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research. \" If a user requests or later uses a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of \"fair use, \" that user may be liable for copyright infringement. This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulllment of the order would involve violation of copyright law. Communication devices All communication devices must be set to \"off\" or \"vibrate\" during class, laboratory, clinic, or chapel. No cell phones, PDAs, calculators, laptops, or other electronic or communication items may be used in the classroom, testing facility, or laboratory unless specically a part of that activity and approved by the faculty member in charge. Academic Policies and Information Academic credit (p. 34) Degree completion requirements (p. 35) Enrollment (p. 36) Satisfactory academic progress (p. 37) Scholastic standards (p. 39 ) Transfer credit (p. 41 ) Academic credit Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. In this section are the University regulations. See school specic pages for regulations that pertain to each school and program. Credit hour Credit is recorded in quarter units. A credit hour is dened as 50 minutes of direct faculty instruction per week for 10 weeks in a quarter (11 weeks including nals week) and two to three hours of out-of-class assignments for each unit of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time (e.g., condensed course taught in 5-weeks). Other academic activities require at least an equivalent amount of work per unit of credit. These include laboratory work [100 minutes when outside preparation required or 150 minutes when no outside preparation required], internships, practica, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. Course numbers Courses are numbered as: 001-099 nondegree-applicable credit 101-299 lower division 301-499 upper division graduate 601-699 graduate: seminar, research, thesis, or dissertation 701-899 professional or clinical 901-999 continuing education units, if preceded by letter prex ending with \"CE\" (e.g., ASCE 916); without undergraduate certicate clinical afliation/ practicum courses 500-level course work may not apply toward a baccalaureate degree unless the instructor approves it and both deans (dean of the schooloffering the course and dean of the school in which the student is enrolled) give permission, and provided the credit does not apply toward both an undergraduate and a graduate degree. Approval is not needed if the course is part of a coordinated program. No courses numbered in the 700s, 800s, or 900s may apply toward an undergraduate degree. Course waiver Certain course requirements in a program may be waived on the basis of previously completed course work, experience, or licensure. An examination for waiver credit, if required, may be taken only once and must be taken before the last quarter of the program of study. Waiver of a specic course requirement does not reduce the number of units required for a program or residency. A waiver examination does not carry academic credit and cannot be used to make up for a course in which an unsatisfactory grade was received. For examination fee, see Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section. Permission to waive a course requirement in the School of Pharmacy requires prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean. Credit by examination For certain courses offered by the University, a student in an undergraduate degree program may earn credit by passing an equivalency examination administered by the appropriate school and department. Such an examination is at least equal in scope and difculty to a nal examination in the course and may include materials supplied by CLEP or other agencies. A graduate program should be used to acquire new knowledge. Since the purpose of credit by examination is to validate prior knowledge, graduate credit may not be earned by examination. If a required course in the degree program is a repeat of prior learning, the student may request a waiver, thus making it possible to take elective courses that would increase knowledge. A student currently enrolled in a degree program at this University who desires credit by equivalency examination petitions the dean of the school offering the course, and, upon approval, pays a testing fee. See Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section for examination fee. Equivalency examinations may not duplicate credit already earned through coursework, including courses taken for audit. A grade of CR (Credit) is given only after the student has completed one quarter, or the equivalent, at this University; and has earned 12 units of credit with a grade point average of at least 2.0 in undergraduate courses. Units earned by equivalency may not be used as part of the enrolled load. Equivalency examinations must be taken before the nal quarter of residency. The maximum amount of credit that may be earned by equivalency examination is determined by each school but may not exceed a maximum of 20 percent of the units required for the degree or certicate.Loma Linda University 2020-2021 35 Degree completion requirements Catalog in effect for degree requirements Students are expected to fulll the curriculum requirements (including prerequisites required for admission) of the catalog year in effect at the time they matriculate to LLU. Subject to department approval, students may choose to complete degree requirements outlined in any CATALOG in effect during terms in which they are registered as accepted students in the selected program. A Change of Catalog form must be submitted no later than the deadline for submission of the Petition for Graduation for Graduate and Professional Programs or Undergraduate Intent to Graduate form. Submission deadlines are provided on these forms. Revisions to a student's program cannot be made during a student's last term. Inactive students, who have either formally withdrawn from a program or been administratively withdrawn for whatever reason, who subsequently re- apply to a program are subject to the program requirements published in the CATALOG in effect at the time of re-entry. For additional information, consult the full policy in the LLU policies available through LLUH One Portal (https://one.lluh.org/ ). Academic service learning Academic service learning is an education practice that takes learning into the community. A reciprocal relationship develops as students work with the community to identify focus areas and implement projects. Connecting classroom curricula with community needs deepens students' engagement in the community while enabling them to develop mental, physical, spiritual, and emotional capacities. Involvement engages students in critical thinking, community relationship building, practical action, leadership, and reflection useful in their professional lives. All students in degree programs (associate through doctoral) are required to complete an approved academic service-learning course prior to graduation. Courses currently approved to meet this requirement are as follows: School of Allied Health Professions AHCJ 328 Wholeness Portfolio I 1 AHCJ 494 Senior Portfolio II 3 AHCJ 519 Graduate Wholeness Portfolio 1 AHCJ 721 Wholeness Portfolio 1 CLSM 105 Procedures in Phlebotomy 4 CMSD 588 Educational Fieldwork II 8 DTCS 304 Community Nutrition 4 DTCS 589 Capstone Course in Nutrition and Dietetics 3 HLIF 570 Professional Portfolio 2 OCTH 604 Health, Society, and Participation 3 OCTH 702 Service Learning I 3 ORPR 540 Rehabilitative Care in Developing Nations 3 ORPR 522 Self-Care Portfolio and Community Outreach 2 PAST 572 Culture and Community for Physician Assistants 3 PTAS 265 Professional Seminar 1 RTMR 344 Professional Development and Service Learning 3 RTRA 614 Professional Portfolio 1 School of Behavioral Health CHLS 505 Cross-Cultural Perspectives in Health Care 3 School of DentistryDNES 200 Curricular Practical Training 0 DNES 500 Curricular Practical Training 0 DNES 504 Curricular Practical Training for IDP 0 School of Medicine BIOL 664 Science Communication Outreach 1 GEOL 464 Science Communication Outreach 1 GEOL 664 Science Communication Outreach 1 IBGS 525 Translational Research Training 2 MDCJ 821 Preventive Medicine and Population Health 1.5-6 School of Nursing NGRD 654 Social Determinants of Health 4 NRSG 415 Community Mental Health Nursing 4 NRSG 416L Public Health Nursing Clinical Laboratory 4 NRSG 434 Public Health Nursing Laboratory for the Working RN3 School of Pharmacy School of Public Health GLBH 545 Integrated Community Development 4 GLBH 565 Interventions in Community Health and Development I3 GLBH 567 Interventions in Community Health and Development II3 GLBH 569 Interventions in Community Health and Development III3 586 Building Healthy Communities: HPRO 537C Community Programs Laboratory\u2014C 1 NUTR 532 Community Nutrition Intervention II 1 PCOR 502 Public Health for a Healthy Lifestyle 5 PHCJ 610 Building Healthy Communities 3 PMED 541 Preventive Medicine in Public Health I 2 PMED 548 Preventive Medicine in Public Health VIII 2 School of Religion RELG 510 Christian Service 1,2 RELR 404 Christian Service 1,2 447A Service Learning 1 RELR and Health 3 RELT 534A Service Learning Practicum-International Project 1 RELT 534B Service Learning Practicum-USA Project 1 Graduation G.P .A. requirement The minimum cumulative G.P .A. required is 2.0 for an undergraduate degree and 3.0 for a graduate degree with no grade on an individual course less than specied by the school offering the degree program. See scholastic standards (p. 39 ) section of this CATALOG for details. Graduation The responsibility for meeting graduation requirements rests primarily upon the student. Therefore, students should read and understand the requirements as set forth in this CATALOG and consult carefully with their advisor to plan a sequence of courses each term that fullls these requirements. A student's program of study is governed by the36 Enrollment requirements listed in the University CATALOG at the time of admission; however, when circumstances demand, the University reserves the right to make changes with reference to admission, registration, tuition and fees, attendance, curriculum requirements, conduct, academic standing, candidacy, and graduation. The undergraduate who plans to graduate must submit an Undergraduate Intent to Graduate form two quarters prior to graduation, except for Summer Quarter graduation which requires submission three quarters prior. Graduate students must submit a Graduation Petition for graduate and professional program. See form for submission deadlines. Commencement exercises The candidate completing requirements in the Spring Quarter is expected to be present at commencement exercises. Permission for the degree to be conferred in absentia is contingent upon the recommendation of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled to the provost and can be granted only by the provost. If a candidate has not satisfactorily fullled all requirements, the University reserves the right to prohibit participation in commencement exercises. Diploma When the profession is named in the degree title, or when the degree is indicated by the school name, no other designation is included on the ofcial diploma issued to the graduate. When the profession or major is not named in the degree title, the profession or specialization is also indicated on the ofcial diploma. Enrollment Registration Standard term registration dates are published on the Web at < http:// www.llu.edu/students/university-records/registration-dates.php>. For programs that do not operate on standard term dates, the Registration Portal should be checked for specic registration dates and deadlines per student, as these dates can vary depending on where students are in their programs. Deadlines for courses taught in a condensed or extended format may differ from standard terms or program deadlines. Course-specic deadlines can be found in the course schedule at <http:// www.llu.edu/students/university-records/course-schedule.php > by selecting a course and clicking on the course reference number (CRN) link. Posted deadlines for registration on the Web and in the Registration Portal are in effect and binding. Students register online using their Registration Portal. Registration procedure includes clearing holds, entering courses, and clearing nance. Upon completion of their rst registration, the student must obtain an ID card at the University Ofce of Student Affairs. All future interactions in the Student Services Center will require presentation of a valid student ID card. A late registration period of ve business days after the term begins is provided for standard term programs. If the course is offered as an intensive, it is possible that registration will be required before the end of the ve days. A late registration fee of $200 will be charged during these ve business days for standard term courses. Students may not attend class without being registered. No credit is granted for academic work performed during any term without registration.Change in registration A change in registration requires reversal of nancial clearance in the Registration Portal if nancial clearance has been obtained and registration is still open for the student's program. Students have until 11:59 p.m. PST (Pacic Standard Time) the following day, or until the end of registration\u2014whichever is earlier\u2014to complete registration changes and to request nancial clearance again. If nancial clearance is not obtained by the end of the following day, any changes made in the Registration Portal will be reversed. Students are advised of this process via their LLU email accounts. A student may add courses that follow the standard-term University calendar during the rst seven calendar days of the quarter. Courses that follow the standard-term University calendar may be dropped during the rst 14 days of the quarter without academic penalty. Standard term course changes after the 14th day of the quarter affect the permanent grade record with a \"W\" indicating withdrawal. Students may withdraw from a standard-term course prior to 14 calendar days before the nal examination week, after which withdrawals are no longer permitted. Independent study Independent study may be undertaken subject to the consent of the department chair and/or the ofce of the dean of the student's school. The student is responsible for completion of the Directed/Independent Study Title Request (https://myllu.llu.edu/apps/studproc/istr/Start.php) form in addition to the regular registration. University policy limits directed study to 12 quarter units of undergraduate credit and eight units of graduate credit in a degree program. Individual programs may further limit these units. The ofce of the dean of the student's school should be consulted regarding limits on credit earned through independent study. Independent study is to be completed in adequate time before graduation to allow recording in the Ofce of University Records. Study load Usually an academic study load is dened in terms of credit units. Time Status Undergraduate Graduate Full-time At least 12 units At least 8 unit Three-quarter time 9 - 11.5 units 6 - 7.5 units Half-time 6 - 8.5 units 4 - 5.5 units Less than half-time 0 - 5.5 units 0 - 3.5 units The normal course load, including all course work for which a student may be registered at this or another institution, is 16 quarter units for an undergraduate student and 12 quarter units for a graduate student. Full-time study loads are those specied by the departments for each program. Students of exceptional ability may register for additional course work upon recommendation of the department and consent of the dean. A person who is not enrolled in regular courses but who is occupied in research, dissertation, or thesis, is classied as a student. By ling an academic load validation form every quarter at registration, the academic load may be validated for loan deferment and for living expenses for aid-eligible students or to maintain immigration status for international students. The faculty mentor who is primarily responsible for the student's research is required to sign the load validation form (electronic workflow) verifying that the student will be working on their research, thesis, or dissertation for a minimum of 18 hours per week (half-time status) or a minimum of 36 hours per week (full-time status). This is a projection each quarter.Loma Linda University 2020-2021 37 The faculty mentor before signing the load validation form for the current quarter must determine that the student indeed qualied for load validation in the previous quarter. Attendance Regular attendance at all appointments (class, clinic, laboratory, University at Worship) is required beginning with the rst day of each term. A pattern of absence, excused and/or unexcused, will be referred to the school's designated academic authority for consideration and action. Excused absences are dened as follow: Illness, veried by a physician's statement or ofcial statement from Student Health Service submitted to the school's designated academic authority Participation in an institution-sponsored activity (veried by a written statement from a faculty sponsor) Recognizable emergency approved by the school's designated academic authority Tardiness is disruptive, distracting, and inconsistent with professional behavior. Students who arrive after the beginning of class may be counted absent. Information regarding the school's designated academic authority can be obtained from the ofce of the dean. Continuous enrollment A student who has not enrolled for any courses, or paid the continuous registration fee for courses still in progress from a previous term, will be inactivated at the beginning of the second quarter of non-enrollment, unless they are on an approved leave of absence (maximum of four academic quarters, including Summer Quarter). For example, a student who enrolled for Autumn Quarter but who does not enroll for Winter Quarter will be inactivated at the close of registration (two weeks into the quarter) for the subsequent Spring Quarter. Inactivated or formally withdrawn students who wish to return to complete their degree programs are required to reapply with sufcient time for adequate review of any new transcript credits and advisement of any new program requirements. The reapplication process also requires the submission of ofcial transcripts from all colleges/universities attended since the student last attended this University. Ofcial transcripts from colleges/universities the student attended while enrolled at this University must also be submitted if they were not submitted prior to inactivation. Students who reapply to a program are subject to the program requirements published in the catalog in effect at the time of reentry. All graduates are expected to have documented current knowledge in their elds of study as of the date of graduation (date on diploma). Personal leave of absence A leave of absence is dened as being away from school for the remainder of the quarter, to a maximum of one year, with the intent to return. The appropriate program withdrawal form (https://myllu.llu.edu/ apps/studproc/pw/Start.php ) is an online workflow. This form is to be approved by the dean or their designee prior to the student's departure. Stipulations for re-entry are given to the student in writing. The student should consult the ofce of the dean of their school regarding the possibility of maintaining health coverage.Withdrawal To withdraw from a course(s), the student must complete an Add/Drop Registration form (http://www.llu.edu/assets/central/ssweb/documents/ regchange.pdf ). If a student nds it necessary to withdraw from a degree or certicate program, the dean (or their designee) must be notied in writing. The student then arranges for formal withdrawal from the program by ling a Program Withdrawal form (https://myllu.llu.edu/ apps/studproc/pw/Start.php ) which is a workflow available on the University website. The Program Withdrawal form and/or the Add/Drop Registration form should be completed as soon as possible after the student determines that they cannot complete the quarter. These forms must be led no later than 14 days prior to the end of the quarter. Courses dropped during the rst two weeks of the term are not included in the student's permanent record. If a student is discontinuing the entire program, the date the Program Withdrawal form is properly submitted to the Ofce of University Records will be the date of withdrawal used to calculate tuition refunds. Tuition is refunded according to the practice outlined in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG. Failure to le the Program Withdrawal form may result in unavoidable charges to the student's account. The tuition refund policy for off-campus students is listed under the applicable school in this CATALOG. Administrative withdrawal Students who fail to make arrangements for a leave of absence or continuing registration may be administratively withdrawn from school. After one quarter, if the student has not re-enrolled, their enrollment will be inactivated. Privacy rights of students in academic records Under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), students have full rights of privacy with regard to their academic records, including their grade reports. Grades are available to students online. The campus is authorized under FERPA to release directory information concerning students. The University has classied the following as student directory information that may be released: name, address (permanent and local), picture, marital status, birth date, school, program, class, previous college, and telephone number\u2014unless the student specically requests in writing that the information not be released. Directory information will be released only by the academic dean's ofce of the school in which the student is enrolled. Requests for directory information received by other ofces of the University will be transferred to the appropriate school ofce. The complete FERPA policy may be found in the Student Handbook. Satisfactory Academic Progress For the purposes of nancial aid eligibility, federal regulations governing Title IV HEA program funds require the University to establish a standard of satisfactory academic progress (SAP), and to monitor students' progress toward completion of a degree or certicate. Information relevant to the University's SAP standard is provided below. Student academic progress is evaluated at least once annually. For students in programs that are less than one academic year in length, academic progress is evaluated at the end of each enrollment period.38 Satisfactory Academic Progress Failure to meet the University's SAP standard requirements may result in nancial aid suspension. Financial aid will be reinstated only after eligibility is re-established. The satisfactory academic progress requirements below apply to all University students and are consistently applied, whether or not a student is receiving nancial aid. Evaluation measures Satisfactory academic progress is evaluated based on three measures: qualitative, quantitative, and maximum time frame. Qualitative. The qualitative measure species the grade point average (G.P .A.) that must be achieved at each evaluation. If the G.P .A. is not an appropriate qualitative measure, a comparable assessment measured against a norm will be used. Calculation of the G.P .A. does not include incompletes (I), withdrawals (W), or transfer courses; however, courses repeated for additional credit (such as seminars and research) will be included. Courses repeated for a better grade will include only the most recent grade in the G.P .A. calculation. Quantitative. The quantitative measure species the pace at which a student should progress through their educational program in order to successfully complete a sufcient number of units at a rate that ensures program completion within the maximum time frame. The pace at which a student is progressing is calculated by dividing the cumulative number of units the student has successfully completed by the cumulative number of units the student has attempted. Units (credit hours) transferred from another institution that are accepted toward the student's educational program will be counted as both attempted and completed units. Maximum time frame. The maximum time frame for an undergraduate program measured in units cannot exceed a period longer than 150 percent of the published length of the program. The maximum time for completion of a master's degree is ve years; the maximum time for completion of a doctoral degree is seven years\u2014except in the case of block programs. Calculation of the time frame begins with the term in which the rst LLU course applicable toward a degree or certicate is taken. Program requirements Undergraduate programs. Undergraduate students must maintain a cumulative G.P .A. of at least 2.0. They must also maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or exceeding two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. Maximum time for completion of an undergraduate program is a period no longer than 150 percent of the published length of the academic program, as measured in credit hours or in clock hours required and expressed in calendar time. Graduate programs. Graduate students must maintain a cumulative G.P .A. of at least 3.0. They must also maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or greater than two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. For programs with a limited or no research component, the number of units per term needed to complete the program on time will be determined by dividing the total number of units required for completion by the length of the program\u2014expressed in academic quarters (e.g., ve years for a master's degree equals twenty academic quarters). Research- intensive programs will provide information regarding the number of units that must be completed by the midpoint and three-quarters point of the program.Maximum time for completion of a master's degree is ve years; maximum time for completion of a doctoral degree is seven years\u2014 except in the case of block programs. Professional practice doctorates. All professional practice doctoral degrees (D.P .T ., Pharm.D., D.D.S., M.D.) are block programs requiring students to enroll full time. See specic programs below for SAP policy information. Doctor of Physical Therapy (entry-level D.P .T.). Students must maintain a cumulative G.P .A. of 3.0\u2014with no grade less than C (2.0) in any required course\u2014and must demonstrate satisfactory clinical performance. In addition, they must receive a grade of B or better in AHCJ 510 Human Gross Anatomy (taken during the rst quarter of the program). Students must maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or greater than two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. Students are expected to complete the program in three years; however, if a leave of absence becomes necessary, the maximum allowable time to degree completion is seven years. Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.). The G.P .A. required for graduation is 2.30. Students must maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or exceeding two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. In addition, students must hold a valid, nonprobationary intern pharmacist license. Six years is the maximum time allowed to degree completion, which is also the maximum time intern pharmacist licensure is granted by the California State Board of Pharmacy. Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.). Students must maintain a cumulative G.P .A. of 2.0. They must also maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or exceeding two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. Students are expected to complete the program in four years; however, the maximum allowable time to degree completion is six years. Doctor of Medicine (M.D.). In order to progress to the next academic year, students must not receive a U (Unsatisfactory) grade in any course. They must also maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or exceeding two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. Although students are expected to complete the program in four years, they are allowed to complete the rst two years (basic sciences) within three years before progressing to the clinical years (third and fourth years of the program). The two clinical years must be completed within three years. Loss of eligibility for nancial aid On the basis of the SAP evaluation, Title IV HEA program funds may be suspended for any of the following reasons: Student fails to achieve the required G.P .A. Student is not successfully completing their education program at the required pace. Student is unable to complete the program within the allotted time frame. The student is suspended from federal nancial aid eligibility only and may not receive additional nancial aid funds. However, they may continue enrollment at this University either without any nancial assistance or, if eligible, with the assistance of private loans. The Financial Aid Ofce can supply the student with additional information regarding these loans. Suspension letter A student who fails to meet the University's satisfactory academic progress standard will be informed in writing by the Financial Aid Ofce that nancial aid has been suspended until such time as the studentLoma Linda University 2020-2021 39 is again in compliance with SAP guidelines. The letter will include instructions regarding the appeal process. Appeal process Students may appeal loss of eligibility for nancial aid. Instructions for submitting a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal are available on the Web for students wishing to have their aid reinstated. The appeal must be led by the deadline specied in the letter of suspension, even if the student believes an error has been made in their case. The completed appeal must be submitted to the director of nancial aid, who will present it to the SAP Appeals Committee. The Financial Aid Ofce will notify the student in writing within ve business days following the decision by the appeals committee. The student is required to submit their appeal in writing. The appeal must include the following information: A full explanation of the circumstances that led to their inability to meet the minimum progress requirements. Supporting documentation verifying the circumstances. A personalized academic plan. With the assistance of their academic advisor, the student is expected to explore options available to eliminate deciencies; as well as to develop a realistic term-by- term listing of specic courses to be taken toward graduation; and non-course requirements to be completed (e.g., advancement to candidacy, qualifying examinations, dissertation defense). This plan is designed to ensure that the student will be able to meet the satisfactory academic progress standard by a specied point in time. The academic plan is signed by the academic advisor, department chair, and school academic dean. If the appeal is approved, the student will be expected to adhere to the units and courses specied in the academic plan portion of the appeal. The academic plan will be closely monitored by the Financial Aid Ofce staff. Failure to follow the courses and units outlined may constitute the basis for future denial of nancial aid. The progress of students on an academic plan will be reviewed at the end of one payment period, and then according to the academic plan; but not less frequently than the rest of the institution's population. Financial aid eligibility reinstatement A student who has failed to make satisfactory progress but who has appealed nancial aid suspension and has had eligibility for aid reinstated is placed on nancial aid probation. Clear nancial aid eligibility will be regained when they are again in compliance with the satisfactory academic progress standard. Scholastic standards Academic standing The following classications are based on scholastic performance: regular standing or academic probation, as dened by each school within the University. Student level Students enrolled in block programs are classied according to the level of the block in which they are enrolled (e.g., master's-1st, -2nd, or -3rd year; or freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, as is appropriate for the degree program; or PY1 [professional year 1]).Undergraduate students enrolled in non-block programs are classied based on the transfer credits accepted that fulll LLU degree requirements at the time of matriculation. Subsequent updates to classications will include units earned at LLU. Undergraduate classications are as follow: Student Level Quarter Units Freshman 0 - 44.9 Sophomore 45 - 89.9 Junior 90 - 134.9 Senior 135+ Grades and grade points The following grades and grade points are used in this University.

S none Satisfactory performance\u2014counted toward graduation. Equivalent to a C grade or better in undergraduate courses, or a B grade or better in graduate courses. An S grade is not computed in the grade point average. A student may request a grade of S in only a limited amount of coursework, as determined by the school in which the student is enrolled. This is done by the student's ling with the Ofce of University Records the appropriate form prior to fourteen calendar days before the nal examination week. Once led, the grade is not subject to change.40 Scholastic standards U none Unsatisfactory performance\u2014given only when performance for an S-specied course falls below a C grade level in an undergraduate course or a B grade level in a graduate course. Similar ling procedures as given for S grade above are required. The U grade is not computed in the grade point average. S/N none Satisfactory performance in a clock-hour course.

Such credit cannot be counted for nancial aid purposes. NC none No credit for unsatisfactory performance for a credit by examination. Does not count for any purpose. W Withdrawal\u2014given for withdrawal from a course prior to fourteen calendar days before the nal examination week for standard-term courses. Withdrawals during the rst fourteen calendar days of a quarter or the rst seven calendar days of a ve-week summer session are not recorded if the student les with the Ofce of University Records the appropriate form prior to the cut-off date. Withdrawals outside this time frame, upon recommendation of the dean, may be removed at the discretion of the provost. In the case of nontraditionally scheduled courses, a W notation will be given for withdrawal from a course prior to completion of 80 percent of the course, excluding the nal examination period. Withdrawals during the rst 20 percent of a course, excluding the nal examination period, are not recorded if the student les with the Ofce of University Records the appropriate form prior to the date when 20 percent of the course is completed. A student may withdraw only once from a named cognate course that s/ he is failing at the time of withdrawal. UW Unofcial Withdrawal\u2014indicates that the student discontinued class attendance after the close of registration but failed to withdraw ofcially.I Incomplete\u2014given when the majority of the course work has been completed and circumstances beyond a student's control result in the student being unable to complete the quarter. An I notation may be changed to a grade only by the instructor before the end of the following term (excluding summer sessions for those not in attendance during that term). Incomplete units are not calculated in the grade point average. By use of the petition form\u2014available online at https://home.llu.edu/ campus-and-spiritual-life/student-services/academic- life (https://home.llu.edu/campus-and-spiritual-life/ student-services/academic-life/ )\u2014the student requests an I notation from the instructor, stating the reason for the request and obtaining the signatures of the instructor, the department chair, and the associate dean. The instructor reports the I notation on the grade report form, as well as the grade the student will receive if the deciency is not removed within the time limit. The petition form is then led with the Ofce of University Records along with the grade report form. The I notation is not granted as a remedy for overload, failure on nal examination, absence from nal examination for other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. IP In Progress\u2014indicates that the course has a duration of more than a single term and will be completed by the student no later than the nal term of the course, not to exceed ve quarters for independent study and research courses (original quarter of registration plus four additional quarters). The student's nal grade will be reported on the instructor's grade report at the end of the term in which the course is completed. If the course work is not completed within the ve-quarter time limit, a grade of UW will be given. AU Audit\u2014indicates registration for attendance only, with 80 percent class attendance considered a requirement. A request to change a credit course to audit or an audit course to credit may be made no later than the fourteenth calendar day after the beginning of a quarter, or the seventh calendar day after the beginning of the ve-week summer session. (This does not apply to short summer courses lasting only a week or two.) AUW Audit Withdrawal\u2014given for withdrawing from a course, or to indicate that the 80 percent class attendance requirement was not met. Grade change Faculty members are responsible for evaluating and assigning grades. A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in arriving at or recording a grade. Such changes are permissible up to the end of the succeeding term. The faculty member must obtain the dean's signature on the change of grade form after the initial grade has been entered. Repeating a course Once grades have been posted for a course, a student wishing to improve their grade must repeat the course. When repeating a course, the student must attend class and laboratory sessions as ordinarily required and take all regularly scheduled examinations. The amount of tuition paid for repeated courses is determined by the school. Both the original and the repeat grades will appear on the student's permanent record, but onlyLoma Linda University 2020-2021 41 the repeat grade is computed in the G.P .A. and included in the total units earned. A student may repeat a course only once, and no more than two courses may be repeated in a student's degree program. Transcripts The University provides Loma Linda University transcripts to other institutions or to the student or graduate only upon the student's written or electronic request signature in accordance with FERPA. Transfer credit Denitions Accredited institution: An institution of higher education that has been granted institutional accreditation from a U.S. accrediting organization recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and/or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA); or an international institution of higher education that is recognized as a degree-granting institution by the government (e.g., Ministry of Education) in which the institution is located. Transfer credit: Academic credit earned at an accredited college or university other than Loma Linda University and applied toward a degree program at Loma Linda University. Extramural credit: Academic credit earned at another accredited college or university after matriculating to Loma Linda University, for the purpose of transferring the credit to Loma Linda University to apply towards a degree program. Credit accepted for transfer The Ofce of University Records will determine the transferability of courses according to University policy and standard transfer practices of accredited higher education institutions in the United States. In addition to the requirement for transfer credit to come from an accredited institution, the quality of the learning experience is considered. Credit must also be appropriate and applicable to the LLU program to which it is being transferred. Generally, credit for comparable courses earned in traditional classroom activities is accepted as transfer. The University may require a written, oral, or practical examination in any course for which transfer credit is requested. In such cases, an examination fee may be required. Extramural credit is to receive prior approval by University Records to ensure that course(s) meet transfer standards before the student enrolls in the selected course(s). Ofcial transcripts documenting the completion of extramural credit is to be received by University Records no later than 15 business days prior to the end of the term in which the degree is to be awarded. Credit is not awarded for extension courses not accepted toward a degree at the offering institution. International Credits submitted from a college outside the United States are evaluated on an individual basis by an evaluation center approved by Loma Linda University, which reports the evaluation results directly to the Ofce of University Admissions. It is the applicant's responsibility to contactan approved evaluation service and supply the required documents for evaluation. Undergraduate transfer credit The purpose of general education requirements is to broaden knowledge beyond what is required in the baccalaureate eld of study. For this reason, general education courses are expected to be completed in an institution providing liberal arts versus a career-focused institution in which courses may be taught with emphasis unique to a specic vocation. No transfer credit is given for a course briefly addressing the chief topics of a broad eld of knowledge if taken after a more comprehensive course on the topic. For example, a one-quarter survey/introductory physics course taken after general physics sequence or any portion of the sequence. A minimum grade of \"C\" (2.0) is required for all courses accepted for transfer credit. Grades of \"C-\"or below are not acceptable. Courses taken for pass/fail (S/U) will be accepted if the institution from which it was taken states in their catalog and/or notes on the transcript that a pass is equivalent to grade of \"C\" (2.0) or better. If it is equivalent to a grade of \"C-\", the course will not transfer. Remedial, developmental education, or other non-academic level coursework is not accepted for transfer or calculated in a student's grade point average. A maximum of 105 quarter units of lower-division credit will be accepted from accredited junior/community colleges. Vocation-specic courses Credit is accepted for vocation-specic courses to count toward units required in baccalaureate degree completion programs based on the following criteria: the school/program is recognized by the same programmatic accreditation organization that accredits the LLU program in the same discipline, the student has successfully passed the same program-specic licensure required of graduates of the LLU program, the course is substantially equivalent to course work at LLU, the courses are applicable to the LLU degree program to which the student is applying/currently enrolled, and must be within the 105 quarter-unit limit accepted from a junior/community college. Units transferred are based on actual units earned as posted on the awarding institution's transcript\u2014for a maximum of 50 quarter units. Only units for didactic courses are transferred\u2014no clinical courses. U.S. service schools Credit may be given for transfer from U.S. service schools carrying a baccalaureate credit recommendation in the latest Guide to the Evaluation of Education Experiences in the Armed Services (https:// www.acenet.edu/Programs-Services/Pages/Credit-Transcripts/military- guide-online.aspx ) provided by the American Council on Education (ACE). An ofcial Joint Services Transcript (JST) must be submitted for evaluation. Credit must be for subject matter relevant to the degree program at LLU. Credit may be awarded for physical education activity based on basic training as documented on a JST or physical education activity waived on submission of DD-214.42 Financial Policies and Information Credit by examination Credit is granted for scores of 3, 4, or 5 on Advanced Placement (AP) examinations taken while enrolled in secondary school and submitted by the College Entrance Examination Board. The amount of credit assigned AP examinations may not duplicate credit earned in subsequent college courses covering the same or similar content. In such cases, transfer credit will be based on the latest credit earned which would be the college course(s). Credit is granted for scores submitted by the College Board for examina- tions of the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) except for English composition. Credit for courses is granted according to recommendations by the American Council on Education (ACE). Students are allowed to challenge a given course by examination only once. Students must complete all CLEP credit within six months after the posting of the initial LLU degree audit online. Credit will not be awarded if previous coursework at the equivalent or at a more advanced level has been awarded or for courses that have been attempted and failed. Credit is granted for scores of 5, 6, or 7 earned on International Baccalaureate (IB) Examinations for higher-level subject examinations. General elective credit only is given. In other words, it does not fulll specic subject requirements. For example, credit in physics may fulll elective credit in natural sciences, but does not fulll a requirement for a general physics sequence. No credit is granted for \"standard\" or \"subsidiary\" level subjects. For additional information on undergraduate transfer credit, see LLU policies on the LLUH One Portal (https://one.lluh.org/ ). Graduate transfer credit For acceptance as transfer credit, courses must not have been previously applied to another degree program or curriculum. Academic standing may be given for courses applied to another degrees. Courses must be applicable to a graduate degree program at the issuing institution. The maximum number of didactic units that may be transferred toward an LLU graduate degree may not exceed 20 percent of the minimum didactic units required for the degree. In order to preserve the unique character of degrees from LLU, the combination of transfer credit and advanced standing must not exceed 40% of the didactic coursework at LLU as specied in the University Catalog, which excludes internships, practica, clinical experiences, research and courses in religion. The precise amount of transfer credit which is applicable toward a particular degree will be determined by the specic school and department concerned, not to exceed limit set here. Extramural credits taken through a consortium agreement (e.g., NEXus - the Nursing Education Xchange) may exceed the unit limit for transfer credit stated above. Consortium agreements must be approved by University Academic Affairs Committee. A minimum grade of \"B\" (3.0) is required for all courses accepted for transfer credit. Transfer of courses completed more than seven years prior to registration in the LLU graduate program are not eligible for transfer.Transfer-credit courses must be equivalent to courses identied in the program curriculum outlined in the University Catalog or dened as a cognate. Extension credits earned at another accredited institution are not accepted for transfer credit unless they are applicable to a graduate degree at the institution awarding the credit and must be approved by the dean of the school (LLU). For additional information on graduate transfer credit, see LLU policies on the LLUH One Portal (https://one.lluh.org/ ). Financial Policies and Information Students are expected to arrange for nancial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Accounts with other schools or with this University must be settled before enrollment. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees for each term are paid; therefore, students should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration periods for each academic year. Tuition and fees may vary from amounts shown. Please refer to the Student Account Disclosure statement for additional student account nancial information (<llu.edu/assets/central/ssweb/studentnance/ documents/disclosure.pdf (http://www.llu.edu/assets/central/ssweb/ studentnance/documents/disclosure.pdf )>).

Spouses of employees who are using the employee benet will be charged the enrollment fee. 6.Students participating in an off-campus or online program will not be charged the enrollment fee, unless the program specically requires this fee, or on-campus courses are taken. 7.Other school-specic fees will be charged independent of the enrollment fee. 8.Fees are refunded only during the 100 percent refund period.Loma Linda University 2020-2021 43 Other fees Late payment fee (term) $100 Late registration fee $200 Returned check fee $25 Lost check reissue fee $15 Returned direct deposit fee $15 Students who have not paid the balance due for registration, or who have not been awarded nancial aid sufcient to cover the balance prior to registration, will be charged a late payment fee. General practices Tuition payments/refunds Tuition and fees are due and payable in full to complete registration each term. If a student withdraws from a per-unit course or program, or from a block program up to 60 percent into a term, tuition will be refunded on a pro rata basis. Students who drop a course from a block program of courses will not receive a refund (please refer to the refund percentages and dates attached to individual courses). Fees are refunded only during the 100 percent refund period. Monthly statement The amount of the monthly statement is due and payable in full upon presentation or notication of statement availability. A student unable to meet this requirement must make proper arrangements with the director of student nance. An account that is more than thirty days past due is subject to a nance charge of .833 percent per month (10 percent per year). Failure to pay scheduled charges or to make proper arrangements will be reported to the respective school administrator and may cause the student to be considered absent, discontinued, or ineligible to take nal examinations. Students may also request that monthly statements be sent to a parent or sponsor. Financial clearance The student is expected to keep a clear nancial status at all times. Financial clearance must be obtained each term in order to complete registration before obtaining access to university services before marching for graduation before receiving a certicate or diploma before requesting a statement of completion, or other certication to be issued to any person, organization, or professional board All University registration holds must be cleared before nancial clearance can be granted. To obtain nancial clearance from the Student Loan Collections Ofce, students with campus-based student loans must be current on all scheduled loan account payments and must have fully completed a loan exit interview after ceasing to be enrolled for at least half time at this University. If the student's loan accounts are not current, or an exit interview has not been fully completed, a hold will be placed by the Student Loan Collection Ofce on diploma, or degree verication; and P1E requests and other services may be denied. Please note that all student loans are reported to a credit bureau organization on a monthly basis. If a student fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the promissory note, the Student Loan Collection Ofce will accelerate the loan(s), place the student loan(s) in collection with an outside agency, and demand immediate payment of the entire unpaid balance\u2014including principal,interest due, late fees, other fees, collection costs, attorney costs, and legal costs.

At the close of the term of residence, both the room deposit and the key deposit are refunded after the dean's inspection and clearance and the student's return of the key. International student deposit Loma Linda University requires that international students be prepared to provide an advance deposit and provide documentation that additional funds will be forthcoming to meet school expenses. The deposit will be held by the University during the program of study and will be applied to the nal quarter's tuition and fees. Alternatively, the deposit may be refunded, less any outstanding balance on the account, if the student is denied a visa or terminates their program. Housing If a student is interested in on-campus/residential housing, application may be made online at < llu.edu/central/housing (http://www.llu.edu/ central/housing/ )>. International students International applicants (non-U.S. citizens and non-U.S. permanent residents) must meet all admissions requirements for the chosen program before an offer of acceptance can be issued. This includes providing evidence of their ability to meet estimated living expenses and all nancial obligations to the University that will occur during their program. After acceptance into the chosen program, the ofce of International Student and Scholar Services will contact international applicants and guide them through the appropriate procedures. For questions, please call International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. Health service A student enrolled in an on-campus certicate or degree program may be covered by the Student Health Plan provisions. Non-degree students taking more than four units (ve units for School of Allied Health Professions) may also be covered by the plan. Please view student registration portal for notice of coverage. A non-degree student may request and pay for health plan coverage if s/he is a part-time student who has been accepted into a board-approved (degree or certicate) program and is currently registered for up to and including four units. For further information, see the Student Health Plan in the Student Life section of this CATALOG. Student aid The Ofce of Financial Aid strives to provide prospective and enrolled students with information and resources to nancially support their educational goals. Through the administration of federal student aid programs, state grant programs, and University-based institutional loans and scholarships, the nancial aid ofce assists students in removing nancial barriers to obtaining a higher education. It is the responsibility of LLU to ensure that funds are administered according to federal and state law.Applying for aid To apply for nancial aid, citizens and eligible noncitizens must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), available online at < (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov )https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa (https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa/)>. The FAFSA became available October 1, 2019, for the 2020-2021 academic year. Completing an application as soon as possible is strongly recommended. Results of the FAFSA, called the Student Aid Report (SAR), will be electronically sent to Loma Linda University if the student listed the institution on the application. The school code for LLU is 001218. The FAFSA must be completed for each academic year. International students are not eligible for U.S. government assistance. International students may receive private funding, such as private educational loans, from a lending institution or bank. Lenders may require international students to have a cosigner who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Please contact the lending institution for more information on the application process and the terms and conditions of the applicable loans. Students must be enrolled in an eligible degree or certicate program to receive nancial aid. Additionally, most nancial aid programs require a student to be attending at least half time in eligible units/hours. Eligibility Eligibility for need-based nancial aid is determined by many factors, including the family's income, assets, family size, and number in college. All information is used to calculate the expected family contribution (EFC). The EFC formula is found in Part F of Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965, as amended. Updates are published in the Federal Register. Eligibility for need-based funds is calculated by subtracting a student's EFC from the estimated cost of attendance. Non-need-based aid is nancial aid that is not based on one's EFC. If a student requires additional aid, they may apply for other non-need-based forms of aid to supplement the cost of attendance. Non-need-based aid may not exceed a student's estimated cost of attendance minus any other assistance they have been awarded. Students must apply for need- based funding and complete a FAFSA to receive most forms of non-need- based assistance. Merit-based aid is given without regard to nancial need. Merit-based aid is typically awarded based on academic achievements, talents, demographic characteristics, and other criteria. Students seeking merit- based aid may apply to outside agencies or contact their programs to inquire about availability. The Ofce of Financial Aid does not select recipients for merit-based aid. For more information on eligibility and general requirements students must meet, please visit <http://www.llu.edu/students/nancial-aid/ eligibility.php> (http://www.llu.edu/students/nancial-aid/eligibility.php ). Financial aid awards If a student is eligible for nancial aid, their need may be funded by various sources. Students who met the priority funding deadline (March 2, 2020, for the 2020-2021 academic year) were given greatest consideration during the awarding process. After the priority funding deadline, most funds are distributed on a rst-come, rst-served basis due to the limited availability of certain awards.

The curriculum in speech-language pathology and audiology, renamed communication sciences and disorders in 2009, was initiated in 1965 under the auspices of the College of Arts and Sciences of La Sierra University (formerly Loma Linda University, La Sierra campus). The program was transferred to the School of Allied Health Professions in 1987. Policies and procedures governing programs currently offered are detailed in this section of the CATALOG following information that pertains to all School of Allied Health students.

(Service) General regulations University students are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. It is important to review specic program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. Admissions policies and information Program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualied for the proposed curriculum and is capable of proting from the educational experience offered by this University. School admissions committees accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and signicant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of the School of Allied Health Professions looks for evidence of self-discipline, personal integrity, and intellectual vigor. The committee also looks for evidence that applicants possess the capabilities required to complete the full curriculum in the allotted time and to achieve the levels of competence required. Acceptance into any program is contingent on the recommendation of the department conducting the program. Most programs require an interview with the faculty. Loma Linda University was established to provide education in a distinctively Christian environment, and its students are expected to adopt Christian ethical and moral standards as a basis for their conduct. It must be understood further that, in harmony with the University's emphasis on health and the health professions and the practices of the supporting church, applicants who use tobacco, alcoholic beverages, or narcotics should not expect to be admitted. Loma Linda University is committed to equal opportunity and does not discriminate against qualied persons on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national or ethnic origin in its educational and admissions policies, nancial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or any University-administered program. It does, however, retain the right to give preference in student admissions to qualied Seventh-day Adventist applicants. While this right is retained, it should be emphasized that admission is not limited to Seventh-day Adventist applicants.Application and acceptance Where to write Correspondence about admission to all programs and requests for application information should be addressed to the Ofce of Admissions and Records, School of Allied Health Professions, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA 92350 or emailed to askalliedhealth@llu.edu.

A G.P .A. considerably higher than the minimum is expected because of the nature of the studies in many professional programs and the competition for the limited number of openings. In general, G.P .A.s between 2.5 and 3.0 are considered minimal, depending on the program. A minimum grade of C (2.0) is required for all college transfer courses. Student life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief.

Academic probation Students whose cumulative G.P .A. at the end of any quarter is less than the minimum required by the school or program will be placed on academic probation, and the number of units for subsequent registrations will be restricted to a maximum determined by the school or program. A student on academic probation jeopardizes their standing in a degree or certicate program.Academic residence In order to graduate from Loma Linda University with a bachelor's degree, a student must complete at least 32 of the last 48 units, or a minimum of 45 total units of course work, at this University. A minimum grade of C (2.0) or better is required for all B.S. and post-baccalaureate degrees. Graduation ceremonies Graduation events include formal ceremonies identied as conferring of degrees, awarding of diplomas, and recognition of candidates for degrees. Other related graduation events include the baccalaureate and vespers services. The conferring of degrees ceremony(ies) occurs at the close of Spring Quarter and includes an academic procession, the formal conferring of degrees by the president, and the presentation of diplomas by the dean of the school. Candidates who complete the requirements for degrees and certicates are invited, with families and friends, to attend and participate in these important and colorful events. To be eligible to participate in graduation events, candidates must have completed all requirements for the degree, including prerequisites and/or corequisites, as specied by the school. In certain degree programs, upon authorization of the dean, exceptions will be made for candidates who have only clinical experience requirements to complete and can project completion by the end of the calendar year can complete remaining degree requirements by the end of the Summer Quarter are in a block program The still in-progress coursework may not exceed eight units for graduate students or 12 units for undergraduate students. A student who completes the requirements for a degree or certicate (other than clinical experience) at the end of the Summer, Autumn, or Winter Quarter is invited to participate in the subsequent June commencement events. The ofcial date of graduation on the diploma is ordinarily the last day of the term in which requirements for a degree are completed. Superior academic performance and achievement in scholarship and leadership are recognized in the printed graduation program for persons who complete their baccalaureate degree and who at the end of the quarter preceding their nal term have acquired a cumulative grade point average for all college work (includes coursework taken at other colleges/ universities, except for remedial courses), as follows: 3.5 Graduation cum laude 3.8 Graduation magna cum laude 3.9 Graduation summa cum laude Although the ofcial commencement program indicates names of graduates who qualify for honors on the basis of their grade point averages as of the end of the quarter preceding their nal term, the subsequently issued diploma and transcript may indicate graduation with honors if the student's nal quarter record has increased the grade point average sufciently to qualify for honors at that time. Scholastic standing Repeating a course A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a required course and is required by the faculty to do additional work may request permission of the faculty to pursue one of the following plans. In either plan, the student must register and pay the applicable tuition. 1.Review the course work under supervision and take a make-up examination (usually not given before a minimum of two weeks ofLoma Linda University 2020-2021 49 study). A passing grade resulting from a repeat examination will be limited to a C (2.0). (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the tuition rate for tutorial course work.) 2.Repeat the course, attend class and/or laboratory, and take the nal course examination. Full tuition will be charged, whether regular or occasional attendance is required. (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the tuition rate.) A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a required clinical experience course and is required by the faculty to do additional work must re-register for the course. Both the original and repeat grades are entered in the student's permanent academic record, but only the repeat grade is computed in the grade point average. A course may be repeated only once. Promotion and probation Each student's record is reviewed quarterly by the faculty. Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic and professional performance and on factors related to aptitude, prociency, and responsiveness to the established aims of the school and of the profession. As an indication of satisfactory academic performance, the student is expected to maintain the following grade point average at a minimum: 2.0 Associate and baccalaureate degree programs 3.0 Master's degree program 3.0 Doctoral degree program A student whose grade point average in any term falls below the minimum required for the degree, who receives in any professional or required course a grade less than a C (2.0), or whose clinical performance is unsatisfactory is automatically placed on academic probation. Continued enrollment is subject to the recommendation of the department. If continued enrollment is not recommended, the case is referred to the school's Administrative Council for nal action. If continued enrollment is recommended, the student will be required to institute a learning assistance plan within the rst two weeks of the following quarter and to meet regularly scheduled appointments with the academic advisor. The learning assistance plan should: identify the problem, identify and list the goals, state the time frame, and include student and advisor signatures and date. A student who is on academic probation and fails to make the minimum required grade point average the following quarter or fails to have an overall minimum grade point average after two quarters will have disqualied him-/herself from the program. Standard of student progress (time framework) After initial enrollment in a program, students must complete program requirements within the following time frames: A.S. degree 3 years B.S. degree 5 years Master's degree 5 years Doctoral degree 7 years Additional requirements For additional policies governing Loma Linda University students, see general policies of the University (p. 34), as well as the University Student Handbook .

Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees for the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. General nancial practices The student is expected to arrange for nancial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Previous accounts with other schools or this University must have been settled.

Normal time to complete the program 34 weeks (three [3] academic quarters) based on full-time enrollment Respiratory Care \u2014 B.S., M.S.R.C. Respiratory care is an allied health profession that promotes health and improvement in the cardiopulmonary function of people with heart and lung abnormalities and disease. Newborn, pediatric, adult, and aging adult patients are treated for a wide range of problems\u2014infant respiratory distress syndrome, trauma, cardiopulmonary arrest, conditions brought on by shock, and postoperative surgical complications; as well as respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, asthma, cystic brosis, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. The respiratory care practitioner is a member of the health-care team in medical centers, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient rehabilitation programs, physician ofces, and in-home care. Many are involved in research and development of new and innovative care and equipment. They are effective communicators and compassionate caregivers, possessing an awareness of cultural sensitivity and diversity. They have leadership roles in patient education, wellness intervention, and development of respiratory care plans. Respiratory-care professionals apply critical thinking skills in cardiopulmonary diagnostics and patient assessment to optimize decision making and delivery of patient care. In a time of high technology, increasing growth of the older adult population, and increasing numbers of patients with asthma and chronic lung disease, there is a greater demand for educated and skilled respiratory care practitioners. Loma Linda University offers two Bachelor of Science degree curricula in respiratory care. The rst is for students who have had no previous education in respiratory care and who have completed the program prerequisites. The second is for students who have an Associate inScience degree in respiratory care from a CoARC-accredited respiratory care program and who wish to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in respiratory care. Professional association The American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) encourages students and graduates to become members and participate in national meetings and local chapters. The AARC's aim is to foster professional growth, encourage research, and provide services and representation for its members.

Herrmann A student who is interested in science, has an investigative mind that enjoys the challenge of solving problems quickly and accurately, and has a desire to help others should consider a career as a clinical laboratory scientist. Clinical laboratory scientists examine and analyze body fluids, tissues, and cells. They look for bacteria, parasites, or other microorganisms; analyze the chemical content of fluids; match blood for transfusions; and test for drug levels in the blood to show how a patient is responding to treatment. Clinical laboratory scientists perform complex chemical, biological, hematological, immunologic, microscopic, and bacteriologic tests. They use, maintain, and troubleshoot sophisticated laboratory equipment that is used to perform diagnostic tests. The clinical laboratory scientist possesses the scientic and diagnostic skills required for DNA and biomolecular technology and genetic engineering applications; and, analyzes and discusses test results with the medical staff. Opportunities Overall employment of medical laboratory professionals is projected to grow 11 percent through 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations, particularly as the volume of laboratory tests increases with population growth and with the development of new technology. Employment opportunities are excellent, with average vacancy rates of seven percent. The twenty-rst century is offering clinical laboratory76 Clinical Laboratory Science \u2014 B.S. scientists new avenues for test development, experimental design, administration, and education. Clinical laboratory scientists work in hospitals or similar medical facilities, clinical and reference laboratories, home health diagnostics, transfusion services, physicians' ofces, and private medical clinics. Employment is also available in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, health information systems, DNA technology and genetic engineering corporations, research laboratories, federal government agencies, forensics and crime investigation, veterinary hospitals, U.S. Public Health Service facilities, areas of medical product development, and customer and patient education.

Program director Matt Riding Medical director Pamela J. Wat Cytotechnology is a specialty within the broad eld of clinical laboratory sciences. The cytotechnologist, working under the direction of a pathologist, detects cell changes caused by different disease processes and is able to differentiate between normal, atypical, and malignant cell changes. In recognizing microscopic abnormalities of cells and cellular patterns from various body sites, the cytotechnologist assists the pathologist in detecting cancer at its earliest and potentially most curable stage. As a result, physicians are able to diagnose and treat cancer by alternate methods long before discovering its existence. Opportunities Cytotechnologists work in hospitals, clinics, and independent pathology laboratories. The employment outlook for cytotechnologists is favorable, with the demand for trained technologists exceeding the supply. Cytotechnologists can advance to supervisory positions, participate in research activities, or become teachers in the eld. Advancement is based on experience, skill, and advanced education. The program The two-year Cytotechnology Program leads to a Bachelor of Science degree. The Bachelor of Science degree program requires completion of two years of prerequisites at an accredited college or university. Accepted students transfer to the program at the junior year level. The program of study begins in the Fall Quarter. Upon satisfactory completion of the program, the student is awarded a Bachelor of Science degree and iseligible to take the national board of certication examination to become a registered cytotechnologist. The junior year includes lecture and laboratory, with an emphasis on basic cytology courses. The senior year includes an 11-week clinical practicum and advanced courses in histology, pathology, and laboratory management. Program learning outcomes By the end of this program, the graduate should be able to: 1.Accurately evaluate cellular abnormalities by applying differential diagnoses in the framework of patient outcome management; 2.Fulll the ethical role and responsibilities of the cytotechnologist; 3.Assess the results of quality assurance measures and institute proper procedures to maintain test accuracy; 4.Comprehend and apply sound principles of scientic research; 5.Advocate rules and regulations with emphasis on patient and workplace safety. Clinical afliations Multiple clinical afliations enrich the student's clinical training by providing exposure to different specimen types in the clinical environments.

Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) evaluate and treat children and adults who have communication, swallowing, and/or cognitive communication disorders. Difculties in the areas of speech, language, fluency, swallowing, and voice are associated with a variety of disorders, including developmental delay, hearing impairment, cleft palate, cerebral palsy, stroke, and head injury. Audiologists are involved in prevention, identication, assessment, and rehabilitation of hearing disorders. Students who choose these professions should be interested in working with people. Opportunities The entry level for speech-language pathology is the master's degree. The entry level for audiology is the doctoral degree. Employment opportunities for speech-language pathologists and audiologists are found in speech and hearing clinics, public schools, hospitals, universities, health departments, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, rehabilitation centers, industry, research institutes, and private practice. These environments allow for considerable flexibility. There is ample opportunity for employment as a speech-language pathologist. Employment opportunities for speech-language pathology assistants (SLPAs) include working under the supervision of a speech-language pathologist. Although SLPAs work primarily in schools, there are also employment opportunities in hospitals and private clinics. Students pursuing the Bachelor of Science degree may work toward meeting eligibility requirements for registration in the state of California as speech-language pathology assistants. Student professional association Students are eligible for membership in the National Student Speech- Language-Hearing Association (NSSLHA) and are also encouraged to become members, read the journals, and participate in the many activities sponsored by the local chapter.

(p. 88) Communication Sciences and Disorders \u2014 B.S. Program director Terry Douglas The curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in communication sciences and disorders begins Autumn Quarter of the junior year. The freshman and sophomore years, which are taken at an accredited college or university prior to coming to Loma Linda University, provide the fundamentals of a liberal arts education. The emphasis in the junior and senior years is on pre-professional courses and may include practical experience. Full-time enrollment in the undergraduate program is required; therefore, one of the considerations for acceptance into the bachelor's degree program is the student's ability to manage a full load of course work. There is no option to enter the program on a part-time basis; neither will a student be allowed to change from full-time to part-time status at any time during program progression. Courses are completed sequentially \u2014with prerequisite courses offered in a given quarter, followed by more advanced courses in a later quarter. Upon completion of the Bachelor of Science degree, students are prepared to seek admission to a graduate program in speech-language pathology or related disciplines. Students are encouraged to take CMSD 267 Speech-Language Pathology Assistant Fieldwork during their senior year in order to qualify for the speech-language pathology assistant license, issued by the California Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology Board. Program learning outcomes Students who graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in communication sciences and disorders will meet the University outcomes (p. 18). By the end of the program, graduates should be able to: 1.Articulate characteristics of typical human speech, language, hearing, communication, and swallowing processes; including their biological, neurological, acoustic, psychological, developmental, and linguistic and cultural bases; 2.Articulate characteristics of atypical human speech, language, hearing, communication, and swallowing; including etiological, biological, neurological, acoustic, psychological, developmental, and linguistic and cultural correlates ;82 Communication Sciences and Disorders \u2014 B.S. 3.Implement knowledge of basic clinical processes for the remediation of human speech, language, hearing, swallowing, and communication disorders and differences; 4.Incorporate cultural responsiveness to diversity (e.g., linguistic, neurological, economic, age, sexual, gender, ability, racial) within academic and/or professional environments ; 5.Use logical reasoning skills to evaluate, research and solve problems in communication sciences and disorders ; 6.Incorporate basic components of professional ethics when treating, counseling, advocating for, and documenting care for clients. Minimum grade required for graduation A minimum grade of C (2.0) is required for a course to qualify for graduation. Clinical experience A supervised clinical practicum is recommended but not required in the curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Science degree. Completion of specic courses precedes placement for practicum. Clinical practicum is available for students who have G.P .A.s of 3.0 or above in the major courses. Wholeness portfolio Undergraduate students in the School of Allied Health Professions develop portfolios during the junior and senior years. Students register for AHCJ 328 Wholeness Portfolio I during the junior year and AHCJ 498 Wholeness Portfolio II during the senior year. The purpose of the portfolio is to allow students to demonstrate achievement of the outcomes set by the University. These outcomes were developed to aid students in achieving personal and professional balance in the spiritual, intellectual, social/emotional, and physical domains. CLEP CLEP tests must be taken within one quarter of receiving the degree compliance report, otherwise, the course must be repeated. Student progress review Students must maintain a G.P .A. of 3.0 to ensure regular standing in the program. If the student's G.P .A. drops below 3.0 by the end of an academic quarter, s/he will be placed on academic probation for the following quarter. If the student's G.P .A. does not improve to at least 3.0 by the end of that quarter, s/he will be dismissed from the program. Each student's progress in the bachelor's degree curriculum is reviewed quarterly. Students are provided written feedback with recommendations for remediation if there are concerns about their academic or clinical performance. Speech-language pathology assistant Students pursuing the Bachelor of Science in speech-language pathology assistant degree may work toward meeting eligibility requirements for registration in the state of California as a speech-language pathology assistant.

Program director Karen Mainess The Master of Science degree in communication sciences and disorders offers preparation for careers in the professional practice of speech- language pathology. It provides a basis for graduate study and research at a more advanced level and encourages growth towards independence. The clinical services of the department, Loma Linda University Medical Center, and afliated practicum sites provide opportunity for supervised clinical experiences that represent the breadth and depth of the profession in a variety of settings. Upon completion of the Master of Science degree, graduates are eligible to:84 Communication Sciences and Disorders \u2014 M.S. receive the preliminary speech-language pathology services credential (California Commission on Teacher Credentialing); receive the temporary license in speech-language pathology (California Department of Consumer Affairs); and seek employment as clinical fellows, working towards the certicate of clinical competence (through the Council for Clinical Certication of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association). Two tracks lead to the Master of Science degree: Individuals who have completed a bachelor's degree in speech- language pathology or in communication disorders may apply for admission to the two-year master's degree program. Postbaccalaureate foundational course work completed at an institution other than Loma Linda University by applicants who have a bachelor's degree in a eld other than speech-language pathology or communication disorders is considered on an individual basis. In general, foundational course work completed at California state schools where undergraduate courses in communication sciences and disorders are required is acknowledged. Prior to admission or within the rst quarter of study (see Program of Study below), California Basic Education Skills Test (CBEST) scores are required. Individuals who have a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university, with a major in a eld other than speech-language pathology or communication disorders and who meet minimum requirements may apply for admission to the transitional three-year Master of Science degree curriculum. The program The curriculum consists of completing required graduate-level courses, supervised clinical practice, capstone research, and clinical presentations. The traditional Master of Science degree curriculum is two years in length. Full-time students will complete the curriculum in seven quarters, including the summer between the rst and the second years. Students begin the curriculum in the Autumn Quarter and go through the program as a cohort. Classes are scheduled in the late afternoon or early evening, and on one Friday per month. During the Winter Quarter and Spring Quarter of the second year, students take the full-time public school and medical eld work. *Note: Students may be required to go out of state for their full-time eldwork and, therefore, should be prepared nancially. Students enrolled in the three-year transitional master's degree curriculum will begin their program in the Autumn Quarter and go through as a cohort. During the rst year, students complete course work that provides the necessary foundation for the second- and third- year disorders courses and clinical practice. In the summer following the rst year, all students may be required to take the clinical practicum. Beginning with the second year, the transitional master's degree students join the cohort of new students in the two-year master's degree program.The two groups complete the remaining two years simultaneously. University student learning outcomes Students who graduate with a Master of Science degree in communication sciences and disorders will meet the University outcomes (p. 18).Program learning outcomes By the end of their program, students should be able to: 1.Apply knowledge of human communication disorders and differences and swallowing disorders; 2.Integrate skills in assessment and intervention of human communication disorders and differences and swallowing disorders; 3.Demonstrate knowledge of the role of the school-based pathologist; 4.Propose, prepare, and present discipline-related research; 5.Implement counseling principles and practices related to the discipline of speech-language pathology with diverse populations and across the lifespan; 6.Relate knowledge of service learning to community served. California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST) The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing requires that all students pursuing a credential pass the CBEST . The CBEST must be passed before beginning the graduate curriculum, or within the rst quarter. It is a measure of reading, writing, and mathematics prociency, and is required by law for anyone applying for a credential in the public schools of California and Oregon. This test is given by National Evaluation Systems, Inc., Box 340880, Sacramento, CA 95834-0880, 916/928-4001. Additional information may be found at <http://www.cbest.nesinc.com/ >. Praxis examination The Praxis (administered by a national testing service) is a multiple choice examination designed to evaluate students' broad-based knowledge across the disorders and is required for ASHA certication, for the California license, and for the California school credential. It is a nationally standardized and publicly administered test. A passing score of 162 must be achieved, and the test may be taken multiple times. Information about the Praxis may be obtained by going to < http:// www.ets.org/praxis (http://www.ets.org/praxis/)>. Students in the Master of Science degree curriculum in communication sciences and disorders are not required to take the Praxis while in the graduate program. However, taking the Praxis before graduation is a good idea. Remediation Alumni and graduate students who do not achieve a passing score on the Praxis may take any course and/or seminar offered by the department free of charge in order to refresh knowledge or remediate areas of concern. Graduate students who demonstrate unsatisfactory performance in the clinical courses CMSD 567 Clinical Practice in Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology, Advanced , CMSD 586 Educational CMSD 588 Educational Fieldwork II , CMSD 596 Medical Fieldwork I, or CMSD 597 Fieldwork II will be required to repeat the clinical experience and to register for CMSD 589 Remediation/Advanced Directed Teaching and/or CMSD 599 Remediation/Externship, respectively.

This profession focuses on the eld of health promotion; and medical nutrition therapy focuses on the science of nutrition, the art of food presentation, and management in providing nutrition care\u2014as well as instruction in proper food choices throughout life. Individuals and groups benet from the work of the registered dietitian, which leads potentially to better health and longer life. Dietetic practice is the application of principles derived from integrating knowledge of food, nutrition, biochemistry, physiology, business and management, journalism, and behavioral and social sciences; as well as the artistic presentation of food to achieve and maintain health, prevent disease, and facilitate recovery from illness. The coordinated program\u2014a joint effort of the School of Allied Health Professions and the School of Public Health\u2014offers students the option to pursue one of three degrees: B.S. degree in nutrition and dietetics M.S. degree in nutrition and dietetics M.P .H. degree in public health nutrition (described in the Nutrition Program of the School of Public Health section of the CATALOG) Each of these degrees culminates in eligibility to take the registration examination for dietitians.The student obtains the credential in dietetics upon successful completion of the registration examination offered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The coordinated program in dietetics combines didactic and supervised professional practice experiences to develop professional competencies concurrently with cognitive and technical skills that enable the graduate to establish eligibility to become a registered dietitian. The M.S. degree prepares entry-level dietitians to join the profession in areas of advanced practice and in specialty areas that will allow them to contribute to the wholeness of humankind. The graduate is awarded an M.S. degree in nutrition and dietetics. The curriculum comprises didacticand supervised professional practice experiences in a health-sciences, liberal arts environment to prepare an educated graduate. This curriculum includes theory, laboratory, research, and clinical experiences. Twelve hundred hours of supervised professional practice experiences are scheduled in medical nutrition therapy, community, and administrative nutrition. Students participate as active members of the nutrition-care team in clinical settings. Four choices are available to earn a Master of Science degree in nutrition and dietetics at Loma Linda University. Opportunities Members of the dietetics profession practice in a variety of environments \u2014including hospitals and other health-care facilities, schools and universities, government and community agencies, business, and industry. A growing number of dietitians are employed in physicians' ofces, clinics, home health-care agencies, mass communications, and many other entrepreneurial roles. By successfully passing the registration examination for dietitians, practice opportunities as a specialist in medical nutrition therapy, administrative dietetics, nutrition education, community nutrition, or research are available. There is increased recognition of the importance of nutrition in the elds of medicine, dentistry, and health promotion\u2014 with emphasis on tness and optimal well-being. This indicates that the dietitian's scope of practice is steadily broadening. The registered dietitian in medical nutrition therapy applies the science of nutrition to the care of people through health promotion and disease prevention, and uses medical nutrition therapy in the treatment of disease. As a member of the patient-care team, the registered dietitian (RD) is responsible for assessing, implementing, and monitoring the nutritional care of patients. In addition, the RD may serve professionally as a nutrition practitioner in health care; a teacher in an educational institution; a research dietitian; or a nutrition consultant-educator in municipal, state, or federal departments of health. The dietitian in administration is accountable for the food service system. In a health-care institution, they are responsible for the effective functioning of food service from the standpoint of patients, administration, medical staff, and personnel. The administrative RD may also teach; manage food systems in educational, public, or commercial facilities; serve as a consultant to health-care or educational institutions; or enter the eld of research. Community registered dietitians practice in diverse settings, translating nutrition science into improved health status. Opportunities may include forming partnerships with various organizations, mastering technology, enacting regulations and policies that protect and improve the public's health, and creatively managing scarce resources. Dietitians working in the community exhibit high-quality leadership and planning skills. Professional registration Upon satisfactory completion of the program and upon recommendation of the faculty, the graduate will receive a verication statement and be eligible to take the registration examination for dietitians in order to become a registered dietitian.98 Nutrition and Dietetics \u2014 B.S. Professional association Students and graduates are eligible for membership in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The association grants student membership at a nominal rate to students in accredited programs. The national ofce of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is at 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2190, Chicago, IL 60606-6995. Along with membership in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, students become members of the California Dietetic Association. Students are also encouraged to join the California Dietetic Association-Inland District. Goals of the coordinated program SAHP Program Goal 1 The program will prepare students to be competent graduates who are eligible to write the registration examination for dietitians to become entry-level practitioners. SAHP Program Objectives for Goal 1 1.Eighty percent (80%) of graduates who write the registration examination for dietitians will pass within the rst year. 2.Eighty percent (80%) of students who enter the B.S., M.P .H., or M.S. degree program will complete program/degree requirements within 150% of the program length. SAHP Program Goal 2 Provide professionally trained registered dietitians with either an emphasis in medical nutrition therapy or public health nutrition who may be employed by or contribute to the health-care and educational systems of the Seventh-day Adventist church; or local, national, or international entities. SAHP Program Objectives for Goal 2 1. Seventy percent (70%) or more of coordinated program graduates who seek employment in dietetics will be employed within twelve months of program completion.* 2. Sixty percent (60%) of coordinated program graduates will contribute to the community and/or provide professional leadership in the eld of dietetics within ve years of graduation. Students admitted into the B.S. + M.S. degree in nutrition and dietetics program satisfy CP requirements when the B.S. degree is completed. They continue their graduate education and do not typically seek employment until conclusion of the M.S. degree.

Through the therapeutic use of everyday activities or occupations, occupational therapists help people across the lifespan\u2014from infancy through older adults\u2014to participate in the things they want and need to do. Common occupational therapy interventions include helping children with disabilities to participate fully in school and social situations, helping people recovering from injury to regain skills, and providing support for older adults experiencing physical and cognitive changes. Practice settings are diverse\u2014 hospitals, schools, behavioral health clinics, outpatient clinics, and community sites with at-risk youth and survivors of domestic violence. Occupational therapy services may include comprehensive evaluations of the client's home and other environments (e.g., workplace, school), recommendations for adaptive equipment and training in its use, and guidance and education for family members and caregivers. Occupational therapy practitioners have a wholistic perspective focusing on adapting the environment to t the person, considering the person as an integral part of the therapy team. Following the mission of this University, students immerse themselves in the community, exploring emerging areas of practice including: aging, at-risk youth, domestic violence settings, lifestyle medicine, obesity, and trauma-exposed children. Opportunities Occupational therapy is an exciting eld with its broad population areas and diverse settings. The American Occupational Therapy Association has identied eight areas of focus: children and youth, evidence- based practice, health and wellness, mental health, productive aging, rehabilitation, disability, and participation; work and industry. Occupational therapy fosters entrepreneurship that promotes health and wellness and meaningful occupational participation. Occupational therapists are moving into areas such as health promotion, obesity, telehealth, and domestic violence. Professional associations Students are eligible for membership in the American Occupational Therapy Association and Occupational Therapy Association of California \u2014two organizations that foster development and improvement of service and education.

Normal time to complete the program 2.33 years (eight [8] academic quarters) \u2014 full-time enrollment required124 Department of Radiation Technology Department of Radiation Technology The Department of Radiation Technology is made up of diverse professions. Radiographers image body structures utilizing ionizing radiation. They can specialize in CT , MRI, imaging informatics, mammography, nuclear medicine, sonography, or radiation therapy. While CT and MRI both produce cross-sectional images of the body, MRI utilizes a magnetic eld rather than ionizing radiation. Nuclear medicine employs the nuclear properties of radioactive and stable nuclides to make diagnostic evaluations of the anatomic or physiologic conditions of the body. Sonography uses sound waves to image the human body; and radiation therapy employs medical use of ionizing radiation to treat cancer and control malignant cell growth. Professionals in these areas are able to communicate effectively, think critically, demonstrate professionalism by treating all persons with respect, assume responsibility and accountability for their actions, and adhere to the rules of condentiality.

Davis The Medical Dosimetry Program is designed to educate personnel in the discipline of dosimetry within a radiation oncology environment, and to prepare them to take the Medical Dosimetry Certication Board (MDCB) examination. Medical dosimetry is a dynamic, exciting eld involving a combined knowledge of mathematics, physics, and the biological and medical sciences. Dosimetrists plan optimal isodose distributions and treatment dose calculations for a variety of external beam as well as brachytherapy treatments. Medical dosimetrists must possess excellent analytical skills, the ability to critically evaluate data, and an aptitude for physics and mathematics. They must also be able to work closely as part of a team with physicists, physicians, radiation therapists, and other personnel. Due to a shortage of training programs in medical dosimetry throughout the United States, there is a great need for medical dosimetrists in many areas of the country. Thus, this program aims to provide a supply of well-trained dosimetrists who will be able to meet the needs of radiation oncology facilities in the local area and beyond. Mission statement The mission of the certicate program in medical dosimetry is to prepare professionals in the eld through broad education and training in all aspects of the profession. This will include critical thinking, clinical competence, effective communication, and professionalism as they apply to the eld of medical dosimetry. The program encourages intellectual, physical, social, and spiritual development by emphasizing these goals in its curriculum, which is reflected in the motto of Loma Linda University Health\u2014\"To Make Man Whole. \" Program learning outcomes (PLOs) By the end of this program, graduates should be able to: 1.Perform calculations, utilizing software tools to optimize isodose distributions to achieve treatment goals through maximizing targetcoverage, minimizing hot/cold spots, and sparing critical structures as per prescription; 2.Create deliverable treatment plans with considerations of machine and patient constraints, calculating monitor units for clinical set- ups, and minimizing systematic and random errors by checking plan parameters; 3.Follow hospital policies and procedures while performing all dosimetry activities; 4.Communicate effectively, both verbally and in writing; 5.Treat everyone with respect and courtesy, abiding by all HIPPA rules; 6.Exhibit responsible attitudes and be accountable for their actions; 7.Pass the MDCB examination, have a job within six months after passing their MDCB examination, and maintain an attrition rate of no more than 25 percent. Program design The program for both tracks is ve quarters in length. Instruction includes a mixture of lecture, laboratory, and clinical work. Students will be exposed to a variety of methodologies within dosimetry, including work with proton therapy treatment planning. The majority of instruction will be conducted in the Radiation Medicine Department of Loma Linda University Medical Center. There are also short clinical rotations to Long Beach Memorial and City of Hope medical centers. The program faculty consists of physicists, dosimetrists, and radiation therapists who are extremely experienced in their eld\u2014 many in both photon and proton therapy treatment planning. Accreditation The American Association of Medical Dosimetrists (AAMD) supports the concept of formal dosimetry training, which leads to board eligibility for the certication in medical dosimetry.

Loma Linda University is a religious, nonprot institution that welcomes students and staff from a broad spectrum of religious persuasions while reserving the right to give preference to qualied members of its sponsoring denomination. As stated in its nondiscrimination policy, the institution \"afrms that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and they should so be regarded by all people. \" Because several of the professions\u2014for which programs within the School of Behavioral Health prepare students\u2014have a tradition of advocacy for oppressed peoples, it is important that the institution, faculty, and staff demonstrate their acceptance of and willingness to assist those in our society who are less privileged. The University actively sponsors several programs that move the institutional health-care personnel resources and expertise into the local, national, and international communities to work with otherwiseunderserved populations. This component of service is an integral part of the statement of mission and a message intended to be captured in the Good Samaritan sculpture that occupies a central position on the campus. The School of Behavioral Health, as part of the University, has expectations of students, faculty, and staff in the areas of conduct and behavior while they are on campus or involved in school or University activities. As such, the School of Behavioral Health adheres to the policies of the University and afrms that Christian principles are incompatible with the various forms of discrimination that have divided societies; and that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and should be so regarded by all His people.

If you would like to know more about us, you can call us toll free at 800/422-4LLU. Beverly J. Buckles, D.S.W. Dean, School of Behavioral Health 150 School of Behavioral Health School foundations The School of Behavioral Health includes the Departments of Counseling and Family Sciences, Psychology, and Social Work and Social Ecology; and the Division of Interdisciplinary Studies. The school offers master's and doctoral degree programs, as well as post-baccalaureate and post- degree certicates. These programs equip graduates with leading-edge knowledge and practice experiences necessary for careers in behavioral health practice, research, and administration. Philosophy The School of Behavioral Health is grounded in a deep commitment to the University's mission to further the teaching and healing ministries of Jesus Christ, which produces wholeness within transformed lives. Transformation is viewed as a lifelong journey of faith and learning underpinned by a bio-psycho-social-spiritual perspective, which assumes that wholeness is achieved when all subsystems affecting human needs are understood and in balance. This pursuit seeks to understand and promote healthy minds, communities, social systems, and human relationships that enable individuals to experience resiliency and live meaningful lives. Such wholeness manifests itself in a life of service to humanity and to God. In the School of Behavioral Health, these purposes are achieved through academic programs\u2014including research, clinical practice, and global learning experiences\u2014that engage faculty and students in the highest levels of scholarship, professionalism, and the quest for wholeness. Because these pursuits are served by knowledge, graduate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of their elds of study and participate with the faculty in the process by which knowledge is created and applied. The end result is rm adherence to the global traditions of Loma Linda University through scholarly and practice pursuits that aim to strengthen the effectiveness of behavioral health practice and research to improve the quality of life for individuals and communities around the world. Goals The School of Behavioral Health attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1.Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly and professional careers in the behavioral health professions. 2.Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication. 3.Fostering the integration of science and practice in the service of humankind. Learning outcomes and assessment Supporting these goals, the School of Behavioral Health has adopted Loma Linda University's institutional learning outcomes (p. 18) (ILOs). The School of Behavioral Health supports the realization of the University's learning outcomes through the curricula of its degree programs by providing students with content and active learning experiences that reflect the current practice and professional knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes needed for competent practice in behavioral health, including, but not limited to: Professional and personal self care Ethical and professional standards of conduct and behaviorLegal and statutory mandates affecting practice Clinical knowledge shared and specic to disciplines Therapeutic and reflective use of self Analytical methods supporting scholarship and the integration of science and practice in the development of new knowledge and improved services Professional communication and presentation skills Strengths perspectives supporting wellness, recovery, and anti- stigma Integration of spirituality and cultural competency Integration of behavioral health into primary health care Global context of behavioral health practice Collegial and collaborative team practice Commitment to continuous professional development, service, and lifelong learning The assessment of the University's student learning outcomes is integrated into the specic program and department criteria and methods used to address professional accreditation assessment requirements. Where possible, these data are used to support the development of school-wide metrics. Mission Operationalizing this philosophy, the mission of the School of Behavioral Health is to provide a spiritually supportive context for teaching, clinical practice, and research innovation that pursues integrative behavioral health aimed at reducing health disparities and promoting social justice in a global context locally and abroad.

The exceptions to this are the combined degrees programs.152 School of Behavioral Health Certicate programs The School of Behavioral Health offers post-baccalaureate and post- degree certicate programs. Students accepted into such programs are assigned an advisor who works with them as they fulll the program requirements. Students are required to maintain a B (3.0) grade point average, with no course grade below B (3.0). All certicate students are required to take at least one, three-unit religion course (numbered between 500 and 600). Master of Arts/Master of Science/Master of Social Work Advisor and guidance committee Each student accepted into a degree program is assigned an advisor who advises the student in meeting the program of study and University requirements. The advisor works with the director of the student's program to support the student's successful progress to graduation. Subject prerequisites and deciencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identied by subject and classied either as prerequisites or as subject deciencies. Applicants lacking certain subject or program prerequisites may not be admitted to the master's degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda University or elsewhere) and acceptable grades are reported. However, subject deciencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but deciencies must be completed as specied and within the time-frame determined, usually during the rst full quarter of study at this University. Study plan The student's advisor should develop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specied as fully as possible. This will serve as a guide to both the student and the advisor. Changes to the academic plan must be approved by the student's advisor and the program director. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of all required courses. Time limit The time allowed from admission to the School of Behavioral Health to conferring of the master's degree may not exceed ve years. Program extensions can be considered within the limits of University policy. Course credit allowed toward the master's degree is nullied ve years from the date of course completion. Nullied courses may be revalidated, upon successful petition, through reading, conferences, written reports, or examination to assure currency in the content. Academic documentation of the justication of revalidated courses must be approved by the dean's ofce. Residence Students must meet the residence requirements indicated for their particular program (never less than one academic quarter). The master's degree candidate must complete one quarter of full-time study at the University or perform the thesis research at the University. Although the number of units students take varies by program, students are expected to work closely with their advisors to assure that their course loads are consistent with program requirements, as well as degree completion options and timelines. Comprehensive and nal examinations The student must take written, oral, and nal examinations prescribed by the program on or before the published dates. If a candidate fails to pass the oral or written examination for a graduate degree, theprogram director in association with the program's academic standards committee determines the requirements needed to ameliorate the failed examination. In the case of a failed thesis defense, a written analysis of the candidate's status and program's recommendations are led with the dean's ofce. The student receives a copy of the committee's recommendation. Research competence Student skills required in research, language, investigation, and computation are specied in each program description in this CATALOG. Candidacy Admission to the School of Behavioral Health or designation of regular graduate standing does not constitute admission of the student to candidacy for a graduate degree. After achieving regular status, admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Behavioral Health Form A) from the student to the dean, on recommendation of the student's advisor and the program coordinator or department chair. Students petitioning the School of Behavioral Health for candidacy for the master's degree must present a satisfactory grade record, include a statement of the proposed thesis or dissertation topic (where applicable) that has been approved by the student's guidance committee, and note any other qualication prescribed by the program. Students are usually advanced to candidacy during the third quarter of study for full-time students. Specic program requirements In addition to the foregoing, the student is subject to the requirements stated in the section of the CATALOG governing the specic program chosen. Religion requirement All master's degree students are required to take at least one, three-unit religion course (courses numbered between 500 and 600). Students should check with their programs for specic guidelines. Combined degrees programs A number of combined degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide more comprehensive preparation in clinical applications and the biomedical sciences. Concurrent admission to two programs in the School of Behavioral Health or to a program in the School of Behavioral Health and to a professional school in the University is required. These curricula are described in greater detail under the heading \"Combined Degrees Programs\" in this section of the CATALOG. Thesis Students writing a thesis must register for at least one unit of thesis credit. The research and thesis preparation are under the direction of a thesis chair and research committee. The timeline for determining a thesis topic and research design are program specic, but must be secured before petition is made for candidacy. The student must register and pay tuition for thesis credit, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and thesis, continuous registration is to be maintained until the manuscript has been accepted. This involves a quarterly enrollment fee paid at the beginning of each quarter.Loma Linda University 2020-2021 153 Format guide Instructions for the preparation and format of the publishable paper, thesis, or dissertation are in the Thesis and Dissertation Format Guide, available through the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor. Consultation with the dissertation editor can help the student avoid formatting errors that would require them to retype large sections of manuscript. The last day for submitting copies to the school ofce in nal approved form is published in the events calendar (available from the academic dean's ofce). Binding The cost of binding two copies of the thesis, one copy to be deposited in the University Library or appropriate department or school collection and one for the student, will be paid for by the student's department. The student will be responsible for paying the cost of binding additional personal copies. Doctor of Philosophy The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded for evidence of mature scholarship; productive promise; and active awareness of the history, resources, and demands of a specialized eld. Advisor and doctoral research committee The School of Behavioral Health requires advisors for Doctor of Philosophy degree candidates to have demonstrated scholarship productivity in their chosen disciplines. Each student, upon acceptance into a doctoral degree program, is assigned an advisor to assist with academic planning and guidance through program requirements. Subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is assigned a doctoral research committee. Each program maintains a list of qualied doctoral degree mentors. The doctoral research committee, usually chaired by the advisor, is responsible for screening dissertation topics, recommending candidacy, guiding research, administering written and oral examinations, evaluating the dissertation/project and other evidence of the candidate's tness to receive the degree, and recommending the student for graduation. Subject prerequisites and deciencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identied by subjects and classied as either prerequisites or as subject deciencies. Applicants lacking subject or program prerequisites may not be admitted to the Ph.D. degree program until prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda University or elsewhere) with acceptable grades. However, subject deciencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but deciencies must be completed as specied and within the time frame determined, usually during the rst full quarter of study at this University. Study plan The student's advisor should develop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specied as fully as possible. This serves as a guide to both the student and the advisor, as well as to members of the guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful consultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of required courses. Time limit Completion of the graduate experience signals currency and competence in the discipline. Seven years are allowed for completion after admission to the Ph.D. degree program. Program extensions can be considered within the limits of University policy.Course credit allowed toward the doctorate is nullied eight years from the date of course completion. To assure currency in the content, nullied courses may be revalidated\u2014upon successful petition\u2014through reading, conference, written reports, or examination. Academic documentation of the justication of revalidated courses must be approved by the dean's ofce with recommendations regarding the student's future relation to the school. Residence The School of Behavioral Health requires two years of residency for the doctoral degrees\u2014D.M.F .T , Psy.D., Ph.D.\u2014spent on the campus of the University after enrollment in a doctoral degree program. During residence, students devote full time to graduate activity in courses, clinical practice, research, or a combination of these. A full load of courses is eight or more units each quarter; 36 or more clock hours per week is full time in research. Students may be advised to pursue for limited periods at special facilities studies not available at Loma Linda University. Such time may be considered residence if the arrangement is approved in advance by the dean of the School of Behavioral Health. The spirit and demands of doctoral degree study require full-time devotion to courses, research, reading, and reflection. But neither the passage of time nor preoccupation with study assures success. Evidence of high scholarship and original contribution to the eld or professional competence form the basis for determining the awarding of the degree. Scholarly competence Doctoral degree students demonstrate competency in scholarship along with research, clinical competence, and professional development. Expectations and standards of achievement with the tools of investigation, natural and synthetic languages, and computers are specied in this section of the CATALOG for each program. Comprehensive examinations The doctoral degree candidate is required to take comprehensive written and oral examinations over the principal areas of study to ascertain capacity for independent, productive, scientic work; and to determine whether further courses are required before the nal year of preparation for the doctorate is undertaken. The program coordinator is responsible for arranging preparation and administration of the examination, as well as its evaluation and subsequent reports of results. Success in the comprehensive examination is a prerequisite to candidacy. Students cannot be admitted to the examination until they have completed the majority of units required beyond the master's degree or its equivalent. The nal oral examination After completion of the dissertation and not later than a month before the date of graduation, the doctoral degree candidate is required to appear before an examining committee for the nal oral examination/ dissertation defense. If a candidate fails to pass this nal examination/dissertation for a graduate degree, the program director in association with the program's academic standards committee determines the requirements needed to ameliorate the failed examination. A written analysis of the candidate's status and the program's recommendations are led with the dean's ofce. The student receives a copy of the committee's recommendation.154 School of Behavioral Health Project All Doctor of Psychology and Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy degree students are required to complete a project and all professional doctoral degree students must register for and complete all research units as specied by the program requirements. Each student, upon acceptance into a professional doctoral degree program, is assigned an advisor to assist with academic planning and guidance through program requirements. The School of Behavioral Health requires advisors for professional doctoral degree program to have demonstrated scholarship productivity in specic disciplines. Prior to advancing to candidacy each student is also assigned a doctoral research committee and have an approved topic for research project. Each program maintains a list of qualied doctoral degree mentors. The doctoral research committee, usually chaired by the advisor, is responsible for screening research topics, recommending candidacy, guiding research, administering written and oral examinations, evaluating the research project and other evidence of the candidate's tness to receive the degree, and recommending the student for graduation. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and project, continuous registration is maintained until the project manuscript is accepted and the nal oral defense completed. This involves a quarterly fee to be paid during registration each quarter. A continuing registration fee is also assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. As such, the student must have active registration during the quarter that the nal oral defense is completed. Dissertation All Doctor of Philosophy students are required to complete a dissertation and must register for and complete all of the research units as specied by the program requirements. Each student, upon acceptance into a Doctor of Philosophy program is assigned an advisor to assist with academic planning and guidance through program requirements. The School of Behavioral Health requires advisors for these doctoral degree program to have demonstrated scholarship productivity. Prior to advancing to candidacy each student is also assigned a doctoral research committee and have an approved topic for the dissertation. Each program maintains a list of qualied doctoral degree mentors. The doctoral research committee, usually chaired by the advisor, is responsible for screening dissertation topics, recommending candidacy, guiding research, administering written and oral examinations, evaluating the dissertation and other evidence of the candidate's tness to receive the degree, and recommending the student for graduation. Doctor of Philosophy students are required to be knowledgeable of the dissertation requirements and policies set by the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Consultation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor can prevent the student from committing formatting errors that would require retyping large sections of the manuscript. Students register and pay tuition for the dissertation, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and dissertation, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted and the nal oral defense completed. This involves a quarterly fee to be paid during registration each quarter. A continuing registration fee is also assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. As such, the student must have active registration during the quarter that the nal oral defense is completed.Doctoral dissertations are reported to University Microlms International and to the National Opinion Research Center. The Faculty of Graduate Studies provides appropriate information and forms. Candidacy Admission to the School of Behavioral Health does not constitute candidacy for a graduate degree. Admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Behavioral Health Form A) from the student to the dean, with support from the student's advisor and the program chair. The student's petition for candidacy for the Doctor of Philosophy degree will include conrmation that comprehensive written and oral examinations have been passed. Students expecting the award of the doctorate at a June graduation should have achieved candidacy no later than the previous November 15. One full quarter must be allowed between the achievement of candidacy and the quarter of completion. Specic program requirements Doctoral programs differ. Each unique program's requirements appear in the programs section of this CATALOG (Section III) and in the program guides available from specic departments. Religion requirement All doctoral students should take at least three, three-unit religion courses (numbered between 500 and 600) for a total of nine units of religion courses. Students should check with their programs for specic guidelines. Combined degrees programs A number of combined degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide additional preparation in clinical, professional, or basic areas related to the student's eld of interest. All require concurrent admission to the School of Behavioral Health and a professional school in the University. The combined degrees programs provide opportunity for especially well-qualied and motivated students to pursue professional and graduate education; and to prepare for careers in clinical specialization, teaching, or investigation of problems of health and disease in humans. For admission to a combined degrees program, the student must have a baccalaureate degree, qualify for admission to the School of Behavioral Health, and already be admitted to another program at the University. Application may be made at any point in the student's progress in the professional school, though it is usually made during the second year. Students in this curriculum study toward the M.A., M.S., M.S.W., Psy.D., or Ph.D. degree. Students may, as needed, be required to interrupt their professional study for two or more years for courses and research for the graduate degree sought. Elective time in the professional school may be spent in meeting School of Behavioral Health requirements. The student's concurrent status is regarded as continuous until the program is completed or until discontinuance is recommended by the School of Behavioral Health or the professional school. The usual degree requirements apply. The following combined degrees programs are offered in conjunction with the School of Behavioral Health.Loma Linda University 2020-2021 155 Social Welfare and Social Research with Biomedical and Clinical Ethics (Ph.D./M.A. (p. 411)) (closed to admission for the 2019-2020 academic year.) Social Work with Criminal Justice ( M.S.W./M.S. (p. 412)) Social Work with Gerontology ( M.S.W./M.S. ( p. 413)) Student life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook . Additional information regarding policies specic to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. The School of Behavioral Health provides a school-specic Policies and Procedures Manual to all School of Behavioral Health students. Regulations, policies, procedures, and other program requirements are contained in this manual. Academic information Conditions of registration, residence, attendance Academic residence A student must meet the residence requirements indicated for a particular degree, which is never less than one academic quarter. A year of residence is dened as three quarters of academic work. A student is in full-time residence if registered for at least eight units. A maximum of 12 units may be taken without special petition to the dean of the School of Behavioral Health, unless the student is enrolled in an approved block- registration program or the program requirements specify otherwise. Transfer credits Transfer credits will not be used to offset course work at this University that earns less than a B (3.0) average. This transfer is limited to credits that have not already been applied to a degree and for which a grade of B (3.0) or better has been recorded. A maximum of nine quarter units that have been previously applied to another degree may be accepted as transfer credits upon petition. A candidate who holds a master's degree or presents its equivalent by transcript may receive credit up to 20 percent of the total units for the degree, subject to the consent of the dean and the department chair involved. In such instances, the transfer student is not relieved of residence requirements at this University. Students should also review the requirements of in their program of study as some professional degree programs require grades higher than a B (3.0) for transfer courses, and may restrict the courses and experiences that may be transferred from other academic institutions. If permitted for transfer, credit for practicum experiences is allowed only where university credit has been received for equivalent experiences. Credit for life or work experiences cannot be used to meet the requirements in any degree or certicate program in the School of Behavioral Health. Advanced standing Advanced standing is a designation used in specic professional degree programs to address possible content redundancy between levels of degrees available within those professions. Evaluation of eligibility for advanced standing is program specic when specic conditions are met. Students should review the availability of advanced standing in theirprogram. Academic variances are used to document the availability of advanced standing. Academic and professional/clinical probation Continued enrollment in a professional degree program or certicate is contingent upon a student's continued satisfactory academic and professional ( clinical) performance. Any student whose performance in either of these areas falls below the requirements of their program, the school, or university will be placed on one or more of these types of probation. Academic probation Degree students whose overall grade point average falls below a 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. Students on academic probation who fail to earn a 3.0 for the next quarter or who fail to have an overall G.P .A. of 3.0 after two quarters may be dismissed from school. The academic requirements for post-baccalaureate and post-degree certicate programs is the same as the G.P .A. requirements for all other School of Behavioral Health programs. Professional performance probation All students enrolled in professional programs are required to adhere to the professional, clinical, and ethical standards set forth by their disciplines, the school, and university. Students obtain copies of the ethical and professional performance and clinical practice standards and requirements set forth by their disciplines through their academic programs. Professional performance requirements for the School of Behavioral Health are included in each program's student handbooks and in the school's student handbook. Program handbooks and the school's student handbook are provided to students as they begin their degree program. The University's conduct and behavior expectations are provided in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook. Any student whose performance is evaluated to fall below these requirements will be placed on professional performance, or clinical, probation at the recommendation of the department's academic standards committee and department chair to the dean of the school. Enrollment in course, clinical work, or other program requirements while on professional performance probation is at the recommendation of the department and approval of the dean, and also conditional based upon the severity of the situation and extent of amelioration. Any student whose professional performance falls below these minimum requirements for two consecutive or dispersed quarters will be evaluated for dismissal from the school. In addition, a student who receives an Unsatisfactory (U) in any segment or quarter of a practicum or clinical requirement is automatically placed on professional performance, or clinical, probation by the dean's ofce. Continued enrollment for the next quarter, term, or rotation segment for a student on professional performance probation is subject to the recommendation of the department chair and its academic standards committee to the dean of the school. A student who receives a U grade for a second consecutive or dispersed segment or quarter of practicum will be evaluated for dismissal from the school. Program and professional specic requirements also apply in these situations and will affect the evaluation of the student's continuing status in the program of study, the school, and University.156 School of Behavioral Health Financial information Schedule of charges (2020-2021) Tuition $845 Per unit, graduate credit $423 Per unit, audit $4,500 Flat fee for the Play Therapy Certicate Program $37,394 Per year: Psychology Psy.D. and Ph.D. Special charges $35 Application fee* $70 Application fee for combined degrees $900 Enrollment fee per quarter $200 Nonrefundable tuition deposit** $35 Application to add program or degree Programs may have additional fees.*** *All students who submit their application by the VIP Priority deadline will have 100 percent of the application fee credited to their student account towards the rst quarter of tuition (see dates below). **The $200 nonrefundable deposit will be credited to the student's account towards the rst quarter of tuition. ***Clinical training fees apply and vary by program.

Program director Michelle Minyard-Widmann Clinical coordinator Alisha Saavedra The Department of Counseling and Family Sciences offers high-quality academic education and clinical training leading to a Master's degree in the child life specialist program. This degree prepares individuals to provide child life services in health-care settings. In addition, practice experiences within the United States and in other countries will provide students with child life practice in diverse environments. The child life profession Child life specialists are professionals in child development. They promote effective coping through play, preparation, education, and self- expression activities. Child life specialists provide emotional support for families and encourage optimum development of children facing a broad range of challenging experiences, particularly those related to health care and hospitalization. Understanding that a child's well-being depends on the support of the family, child life specialists provide information, support, and guidance to parents, siblings, and other family members. They also play a vital role in educating caregivers, administrators, and the general public about the needs of children under stress (Association of Child Life Professionals <http://www.childlife.org>). The program Certication for the child life profession Through the Association of Child Life Professionals, the certied child life specialist (CCLS) credential was developed to increase the prociency of child life professionals by identifying a body of knowledge, uniform and improved standards of practice, and ethical conduct while enhancing the status and credibility of the profession. Requirements for certication are based on academic and internship experience, and successful completion of an examination process (Association of Child Life Professionals <http://www.childlife.org >). Program learning outcomes By the end of this program, the graduate should be able to: 1.Represent and communicate child life practice and psychosocial issues of infants, children, youth, and families;158 Child Life Specialist \u2014 M.S. 2.Utilize theories of child development, stress and coping, and family systems in pediatric health environments; 3.Work collaboratively in diverse settings; 4.Identify as a professional child life specialist through membership and participation in professional organizations; 5.Apply the concepts of ethical and legal standards of the profession; 6.Describe the impact of health and health issues on the global setting; 7.Satisfactorily complete a supervised practicum and internship in child life. Professional experience Students will participate in supervised clinical training at Loma Linda University Children's Hospital and various hospitals located in the United States. A 100-hour practicum and 600-hour internship are required to complete the master's degree. These experiences will provide an opportunity for students to build on course work and put theory into practice. Students will also have the opportunity to participate in various events such as grief camps, health fairs, global health trips, and other activities on campus designed to broaden their clinical experiences.

LLU graduates with the LPCC specialization are qualied to treat individuals, couples, families, and groups of all ages. They are also prepared to address education and career counseling issues and to work with families of children with special needs. When licensed, they may choose to set up private practices or work in mental health clinics, substance use treatment facilities, in-patient and out-patient medical facilities, religious organizations, family court, employee assistance programs, retirement homes, higher education, and K-12 schools as mental health counselors. The California Business and Professions Code Section 4999.20 denes professional clinical counseling as \"the application of counseling interventions and psychotherapeutic techniques to identify and remediate cognitive, mental, and emotional issues\u2014including personal growth, adjustment to disability, crisis intervention, and psychosocial and environmental problems. Professional clinical counseling includes conducting assessment for the purpose of establishing counseling goals and objectives to empower individuals to deal adequately with life situations, reduce stress, experience growth, change behavior, and make well-informed rational decisions. \" The California Board of Behavioral Sciences (BBS) regulates all master's-level licenses in mental health. State standards for LPCC are consistent with national standards, making it easier for graduates to be granted reciprocity throughout the country. Equivalent licensure in other states may be titled licensed professional counselor, licensed clinical mental health counselor (LCMHC), or similar titles. Complete information regarding scope of license for LPCC is located on the Board of Behavioral Sciences website < http://bbs.ca.gov/pdf/forms/lpc/ lpc_scope_practice.pdf>. Pupil personnel services credential (PPS): school counseling specialization School counselors serve as leaders of counseling programs within the educational system. They address academic, career, and personal/ social needs of students and serve as counselors and advocates for students, collaborators with parents and school personnel, and liaisons to the community. As articulated by the American School Counselor Association, school counseling programs are preventive in design, developmental in nature, and integral to the total educational program. Combining the school counselor certication with clinical counselor licensure is an excellent professional path that enhances counseling competence and professional opportunities. Additional information about the pupil personnel services credential in school counseling is found in the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing website located at <http://www.ctc.ca.gov/ >. LPCC clinical training and PPS eld experience All LPCC and PPS school counseling candidates must satisfactorily complete eld experiences as required by their programs.

Program director Nichola Seaton Ribadu The Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy (D.M.F .T .) program is one of the few D.M.F .T . programs in the United States that is accredited by the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT). The program is fully online for students coming in with a COAMFTE- accredited master's degree. For students who have earned a master's degree in a related eld (e.g., social work or clinical counseling), there are required corequisite courses that need to be taken in addition to the specic D.M.F .T . courses. Corequisite courses are currently only provided on campus. Online delivery will utilize synchronous and asynchronous formats. The curriculum adopts the practitioner-administrator-evaluator approach and focuses on applied skill development for use in clinical practice and administrative positions. The goal of the curriculum is to prepareLoma Linda University 2020-2021 167 students to apply evidence-based standards to the systemic/relational principles of marriage and family therapy as they design, evaluate, and administer programs that impact a clinical population. Graduates of the D.M.F .T . program use a multicultural lens and are well-prepared to serve as ethically-competent leaders who advance the marital and family therapy profession. Alumni most often work as program directors, grant proposal writers, program evaluators, advanced clinicians, and clinical supervisors across the nation and outside of the United States. Some alumni also serve the University as faculty members and adjunct professors. The 120-unit* D.M.F .T . degree curriculum requires a minimum of three years of full-time study for completion. This includes course work, 1000 hours of direct client contact, a doctoral project, and supervised professional development experience. The program is also designed to meet the requirements for California state licensure as a marital and family therapist. *Students who have completed a master's degree from a COAMFTE- accredited program receive advanced standing of 43 units, reducing the required time to complete the degree to a minimum of two years. Consideration for advanced standing will be given to students entering the D.M.F .T . degree program with an M.A. or an M.S. degree from a non- COAMFTE-accredited program on a course-by-course basis. Knowledge and skills promoted Theory and practice Students study the work of the original thinkers in marital and family therapy, as well as the most recent developments in the eld\u2014such as social constructionism, evidence-based practice, and global perspectives. D.M.F .T . students will develop skills in applying marriage and family therapy principles and frameworks to public and private clinical practice settings. They will develop a critical understanding of the theoretical and philosophical foundations of marriage and family therapy, be conversant with the current issues in the eld, and use this knowledge to develop programs and services. Personal development The program encourages students to develop a clear understanding of themselves and invites reflection and consideration of the impact of their personal values, social positions, and contexts on their clinical, administrative, and program development practices. Students are supported in the development of their strengths as they create an epistemological framework and ethical consciousness that guide their approach to professional practice in their lives; and are encouraged to engage beyond their local communities to include experiences in wider cultural and global contexts. Practice and supervisory skills Students will apply an in-depth understanding of theory as it relates to the practice of marital and family therapy interventions and program activities at family, community, and societal levels\u2014drawing on the core marriage and family therapy frameworks. They will develop sophistication in clinical, administrative, and supervisory skills necessary for multisystemic engagement. As it is COAMFTE-accredited, the D.M.F .T . program offers students the opportunity to complete the requirements for becoming AAMFT -approved supervisors prior to graduation. Evaluation skills Students will develop skills and understanding of the process of evaluation research related to marital and family therapy programs and services. This includes the ability to apply research ndings to clinical practice and to utilize research ndings in creative ways for the benetof the general population. D.M.F .T . students will focus on evaluation of program performance and outcomes in practice-based settings. Program goal and outcomes The goal of the D.M.F .T . program is to prepare doctoral-level marital and family therapists to serve as program developers, as well as evaluators/ administrators, who will promote the health and well-being of individuals, families, and communities. This goal works in combination with the larger University mission of advancing health services that attend to the whole person by developing practiced-based knowledge in marriage and family therapy. There are two overall program outcomes. These outcomes integrate our University's commitment to diversity and quality training of health-care professionals with the need for diverse doctoral-level practitioners skilled in program development/evaluation and administration. The program outcomes are: 1.The program will graduate a diverse student body prepared to advance the eld of marriage and family therapy through practice- based leadership, founded on the consumption of current and reliable research. 2.The program will prepare doctoral-level family therapy professionals to apply the systemic/relational principles of the eld to develop, evaluate, and administer ethically competent programs that contribute to MFT practice. Student learning outcomes By the end of this program, the graduate should be able to: 1.Develop a professional identity as doctoral-level marital and family therapists aligned with national practice standards; 2.Become adept in systems/relational practice, demonstrating sophistication as therapists, program developers, evaluators, and administrators of marital and family therapy services; 3.Use marital and family therapy, human development, and family science literatures to design and evaluate programs, clinical protocols, organizational structures, and service-delivery processes; 4.Further benet families and communities, students will demonstrate the ability to use research and evaluation methodologies to improve human service program performance and outcomes; 5.Be responsive to the societal, cultural, and spiritual contexts in which health and well-being are embedded; 6.Develop an ethical consciousness that guides their practice in all aspects of professional work. Advanced standing policy National accreditation and certication processes ensure that degrees are comparable across institutional boundaries. This advanced standing policy recognizes the value of these professional review processes on the part of the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences and facilitates cooperation in professional training within the marital and family therapy discipline. The policy assures that at least half of all interim master's degree units and 60 percent of doctoral academic credit will be earned at Loma Linda University, while enabling cooperative relationships with other accredited programs. Guidelines Advanced standing may be granted for previous course work equivalent in content and scope to required counseling and family sciences (CFS)168 Marital and Family Therapy \u2014 D.M.F .T . courses. This reduces the number of units to be taken at this University. Determination of advanced standing is based on the following guidelines: 1.Residency requirements a.Doctoral degree. Advanced standing may not reduce total units below 60 units for the Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy (D.M.F .T .) degree. 2.Determination of equivalency a.Credits applied to advanced standing must be graduate-level courses earned at an accredited institution. No credit may be applied for grades lower than B. b.Courses completed in programs accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Martial and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE) will be reviewed as a whole in relation to CFS program requirements. It is anticipated that comparable course content from these schools may be divided into different course congurations than that of this University. Students seeking advanced standing based on units earned at other institutions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with COAMFTE standards. c.Advanced standing is not granted for religion courses. d.Doctoral courses taken more than seven years prior to enrollment as a student in the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences may be considered for advanced standing only if the content has been used professionally on a regular basis and the student can demonstrate current knowledge in the eld. e.Approved prior client contact hours may also be applied. See CFS doctoral handbook for approval process. 3.Approval process Students seeking advanced standing should meet with their program director prior to admission or within the rst two quarters of study and supply copies of each syllabus of prior course work. Following the course review, student will initiate an academic variance specifying the coursework or coursework and work experience with documentation of coursework and experience for every course the student would like to bring in through advance standing. Financial assistance Students who are accepted into the D.M.F .T . degree curriculum in marital and family therapy may apply for work-study and department-funded research, teaching, and administrative assistantships awarded by the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences. Departmental awards are contingent on the availability of funds. Students may also apply for need-based nancial aid, such as a loan or other work-study programs on campus. Students can also apply for the small School of Behavioral Health based scholarships offered each year. Students accepted into the D.M.F .T . degree curriculum in marital and family therapy are eligible for and encouraged to apply for the AAMFT minority fellowships.

The School Counseling Program certicate is one of two options in the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences that qualify a graduate for the California pupil personnel services (PPS) credential in school counseling. Students pursuing the M.S. degree curriculum in the Counseling Program may choose school counseling as a single170 School Counseling \u2014 Certicate specialization embedded in the degree program, or combine it with the licensed professional clinical counselor (LPCC) specialization. Students in the Marital and Family Therapy Program may add the School Counseling Program certicate to their M.S. degree curriculum. Successful completion of the certicate, including passing scores on all sections of the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST), will qualify graduates for the California PPS credential in school counseling. As with all department programs, the School Counseling Program certicate is designed in accordance with the department's vision of transforming relationships. Faculty members are committed to the mission of facilitating wholeness by promoting health, healing, and hope to individuals, families, and communities through education, research, professional training, community service, and global outreach. The call to service In the heart of the campus, the University's commitment to service is memorialized in the Good Samaritan sculpture that contrasts human indifference and ethnic pride with empathy and service. As counseling needs are more openly recognized and accepted across cultures, students and faculty members are called to serve together in local and global communities. Loma Linda University's relationships around the world continue to create unique opportunities for students to join in global partnership through eld experience. Professional school counseling Professional school counselors are leaders of counseling programs within the educational system. As articulated by the American School Counselor Association (ASCA), school counseling programs are preventive in design, developmental in nature, and integral to the total educational program. Counselors address academic, career, and personal/social needs through their work as advocates for K-12 students, collaborators with parents and school personnel, and liaisons to the community. Employment as a school counselor in public schools requires the pupil personnel services credential in school counseling. Combining the school counselor certication with licensure in clinical mental health is an excellent professional path that enhances competence and professional opportunities. Additional information is located on the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing website at <http:// www.ctc.ca.gov >. Degree and certicate requirements The School Counseling Program certicate is paired with the M.S. degree at Loma Linda University. An approved master's degree is required for state credentialing. Therefore, it is not possible to complete the certicate and receive a University recommendation for the school counseling credential until all degree and certicate requirements are completed. This applies to students pursuing the M.S. degree in counseling (credential option) and the M.S. degree in marital and family therapy (school counseling certicate option). Required courses for the certicate/credential program are listed at the end of this narrative. Certicate of clearance prior to eld placement School Counseling Program students must obtain a certicate of clearance (COC) from the state of California before they are allowed to begin eld experience. The COC requires verication of a current TB test and a LiveScan, in accordance with state guidelines. The process can take six to eight weeks.Practicum and eld experience Field experience requirements for the certicate program include 100 hours of preeld practicum followed by 600 hours of eld experience. For students in a clinical master's degree program, preeld hours are met earlier through clinical placements. In addition, 200 of the required 600 hours of school counseling eld experience can be elective hours from clinical training. The remaining 400 hours must be completed as a school counselor trainee in public schools, evenly divided between two different grade blocks (e.g., elementary school, middle school, or high school). California Test of Basic Skills (CBEST) Candidates for the school counseling certicate must take the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST) within the rst two quarters following admission to the program and must pass all sections of the CBEST before the University can recommend them for the school counseling credential. Financial assistance This program is not independently eligible for federal nancial aid. However, a student can complete the requirements for this certicate while concurrently enrolled in a School of Behavioral Health graduate degree program as noted above (see degree and certicate requirements). Program learning outcomes By the end of this program, the graduate should be able to: 1.Integrate counseling concepts and skills with a personal epistemology; 2.Demonstrate counseling interventions based upon a broad range of theoretical and legal/ethical frameworks through comprehensive written examination; 3.Develop identity as a professional school counselor through membership and participation in professional organizations; 4.Satisfactorily complete 600 clock hours of supervised practicum in counseling, 200 of which may be supervised clinical hours; 5.Meet all University qualications for the California pupil personnel services credential in school counseling issued by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC). Accreditation Loma Linda University is regionally accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), 985 Atlantic Avenue, Suite 100, Alameda, The pupil personnel services (PPS) credential curriculum in school counseling is accredited by the Committee on Accreditation, on behalf of the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC). The next Commission visit occurs during the 2023-24 academic year. Additional PPS information can be obtained by going to the CTC website at < http://www.ctc.ca.gov/ >.

The 3 - 4 year, 103-unit curriculum includes two years of course work, professional development and clinical practice leading to licensure or certication and a one year supervised dissertation experience. The purpose of the curriculum is to develop family science scholars and practitioners who will advance theory, research, practice, and teaching in the elds of couple and family therapy and family social science. Students will be prepared for academic, professional and clinical positions in universities, community mental health and medical settings. Ph.D. degree students develop expertise in conducting original research using quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method approaches; teaching in academic and community settings; and advance clinical practice. Ph.D. degree program specialty The core academic curriculum in the systems, families, and couples Ph.D. program is composed of 80 units of coursework in the areas of theory, research and religion. Students will then choose one of two specialties, (1) couples and family therapy or (2) family studies. Each specialty includes 23 units of course work. The family studies specialty focuses on skill development in the areas of family studies research, program development and evaluation, academic teaching and family life education. This specialty meets the course requirements of the National Council on Family Relations for Certied Family Life Educator. More information on becoming certied by the National Council on Family Relations can be found in the organization's ofcial website at <http://www.ncfr.org> (http://www.ncfr.org/ ).

Both conceptually and pragmatically, the programs in the Department of Social Work and Social Ecology are guided by an overarching ecological (bio-psycho-social-spiritual) perspective and methodological framework that supports the use of scientic methods of problem analysis and program design. A key component in this framework is the importance of interdisciplinary scholarship when studying the interrelated aspects of behavioral, sociopolitical, economic, and environmental problems. The result is an interdisciplinary teaching, learning, and practice environment brought together for the purpose of creating sustainable interventions directed toward improving the functioning of individuals, families, groups, organizations, institutions, and communities. As such, priority has been given to creating an academic milieu favorable to educating competent, ethical, and compassionate professionals and scholars for advanced practice roles\u2014capable of respecting and addressing the needs of diverse populations.

Program director Larry Orgiz Prior to the end of the 1990's two doctoral degrees (the Ph.D. and original D.S.W.) were viewed as interchangeable modes of advancing the scholarship of the social work profession. However, flexibility in the articulation of discipline-specic Ph.D. programs led to preference for the Ph.D. doctorate over the D.S.W. degree, resulting nally in the complete elimination of the D.S.W. degree in the United States. However, over the last decade there has been growing recognition by social work professionals and educators that a practice doctorate for social work addresses the expansion of much needed applied scholarship in ways not being achieved by social work PhD programs. Thus the role, importance, and a new vision of the practice doctorate in social work has been articulated and follows the journey seen in other elds such as nursing, physical therapy, speech, and audiology. As such, the D.S.W. degree in its rearticulated content provides a pathway for M.S.W. level social workers to further their development as scholar practitioners providing leadership and innovation in applied social work practice. Mission statement The mission of the Doctor of Social Work program is to transform experienced M.S.W. level social workers into scholar practitioners capable of advancing clinical social work practice knowledge and innovation through applied scholarship, leadership, education and the promotion of social justice in support of whole person care in an increasingly diverse and global practice environment. Program goals The goals of the D.S.W. program are to: 1.Prepare doctoral level social work scholar practitioners with expertise in clinical leadership.Loma Linda University 2020-2021 183 2.Equip students with the understanding and skills needed to develop, implement, and disseminate knowledge and innovation in behavioral health practice and social work education. 3.Equip students to be transformative leaders in the integration and promotion of social justice in behavioral health services and social work education. Program learning outcomes By the end of the program, the graduate should be able to: 1.Conduct systematic inquiry that adheres to scholarly conventions. 2.Use and critically evaluate at an advanced-level, evidenced-based, research-informed and promising practices. 3.Develop and disseminate clinical practice and educational innovations and knowledge that reflect the inherent values of the social work profession. 4.Demonstrate expertise in behavioral health clinical leadership that advanced social work practice and education. 5.Demonstrate expertise in the application of mission-focused learning that promotes and integrates social justice in practice and education delivery and innovation. Financial assistance Students who are accepted into the D.S.W. degree program may apply for work-study and department-funded research, and teaching, assistantships awarded by the Department of Social Work and Social Ecology. Departmental awards are contingent on the availability of funds. Students may also apply for need-based nancial aid, such as a loan or other work-study programs on campus. Students accepted into the D.S.W. degree program are eligible for and encouraged to apply for the CSWE minority fellowships. See https://www.cswe.org/Centers- Initiatives/Minority-Fellowship-Program/MFP-Doctoral-Students.aspx for information. For information regarding funding opportunities, see Student Aid (p. 42) in the nancial polices section of this CATALOG. Accreditation All doctoral degrees at Loma Linda University fall under the institution's regional accreditation by the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC). D.S.W. degrees are not currently accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), albeit the Council has engaged in public dialogue and dissemination of information that proposes that the criteria for accreditation of D.S.W. degrees will be articulated within the next three years in accordance with its Board's 2016 mandate. At present, the minimum program criteria to be eligible for consideration of future accreditation by CSWE is that: 1) all students must have earned a Master of Social Work (M.S.W.) degree from a program accredited by CSWE; and 2) all programs eligible for accreditation must demonstrate a program of study that is a minimum of three academic years of full-time study. The D.S.W. program at Loma Linda University has been designed to meet these criteria from inception and will apply for CSWE accreditation once available. Admissions Applicants must meet Loma Linda University (p. 23) and School of Behavioral Health (p. 150) admissions requirements, and give evidence of academic ability, professional comportment, and mature judgment. The Doctor of Social Work degree curriculum represents advanced studyover and above the M.S.W. degree. Admission is based on an integrated evaluation of the following criteria: M.S.W. degree or equivalent (e.g., M.S.S.W.) from a program that is accredited by the CSWE A minimum of four-years professional social work experience post receipt of the M.S.W. degree A minimum M.S.W.

Normal time to complete the program Four (4) years based on full-time enrollment; part time permittedSocial Work \u2014 M.S.W. Program director Kimberly Freeman The social work profession centers on improvement of the quality of life for people and the enhancement of human potential for full, productive participation in society. With this philosophy at its core, the master's degree offered by the Social Work Program (M.S.W.) in the School of Behavioral Health emphasizes an ecological perspective that focuses on the interaction of a person or system with their environment. Reflecting this stance is Loma Linda University's motto, \"To make man whole\" and its heritage as an international leader in the delivery of health-care services and related facilities. It is the combination of these influences that has guided the development of the generalist curriculum, clinical practice specialization, and selection of practicum sites for the Social Work program. Mission The mission of the Master of Social Work Program at Loma Linda University is to prepare competent, ethical, and compassionate advanced social work practitioners who possess the knowledge, values, attitudes, and skills necessary for lives dedicated to whole person care in advanced practice and leadership roles within behavioral health institutions and agencies. Goals The goals of the M.S.W. degree in social work are to: Instill in graduates the knowledge, ethics, values, and skills expected of professional social workers. Prepare students for advanced practice with diverse populations and the advancement of social and economic justice in local, national, and international communities. Equip students to integrate research and practice for advancing the profession of social work. Prepare advanced social work practitioners for work in behavioral health institutions and agencies. Transition students into professional roles with a commitment to lifelong learning. Program outcomes Reflected in the above goals are the following nine social work competencies that describe the knowledge, values, skills, and the cognitive and affective processes that dene and inform generalist and clinical practice. By the end of the program, the graduate should be able to: 1.Demonstrate ethical and professional behavior; 2.Engage in diversity and difference in practice; 3.Advance human rights and social, economic, and environmental justice; 4.Engage in practice-informed research and research-informed practice; 5.Engage in 6.Engage with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities; 7.Assess individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities; 8.Intervene with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities;190 Social Work \u2014 M.S.W. 9.Evaluate practice with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Liberal arts preparation The M.S.W. degree curriculum is built on a liberal arts perspective. Individual applicants whose undergraduate degree does not reflect this perspective may be asked to enroll in additional courses. Prerequisite requirements must be completed before admission to the M.S.W. degree program. General overview The program begins with rst-year, generalist content common to all graduate social work education. The generalist practice curriculum is grounded in the liberal arts and the person-in-the-environment framework. Students learn to promote social well-being, and build on the strength and resiliency of all human beings through a range of prevention and intervention practice methods when working with diverse individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Integrated within the curriculum, students learn to apply ethical principles, critical thinking and research-informed practice at the micro, mezzo, and macro levels while maintaining an emphasis on diversity, advocacy for human rights, and social and economic justice. The clinical practice specialization builds on the strengths-based and ecological practice perspective of the generalist curriculum by extending, expanding, and enhancing students' abilities to effectively engage in advanced clinical practice. This requires the integration of generalist and clinical practice theories and intervention methods as applied to individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Theoretical perspectives include empowerment, strengths approach, attachment, child development, risk and resiliency, trauma, cognitive neuroscience, family systems, cognitive behavior, and psychodynamics; all of which are enhanced by the person-in-the-environment perspective. These theoretical underpinnings support student skill acquisition and development through clinical specialization courses with a rm grounding in engagement, diagnostic assessment, problem solving, social policy, and evidence-informed treatment approaches. Students' clinical practice experiences also address the needs and rights of all persons to promote social and economic justice. Clinical students learn to be alert to and understand the importance of continuous self-reflection and practice evaluation. Program options On-Campus M.S.W. Program Program options have been designed to address the varying needs of students. As such, the program offers two-, three-, and four-year options. Students completing the two-year option cannot be engaged in regular full-time employment. An advanced standing option is also available to qualied B.S.W. degree graduates (see below). Hybrid M.S.W. Program An online hybrid (online and onsite) M.S.W. degree program is offered to meet the varying needs of students who are not able to attend a traditional program due to full-time employment or with geographic hardship within Southern California. Degree requirements for the M.S.W. hybrid cohort are the same as those required for the on-campus cohorts for the three-year, part-time option. A separate application portal has been created for the hybrid M.S.W. program option. Courses for theonsite portion of this hybrid program are taught on the main campus on Wednesday evenings. Inquiries about this program should be directed to the Dr. Kimberly Freeman, M.S.W. degree program director. Advanced standing for B.S.W. degree graduates Students who have earned a B.S.W. degree from a Council on Social Work Education (CSWE)-accredited program within the past ve years have the opportunity to remove areas of redundancy in their educations through consideration for advanced standing. In their personal statements, which are part of the application for admission to the M.S.W. degree program, B.S.W. degree graduates can request consideration for advanced standing status and thus have the opportunity to complete the M.S.W. degree in 12 months. Students completing the advanced standing track must begin the M.S.W. degree program during the Summer Quarter, which requires individuals to submit all components of their application packet by January 15 of the enrollment year. Exceptions to this date will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Advanced standing students enrolling as part of the summer cohort are eligible to receive a tuition waiver covering up to 14 units, not including living expenses and fees. See the M.S.W. Handbook on the department social-work>. (http://behavioralhealth.llu.edu/programs/social-work/ msw-social-work/ ) Transfer students Transfer students who have taken courses in an M.S.W. degree program accredited by the Council on Social Work Education may transfer up to 20 percent of the 78 units required for the M.S.W. degree at Loma Linda University, unless otherwise approved. Evaluation of all courses is conducted on a case-by-case basis using course outlines, transcripts, and course catalog entries to review and assure adequate equivalency. The Academic Standards Committee evaluates these equivalencies. The 20 percent transfer of units is limited to credits that have not already been applied to a degree and for which a B (G.P .A. of 3.0) grade or better has been recorded. Transferred course grades are not calculated into a student's G.P .A. earned while matriculating through the program at Loma Linda University. A maximum of nine quarter units that have been previously applied to another master's degree may be accepted as transfer credits in the areas of research methods and statistics. Individuals wishing to transfer research methods and/or statistics courses must rst pass the program's competency examination/s in these areas. Consideration is given to other course transfers on a case-by-case basis. Professional, eld practica grades/credits are not typically transferable \u2014review is made on a case-by-case basis. Consideration may be given if there is clear evidence that the student has met the practice competencies of the M.S.W. degree program. No academic credit is given for life experience and/or previous work experience for any part for the M.S.W. degree program (i.e., generalist and clinical practica, courses in the generalist or clinical specialization curricula).Loma Linda University 2020-2021 191 Central academic requirements and processes M.S.W. advancement G.P .A. The M.S.W. degree advancement G.P .A. provides an initial predictor of success. The rst 12 units completed toward the M.S.W. degree, including units acquired during non-matriculation, must be completed with a G.P .A. of 3.0. Students who fail to achieve this level may be dismissed from school. Students receive orientation to the process and requirements of the M.S.W. degree advancement G.P .A. during the new student orientation. Qualifying review When all generalist course work is completed, students are required to pass the program's qualifying review (see the M.S.W. Handbook ). The intent of this process is to: assist faculty members and students in the assessment of strengths and areas for improvement, provide feedback, foster an environment of self-evaluation, and encourage heightened participation in individualized academic development. Generalist and clinical practica Field practica are regarded as an integral part of the Social Work Program as these offer students opportunities to integrate and apply theoretical and research knowledge with social work practice and intervention skills in institutional or agency settings. Practica are designed and selected to provide maximum learning opportunities under the supervision of a qualied eld instructor. As such, experiences are patterned to build upon one another, presenting the increasing challenges present in the continuum of generalist to clinical practice. Students complete 1,080 hours of eld work in a qualied setting and 120 hours of concurrent integrated seminar for a total of 1,200 hours. The emphasis of SOWK 757A Generalist Practicum and Seminar, SOWK Seminar, and SOWK 757C Generalist Practicum and Seminar (480 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar or nine generalist practica units) is on achieving generalist social work knowledge, values, and skills; including developing rapport with agency personnel and clients, acquiring interviewing skills, and obtaining beginning-level psychosocial assessment and intervention capabilities. The content of the concurrent seminar further supports this perspective as it provides students with opportunities to integrate their practicum experiences with their developing professional identity. The emphasis of SOWK 787A Advance Clinical Case Consultation, SOWK 787B Advanced Clinical Case Consultation, and SOWK 787C Advanced Clinical Case Consultation(600 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar or 12 clinical practica units) reflects the clinical practice specialization and provides the depth and breadth of learning opportunities that underpin the acquisition of advanced practice capabilities. Specically, clinical practica experiences are expected to promote increased insight and understanding of agency and/or client systems as these build on the generalist skills achieved during the rst year of study. Research The program includes completion of course work in applied research. An individually-authored thesis option is available for students meeting program criteria. These study options aim to develop knowledge for the advancement of social work practice and provide guided experiences in the conduct of research applicable to a variety of professional andacademic settings. Guidelines for these options are provided by the program. Wholeness portfolio Each student completes a wholeness portfolio during the generalist and clinical practica, and seminar experiences. This review of the student's individualized objectives and professional development begins during the rst year of study and culminates during the second year of study as the student completes the nal quarter of the clinical practicum. This experience emphasizes the student's plans for employment, lifelong learning, and integration of the core values of Loma Linda University. It is seen as a capstone academic experience that facilitates closure, and the nal stage of reflection and review in the development of transitioning professional. Combined degrees Students interested in completing a combined degrees curriculum with Social Work and Gerontology, Social Work and Criminal Justice programs, or the Social Work and Social Policy and Social Research programs should contact the Social Work Department directly.

I invite you to learn more about our clinical services, programs, and exceptional dental school family of students, faculty, and staff. Robert A. Handysides, D.D.S. Dean, School of Dentistry Loma Linda University 2020-2021 195 School foundations History A small but determined group of dentists met during the summer of 1943 in Grand Ledge, Michigan. Their purpose was to establish an organization that would serve as a catalyst, urging the Seventh-day Adventist Church to sponsor a dental school where young adults could learn the dental profession in an environment consistent with their religious beliefs. These men were the founders of the National Association of Seventh-day Adventist Dentists (NASDAD). Under the leadership of Dr. J. Russell Mitchell, the organization's rst president, the goal of a Christian dental school began taking conceptual form. NASDAD expanded in membership and objectives through men such as Dr. C. C. Ray, who toured the country on his own time in search of fellow Seventh-day Adventist dentists who were willing to pursue NASDAD's goals. Dr. M. Webster Prince served as president of NASDAD in 1948 and 1949. At a meeting in San Francisco in 1949, NASDAD members voted unanimously to support the dental school project. Later that year at a NASDAD session in Hinsdale, Illinois, the members pledged a strong nancial base in support of their goals. The momentum of the effort became evident in the early 1950s. The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, under the guidance of President W. H. Branson, asked Dr. Prince to conduct a feasibility study. Subsequently, ofcial action was taken in 1951 to authorize establishment of the School of Dentistry as a unit of Loma Linda University's School of Medicine. Dr. Prince was selected as the rst dean of the School of Dentistry. His leadership in organizing and eventually administering the new School of Dentistry was facilitated by his prior experience as president of the Michigan Dental Association and as chair of the American Dental Association Council on Dental Education. Forty- two students comprised the inaugural class in the late fall of 1953. A dental hygiene curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science degree was developed in 1959 under the direction of Dr. Gerald A. Mitchell, chair of the Department of Periodontics. Violet Bates became chair of the new department, and the rst class of ten dental hygienists graduated in 1961. In 1960, Dr. Charles T . Smith became dean. During this period, the school experienced positive growth in many areas. A dental assisting curriculum was developed in 1968 under the leadership of Betty Zendner. The rst class graduated in 1969, receiving the Associate in Science degree. A dental auxiliary utilization (DAU) program was initiated to provide enhanced learning for dental students. The Monument Valley Dental Clinic for Navajo Indians was started in 1966, and Dean Smith succeeded in nding from public sources scal support for the clinic building and for faculty housing. New advanced education (postdoctoral) programs were initiated in ve clinical disciplines: orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics, and oral pathology. During the 1970s, the School of Dentistry continued its evolution into one of the premier clinical programs in the United States. Dr. Judson Klooster became dean in 1971. One of his major contributions was the expansion of Prince Hall, which was completed in May 1976. The new building more than doubled the number of clinical units; provided facilities for specialized areas of clinical instruction; and included eight new research laboratories, new classrooms, seminar rooms, amphitheaters, urgently needed teacher ofce space, and a commensurate expansion of support facilities and services. The Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic wasremodeled, and an outpatient surgicenter was developed to meet the needs of patients requiring general anesthesia for dental treatment. The School of Dentistry became an important regional resource for providing dental care for developmentally disabled children and adults, many of whom require such a treatment setting. The Biomaterials Research Laboratory was constructed; and new advanced education programs were initiated in pediatric dentistry, implant dentistry, dental anesthesiology, and prosthodontics. A new program was established in 1985 to provide a U.S. dental education for internationally trained dentists. An increasing number of dental professionals from other countries were seeking an American education and the opportunity to practice dentistry in the United States or to gain advanced knowledge to share in their own countries. The International Dentist Program continues to offer an intensive, twenty-four-month course of study leading to a D.D.S. degree. The program has added a six-month certicate program limited to dental missionaries from other countries who sense the need for updated continuing education. Beginning with the nineteen-year deanship of Dr. Charles Goodacre in 1994, the School of Dentistry focused particularly on research, service learning, and technology that included the development of electronic learning materials and the acquisition and utilization of 3D computed tomography (3DCT) and computer-aided manufacture (CAD/CAM) technology. In 2000, the rst major expansion of the School of Dentistry in more than twenty years added 15,000 square feet to Prince Hall on the east side and provided two new patient entrances. The expanded Special Care Dentistry Clinic and the enlarged Pediatric Dentistry Clinic were relocated to the ground floor. An additional student laboratory was also included on that level. On the second floor, the new space allowed for expansion of the predoctoral clinic, with thirty-six additional operatories. A preclinical laboratory was remodeled into a simulation laboratory in 2008. The laboratory included flat-panel monitors with access to faculty presentations and the clinical management system. In the autumn of 2010, the LLU Center for Dentistry and Orthodontics was opened in San Bernardino, three miles from the school. The three-story treatment, research, and teaching facility brought together the University's Advanced Education Program in orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics and the School of Dentistry's faculty practices \u2014creating the most comprehensive oral health care center in the Inland Empire. A year later (August 2012), another opening featured the school's groundbreaking for the Hugh Love Center for Research and Education in Technology. Comprising six operatories and a three-chair open clinic, the 3,000-square-foot center enables qualied students, under faculty supervision, the opportunity to treat patients using the very latest in dental technology. Dr. Ronald J. Dailey was named School of Dentistry dean in July of 2013. Having led the school through all of its academic challenges as an associate dean since 1993, Dr. Dailey was well prepared to pilot the school's programs through revisions that accommodate new accreditation standards; as well as the Joint Commission on National Dental Board Examination's integration of basic, clinical, and behavioral sciences into a single national board examination. The School of Dentistry continues to regularly expand the opportunities for enhanced student learning by improving physical facilities; making196 School of Dentistry regular curricular modications; and reinforcing the excellence of its clinical practices in light of its motto, \"Service Is Our Calling. \" Our mission Loma Linda University School of Dentistry seeks to further the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ as: Students learn to provide high-quality oral health care based on sound biologic principles.

This section of the CATALOG provides the general setting for the programs of the School of Dentistry and outlines the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specic program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs.Specic program requirements Information on the preceding pages pertains to general requirements governing all students. The student is reminded of individual responsibility to be fully informed not only of these general requirements but also of the specic requirements in the following pages, which govern the curriculum of the chosen program. Programs and degrees The School of Dentistry offers a comprehensive range of programs. Each of the school's six programs draws on the curricula of the various departments. 1.The undergraduate curriculum, the DENTAL HYGIENE program, leads to the Bachelor of Science degree and prepares the dental hygienist to enter a variety of careers. Dental hygiene is a four-year college curriculum; the junior and senior years are taken in the Loma Linda University School of Dentistry. 2.The four-year professional curriculum, the GENERAL DENTISTRY program, leads to the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree and equips the general dentist to meet the needs of a diverse patient population. 3.The INTERNATIONAL DENTIST program, a two-academic- year curriculum, leads to a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from Loma Linda University. The program is designed for the dentist who has previously earned a dental degree outside the United States. 4.ADVANCED DENTAL EDUCATION programs lead to postdoctoral certicates in eight specialty and non-specialty areas of dentistry and, at the student's option, additionally to a Master of Science or a Master of Science in Dentistry degree. 5.The COMBINED DEGREES program leads to the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree (through the School of Dentistry) earned concurrently with a Master of Arts degree in Bioethics (through the School of Religion)\u2014D.D.S./M.A. Combined degrees program D.D.S. / M.A. The combined degrees program leading to the Doctor of Dental Surgery and the Master of Arts in bioethics is designed to t the schedule of Doctor of Dental Surgery degree students. Ethics in dentistry is an emerging academic interest, and this program aims to evolve the dental school into one of a very select few in the nation known for their expertise in ethical issues. This program requires 48 units of credit. This degree is offered cooperatively by the School of Religion and the School of Dentistry. Awards All School of Dentistry students are eligible to receive awards of various kinds for demonstrated excellence, scholastic attainment, leadership ability, technical ability, professional prociency, initiative, and other accomplishments or achievements, according to the bases established by the donors. Awards are given through various organizations, associations, and school and university departments. The names of all award recipients are printed in the University commencement program. Student life School of Dentistry inherent requirements In harmony with its own didactic, clinical, research, and service objectives, and using the American Dental Education Association suggested guidelines, Loma Linda University School of Dentistry hasLoma Linda University 2020-2021 197 identied the following inherent requirements for entry into all its programs. Cognition Students must have the cognitive abilities that allow the accurate and effective ability to measure, verify, calculate, reason, analyze, synthesize, and critically problem solve. Effective dental education requires the capacity to gather, organize, and assess relevant information in order to arrive at integrated solutions. Students must be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and understand the spatial relationships of structures in order to fully solve clinical problems. Sensation and perception For learning to occur, students must be able to visualize and comprehend physical demonstrations in the classroom, laboratory, and clinic. Such observation requires the functional use of vision, touch, hearing, smell, and somatic sensation. Specically, students must be able to acquire information from written documents and to visualize information presented in images from papers, videos, and digital media\u2014including interpretation of radiographic and other graphic images, with or without the use of assistive devices. Sufcient visual acuity is required to read charts, records, small print, and handwritten notations. Adequate visual and tactile skills are also necessary to perform dental examinations and provide treatment. Visual acuity, accommodation, and color vision are necessary to discern variations in color, shape, and general appearance between normal and abnormal hard and soft tissues. Students must be able to observe and describe changes in mood, activity, and posture in their patients, possessing skills in effective perception and understanding of nonverbal communications. Accurately noting verbal and nonverbal communication is essential when performing dental operations or administering medications. Communication skills Students must be fluent in the use of standard written and spoken English. They must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients, the faculty and staff, and other students. Specically, students must be able to observe, hear, and speak to patients in order to elicit and provide information. In addition, they must have the ability to read and understand written communications and generate effective oral and written communications with all members of the health-care team. This includes the ability to discern when a matter is of a condential nature in order to maintain condentiality. Students may be required to remediate written and/or verbal language skills before admission or during their program. This remediation may include accent modication. Fine and gross motor skills Students need sufcient motor and sensory capability in both hands to provide general dental care; to perform palpation, percussion, auscultation and other diagnostic maneuvers; basic laboratory tests; and diagnostic procedures. These actions require ne and gross muscular movements, coordination, and equilibrium. Individuals must be able to operate foot controls utilizing ne movements, operating high- or low- speed dental instruments to achieve accurate movements of less than one-half millimeter. Students must be able to perform basic life support (e.g., CPR), transfer and position disabled patients, assist patients who lack motor control, and position themselves around the patient and dental chair.Behavioral and psychosocial attributes Students must possess the emotional stability and demonstrate the resilience required by a challenging educational program. Success requires use of good judgment, insight, self-motivation, self-assessment and self-control, high achievement striving, and the development of a mature, sensitive, and effective personal relationship style. It is imperative that students be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. Students must be able to adapt to changing environments, demonstrate flexibility, and learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical issues of many patients. Compassion, integrity, honesty, concern for others, and cultural sensitivity are required personal qualities. Disabled applicants and students The LLU School of Dentistry provides reasonable and appropriate accommodations in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act for individuals with documented disabilities who demonstrate a need for accommodation. The Americans with Disabilities Act denes a person with a disability as an individual with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Problems such as English as a second language, test anxiety, or slow reading without an identied underlying physical or mental decit, or failure to achieve a desired outcome are generally not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act. To be considered for an accommodation based on a learning disability, a student must experience marked difculty when compared with the average person in the general population, not just other dental school students, in one or more basic academic areas as a result of a signicant information processing or attentional disorder. Students requesting accommodations must provide supporting documentation for the disability requiring accommodation, including: A report from a licensed professional approved by Loma Linda University School of Dentistry identifying the diagnosed disability and the recommended accommodations. Record of any previous accommodations provided by educational institutions or other testing agencies. If no prior accommodations were provided, the licensed professional should include a detailed explanation as to why no accommodations were given in the past and why they are needed now. Documentation needs to be reviewed by the assistant dean for admissions and student affairs, before accommodation is formally implemented. While awaiting assessment and documentation, temporary accommodation may be granted. The temporary accommodation will not exceed 90 days. Students requesting accommodation are responsible for: Reporting their request for accommodation to the Ofce of Admissions and Student Affairs Providing the supporting documentation Policies for this school The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the198 School of Dentistry contents of the Student Handbook at <http://www.llu.edu/assets/central/ handbook/documents/Student-Handbook.pdf >. Professional ethics Successful students should demonstrate behaviors and attributes in harmony with School of Dentistry's core values. The school seeks students who openly and enthusiastically align themselves with the following core values: Belief in God Spiritual maturity Demonstrated compassion Service to others Commitment to excellence Critical thinking Respect for self and others Ethical integrity Principled care Pursuit of knowledge Conscientiousness and industry Effective communication The school code of ethics expands and elaborates Loma Linda University's standards of ethical conduct. Organized dentistry is proud of its reputation for honesty and integrity. These virtues are essential if dentistry is to continue to maintain its position of trust in society. The establishment of peer review committees, ethics committees, codes of ethics, and other regulatory and/or advisory processes and standards within the profession indicate a vital and continuing concern for maintaining high standards of integrity. The School of Dentistry is a partner in this process where future professionals are selected and trained in the development of professional and ethical attitudes consistent with the highest goals of the profession. The school seeks to broaden students' ethical perceptions by including a religious perspective not always found in ethical codes. By adding a spiritual foundation to the professions' ethical frameworks, it is anticipated that the dental professionals' ethic will be more completely informed and not only will reflect concern for their fellows, but also will reflect an intimate relationship with the Creator God. The code contains specic admonitions that are limited in number but comprehensive in nature. It is anticipated that the values of honesty, integrity, and altruism will be enhanced during professional training so that, following graduation, these virtues will be second nature in the service provided to patients. Thus, the relationship of trust between dental professional and patient can develop to benet both the profession and the public. This is a goal the school feels it must meet as it seeks to train dental professionals to become competent in all aspects of patient care. The School of Dentistry code of ethics applies to all students (associate and baccalaureate dental hygiene; predoctoral, including international dentist students; graduate, certicate, residents, fellows, preceptors, research scholars; and exchange students). The School of Dentistry code of professional ethics with its specic guidelines is available for review in Section VII of the LLU Student Handbook.Student leadership Student Government Loma Linda University American Student Dental Association (LLU ASDA) is composed of peer voted student ofcials who are charged by administration to carry out the actions necessary for a successful student government, as well as serving as a representation for he ASDA chapter at regional and national meetings and events. LLU ASDA's central body if the Executive Council (EC) compromised of the First Delegate/ President, Second Delegate/President-elect, two class representatives, secretary, and treasurer. The EC has the authority to appoint members to other designated ofces to fulll the work of the local chapter as needed and delegate duties to subcommittees as needed in governing the student body, including representation for other state and national professional organizations (CDA, ADEA, AGD) and class leadership. The EC oversees the utilization of all funds paid by student dues and obtained through fundraising. Elections for all positions of LLU ASDA occur in the Spring Quarter. Class leadership Class leaders are elected annually during the Autumn term for the rst year and Spring term thereafter.

A student may not concurrently register for courses in another school of the University without permission from the associate dean for academic affairs. Attendance Regular attendance at lectures, clinics, and other assemblies is required of all students. All lectures and laboratories provide information essential for successful completion of the program. Each student is responsible for all material covered and assignments made. Absences in excess of 15 percent may be sufcient cause for a failing or unsatisfactory grade to be recorded. Clinics and individual courses/instructors may have more stringent requirements. Length of academic residence To fulll the requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, the student must be registered for a full course load at the University for the entire junior year for the Associate in Science degree; and the entire senior year for the Bachelor of Science degree; and the entire third (D3) and fourth (D4) years for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Dean's list Outstanding academic performance will be rewarded by publication of the Dean's List each review period. The eligibility requirements are: Complete at least 12 units of graded course work during the term. Achieve a term grade point average of at least 3.5 with no grade lower than a B-. Receive no incomplete (I) grades on the grade report. Course waiver A course requirement may be waived if the applicant has previously taken the course and earned a grade of B or above, but no credit results. Evaluation for waiver of courses will be completed only after an applicant has been accepted to the program, and must be approved by the course director at this University and the school's associate dean for academic affairs. Tuition is not reduced if courses are waived or if a student takes less than a full load. Examinations It is the policy of the school that all students are expected to take examinations at the scheduled time. The only acceptable excuse for not taking an examination on time is major illness (documented by the Student Health Service and conveyed to the course director). The consequences of missing an examination under the circumstances of documented illness are determined by the course director. If a studentappears late for an examination, s/he may be denied admission to the examination site. If a student arrives late for an examination and is allowed to take it, s/he will be required to nish the examination at the same time as students who arrive on time. Repeating/remediating a course (predoctoral, IDP , and dental hygiene programs) If a student receives an unsatisfactory or failing grade in a required course, it will be necessary for them to do additional work. Based on the original grade earned by the student, and upon the recommendation of the Academic Review Committee, one of the following plans will be pursued: 1.For courses with unsatisfactory performance (D+/D/U grades), the student must reregister for the course, review the course work independently, repeat required assignments or quizzes, and take any or all course examinations as required by the course director. The highest grade allowed for a remediated course is C. At the discretion of the Academic Review Committee and course director, the student may be required to repeat the course at the next course offering. 2.For courses with failing performance (F grades), the student must reregister for the course, attend the class and/or laboratory, and take all course examinations at the next regular course offering. 3.Both the original and repeat grades are entered into the student's permanent academic record, but only the repeat grade units are computed in the grade point average. 4.Under certain circumstances and upon recommendation of the Academic Review Committee, a student may remediate/repeat a maximum of 12 units during the current and subsequent academic year. Upon such recommendation, the student will be permitted to move forward as a member of the cohort with which they enrolled.

National Dental Board Examinations Attempting the Integrated National Board Dental Examination (INBDE) is a requirement for graduation. The INBDE is designed to assess cognitive knowledge of the basic, behavioral, and clinical sciences. Eligibilityto sit for the INBDE is determined by successful completion of the curriculum leading up to the examination. In addition, students are required to pass a comprehensive examination that assesses mastery of the test specications prior to the INBDE. The eligibility requirements and timetable for passing the INBDE is as follows: INBDE examination is scheduled after the third year. A candidate for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree must have attempted the INBDE at least once before being awarded the D.D.S. degree. Procedures for academic review (predoctoral, IDP , and dental hygiene programs) There are review committees: D1, D2, D3, D4, IDP , and Dental Hygiene. Membership of each committee consists of the associate dean, academic affairs; the assistant dean, admissions and student affairs; and the department representative/course directors of all courses required of the respective class in the academic year. The associate dean, clinic administration, the clinic director, and primary attending faculty are members of the D3/D4 academic review committees. In addition, each committee has two student members appointed by the dean in consultation with the assistant dean, admissions and student affairs and DSA ofcers. Student committee members will be in the class one year ahead of the class being reviewed. The academic review committees meet a minimum of two times annually to evaluate student academic and clinical performance and progress records. Students whose performance does not meet the stated academic standards and students who are being considered for academic sanctions may be scheduled for a hearing with the committee. The committee also recommends to the dean all appropriate candidates for promotion, academic probation, repeat, or other appropriate actions; as well as students who should receive special recognition for academic excellence. The process for evaluation of academic performance is as follow: 1.The academic review committee\u2014by reviewing grades, reports, and other pertinent information\u2014identies students whose academic and/or clinical performance is below acceptable levels. 2.The assistant dean for admissions and student affairs noties a student facing possible academic sanctions regarding the time and place for a hearing called for the purpose of allowing the student to appear before the committee to present reasons why action should not be taken. The academic review committee considers the student's presentation and all available information before making a recommendation. 3.The dean may enforce one or more of four academic sanction options: Academic probation Remedial action Academic leave of absence Academic discontinuation Please refer to the academic disciplinary policy for more specic descriptions regarding each academic sanction. 4.A student may appeal the recommendation of the academic review committee to the dean. Such appeals are not expected to be routine and should be considered only in circumstances where new and relevant information exists that was not available for consideration by the academic review committee. The dean will decide if the appealingLoma Linda University 2020-2021 201 student will be permitted to continue participating in classes and/or clinical assignments during the appeal proceedings. The dean will review the matter and either render a decision or appoint a three-member ad hoc committee. Members of this committee will not have been involved in the academic review committee decision process. The ad hoc committee will determine whether the process was appropriately followed, review new information, and judge whether the record supports the recommendation. They will report their ndings and recommendation to the dean, who will decide if the appeal is warranted or not. Academic disciplinary policy (predoctoral, IDP , and dental hygiene programs) Academic probation Academic probation is a specied period of time during which the student is given an opportunity to comply with specic academic standards. Such action must be conrmed by letter to the student. Criteria for placement on academic probation A student will be placed on academic probation if s/he meets one or more of the following conditions: 1.Term or cumulative grade point average (G.P .A.) below 2.0. 2.Failing or unsatisfactory (U/F/D+/D) grades in any course required for the degree. 3.Social/behavioral/ethical problems that signicantly impact academic and/or clinical performance. Level of academic probation The level of academic probation indicates the seriousness of the cumulative academic deciency. However, depending on the seriousness or nature of the academic deciency, a student may be considered for academic leave of absence or discontinuation at any level of probation. Level I First term on academic probation Level II Second term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term or failure to reregister in the succeeding year. Level III Third term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. If a student is unable to remove academic probationary status within the following term, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term or failure to reregister in the succeeding year. Level IV If a student meets the criteria for academic probation for a fourth term, consecutive or nonconsecutive, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. Restrictions for a student on academic probation A student on academic probation: 1.May not serve as an ofcer for any class, school, or extracurricular organization. 2.May not take any elective courses. 3.May not participate in any elective off-campus, service-learning, or mission activities.4.Remains on academic probation until all the terms of the probation sanctions have been fullled, unless the student is discontinued. Remedial action or remediation As a condition for continued enrollment, remedial action for the student may consist of: 1.Counseling, tutoring, and/or repeating assignments or course work; or completing additional assignments or course work, possibly including repeating an academic year or portion thereof. 2.Other specied requirements. Academic leave of absence Academic leave of absence is a specied period of time during which the student is withdrawn from the academic program. Upon request to and approval by the academic review committee, the student may return to the program at a year/term level specied by the committee. The student may be requested to fulll specic requirements prior to re-entering the academic program. The following guidelines pertain to when an academic leave of absence may be considered for a student who is in one or more of the following situations: Student has a serious academic decit that cannot be removed while continuing with current course work. At the end of the academic year, student does not meet the criteria for promotion to the next academic year. Student has three consecutive reviews or terms on academic probation. Student has not passed the National Board Dental Examination on schedule after two attempts and needs full study time to prepare for the National Board Dental Examination. Student fullls criteria for academic discontinuation, yet shows promise for future success despite current deciencies. Return from an academic leave of absence requires that the student reapply for admission by written request to the assistant dean for admissions and student affairs. The student must meet the requirements for readmission specied by the academic review committee at the time the leave of absence was granted. The requirements for readmission may also be reviewed by the academic review committee. Academic discontinuation Guidelines for academic discontinuation are indicated below for predoctoral, IDP , and dental hygiene students: D1 Year Any term with one or more failing grades, regardless of term or cumulative G.P .A. Three or more unsatisfactory or failing grades within the academic year, regardless of term or cumulative G.P .A. Three consecutive reviews or terms on academic probation. Failure to fulll terms of academic probation within the specied time period. Failure to meet criteria for promotion to D2 year by the end of the D1 year.

Failure to achieve eligibility for graduation within three full academic years of enrollment in the dental hygiene program. In some situations, the academic review committee may recommend that a student repeat an academic year (or portion thereof) as an alternative to discontinuation. Scholastic standing Grades and grade points for the predoctoral, IDP , and dental hygiene programs may be found in Section II of this catalog, with the following exceptions:Satisfactory (S)\u2014grade if the student exceeded the minimum requirements for overall performance. Marginal Satisfactory (MS)\u2014grade if the student met but did not exceed the minimum requirements for overall performance. Unsatisfactory (U)\u2014grade if the student did not meet the minimum requirements for overall performance. Student-initiated academic grievance procedure If a student wishes to contest a grade, they should discuss the grade rst with the instructor, where appropriate; then with the course director, if applicable; and nally with the department chair. If the student is not satised, they may then appeal to the associate dean for academic affairs (for further discussion of the academic grievance process, see Loma Linda University Student Handbook, Section V\u2014University Policies). Service-learning Service-learning at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry continues the original purpose of the school\u2014to train dental health professionals to provide service to underserved populations, both locally and abroad. Field experience for students of dentistry and dental hygiene includes extramural opportunities within the U.S. and in foreign countries. In addition to providing clinical treatment, service-learning experiences include local health fairs and elementary school dental health presentations. Service experiences may last from one day to several weeks. All students are required to complete assigned service-learning rotations and minimum clock hours, as described in each program. Predoctoral dental students are required to complete a minimum of 120 service- learning hours. Forty hours must be completed doing local community service dentistry. Up to 30 of the remaining 80 hours may be completed doing non-dental service. Dental hygiene students must complete 75 service-learning hours. Thirty-ve hours of local service are required, and up to 15 non-dental service hours may be credited. International Dentist Program students must complete 60 hours of service. Of the 60 hours, 40 will be assigned by the program. Up to 10 hours of non-dental service may be completed as part of the 60 hours total requirement. In addition, a didactic component is included within the service-learning program. Lectures are embedded within existing courses and occur throughout the curricula. Students are required to be in good and regular standing to be eligible to participate in elective international service-learning experiences. Learning environment Because the study of dental sciences and arts is based on a foundation in essentially the same science subjects as are studied in medicine and allied health curricula, the School of Dentistry shares with the School of Medicine the facilities for teaching basic sciences. Classrooms, laboratories, student lounges, teachers' ofces, and clinical facilities related solely to dentistry occupy the School of Dentistry building, named in honor of M. Webster Prince, the rst dean. Prince Hall is on the University mall facing the University Church and adjacent to the Medical Center. The facilities effectively accommodate collaboration with the Medical Center in ongoing research and service programs. The total resources of the University constitute a wealth of opportunity for the student with initiative and willingness to develop individual capacity to the fullest extent. Students nd varied opportunities for serving and learning in the immediate University community, in school-Loma Linda University 2020-2021 203 sponsored service-learning clinics, clinical and research electives, and diverse volunteer programs. Basic sciences The Loma Linda University departments of basic sciences include anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, and physiology and pharmacology. The basic sciences serve as the foundation for the dental sciences by leading toward an understanding of normal structure and function, as well as introducing the basis for pathology in the practice of dentistry. Subjects are taught in the rst year of the dental hygiene and the rst two years of the general dentistry curricula as part of three conceptually integrated sequences of courses\u2014sequences in physiology, in anatomy, and in applied science. Throughout the basic sciences, an appreciation of God's creation and His wisdom is reinforced through the study of human biology. Students are encouraged to extend their knowledge and apply it for their own well-being and for the well-being of their patients. The purpose of the basic science curriculum is to provide a foundation of knowledge that is essential for the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene. The faculty is dedicated to providing students with tools that expand their thinking and challenge them to ask probing questions and to earnestly search for answers. Its aim is to prepare students to excel scientically. The higher aim is, through the Christian atmosphere of this University, to prepare students to become truly compassionate dentists. Financial information Financial policies The Ofce of the Dean is the nal authority in all nancial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all nancial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. General nancial practices The student is expected to arrange for nancial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Previous accounts with other schools or this University must be settled. Satisfactory academic progress policy (all programs) To be eligible for federal, state, and University nancial aid, students are required by the U.S. Department of Education and the state of California to maintain satisfactory progress toward their degree objectives. In compliance with prescribed regulations, the University and School of Dentistry have established guidelines that are designed to ensure thatstudents successfully complete courses to promote timely advancement toward a specic degree objective. Denition of satisfactory academic progress The School of Dentistry denes satisfactory academic progress by the following three criteria: 1.Meeting a minimum grade point average requirement 2.Making yearly progress by completing the academic requirements dened for a program 3.Completing the degree objective within the maximum time allowed Grade point average requirement To maintain satisfactory academic progress, students in the predoctoral, IDP , and dental hygiene programs must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0. In addition, dental hygiene students must achieve no grade lower than a C- in all core courses. Yearly progress requirement Each student's academic progress is evaluated by the Academic Review Committee throughout each academic term, and a cumulative review is conducted to determine eligibility for promotion at the end of each academic year. The Ofce of Academic Affairs monitors the minimum grade point average requirement. The Ofce of Financial Aid, along with the School of Dentistry Ofce of Academic Affairs, monitors yearly progress and the maximum time allowance. Students whose academic standing or degree progress falls below the standard receive a nancial aid warning during the next term of registration. If their academic standing or degree progress is not raised to the standard by the end of the term in which the nancial aid warning was issued, their nancial aid will be terminated until the requirements have been met. Reasonable degree progress It is expected that students will complete the requirements for a degree within the scheduled curriculum time. The Doctor of Dental Surgery degree is scheduled to be completed in four years for the traditional program and two years for the international program and may not exceed six for the traditional program and three for the international program. The Bachelor of Science degree in dental hygiene is scheduled to be completed in two years and may not exceed three years. Certication of status The Ofce of Academic Affairs will certify the ofcial status of each enrolled student at the end of each academic year to the Ofce of University Records and to the Ofce of Financial Aid. Student nancial aid Federal loans are available only to United States citizens, green card holders, or those with permanent resident status. With good credit or a creditworthy cosigner, federal loans may be used to cover the entire academic budget. For more information, contact the Ofce of Financial Aid < naid@llu.edu > or 909/558-4509.

Advanced Education Endodontics \u2014 post-D.D.S. and Dentofacial Orthopedics \u2014 M.S. (p. 239) Undergraduate Established in 1959, the Department of Dental Hygiene, the Bachelor of Science degree undergraduate curriculum of the School of Dentistry, is largely focused on preventive oral health services and continuing care. Dental science courses, preclinical lectures and seminars, laboratory exercises, and clinical assignments have been developed to provide training in the variety of procedures delegated to the dental hygienist within the dental practice setting. These experiences are sequenced in an organized manner that provides for continual growth, and competency in performance of all traditional and expanded function procedures.The purpose of the program is to develop professionals prepared for the current practice of dental hygiene, as well as graduates who are additionally prepared to deal with future changes in dentistry. Courses that encourage critical thinking and problem-solving techniques and that enhance the ability to evaluate the latest in research are important adjuncts to clinical training. Upon completion of this curriculum, graduates will be prepared to enter a variety of career options available to dental hygienists. Dental Hygiene Program curricula are approved by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC). The program is also approved by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. Philosophy A profession in the health arts and sciences calls increasingly for persons of intelligence, integrity, responsibility, and depth of human understanding. Therefore, the program of instruction is planned on a strong liberal arts foundation. The student is encouraged to take electives that contribute to breadth of knowledge and quality of values. The choice of electives in early college work is important for many reasons. The School of Dentistry is interested in applicants with the potential to become hygienists who are well-read and caring persons prepared to communicate effectively in professional and community relationships. They should be able to draw on knowledge of the structure and function of the human body in health and disease, applying resources based on Christian ideals and values to aid in the solution of personal problems. They should also be able to develop attitudes and skills that will most effectively serve society.206 Undergraduate Goal The goal of the Dental Hygiene Program is to educate competent, concerned, and active members of the dental hygiene profession who possess the ability to effectively perform the expanding scope of practice of the dental hygienist. Loma Linda University emphasizes Christian values and beliefs and the concept of whole person care. Opportunities for spiritual growth and fellowship among faculty and students are interwoven into daily academic pursuits, clinical practice, and social interactions. The advancement of dental hygiene depends on an ever-growing body of knowledge. Therefore, this program also places great importance on providing an atmosphere in which students can develop skills necessary to objectively assess new theories and trends in dentistry in light of scientic knowledge and principles. By combining Christian values with an appreciation for research and the scientic method, graduates will continually apply evidence-based principles to patient care and exhibit God's love in the quality of service they render.

(p. 210) International Dentist Program (IDP) \u2014 D.D.S. (p. 222) Dentistry \u2014 D.D.S. Dean Robert A. Handysides The goal of the General Dentistry Program is to train practitioners in the delivery of high-quality dental care that is preventive in purpose and comprehensive in scope, and that is based on sound biological principles. Curriculum Dentistry, like all health professions, exists to benet society. Therefore, it continually assesses its professional services to ascertain what measures, attitudes, and skills most effectively serve society. The School of Dentistry is committed to: Beginning the curriculum with a strong foundation in the sciences that are basic to knowledge of the structure and function of the human being in health and in sickness. Providing an educational environment that progressively leads a student to mastery and correlation of clinical sciences and skills. Developing a frame of reference from which to mobilize the resources of dentists and associated professional personnel in both delivery of health care and contribution to community well-being by education for the prevention of illness. These concepts include responsibility for contributing to the body of scientic knowledge by questioning, investigating, and teaching; for remaining sensitive and adaptive to the needs of humanity in ever- changing conditions; and for maintaining consciousness of the individual obligation to live, practice, and strive for the good of humanity. The curriculum in dentistry, organized to be completed in four academic years, fullls the requirements for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Objective The primary objective of the dentistry curriculum is to graduate individuals who attest to the purpose of the University and the goals of the School of Dentistry\u2014which include advancing knowledge and understanding of health, disease, and ways to improve health and the dental health-care delivery system through basic and applied research. Program learning outcomes By the end of the program, the graduate should be able to: 1.Perform clinical decision making that is supported by foundational knowledge and evidence-based rationales; 2.Promote, improve, and maintain oral health in patient-centered and community settings; 3.Function as a leader in a multicultural work environment and manage a diverse patient population; 4.Maintain physical, emotional, nancial, and spiritual health in one's personal life; 5.Apply ethical principles to professional practice.Regulations The student is also subject to the conditions of registration, attendance, nancial policy, governing practices, and graduation requirements outlined in Section II and in the School of Dentistry general information in Section III of this CATALOG. Instruments, textbooks, additional materials Instruments, textbooks, and materials required for the study and practice of dentistry are prescribed by the School of Dentistry. The school issues dental instruments each quarter as needed in the program. Unauthorized or incomplete equipment is not acceptable. Advance administrative approval must be obtained for any exception. Employment Because the dental program is very rigorous, rst-year students in dentistry may not accept part-time employment during the rst term. Thereafter, such employment may be accepted by the student only upon receiving written permission from the associate dean for academic affairs. Licensing Eligibility to take examinations given by the state and regional boards of dental examiners is based on essentially the same requirements as are stipulated by the School of Dentistry for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Information about the examinations of the respective states is available at the ofce of the associate dean for academic affairs. Credentials from the National Board of Dental Examiners are accepted in lieu of the written portion of a state examination in most states. Many states require the National Board Dental Examination and provide no alternative. The national board does not include a clinical examination.

U none Unsatisfactory; The U grade is not computed in the G.P .A. The Course must be repeated to count toward a certicate and/or degree. University policy states that \"a student may repeat a course only once, and no more than two courses may be repeated in a student's degree program. \" Academic criteria for academic advancement and program completion Process to remediate a course: 1.A detailed written plan must be developed by the course director/ program director outlining how deciencies will be remediated and reassessed. 2.The plan must be approved by the Ofce of Advanced Dental Education. 3.The postdoctoral student/resident is required to register for Advanced Dental Education Remediation (GRDN 700) with the sub- title of the course that is being remediated. 4.Remediation must be accomplished during the academic quarter immediately following the quarter in which the unsatisfactory grade was received. 5.Successful remediation of a course will not result in a grade change for the course. 6.Failure to successfully remediate a course will result in the need for the postgraduate student/resident to repeat the course while on academic probation.7.The postdoctoral student/resident may exercise the option to retake the course which may result in a grade change for the course. Process to repeat a course: 1.The postdoctoral student/resident will be placed on academic probation. 2.The postdoctoral student/resident must register for the course to be repeated at the earliest opportunity. 3.The postdoctoral student/resident must receive a minimum grade of B- to continue in the advanced dental education program. Academic disciplinary policy for advanced education programs: Academic probation Academic probation for postdoctoral students/residents will be for a minimum of one academic quarter following the quarter in which the unsatisfactory performance was noted. Probationary status will be reviewed on a quarterly basis until successful remediation has been recorded. Such action must be conrmed by memorandum to the student. Under the following conditions, a postdoctoral student/resident will be sent an advisory letter from the Ofce of Advanced Dental Education regarding the potential for placement on academic probation. 1.Term G.P .A. below 3.0 (B) 2.One or more courses with a grade of C+ or lower 3.More than one course with a grade of MS.

Level of Academic Probation: The level of academic probation indicates the seriousness of the cumulative academic deciency. However, depending on the seriousness or nature of the academic deciency, a postdoctoral student/resident may be considered for academic leave of absence or discontinuation at any level of probation. Level I First term on academic probation. Level II Second term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term.Loma Linda University 2020-2021 229 Level III Third term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. If a student/resident is unable to remove academic probationary status within the following term, they will be considered for academic discontinuation. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term. Level IV If a student/resident meets criteria for academic probation for a fourth term, consecutive or nonconsecutive, they will be considered for academic discontinuation. Restrictions for a postdoctoral student/resident on academic probation: A student/resident on academic probation: 1.May not serve as an ofcer for any class, school, or extracurricular organization. 2.May not take elective courses. 3.May not participate in elective off-campus, service learning, or mission activities. 4.Remains on academic probation until all terms of the probation sanctions have been fullled, unless the postdoctoral student/ resident is discontinued. Remedial action (remediation): A postdoctoral student/resident who is not performing up to expectations (academic and professional) may receive the following: 1.Restriction of clinical privileges by the program director. 2.Academic probation (Level I to III) - upon recommendation of the Program Director by the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education. 3.Professional Standards (Behavioral) probation (Level I to III) - (See Professional Standards Review Process in Loma Linda University Student Handbook ). 4.Clinical probation (Level I to III) - upon recommendation of the Program Director by the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education. 5.Discontinuation - upon recommendation of the Program Director to the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education. Discontinuation must be approved by the Dean. Probation: All recommendations to the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education for probation must be supported by well-documented evidence of repeated counseling and other internal measures designed to point out deciencies and take corrective action through a detailed remediation program. A remediation program must be specic in design, implemented, and monitored for any postdoctoral student/resident who is not performing up to a program' s stated standards. It is important to have documentary evidence on record by multiple faculty members with detailed accounts of dates, times, explanations or counseling, discussions, and corrective measures. Written statements from support staff should also be included if they have direct contact or knowledge of a matter involving a postdoctoral student/resident. Postdoctoral students/residents may be placed on academic probation, professional standards (behavioral) probation, and/or clinical probation. Probation begins at Level I and may progress to Level III. Postdoctoral students/residents should be placed on probation for the academic quarter immediately following the quarter in which the unsatisfactory performance was documented. Probationary status will be reviewed on a quarterly basis until successful remediation has been documented. This information will be conveyed to the postdoctoral student/resident verbally and in writing. Continuation: Postdoctoral students/residents who are not progressing as expected may be continued in their year group for as long as necessary before being promoted to the next year or discontinued. To exercise this option, the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education will inform University Records of the decision to continue a postdoctoral student/resident and state the anticipated length of that continuation. Program directors make the determination to recommend continuing or discontinuing a postdoctoral student/resident and when the postdoctoral student/ resident has completed their program. Recommendation for continuation will be submitted to the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education for review and approval. Discontinuation: Postdoctoral students/residents who do not achieve required measurable improvement by the end of the prescribed remediation and counseling periods may be recommended for discontinuation by their Program Director to the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education for review. Recommendation to discontinue a postdoctoral student/resident will be submitted by the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education, in writing, to the Dean for review and action.

They mend the mind, body and spirit of a patient in need. This tenet has been at the core of our mission for more than 100 years, and we strive to educate physicians, researchers, and medical professionals who are committed to whole person care. In addition to our medical school program, we offer a broad spectrum of graduate education opportunities, including combined degree programs, postgraduate residencies and fellowships, and continuing medical education for physicians beyond their formal academic years. Our faculty members have pioneered transplantation, epigenetics, and translational research, among other elds, by bringing together clinicians, researchers and bright young students. Their promise to develop lifelong learners has led our graduates to advance medical care around the world. In the School of Medicine, you will be immersed in the ever-changing eld of medicine and will be entrusted with the gift of improving the lives of others. We welcome your curiosity. Tamara Thomas, M.D. Dean, School of MedicineSchool foundations History In 1909, the School of Medicine opened its doors as the College of Medical Evangelists, and in 1910, Adventist pioneer Ellen G. White declared \"The medical school at Loma Linda is to be of the highest order. \" Thus began an endeavor that has lasted for more than a century: To educate physicians dedicated to Christian service. Between 1913 and the mid-1960s, medical student education was split between the Loma Linda University campus and White Memorial Medical Center in Los Angeles, but in 1967 the Loma Linda University Medical Center opened its doors, making way for consolidation of the four years of medical school in Loma Linda. In 2017, the 11,000th student received her medical degree from the School of Medicine. No other university on the West Coast has graduated more physicians than Loma Linda University, and our graduates have travelled around the world offering care to others and fullling the University's motto \"To make man whole. \" \"So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.\" Luke 9:6 Mission The Loma Linda University School of Medicine is dedicated to continue the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ. Preparing the physician Our purpose is the formation of Christian physicians, who will provide whole person care to individuals, families, and communities. Education We strive to create an environment in which medical students, graduate students, and residents will acquire the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes appropriate to Christian health professionals and scholars. Research Our faculty works to cultivate a supportive atmosphere of inquiry to discover new routes to wholeness through basic and clinical research. Service Patients will have timely access to cost-effective, safe, comprehensive, whole person care without regard for their circumstances or status. Developing the whole person The Christian view of wholeness holds that the needs of patients go beyond the healing of the body, and that the development of students involves more than the training of the mind. We are dedicated to promoting physical, intellectual, social, and spiritual growth in our faculty and our students. We believe in the importance of transforming our daily activities into personal ministries. Reaching the world Students, faculty members, and graduates of Loma Linda University School of Medicine are devoted to providing whole person care wherever the opportunity arises; participating with the global community in the provision of local medical education, providing international physicians and scientists the opportunities for professional interaction and enrichment, and sharing the good news of a loving God as demonstrated by the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.Loma Linda University 2020-2021 247 Doctor of Medicine degree/Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Program requirements The Doctor of Medicine degree/Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Program (M.D./OMS) is designed to provide an opportunity for qualied dentists to obtain the Doctor of Medicine degree in a customized, three-year period.

General information The basic sciences of the School of Medicine offer graduate programs with emphases in anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, and physiology. The Ph.D. degree curriculum is designed to prepare students for careers in independent research and teaching in academic or biotechnology settings. Students may enter any of these ve Ph.D. degree curricula by applying to the Integrated Biomedical Graduate Studies Program. After completing a common rst-year core curriculum, students will select a program and a mentor for the completion of their studies, during which advanced courses and laboratory work allow them to fully develop an area of research interest and expertise. Students usually rotate through up to three research laboratories before selecting a research advisor. The M.S. degree course of study provides education appropriate for technicians involved in biomedical research and for medical technologists seeking career advancement. A pathway to combined M.D./ Ph.D. degrees is also offered. Combined degrees Combined degrees (Ph.D./M.D. and M.S./M.D.) options are also available. The combination of an M.S. degree with a professional degree provides additional content and research experience as a background for postgraduate medical or dental education. The combination of a Ph.D. degree with a professional degree prepares the student for a future in academic medicine or dentistry\u2014combining research, teaching, and clinical practice. The combined degrees are described at the end of Section III in this CATALOG.Loma Linda University 2020-2021 251 Department of Basic Sciences The Department of Basic Sciences in the School of Medicine offers graduate programs leading to M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in three areas through the Integrated Biomedical Graduate Studies Program (IBGS). This program includes a common integrated rst-year core curriculum that explores the biochemical, molecular, cellular, and physiological functions of living systems in a way that emphasizes analytical thinking and problem solving. During this rst year, students also attend seminars and rotate through up to two research laboratories. After completing the rst year of study, students select both a program and a laboratory from which they wish to obtain a degree. Advanced, discipline-specic courses are taken during the second year; and research leading to the publication of peer-reviewed articles and doctoral dissertation defense are carried out between the time a research laboratory is selected and the completion of the degree.

Department of Earth and Biological Sciences Graduate degree programs Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy The Department of Earth and Biological Sciences (EBS) within the School of Medicine at Loma Linda University offers Master of Science degrees in biology, geology, and natural sciences; Doctor of Philosophy degrees in biology and earth science; and Bachelor of Science degrees in geology and environmental sciences. The goal of the department is to provide students with the best possible opportunities for graduate study in these areas; with strong preparation for careers in the application of research in, or teaching of biology, geology, paleontology, or earth systems science. Student life Information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook and the School of Medicine's \"Orange Book\" of Student Guidelines, Policies, and Procedures . Additional information regarding policies specic to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. Financial information Schedule of charges (2020-2021) EBS strives to make it possible for every qualied student to successfully complete his or her degree in a timely manner. For many students, nancial arrangements may be key elements in providing opportunity for timely completion. The department therefore makes available to as many qualied students as possible various forms of nancial aid within the limits of the departmental budget and circumstances. Such nancial aid may take the form of research assistantships (RA) and tuition waivers, or other special awards. It is hoped that these incentives will not only help make a student's graduate career possible, but will also strengthen and expand their opportunities for learning while enrolled in the University. Other nancial aid, such as student loans or other scholarships, are available through the Student Financial Aid ofce in the Student Services building. However, every student is responsible for the enrollment fee each quarter. It is not covered by tuition waivers. If a student is awarded an RA, they will be expected to document at least 30 hours per pay period (two [2] weeks) on departmental and research-related projects. Ph.D. degree students will be expected to document at least 40 hours per pay period on their project in order to continue receiving the RA. Please note that RAs are awarded for a set amount for the year (M.S. degree--$7,500; Ph.D. degree--$17,000). This amount is paid out monthly after the rst full month of work.Tuition $580 Per unit, graduate credit $290 Per unit, undergraduate credit; $3,480 per quarter $350 Per unit, audit, graduate Special charges* $60 Application fee $823 Enrollment fee per quarter $60 Fee for credit by examination $30 Per unit fee to have credit earned by examination appear on transcript *Programs may have additional fees.

Interim program director William K. Hayes The Department of Earth and Biological Sciences offers a program leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in environmental sciences. This program builds upon a strong interdisciplinary breadth in natural, physical, and earth systems sciences to help understand the effect of human activities on environmental sustainability and management. In addition, because understanding the environment has become highly dependent on advanced technology, students will learn to use marketable geospatial applications, such as: geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, computer systems modeling, and global positioning systems. These tools will help students address environmental problems, such as: climate change, biodiversity decline, groundwater and soil contamination, use of natural resources, waste management, sustainable development, and air and noise pollution. Students have a choice of advanced expertise in conservation biology and biodiversity or environmental geology. Lastly, this program will encourage students to develop critical-thinking skills, healthy lifestyles, and service-oriented attitudes that are necessary to develop effective and ethical solutions to environmental problems on a local and global scale. Program learning outcomes By the end of this program, the student should be able to: 1.Integrate each of earth's dynamic and interdependent component systems; 2.Critically evaluate the relation of science and faith within an environmental context; 3.Demonstrate written, technical, oral, and problem-solving skills necessary to collect, analyze, and share environmental data with scientic and public communities; 4.Identify professional and academic opportunities in the environmental science eld; 5.Discuss concurrent environmental science research; 6.Examine human and natural causes of earth's environmental problems; 7.Address environmental problems as an environmental scientist. Employment opportunities Career options in the eld of environmental sciences are diverse and abundant. The Environmental Sciences Program prepares students for entry-level jobs in environmental sciences or GIS elds. Graduates may pursue jobs in the public sector through local, state, and federal agencies such as U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and Department of Fish and Game. In the private sector, graduates may seek jobs in environmental consulting rms, foundations, and organizations. Some examples of career paths that environmental science graduates pursue include environmental engineering, science, and social policy; a wide variety of natural resources management elds, such as soil science, forestry, agriculture, watershed science, range management, wildlife conservation, recreation resources, land management, and ecology; landscape architecture, conservation science, GIS, climatology, diverse health sciences; as well as public policy, law, or planning careers. Environmental scientists may also become involved through employment or volunteering with nonprot organizations such as Adventist Development and Relief Agency International, and help world populationslearn how to use the earth's resources to their advantage in a sustainable manner. Preparation for teaching In addition to the environmental sciences major, a student preparing to teach at the elementary or secondary level will need to complete the requirements for a teaching credential. The student should consult the undergraduate program director for further information. General elective units can be used for education courses. Preparation for advanced programs Because of the strong foundation in the natural and physical sciences acquired in the Environmental Sciences Program, students have the option of applying to a variety of graduate programs; as well as medical, dental, and engineering programs. In most cases, these programs require full-year courses in general biology, general chemistry, general physics, and organic chemistry. One or more courses in calculus may also be required. Students are strongly encouraged to contact the pre-health or graduate program of their choice early in their studies to ensure they meet specic course requirements. Environmental internship The Environmental Sciences Program offers students the opportunity to engage in \"hands-on\" application of fundamentals learned in course work by enrolling in ENVS 487 Internship in Environmental Sciences . With the supervision of a faculty advisor, students will develop an academic component of the internship and will be permitted to earn up to eight units of general elective credit toward the B.S. degree. All internship appointments are subject to Environmental Sciences Program director approval. Undergraduate research Following approval of an academic advisor and research professor, students interested in eld research may gain training and experience in one of the three concentration areas offered by the program. Under the supervision of a research professor, students will develop projects within the context of environmental conservation, health, or sustainability in an effort to nd new solutions to environmental problems. Honors program Students who earn a G.P .A. of 3.0 or above, a sponsoring faculty member, and an approved research proposal may apply to be accepted into the environmental sciences honors program.

Normal time to complete the program Two (2) years based on full-time enrollment; part time permittedLoma Linda University 2020-2021 279 Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy The School of Medicine's Division of Anatomy offers curricula leading to the Master of Science or the Doctor of Philosophy degree. The core curriculum offers a broad biomedical background. Course work provides opportunities for qualied students not only to study all aspects of human morphology from both didactic and investigative points of view, but also to develop a special area of research interest. Study and research on other species and in other biomedical disciplines may be included in the student's curriculum. While working on a signicant research problem, students are introduced to research methods through scientic literature and the laboratory. They acquire experience in scientic communication by participating in seminars, writing critical reviews, and reporting results of research experience either in thesis/ dissertation form or as publishable/published papers. The Doctor of Philosophy degree is designed to prepare the graduate for a career in independent research and teaching in university, clinical, biotechnological, or government environments. In addition to technical skills, doctoral degree students are expected to develop creativity and independence. The Master of Science degree provides content appropriate for persons preparing to teach at the secondary level or in related professional school areas, or for persons intending to pursue careers as research technicians. Program learning outcomes By the end of the anatomy program, the graduate should be able to: 1.Apply the biomedical sciences to the study of human anatomy. 2.Demonstrate mastery of molecular, cellular, and integrative aspects of anatomy. 3.Interpret current literature in anatomy. 4.Make original contributions to biomedical science. 5.Demonstrate scientic and professional ethics. 6.Explain the process of applying for external funding.* * This objective is not applicable to M.S. degree students. First-year curriculum (Ph.D. degree) The rst-year curriculum includes a course sequence taught by an interdisciplinary faculty that integrates all the disciplines of the biomedical basic science areas\u2014moving from molecules through cellular mechanisms to integrated systems. In addition, a supplemental course covers research-related topics such as scientic communication and integrity, information handling and statistics, and successful grant proposal writing. Students learn of new developments in the biomedical sciences through weekly seminars, and gain presentation skills in a weekly student presentation seminar series. During the subsequent years, formal courses continue to broaden and integrate into a meaningful whole an understanding of the clinical consequences of cellular events. Religion requirement Students in the Master of Science (M.S.) degree curriculum are required to complete one, three-unit graduate-level religion course (RELT 617 Seminar in Religion and the Sciences). Students in the Ph.D. degree curriculum are required to complete three graduate-level religion courses of three or more units each.

Duerksen-Hughes Objectives Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the investigative skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursuing careers in academic medicine and medical research may wish to enroll in one of the combined degrees programs. The Medical Scientist Program is designed to develop a student's independence and competence as an investigative scientist and clinician. It provides students with a broad educational base for the practice of medicine and related research. The program is administered by the School of Medicine in cooperation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Program description The Medical Scientist Program at Loma Linda University is designed to attract those students who are energized by engaging in biomedical research and wish to contribute substantially to this enterprise. The expectation is that graduates of this program will pursue careers in academic medicine and medical research. Areas of study for the Ph.D. degree include: anatomy; cancer, developmental, and regenerative biology; infection, immunity, and inflammation; and neuroscience, systems biology, and bioengineering. The program integrates graduate and medical education in a Christian environment and is designed to allow completion of both the PhD and MD degrees. Students typically begin the combined degree program through completing two years of medical school, culminated by successful completion of Step 1 of the USMLE examination. Students will then transition to the PhD part of the curriculum, where they will take and pass required courses, successfully pass written and oral qualifying examinations, and complete and successfully defend doctoral dissertations. Students will then transition back to the MD program, where they will complete the last two years of training, completing all of288 Medicine \u2014 M.D. the standard clinical rotations, and take and pass Step 2 of the USMLE. A student must nish all requirements for the Ph.D. degree before being allowed to register for the last year of medical school. In most cases, the sequence should take approximately eight years to complete. Combined degree students must complete the full curricula for both the MD and the PhD programs, with the exception that during the PhD years, two rather than three, three-unit religion courses are required, which must include RELT 617 Seminar in Religion and the Sciences and either RELE or RELR 500 level or above classes, and during the MD years, to complete 12 units of 700 level religion coursework rather than 14 units, with these 12 units to include RELR 775 Whole Person Care, RELE 704 Medicine and Ethics , and RELE 714 Advanced Medical Ethics . Students are encouraged to inquire about the possibility of waiving specic graduate level classes where equivalent mastery has been demonstrated in the MD curriculum. Students interested in beginning the sequence with Ph.D. training, or who have other special requests, are encouraged to communicate with the program coordinator as some customization may be possible. Admissions Admission into the Medical Scientist Program is competitive and requires evidence that the student is likely to develop into a successful medical scientist. The student must submit separate applications to the School of Medicine for both the M.D. and the Ph.D. degree programs, and meet the stated admissions requirements for each program. The application package for the Ph.D. degree requires scores for the general test of the Graduate Record Examination. Both programs must accept the candidate in order for the candidate's credentials to be evaluated by the MD/PhD committee for acceptance into the Medical Scientist Program (MD/ PhD). Students entering the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program who determine that a research career is inappropriate may elect to complete the M.D. degree program independently. Students entering the Ph.D. degree program who desire a career in academic medicine may choose to apply for admission to the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program at a point after their entry into the Ph.D. degree program; however, the standard medical school application process will be required at that point. Financial assistance Financial assistance to students in the Medical Scientist Program may provide: 1.Cost-of-living stipends during those periods in which students are most directly involved in graduate education. The amount of the stipend is equivalent to that available to Ph.D. degree students in the basic science graduate programs.* 2.Tuition waivers for all graduate program course work. 3.Tuition deferment for the M.D. curriculum, upon completion of a Ph.D. degree. Tuition assistance for the MD portion of the combined degree program is not given to all students who earn both degrees. Assistance for the MD portion will only be given in cases where an applicant has received approval from the School of Medicine MD/PhD Committee prior to beginning the MD coursework. Assistance that is received will be in the form of an institutional loan which will cover MD tuition and fees but will not include living expenses. The School of Medicine makes provision for the loan to be forgiven when a recipient meets the terms described below and in the loan agreement.M.D./Ph.D. degree students are ordinarily expected to complete their Ph.D. degree before beginning the third year of medical school. Students who have not completed the Ph.D. degree may apply for a tuition deferment for their third year of the medical curriculum, and, in unusual cases, for the rst term of their fourth year. Applications for tuition deferment beyond the rst two years must be approved by the student's dissertation committee and signed by the dissertation advisor, the associate dean for basic sciences, and the dean of the School of Medicine. Under no circumstances will a student be granted a tuition deferment until they have nished the requirements for the Ph.D. degree. If a student withdraws from the Ph.D. degree program their tuition deferments will be converted to a loan. Completion of the M.D. degree terminates the student's participation in the Medical Scientist Program and ends the availability of tuition waiver. Any tuition deferments then in force will convert to loan obligations at that time. If a student has received acceptances into both the MD and the PhD programs, but is not accepted into the MSP , they may elect to complete one or both degrees; however, tuition support for the medical program will not be available to these individuals. *Stipends from the School of Medicine will be awarded for the rst two years of the graduate program, provided that the student makes satisfactory academic process and remains in good and regular standing. Stipends covering study beyond the rst two years should ordinarily be obtained from the individual laboratories or departments in which the student conducts research. Medicine \u2014 M.D. Curriculum The curriculum in medicine consists of four academic years. The foundational basic and clinical sciences are integrated throughout medical school, with an emphasis on the basic sciences in the rst half, and the clinical sciences in the second half of the curriculum. Organ system blocks are used to integrate the traditional basic science disciplines and other important topics into a single course covering each system, with six blocks taught sequentially in year one, and four blocks in year two. The educational program makes use of a wide variety of pedagogical methods\u2014including but not limited to traditional and interactive lectures, problem, team and case-based learning, personalized computer-based instruction, quantitative laboratory experiences, patient- care experiences and the use of simulation and standardized patients. Students also begin to develop the skills and professional behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical, and Christian practice of medicine\u2014both now and in the future\u2014through participation in two longitudinal courses, which extend throughout medical school. The Clinical Skills course is designed to sequentially develop skills in patient-care, communication, critical thinking, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism and whole person care. Students will have opportunities to participate in both inpatient and outpatient care experiences throughout each year of medical school, in addition to the use of standardized patients and simulation experiences. The Christian Physician Formation course is taught in LIFE communities, where small groups of students are paired with clinical faculty. This course includes a religion component, which is co-taught by faculty from the School of Religion and clinical faculty, as well as topics including\u2014resilience, professionalism, social determinants of health and lifestyle medicine. Students are provided with a faculty mentor through this course to guide them through their educational journey.Loma Linda University 2020-2021 289 The third year of medical education is organized into two components. The primary care block consists of rotations in internal medicine, pediatrics and family medicine, and includes a continuity clinic experience. Surgery, obstetrics and gynecology and neurology/psychiatry are combined in the second component. During these rotations, students obtain a foundation for patient care in ambulatory and hospital-based settings through a process of self-directed learning, guided supervision and teaching by house staff and faculty members in the clinical setting, along with the use of standardized patients and simulation experiences. Recurring experiences in whole-person care, medical ethics, radiology, lifestyle and preventive medicine, social determinants of health and patient safety are integrated into these core rotations. Students have the opportunity to explore areas of interest during two elective experiences. During advanced integration weeks, third and fourth-year students will have the opportunity to explore multiple topics. Students will attend plenary sessions led by visiting speakers each morning and participate in breakout groups in the afternoons. These sessions include topics on religion/spirituality, social determinants of health, cultural humility, resilience and lifestyle medicine. Themes such as Whole Person Care and God and Human Suffering will bring topics together to integrate learning. During the integration weeks, students will also have access to mentoring regarding career planning, specialty choice, and the residency application process. The fourth year of medical education requires students to integrate the knowledge and skills gained during the rst three years and apply it more autonomously to patient care. Students participate in supervised patient-care experiences in emergency medicine, intensive care medicine, preventive medicine and public health, a selective in either medicine or surgery, and a subintern-level experience in medicine, surgery, family medicine, or pediatrics. Students have ample opportunity to pursue individual interests during four months of elective rotations. To emphasize the importance of science in medical practice, up to a one- month elective must be in the basic science discipline of the student's choosing. Students have adequate flexible time to study for Step II (clinical knowledge and clinical skills) of the USMLE and successfully participate in the residency selection process.

The Admissions Committee seeks individuals who have demonstrated a serious personal commitment to the practice of medicine and have altruistic goals and ideals. The School of Medicine is owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church; therefore, preference for admission is given to members of the Church. However, it is a rm policy of the Admissions Committee to admit applicants from other faiths who have demonstrated a commitment to Christian principles and are best suited to meet the educational goals of the School. No candidate is accepted on the basis of religious afliation alone. The study of medicine To prepare for a career in medicine, applicants should quest for a broad understanding in the major areas of knowledge--the natural sciences, the behavioral sciences, and the humanities--which will assist them in learning throughout their lives. The School of Medicine Admissions Committee selects applicants who are best suited to fulll the mission of the school and to successfully practice medicine. The committee selects applicants who demonstrate the ability to learn independently, to think critically, and to articulate clearly\u2014both orally and in written form\u2014their ideas and opinions. It is important that applicants to the School of Medicine demonstrate excellent interpersonal skills and show evidence of sensitivity to the needs of humanity. The Admissions Committee puts forth considerable effort to ensure that an applicant is qualied for medical school. The applicant's academic record and MCAT scores are reviewed to assess the applicant's ability to handle the academic rigors of the medical curriculum. The committee also looks for prerequisite qualities of character and personality, potential for self-direction, good judgment, and dedication to the ideal of service to humanity.290 Medicine \u2014 M.D. General entrance information On rare occasions, academically exceptional applicants may be considered for admission who have completed 90 semester/135 quarter hours at an accredited institution of higher education in the United States or Canada. Preference is given to college/university graduates. Credit for the following courses is required of all applicants: General biology (excludes microbiology, anatomy and physiology), one year sequence with lab General or inorganic chemistry, one year sequence with lab Organic chemistry, one year sequence with lab General physics, one year sequence with lab Biochemistry, one academic term; lab recommended CLEP , pass/fail performances, and online courses are not acceptable for the science required courses. Additionally, science credits earned in professional schools (e.g., allied health professions, business, dentistry, nursing, or pharmacy) do not fulll requirements for admission to medicine. Advanced Placement (AP) credits for the required science courses generally are not accepted. Recommended Introductory courses in basic statistics, psychology, and sociology Required Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) All applicants must complete the MCAT prior to consideration by the Admissions Committee. The MCAT is based on knowledge gained from required science courses. The exam must be taken no later than September of the year prior to application. MCAT scores older than three years from the date of matriculation are not considered.

Because of this, it is necessary for students to have immunizations against certain infectious diseases. In order to complete registration for the rst academic quarter, students must give evidence in the form of physician records or college health service records that they have met immunization requirements. Students without proper verication will be required to receive immunizations, and the charges will be billed to the students' account. Pre-entrance requirements may be found at Student Health Service. Students are also required to have certain injections and immunizations repeated at various intervals during their enrollment, including an annual skin test for tuberculosis. Medical students are required to have an influenza vaccination on an annual basis in order to meet the requirements of clinical sites where students will be working. These vaccinations will be administered by the Student Health Service at the beginning of each flu season. Incoming students are expected to have routine dental and medical care as well as elective surgery attended to before registering for medical school. All School of Medicine students are provided with health coverage through the University's Department of Risk Management. The Student Health Plan remains in effect for students who are regularly enrolled, provided they register and pay tuition and fees on time each quarter. Student Health Plan benet information may be found at Student Health Service. The plan does not cover optical care and provides only limited dental care. It may be to the student's advantage to maintain a current personal policy. A student who does not have health insurance coverage for their spouse/children may purchase coverage through the University's Department of Risk Management at the time of registration or during specied enrollment periods. Government regulations prohibit the use of student loan funds to provide medical insurance or services for a student's spouse or children. Students who wish to review a copy of the current student health plan or have further questions about the plan should contact Risk Management at (909) 651-4010. Details will be presented during orientation or upon request. Transfer Loma Linda University School of Medicine accepts transfer applications if transfer positions are available. Opportunities for transfer are rare. Transfer applications are not accepted if there are no transfer positions available. If a transfer position should be available, applications are accepted only from students in good standing at LCME-accredited allopathic medical schools in the United States. Acceptance is limited to students who have successfully completed the second year and not yet started the third year, without any breaks. Students must have completed all preclinical coursework and passed USMLE Step 1.

Students are expected to follow the general policies of the University, the school, and specic policies of their degree curriculum. The school reserves the right to update and modify curricula content to keep current with trends in health care. Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree The purpose of the School of Nursing's baccalaureate degree is to prepare competent clinicians who are committed to excellence in practice and to Christian principles. The faculty believes that baccalaureate education in nursing is the basis for professional practice. The curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree is consistent with the faculty's belief that students should be broadly educated. The focus is on the synthesis of nursing knowledge and skills with those from the humanities and sciences. Preparation for practice includes experiences in primary and acute care\u2014with clients from various ages, cultural groups, and socioeconomic strata. Undergraduate curriculum sequence The undergraduate curriculum begins with four quarters of pre-clinical work\u2014which forms the general education and science base for nursing. These quarters may be completed at any regionally accredited college or university. After completion of an additional eight quarters at Loma Linda University, the student is eligible to receive the B.S. degree and is prepared for professional nursing practice at the baccalaureate level. Clinical experience develops student's technical and theoretical capabilities in a progressive manner and within the context of the nursing process. Most baccalaureate nursing major courses are in the upper division, where clinical experience is gained in a broad variety of settings. Integral components of upper division courses are leadership concepts and skills, research, public health, and activities that foster collaboration in planning health care with the family and all members of the health-care team. Learning outcomes for baccalaureate nursing Learning outcomes of the baccalaureate nursing program are designed to prepare competent nursing professionals. By the end of the program, graduates should be able to: 1.Apply the nursing process to individuals, families, groups, communities, and populations across the lifespan from diverse backgrounds in a variety of settings to ensure that it is wholeness- focused, compassionate, age, and culturally appropriate. 2.Collaborate with members of the interprofessional health-care team to manage and coordinate the provision of safe, quality care for individuals, families, and groups. 3.Integrate scientic information and best current evidence with clinical expertise and patient preferences when promoting health and making clinical judgments in the management of patient-centered care. 4.Use quality improvement measures to evaluate the effect of change on the delivery of patient-centered care and patient outcomes. 5.Evaluate effectiveness of strategies used to reduce the risk of harm to individuals, self, and others in health-care, home, and community settings. 6.Use empirical and evidence-based information and patient care technology to communicate relevant patient information, managecare, and mitigate error in the provision of safe, quality, patient- centered care. 7.Model integrity and accountability into practices that uphold established regulatory, legal, and ethical principles while providing standard-based nursing care. 8.Integrate leadership and management theories and principles into practice when managing a caseload of patients and making clinical judgments about their care. 9.Use verbal, nonverbal, and written communication strategies that promote an effective exchange of information; development of therapeutic relationships; and shared decision making with patients, families, groups, communities, and populations from diverse backgrounds. Professional registration Satisfactory completion of the California Board of Registered Nursing-required content prepares the student to sit for the NCLEX- RN examination. All states require that a nurse pass the NCLEX-RN examination for licensure to practice. California application forms and fees are submitted to the California Board of Registered Nursing, P .O. Box 944210, Sacramento, CA 94244-2100; website: <http://www.rn.ca.gov/>. Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree options For all B.S. degree options, students must complete all prerequisite courses prior to starting the nursing program. Occasional exceptions for certain prerequisites can be made. For more specics, consult with the admissions department staff. 1. Standard B.S. degree curriculum Individuals who have been licensed vocational nurses, have held military health-care occupations, and individuals transferring from other nursing programs, may qualify for advanced placement. 2. RN to B.S. curriculum An RN with an associate's degree in nursing or equivalent may complete a baccalaureate degree in four quarters of full-time course work. Part- time study is an option. Courses are designed in the online format. Online activities will include weekly discussions and assignments designed to focus on the working environment of the RN. The returning RN must have completed the majority of the prerequisite courses prior to acceptance into the program and must hold a current RN license. If the student is attending a nursing program that has a concurrent agreement with Loma Linda University, coursework in the RN to B.S. program may begin before completing the A.S. degree and before RN licensure. Nondegree option The 45-quarter unit RN licensure option Licensed LVNs who have been admitted and are currently in our nursing program have the option of requesting the 45-quarter unit option for LVNs. Because the LVN choosing this option does not meet the requirements for a degree as outlined by the school, neither a degree nor a certicate will be issued; nor will a graduation exercise be included. In addition, the student will not be eligible to wear the school pin, cap, or other insignia. An RN license obtained through this option is valid in California and may not be transferable to other states. Prerequisite per BRN High school diploma326 Undergraduate Current LVN license in California (skills will need to be validated) Completion of anatomy, physiology and microbiology with a grade of C or higher G.P .A. of at least 2.0. Academic plan Required courses Basic science prerequisites See above for details 9 Required courses NRSG 217 Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing 6 NRSG 233 Health Assessment 3 NRSG 302 Adult Health Nursing II 8 NRSG 303 Adult Health Nursing III 7 NRSG 315 Child Health Nursing 6 NRSG 419 Capstone Nursing Leadership 6 Total Units 45 NOTE: The student in this 45-unit RN option must maintain a G.P .A. of at least 2.0 and earn a grade of at least a C in each course throughout enrollment at Loma Linda University. A grade below a C will cause the student to be dropped from the LLU School of Nursing. Academic policies and practices Academic residence To qualify for an undergraduate degree from Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 45 units at Loma Linda University; 32 of the units must be upper division courses. At least three clinical nursing courses are required as part of these units. Nursing courses Nursing course grades Most nursing courses in the undergraduate curriculum are divided into approximately equal components of theory and clinical laboratory practice. Grades for nursing courses represent a combination of theory and clinical laboratory grades. In order to pass a nursing course, a student must receive a grade equivalent to a C or above in the theory and must receive either a C or a satisfactory in the clinical laboratory sections of the course. To receive a passing grade in theory, the student must obtain a cumulative score of at least 76 percent on examinations. A grade of C- or below places the student on provisional status and requires that the student repeat the course. The student will be allowed to repeat the course based on space availability in the clinical setting. Enrollment in the School of Nursing will be terminated if a student receives two grades of C- or below in nursing courses. Percentage breakdown for grading The undergraduate division of the School of Nursing uses the following percentages for computing grades: 95-100% A D+63-67% D Below 62% F Clinical experiences Clinical experiences are under the direction of the course coordinator. The student has supervised experience under a clinical instructor in the care of patients. The student must meet LLUSN professional dress standards for clinical assignments and adhere to any additional dress policies of a particular clinical agency or setting. Failure to meet standards will result in being sent home from clinical lab. Unexcused tardiness or absences from class or clinical laboratory is cause for failure. Three times of being tardy to class or laboratory is equal to one absence. Absences in excess of 20 percent of course appointments (class, seminar, or clinical) may be cause for failure. Students must make up for absences from clinical experiences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., personal illness or death in the family). A fee of $200 will be charged for make-up of clinical laboratory during non-clinical time. Nursing students are required to practice in client care settings under the supervision of a registered nurse during assigned clinical laboratory time. Each student will be expected to apply basic theoretical concepts to clinical practice by assessing, planning, and implementing nursing procedures; and evaluating the care of individuals, families, and communities. Students will function within the policies of the clinical agency and demonstrate the professional behavior outlined in the University CATALOG and the University Student Handbook while performing routine nursing care. Students are expected to be knowledgeable about clients and their problems and about the plans for care prior to actually giving care. They must come prepared for the clinical experience and must adequately assess a client. Students are expected to perform skills safely. Students whose performance is deemed unsafe may fail the course or be dropped from the program. Students are responsible for their individual transportation to off-campus clinical sites. Individual transportation does not mean arrangements to car-pool with someone. Off-campus clinical assignments cannot be promised on the basis of the student's transportation convenience. Students may be required to complete a clinical experience on a Sunday or a holiday. Licensure To be eligible to write the NCLEX-RN examination, the student must have completed all required BRN-approved nursing curriculum courses required for licensure and have been awarded a B.S. degree in nursing. Under the laws of California, a candidate for the examination is required to report all misdemeanors, driving citations over $1,000, and felony convictions. If a candidate has a criminal history, the California Board of Registered Nursing will determine the eligibility of that individual to write the licensing examination. Credit by examination Challenge/equivalency examination An undergraduate student may meet academic requirements by passing an examination at least equal in scope and difculty to examinations in the course. Undergraduate students with prior education in nursing or in another health-care profession are eligible to challenge nursing courses required for California state licensure. The applicant's background in health-care theory and clinical experience must be commensurate with the theory and skills required for the course.Loma Linda University 2020-2021 327 Challenge examinations in nursing courses include both a written examination covering theory and an examination of clinical competence. A fee is charged for a challenge examination. See the \"Schedule of Charges\" in this section for fees. Progression to the next level in the program is permissible only after successful completion of the challenge examination at 76%. A grade of S is recorded for challenge credit earned by examination only after the student has successfully completed a minimum of 12 units of credit at this University with a G.P .A. of 2.0 or above. Examination fee will be waived when used to determine initial placement for military persons, licensed vocational nurses, and individuals transferring from other nursing programs who meet requirements for advanced placement in the nursing program. Credit for previous coursework must not exceed program residency requirements. Advanced placement program Credit toward graduation may be accepted by the school for an entering student who has passed one or more Advanced Placement examinations with a score of 3, 4, or 5. Records for AP courses must be sent directly from the College Board to University Records. For specic policy and time limits regarding CLEP examinations, see \"Academic Policies\" in the Section II of the CATALOG. Licensed vocational nurse (LVN) option for advanced placement Licensed vocational nurses may be eligible to apply for advanced placement in the nursing program at Loma Linda University. Substantive experience and/or testing will be considered to determine placement. Interested candidates are advised to discuss advanced placement options with the admissions department prior to applying for the nursing program. Military option for advanced placement Individuals who have held military health-care occupations in the areas including, but not limited to Basic Medical Technician Corpsmen, Army Health Care Specialist, or Air Force Independent Duty Medical Technician may be eligible to apply for advanced placement in the nursing program at Loma Linda University School of Nursing if they are able to provide veriable education and experience. Interested candidates are advised to meet with the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Program at least four weeks prior to application to review eligibility requirements. Academic support In order to promote academic success in the nursing program, if a student earns a grade of \"C\" or \"C+\" and/or a cumulative exam score less than 80% in the following nursing courses: NRSG 224 Nursing Pathophysiology NRSG 231 Foundations of Nursing NRSG 232 Fundamentals of Nursing NRSG 233 Health Assessment NRSG 305 Nursing Pharmacology the student will be required to: Register for NRSG 244 Strategies for Academic Success (1 unit) during the subsequent quarter and each quarter through completion of NRSG 301 Adult Health Nursing I . Follow an individualized plan for continued involvement with the Academic Center for Excellence (ACE) in subsequent quarters. The individualized plan will be developed based on individual needs asdetermined by the ACE faculty mentor, course instructor(s), advisor, and student. Repeating a course A grade of C (2.0) is the minimum passing grade for nursing and required religion courses. Any nursing or religion course taken while a student at Loma Linda University School of Nursing in which the earned grade is C- or lower must be repeated. A nursing or religion course may be repeated only once. When a student repeats a course, both the original and repeat grades are entered into the student's permanent record; but only the repeat grade and credit are computed in the grade point average and included in the total units earned. Probation status Students whose cumulative G.P .A.s at the end of any quarter is less than 2.0, or who have received a C- or below in a nursing course, or who have withdrawn (W) due to failing are placed on academic probation. Students on probation status will be required to take NRSG 244 Strategies for Academic Success the subsequent quarter and each quarter through the completion of NRSG 301 Adult Health Nursing I and to communicate regularly with their academic advisor. Students on probation may take only one clinical nursing course at a time and no more than 12 units. Any exceptions must be pre-approved. When the coursework has been repeated successfully, the student is returned to regular status. Enrollment in the School of Nursing will be terminated if a student receives two grades of C- or below in nursing or required cognates. See Student Handbook for grievance procedure.

While the traditional role for pharmacists is to dispense medications to patients, the practice of pharmacy is extensive and has become a \"hands-on\" practice. In the community setting, pharmacists administer vaccines to patients and also conduct patient assessments of ailments such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and seizures in outpatient disease- based clinics. In the institutional setting, pharmacists work closely with physicians, nurses, and allied professionals to ensure that patients are receiving appropriate doses of medications per protocol. In order to gain these skills, knowledge of pharmacy practice in drug information, pharmaceutical care, clinical therapeutics, and experiential education is vital; along with an understanding of biomedical, pharmaceutical, social, and administrative science. This catalog will introduce you to the courses and services available to help you reach your goals. The aim of our faculty, staff, and administration is to provide an environment that helps you develop into a caring, compassionate, competent, and skillful pharmacist. We are committed to ensuring that all students gain the knowledge and skills needed for the profession, and a dedication of lifelong service to others. While a student at Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy, you will have opportunities toparticipate in community outreach, including programs to underserved patient populations. The University motto, \"To make man whole, \" combined with the mission to continue the teaching and healing ministry to Jesus Christ, is the foundation on which all programs at Loma Linda University are built. It is our desire to prepare all graduates to fulll this mission. Welcome to the school that will help you grow spiritually, mentally, physically, socially, and professionally for a life of service to those in need. Michael D. Hogue, Pharm.D., FAPhA, FNAP Dean, School of Pharmacy School foundations History In 1994, a school of pharmacy was proposed to the Loma Linda University Board of Trustees; and in 1995, the board voted to continue to approve, in principle, the establishment of a school of pharmacy.

The experiential program consists of both introductory (IPPE) and advanced (APPE) pharmacy practice experiences designed to meet the required structured, supervised, professional experience for a Doctor of Pharmacy degree. Students and their supervising preceptors are guided by the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy Experiential Program Manual, which contains guidelines and policies for successful completion of the program. The School of Pharmacy requires participation in introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) each year during PY1 through PY3 to enhance practice skills and prepare students to function as members of a health-care team. Advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) comprise the entire PY4 curriculum and are designed to help students integrate and rene skills learned in the rst three years of pharmacy (didactic and experiential) course work. The purpose of the experiential education program is to apply knowledge from classroom and laboratory courses to patient care (pharmacy practice). The ultimate goal of the experiential program is to produce well-rounded, competent, caring, and responsible pharmacists who can deliver exemplary pharmaceutical care, as well as communicate effectively with diverse patients and other health-care professionals. Experiential education requirements During experiential courses, students are assigned to both hospital- based and community-based pharmacy practice settings under the direct supervision of a School of Pharmacy preceptor. Participation in the IPPE/APPE courses requires a valid California intern pharmacist license issued by the California Board of Pharmacy. Students completing IPPE/APPE experiences at sites outside of California must be licensed in the applicable state. When a student is participating in an IPPE or APPE rotation, Loma Linda University's code of conduct and the guidelines found in the School of Pharmacy Student Policies and Procedures Manual are still in effect throughout the completion of this experience. If experiential site regulations and policies differ from University policies, the site policies supersede. In addition to the above-mentioned guidelines, the following regulations are to be followed by all professional pharmacy students assigned to experiential sites or rotations. Attendance is mandatory. Punctuality is expected, and tardiness will not be tolerated. Students must maintain their University email accounts and check them at least daily to keep apprised of important information or announcements. All experiential educational assignments are made through the Department of Experiential and Continuing Education and are the responsibility of the chair of the Department of Experiential and Continuing Education. Students are not to function as agents or employees of the site. They must identify themselves as pharmacy students from Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. While participating in this graded experience, students shall not, under any circumstances, receive nancial remuneration from the experiential site. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in suspension and removal from the rotation and receipt of a failing grade in the course. The student is responsible for all nancial obligations associated with their pharmacy education. They are also responsible for fullling all siterequirements prior to each rotation within the time frame requested. These responsibilities include transportation, food, lodging, and any other incidental costs related to practice assignments. Concurrent employment during the experiential experience does not exclude or excuse students from any responsibilities associated with course requirements. The student must possess a valid driver's license and is responsible for transportation to and from sites. IPPE rotations can be up to 70 miles from campus. Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy students are required to dress and act professionally at all times. This expectation extends to experiential educational activities where the student is not on the campus but receives instruction and guidance through a School of Pharmacy preceptor. The Department of Experiential and Continuing Education requires all students to adhere to the School of Pharmacy dress code and to wear their Loma Linda University identication cards and short white laboratory coats at all times while at the experiential site. The laboratory coat must be white, clean, and freshly pressed. Students who attend out of dress code will be considered absent by the preceptor and sent home to fulll dress code requirements prior to returning to the practice site. In addition to the general school requirements, other rules may apply for students who are off site. If the experiential site implements special attire or dress code requirements, the more stringent of the dress code requirements prevails, whether that of Loma Linda University or of the off- site institution.

Educational goals Loma Linda University School of Public Health, a Seventh-day Adventist Christian institution, seeks to further the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ \"to make man whole\" by: Educating ethical and procient scholars through instruction, example, and the pursuit of truth. Expanding and providing advanced knowledge through research in various elds related to human health and disease. Providing advanced skills and competencies for professionals who plan to pursue a practice or research career. School foundations History The school's foundation was laid in 1948 with the organization of the School of Tropical and Preventive Medicine, the purpose of which was to provide a base for research and teaching. In 1964, plans were laid for faculty and facilities to meet the requirements of the Committee on Professional Education of the American Public Health Association (APHA). Three years later, the School of Nutrition and Dietetics (established in 1922) and the Division of Public Health andTropical Medicine were accredited by APHA and organized under the name Loma Linda University School of Public Health. This name was changed to School of Health in October 1970 to reflect more clearly the school's emphasis on lifestyle. In response to changing societal perceptions and denitions of \"public health, \" the original name, School of Public Health, was readopted in August 1987. The Center for Health Promotion, the Department of Preventive Medicine, and the Preventive Medicine Group were merged into the School of Public Health in 1990. The expanded resources realized by this merger stimulated further growth and development of the school to provide a dynamic learning and research environment for its students and faculty. The school has maintained continuous accreditation since it was accredited at its inception in 1967 by the American Public Health Association. It is currently accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH): 1010 Wayne Avenue, Suite 220, Silver Spring, MD 20910; and is also a member of the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH). CEPH may be contacted at 202/789-1050. <jconklin@ceph.org> Master's degree programs Master of Public Health (M.P .H.), Master of Health-Care Administration (M.H.A.), and Master of Science (M.S.) degree programs are designed for those with appropriate backgrounds who are seeking to acquire graduate- level competencies in public health, health-care administration, and nutrition.

It is currently accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH): 1010 Wayne Avenue, Suite 220, Silver Spring, MD 20910; and is also a member of the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH). CEPH may be contacted at 202/789-1050. <jconklin@ceph.org> Centers Center for Health Strategy and Innovation Executive Director, Karl J. McCleary Public health has gone through several eras where the focus of attention or paradigm has guided the actions of the eld. At present, the concept of population health has emerged as a broader, more encompassing concept of public health that incorporates a range of factors that interact and affect the health of individuals, communities, and the population as a whole. Unfortunately, these health outcomes frequently reflect inequities across the population. The Center for Health Strategy and Innovation362 School of Public Health seeks to identify and deploy successful strategies\u2014evidence-based interventions, once adopted and implemented in practice and policy, help achieve desired improvements in population health. We accomplish this vital work through scholarship in dissemination and implementation science, which primarily focuses on organizations, communities, and systems. Center for Teaching and Learning Executive Director, Donna Gurule The Center for Teaching and Learning houses the degree programs for the School of Public Health. It has the responsibilities of identifying ways to transform public health education, reporting assessment results for student learning outcomes, engaging and training faculty in pedagogy, course design, and faculty delivery, and providing excellent learning opportunities for our students utilizing technology and innovation. These are accomplished through scholarship in teaching and learning. Center for Nutrition and Healthy Lifestyles Executive Director, Joan Sabat\u00e9 Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancers account for 60% of all deaths worldwide, with an estimated 80% of these deaths occurring in low and middle income countries. These conditions are largely preventable through the adoption of healthy diets, physical activity, and avoidance of smoking. The center focuses on elucidating key dietary and other behavioral factors for the prevention of chronic diseases. Also, the center is compelled to focus effort on effective health education programs to improve diet quality and recover a healthy lifestyle in the US and globally. Researchers at the center are leaders in the study of the health effects of plant foods, and the home of the world-renowned Adventist Health Study, providing the global community with strong evidence for healthy outcomes, and the prevention of chronic diseases when adopting a plant- based diet. Building on the Adventist Health Study's unique 50 plus years of research in lifestyle and plant-based diets, the center pioneers new knowledge and aims to develop innovative, interdisciplinary, translational, and interventional research directed at reducing the risk, morbidity and mortality of unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyle, and tobacco use related chronic diseases in the US and globally.

International students will receive the necessary visa applications and registration clearance after they have submitted their deposits and payment plans. Admissions decisions The Admissions Ofce and program director considers the following qualications in making admission decisions: Personal statement, letters of recommendation, overall G.P .A., GRE examination scores or equivalent, professional potential, and personal interview. Admission decisions are in one of two categories: regular admission or denial of admission. Admissions requirements Specic requirements\u2014which vary from program to program\u2014should be determined based on the student's area of interest. Requirements for admission into degree programs are specied in the next section. Prerequisite courses A grade of B or higher is required for all prerequisite courses. Prerequisites must be completed prior to acceptance. Entrance tests Scores from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or equivalent are required with the application. Application forms for the GRE and information regarding examination times and places are furnished by the Educational Testing Service, GRE-ETS, P .O. Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541-6000, U.S.A.; and at < http://www.ets.org>. Applicants for the M.H.A. degree in health care administration are required to submit scores from the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) or equivalent, such as the GRE. Application for the GMAT are available at < http:// www.mba.com/us (http://www.mba.com/us/)>. General regulations Students are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III of this CATALOG provides the general setting for the programs of each school and outlines subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specic program requirements in the context of general requirements applicable to all programs. University email accounts The University accepts its moral, ethical, and legal responsibility for informing and reminding students of deadlines, regulations, and processes by issuing an email account to every student and communicating with students by email. It is the students' responsibility to read and respond to their email messages from the University. Learning environment Technology facilities Technology-mediated and fully online courses are part of the school's curricula. Students should be prepared to use email, electronic library resources, online survey tools, course management tools, and other Internet communication tools while engaged in the School of Public Health learning environment. Through the online M.P .H., the technology- mediated Dr.P .H. degree programs, and the online post-baccalaureate certicate programs, the School of Public Health demonstrates its commitment to moving forward with a technology-supported and technology-facilitated learning environment.Tutorials are available to assist members of this learning community in using the school's various tools. Campus facilities Facilities for the School of Public Health--ofces, lecture and seminar rooms, teaching and research laboratories, work and storage areas-- are located mainly in and adjacent to Francis Nichol Hall. Additional ofces and research facilities are located in the Parkland Building and the Centennial Complex. Academic policies Students are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily complying with policies and meeting regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Advanced standing Graduate students with previous course work in areas of public health may apply for limited units of advanced standing. If approved by the program director and the assistant dean for admission and records of the school, degree requirements may be reduced. Courses taken during the past ve years are considered in an evaluation of the student's qualication for advanced standing. Competency in courses taken more than ve years previously may be considered if the content has been used professionally on a regular basis. No advanced standing is granted for life experience that is not in conjunction with previous course work. Religion course work requirement Registration and completion of graduate-level religion course work is mandatory for completion of degree requirements. The religion requirement is designed to provide a spiritual dimension to the professional training of public health students, opportunities to further develop their skills in dealing with life's challenges, and for personal spiritual growth. Transfer of course units from other universities and institutions is not allowed; nor is a waiver option available, regardless of educational background. Traditional letter grading is required. Selection of religion courses to fulll requirements for the various degrees should be made in consultation with the advisor, using the course schedule published online at <llu.edu/central/ssweb ( http:// www.llu.edu/central/ssweb/)>. Master's degree students are required to complete a three-unit, 500-level religion course per degree sought; and doctoral students are required to complete three 500-level religion courses in each of the religion content areas: ethical, relational, and theological studies. Only courses with REL_ code prexes may be used to satisfy the religion course requirement. The religion requirement may not be waived by registering for a religion course at a university other than Loma Linda University. Student classication Students enrolled in courses prior to receiving ofcial acceptance into the School of Public Health are classied as \"nondegree\" students by the University. Students may retain this status only by permission of the assistant dean for academic support for a maximum of 12 units of credit before ofcial acceptance into the school. Convocation attendance Attendance at weekly University and quarterly school convocations is required. Unexcused absences are reported to the dean. Persistent failure to attend may jeopardize a student's regular standing.364 School of Public Health Course attendance Only duly registered students may attend classes. Students are expected to attend all required contact elements in a course. Absences in excess of 15 percent may be sufcient cause for a failing or unsatisfactory grade to be recorded. Adding an additional M.P .H. major Students who wish to add another major to their M.P .H. programs must complete a written petition to revise or make a changes in their programs. This request will be reviewed by the relevant departmental committee for approval to add the major. After approval, the student must work with the assigned advisor in the secondary department to determine the course work and other requirements that must be fullled for the additional major. These requirements must be specied on the Degree Compliance Report for the student within one quarter of acceptance into the added major; otherwise the student will be administratively withdrawn from the added major. Because each combination of majors is unique, there is no guaranteed timeline for completion of the requirements for the additional major. Adding another major may also impact nancial aid. Additional majors require a minimum of 18 specied units from the major core course work beyond those required for the primary major, with a grade point average of at least 3.0 for those added units. Coordination of the eld practicum experience between the two majors is also required. All successfully completed majors will be listed on the student's transcript. Time limit The time lapse from rst enrollment in courses applied to a master's degree curriculum to the conferring of the degree may not exceed three years. For a doctoral degree, the maximum time allowed for advancement to candidacy is three years, and ve years for completion of the degree program. Students who show evidence of appropriate academic progress may be granted up to two, one-year extensions for master's and two, one-year extensions for doctoral degrees. They may not exceed the University maximum allowable time for degree completion of ve years for a master's degree and seven years for a doctoral degree. These extensions are not automatic but must be initiated by student request and be approved by the program director and the assistant dean for academic support. Exceeding the time limit requirements may have nancial aid implications. Academic probation Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress, as dened elsewhere in this CATALOG, will be placed on academic probation. Students with two quarters of unsatisfactory performance jeopardize their standing in a degree or certicate program. Residency requirements Residency requirements may be met by a student taking, through the School of Public Health, the minimum number of units specied for the appropriate degree. The minimum didactic unit residency requirement for a single M.P .H. degree is 56 units (including up to nine units of transfer credit) and for a single Dr.P .H. degree is 54 units (plus applied practice experience and integrated learning experience) and for a single Ph.D. degree is 47 units (plus research/dissertation units). Advanced standing can be considered for previous course work relative to these requirements, but does not alter the minimum unit requirements for the degree.Graduation requirements A candidate for a degree shall have met the following conditions: Completed all requirements for admission. Satisfactorily completed all requirements of the curriculum, including specied attendance; number of credit units; specic course and eld instruction; applicable qualifying and comprehensive examinations and culminating activities; and have a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 for graduate students, computed separately for the total degree program and for courses in the major area. Completed a eld practicum or internship (if required by the program). Completed the culminating experience. Completed an online exit survey (at the conclusion of the program). Submitted a graduation petition two-to-four quarters before graduation, as specied by the University. Given evidence of responsiveness to the established aims of the University and of the school.

The candidate who has completed the requirements at the end of the Spring Quarter is encouraged to be present at the conferring of degrees. Students desiring to participate in commencement ceremonies must do so at the spring (June) exercise immediately following completion of their assigned curricula. The University reserves the right to prohibit participation in commencement exercises by a candidate who has not satisfactorily complied with all requirements. Grievance policy Grievances related to sexual harassment, racial harassment, or discrimination against the disabled shall be pursued in accordance with University policies specically relating to these items. Grievances related to academic matters or other issues covered by specic school policies shall be made pursuant to the policies of the school in which the student is enrolled. A student who questions whether the process provided by the school has followed its policy in regard to their grievance may request the Ofce of the Provost to conduct a review of the process used by the school in responding to their academic grievance. For more detailed information, please see the University Student Handbook for School of Public Health grievance policy and procedures. Academic advisement It is the responsibility of students to know and fulll all academic and graduation requirements and to make every reasonable effort to obtain adequate academic advisement. Frequent advisor contact helps to ensure that students have current academic information and are making adequate progress toward educational goals. Continuing education The school offers non-degree short courses and workshops at various locations in the United States and overseas to meet the continuing education needs of School of Public Health alumni, other health professionals, and lay persons in the church and community. In addition, most degree courses are approved for continuing education credit. Financial information The Ofce of the Dean is the nal authority in all nancial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all nancial policies. Any exceptions toLoma Linda University 2020-2021 365 published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or center directors in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. The student is expected to arrange for nancial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Previous accounts with other schools or with this University must be settled prior to registration. Traineeships United States Public Health Service traineeships provide grant money in support of public health training to citizens of the United States or to persons having in their possession a visa granting permanent residence in the United States. Allocation is made by the school to those who demonstrate nancial need and who undertake specied programs of study. Further availability is contingent upon congressional funding. Applications are available from the School of Public Health Ofce of Financial Administration. Assistantships A limited number of teaching and research assistantships are available through the academic programs and individual researchers. It is understood that the student will perform such duties as may be required by the one to whom the student is responsible, but such duties are not to exceed the equivalent of half-time employment. Students will be considered after they demonstrate knowledge and prociency in the area in which they would work. Application for nancial aid Before a fellowship, traineeship, or assistantship is awarded, the student must have secured regular admission to the school. The student's academic record, nancial need, and potential productivity are among the factors considered in the awarding of nancial aid. Preference is given to complete applications received by March 2. Early application is advised. Loans Loan funds may be available to School of Public Health students who show need as determined by a federal formula. Loans are restricted to citizens of the United States and eligible noncitizens. Certain funds are interest free while a student is enrolled at least half time. Inquiries about loans should be made to the Ofce of Financial Aid. Schedule of charges Effective Summer Quarter 2019 (subject to change by trustee action): Tuition $895 Master's students per unit: credit (on campus and online) $448 Master's students per unit: audit (on campus and online) $975 Doctoral students per unit: credit (on campus or online) Special tuition charges $895 Field practicum and internship (100 hours/2units)Enrollment fee $910 Enrollment fee Special charges $50 Application (nonrefundable) $100 Acceptance deposit for master's degree students (nonrefundable) $250 Acceptance deposit for doctoral degree students (nonrefundable) $100 Late payment fee $25 Returned check fee $200 Late registration fee $50 Examination, other than regularly scheduled $50 Equivalency examination Miscellaneous expenses cost Health-care items not covered by insurance cost Breakage, damage, loss of University equipment International student deposit $8,000 Master's student $8,000 Doctoral student Refund policy Tuition refunds are calculated on a prorated basis for up to 60 percent of the quarter, with no refund after that point. This calculation is based on the day a withdrawal from a course or program is processed by University Records. Students who drop a course from a block program of courses receive no refund. If a student drops a course after completing 10 percent of a course, the student will receive a 90 percent refund. Because refunds are based on a percentage of the course completed, the days on which these percentage refunds will change are determined by the length of the term in which the course is scheduled.

The school's mission, as part of Loma Linda University, is particularly focused on the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ and the role it plays in equipping health-care practitioners to integrate Christian faith, health, and science. The school contributes to the University's mission, vision and values by giving priority to the sacred task of serving students in its eight schools. Its use of mission-focused learning, through scholarship that expands knowledge and addresses the challenges health-care professionals face in today's complex world, and provides a critical service to the university and world-wide Seventh-day Adventist church. The school offers three master's degrees: M.A. degree in bioethics, M.S.Chap. degree in chaplaincy, and M.A. degree in religion and society. These programs prepare graduates with theological educations and skills in bioethics and chaplaincy, and emphasizes religion's relationship to culture and society. Within the framework of our academic programs, we offer a unique opportunity for students in other University programs to apply for dual enrollment in bioethics, and religion and society. Students enrolled in medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy are eligible to apply for admission to the bioethics and religion and society programs. Pleaserefer to The Combined Degrees Programs of the University (p. 401) section to learn more about our dual enrollment degree programs. We believe our academically rigorous programs and mission-focused courses cultivate a vibrant Christian community at LLU and help to prepare health care practitioners to go forth and \"make man whole\" as they embody the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ. Welcome to Loma Linda University School of Religion. Leo Ranzolin, Th.D. Interim Dean, School of Religion 390 School of Religion School foundations History In the conguration of Loma Linda University as a health sciences university, the role of religion as integrative in each of the programs of the University is mandated and continuously afrmed by the University administration and the Board of Trustees. In July of 1990, the Faculty of Religion (now the School of Religion) was established to assist in this integration. Philosophy As implied by its motto, \"To make man whole, \" the University afrms these tenets as central to its view of education: God is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Humanity's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious values, benets the individual and society and advances the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Mission statement The School of Religion is committed to continue the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ by integrating Adventist faith with the world's changing need.

Program director Angela Li The Master of Science in Chaplaincy (M.S.Chap.) program is theological and clinical based chaplaincy education at Loma Linda University. It has been developed using guidelines established by the Association of Professional Chaplains (APC), which oversees and rigorously maintains \"best practice\" standards for the chaplaincy profession. It is designed to meet a variety of students' needs, namely: It meets the APC full board certication academic requirement. It is a professional degree that blends theological study with clinical experience. It provides specialty training in spiritual care and/or chaplaincy. It prepares students for employment as professional chaplains. Graduates of the program will receive excellent academic training enhanced by professional, clinical, and ministerial experience. TheLoma Linda University 2020-2021 393 program's goal is to prepare chaplains who can model the \"teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ\"; and who are trained at the highest level of Christian professionalism, in preparation for full board certication by the APC. Students are required to complete four (4) units of clinical professional education (CPE) credits prior to graduation. As a premier teaching and research medical complex, Loma Linda University Health (LLUH) is an excellent setting to experience clinical aspects of this program and is an accredited Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) Center. (Students are not required to complete their clinical internships at LLU but are able to complete this requirement at any ACPE-approved site in North America. Visit the ACPE-approved centers web page here (https:// www.acpe.edu/ACPE/Directory/Accredited_Centers.aspx) to view a list of available sites. Separate application, fees, and acceptance procedures are required for this component of the program.) To increase diverse learning experiences, students are requested to complete a maximum of two (2) CPE units at Loma Linda University Medical Center. The professors represent areas of expertise, such as biblical studies, theology, practical theology, marriage and family therapy, cultural psychology, American church history, health education, nursing, spiritual care, and ethics. In addition, clinical faculty members from across many health-care professions are involved in the program. This diversity of specialists provides students a rich and balanced program of study. All courses are taught from the Christian perspective. Students from more than sixty-ve religions and eighty countries study here. A mutual and shared respect for various cultures and beliefs is emphasized on campus and in the classroom. Small class sizes allow for specied instruction and personal growth. The program draws upon resources from across the entire Loma Linda University campus. These include the Chaplain Services of LLUH and the Center for Spiritual Life and Wholeness, both of which provide a rich context in which to study chaplaincy. The Center for Spiritual Life and Wholeness is dedicated to promoting and supporting wholeness in individuals, as well as providing tools for health-care professionals across various disciplines to use in providing whole person care to their patients.

Project When students have completed the majority of their course work and at least some clinical work, they must also be able to articulate, in written form, all chaplaincy competencies, as dened by the Association of Professional Chaplains (APC). This will be based on their theoretical understanding, reflection, and personal experiences.Noncourse requirements Annual Evaluation Students will be evaluated on their academic and clinical competencies at the end of Spring quarters of their rst and second years. Dean's Exit Interview Graduate candidates are required to attend exit interviews with the Dean of the School of Religion during the Spring quarter of their graduation year. Normal time to complete the program Three (3) years (11 consecutive academic quarters)\u2014based on full-time enrollment; part time enrollment is permitted. Denominational Studies for Chaplains \u2014 Certicate Program director Jon Paulien Students are encouraged to inquire regarding admissions. The fully online Denominational Studies for Chaplains Program is designed for practicing chaplains who lack academic course work in Adventist doctrine and who desire endorsement from the Adventist Chaplaincy Ministries (ACM) department of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. This certicate will satisfy the denominational studies requirement. The development of this certicate has been a collaborative effort between Loma Linda University and Loma Linda University Medical Center Chaplains Department, in consultation with ACM. This certicate is a response to the stated need of ACM for denominational education that includes the following four areas: 1.Seventh-day Adventist history and heritage; 2.Seventh-day Adventist doctrines, beliefs, and practices; 3.Seventh-day Adventist perspectives on Daniel and Revelation and how they inform the issues of suffering and pain; and 4.Seventh-day Adventist health, wellness, and lifestyle issues. Teaching methodology The education model designed for this academic certicate will be through distance learning online modalities that use Canvas as its learning management system (LMS). This certicate is a two-year program in which all courses and learning occur via the LMS. The learning activities for each course facilitate opportunities for personal growth via the online, class-driven learning activities. Students can begin the program in any given quarter and are expected to follow the course requirements as they are offered, one per quarter in a continual sequence. The program includes an individual report, preparation and presentation of a portfolio, and an exit interview\u2014all conducted via the LMS and facilitated via video conference communication technology. Program learning outcomes and performance By the end of this program, the graduate should be able to:Loma Linda University 2020-2021 395 1.Explain Adventist theological uniqueness and the biblical foundations of its doctrines; 2.Demonstrate competent use of Scriptures; 3.Explain Christian theology and history, with specic attention to Seventh-day Adventist life and thought; 4.Integrate Adventist doctrines into their ministry and as a representative of the Seventh-day Adventist Church; 5.Synthesize individual Adventist versions philosophies of ministry within the health-care setting.

The program is ideal for individuals seeking deeper biblical, theological, and philosophical insight, spiritual growth, practical competency, and cultural literacy in the context of a range of vocational settings\u2014health care, the local church (non-ordained ministry), non-prot organizations, secondary education (teaching certications must be obtained independently), and further graduate study. Students may complete this program prior to beginning professional or graduate school. Students enrolled or enrolling in other LLU programs may be interested in pursuing it as a dual-degree option. Others may seek to complement already completed courses of study. The curriculum covers the basic areas of theology, biblical studies, and Christian spirituality, and can also be customized around a particular area of interest. Using the resources of the School of Religion and the entire university, each student and their mentor will formulate and acquire faculty approval for a personalized area of emphasis that matches his or her interests and qualications. Possible areas of emphases include: Biblical studies Christian theology Science and religion Health care Wholeness/whole person care Spirituality Social ethics Bioethics Students may progress through the program at their own pace (up to ve years maximum). All students must have a demonstrated prociency with technology and have access to personal computers and the Internet. Professors in the program represent areas of expertise such as biblical studies, theology, philosophy, world religions, practical theology, marriage and family therapy, cultural psychology, American church history, health education, nursing, spiritual care, and ethics. This diversity of specialists provides students with a rich and balanced program of study. A mutual and shared respect for various cultures and beliefs is emphasized on the campus and in the classroom. Small class sizes allow for personalized instruction and engaged participation. The program draws upon resources from across the Loma Linda University campus. These include the Center for Spiritual Life and Wholeness, the Center for Christian Bioethics, and the Center for Understanding World Religions that offer multiple programs, conferences, and lecture series intended for student enrichment. Mentors As soon as possible, but before the student has completed half of the program, the program's administrative committee will link the student to a mentor who will provide support and guidance. Until then, the program director will mentor the student.396 Religion and Society \u2014 M.A. Program learning outcomes By the end of this program, the graduate should be able to: 1.Responsibly interpret the Bible in an increasingly scientic, globalized, and pluralistic society; a.analyze major themes of Old Testament theology. b.analyze major themes of New Testament theology. c.apply basic principles of exegesis and hermeneutics to the Bible. 2.Assess Christian reflection and praxis as it engages with culture(s); a.identify core tenants of classical, Christian theology from a Seventh-day Adventist perspective. b.evaluate models of the relationship between church and culture. c.analyze one instance of cultural/theological contextualization and preservation. 3.Demonstrate a broad, basic knowledge of the eld of ethics; a.compare major schools of normative ethics\u2014deontological, consequentialist, and virtue. b.articulate ethical emphases in Christian Scripture. c.address a contemporary ethical issue utilizing Christian Scripture. 4.Demonstrate growth in spiritual maturity. a.develop a personal theology of wholeness. b.engage in practices that help attune one's self to the spiritual meaning of everyday activities. c.recognize a commitment to community involvement and service as a crucial component of wholeness. Periodic review In addition, each student's achievements will be assessed every 12 units to determine the advisability of their continuing in the program. Prerequisite There are no prerequisites for this program, however, those who enter having taken few or no courses in religion must structure their programs considering the requirements. The opposite will be true for those who enter the program after having extensively studied religion but not the other subject(s) they desire to explore. Core courses Four of this program's 12 courses are required: RELT 501, 502, 503; and RELG 696. The religion science cluster\u2014 RELT 501 Religion and Society , RELT 502 Religion and Society, and RELT 515 Faith and Flourishing \u2014 which may be taken in any sequence, provides intensive introductions to the eld. One course is offered each quarter during the academic school year, and a course may be offered also in the summer. The fourth required course is the nal project ( RELG 696 Project ). These four, four- unit courses, totaling 16 units, constitute one-third of the program. The remaining eight courses, totaling 32 units and two-thirds of the program, are selected by the student and approved by the administrative committee. Transfer credits Students are permitted to transfer up to eight units of approved graduate- level courses from other accredited institutions into the Religion and Society Program.Admissions In addition to Loma Linda University (p. 23) and School of Religion (p. 390) admissions requirements, the applicants to the M.A. in Religion and Society Program are expected to present/complete: A bachelors degree from an accredited institution. An undergraduate degree in religion is not required. An overall undergraduate Grade Point Average (G.P .A.) of at least 3.25. Acceptable scores in an approved standardized test such as the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) or Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). An essay (1,000 words) that species why the applicant is interested in this program, relevant background experiences, and how the program ts into personal and professional plans. A writing sample (usually drawn from previous academic work) emailed directly to religion@llu.edu. An interview. Three letters of recommendation from previous teachers or mentors. In addition to these considerations, acceptance into this program depends upon whether, at the time the student wishes to study, the School of Religion's resources and their interests and goals overlap enough to make it a mutually benecial experience. Provisional Admission A student who is promising, even though they do not meet one or more of the admission requirements, may be given provisional acceptance for up to 12 units of study after which the administrative committee will determine whether or not they will be permitted to continue. Program requirements In order to receive the Master of Arts in Religion and Society, the student will complete a minimum of 48 units of course work as herein specied, with an overall grade point average of B+ or better, and no core course lower than a B.

Feel free to contact us by email at <graduatestudies@llu.edu >. Ronald Carter, Ph.D. Provost and Interim Director, Faculty of Graduate Studies Loma Linda University 2020-2021 399 Foundations of graduate study Recognizing the need to provide advanced education, the College of Medical Evangelists (CME) organized its School of Graduate Studies in 1954. The new school conferred a Ph.D. degree in 1958, the rst Ph.D. to be awarded by a Seventh-day Adventist institution of higher education. In 1961 when CME became Loma Linda University, the university assumed oversight of the graduate education conducted by La Sierra College in Riverside, California. By 1963, the School of Graduate Studies had been renamed the Graduate School, with a home in a new building, named Frederick Griggs Hall in honor of a former department chair. The two campuses comprising Loma Linda University\u2014La Sierra and Loma Linda\u2014separated in 1990. In 2005, the Graduate School was restructured as the FGS. Since then, FGS has continued to provide oversight of graduate programs, supported by other schools of the university to promote and encourage independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, contribution to scholarly communication, and intellectual achievement in the service of humankind. Philosophy In the FGS of Loma Linda University, the essential concern of both faculty and students is the quest for meaning. Because this quest is served by knowledge, graduate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of their elds of study. They also participate with faculty in the process by which knowledge is augmented. Objectives The FGS attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1.Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly careers in the sciences and the health professions. 2.Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication. 3.Relating intellectual achievement to the service of humankind. General regulations Students of the university are responsible for informing themselves regarding policies and regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation, and for satisfactorily meeting those requirements. Section III provides the general setting for school programs. Subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs are also outlined. It is important to review specic program requirements in the context of general requirements applicable to all programs (Section II). Application and admissions Program admissions committees of the university intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualied for the proposed curriculum and is capable of proting from the educational experience offered by the university. The admissions committees of the schools accomplish this through examination of evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and signicant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired.Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate record with a grade point average of B (3.0) or better in the overall program and in the major eld. Some students with an overall grade point average between 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades during the junior and senior years are superior or other evidence of capability is available. International applicants are not eligible for provisional admission. From master's to Ph.D. degree Bypassing master's degree A graduate student at the university may proceed rst to a master's degree program. If at the time of application the student wishes to qualify for the Doctor of Philosophy degree program, this intention should be declared, even if the rst objective is to earn a master's degree. If, after admission to the master's degree program, a student wishes to go on to the doctoral degree program, an application form should be submitted, along with letters of reference, to respective school(s) deans. If an award of the master's degree is sought, the student will be expected to complete that degree before embarking on doctoral activity for credit. A student who bypasses the master's degree may be permitted, on the recommendation of the guidance committee and with the consent of the dean, to transfer courses and research that have been completed in the appropriate eld, and that are equivalent in quality and scope, to their doctoral program. Financial information The student is expected to arrange for nancial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Previous accounts with other schools or this university must have been settled. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid. Students should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant.

The combined degrees programs provide opportunities for especially well-qualied (G.P .A. of 3.5 or higher) and motivated students to pursue professional and graduate education; and to prepare for careers in clinical specialization, teaching, or investigation of problems of health and disease in humans. For admission to a combined degrees program, each student must have a baccalaureate degree and must already be admitted to the schools offering their chosen combined degrees program. Students may be required to interrupt their professional study for two or more years (as needed) for courses and research for the graduate degrees sought. The student's concurrent status is regarded as continuous until the program is completed or until discontinuance is recommended. The usual degree requirements apply. Interested and qualied students may choose from the formally combined degrees programs identied below or from informal concurrent programs. Students wanting to pursue informal concurrent degree programs must be granted permission by the director of the primary program in order to proceed with their requests. Formal requests are required to adhere to the policy on concurrent graduate degree programs. Final permission for an informal concurrent degree program must be obtained from the appointed subcommittee of the provost. If a student chooses to withdraw from one program at any time, he or she must meet all requirements for the remaining degree. A student who decides to return to the second program after having completed the rst program, must reapply, be admitted, and fulll all requirements for the second degree. Programs For convenience in locating a combined degrees program, some programs are listed twice\u2014the second time with the program names reversed\u2014e.g., Criminal Justice with Social Work and Social Work with Criminal Justice. Combined degrees programs that must be entered in a specied order are listed only once. For example, a master's degree student in bioethics cannot choose to add pharmacy (Pharm.D.), but a pharmacy student can choose to add the M.A. degree in bioethics. Such programs list the primary degree program rst.

The program This program combines study for the M.A. degree in bioethics (offered by the School of Religion) with either the Psy.D. or Ph.D. degree inLoma Linda University 2020-2021 403 psychology (offered by the Department of Psychology of the School of Behavioral Health). The purpose of the combined degrees program is to facilitate more efcient completion of graduate programs in ethics and psychology for the student interested in both areas. Students who complete the program should be prepared to make signicant interdisciplinary contributions to the elds of psychology and ethics. To enter this combined degrees program, students must gain acceptances into both the M.A. degree in ethics curriculum and to a doctoral degree in psychology. Admission information is available at the School of Behavioral Health. Course requirements Students in this combined degrees program will complete requirements with greater efciency by taking a number of courses that fulll requirements for both degrees. Approval for selective courses should be sought from both program advisors. M.A. curriculum A total of 48 quarter units is required for the M.A. degree.

Admissions Students are selected through a competitive process led by the School of Dentistry in conjunction with the School of Dentistry's Bioethics Program. Selection is based upon the recommendation of the School of Dentistry's academic dean and dean of students and standard admission criteria for the M.A. degree in bioethics. DAT scores are accepted in lieu of the GRE. The program The combined degrees Bioethics with Dentistry Program is designed to t the schedule of D.D.S. degree students. Ethics in dentistry is well- established at Loma Linda University. Loma Linda University's School of Dentistry is one of a select few dental schools in the nation known for expertise in ethical issues. An M.A. degree in bioethics taken as a stand-alone degree requires 48 units. However, the M.A./D.D.S. combined degrees reduce the total units required by 12 units in the following manner: 1.The eight units earned from the following four, two-unit courses in the dental curriculum can be counted for credit toward the M.A. degree in bioethics: a) RELR 717 Diversity and the Christian Health Professional , b) DNES 794 Public Health Dentistry , c) RELR Christian Dentist in Community , and d) DNES 851 The Dentist and the Law . In order for these eight units to be counted toward the M.A. degree, the student must submit a supplemental eight-page paper that integrates the content of these four courses and relates the content to bioethics.These four courses have sufciently similar content to bioethics that they warrant being applied to both the D.D.S. and the M.A. degree in bioethics, once the supplemental paper is approved. 2.Four units come from the deletion of RELE 734 Christian Ethics for Dentists from the combined degrees student's curriculum because its content is substantively duplicated in the Bioethics Program; and the deletion of a two-unit religion selective from the dental curriculum, which will now be taken in the bioethics selectives. M.A. degree requirements The following courses from the D.D.S. curriculum will be counted double for the M.A. degree in bioethics once the supplemental papers, noted above, are approved.

Admissions Students are selected through a competitive process led by the School of Medicine in conjunction with the Bioethics Program. Selection is basedupon the standard admission criteria for the M.A. degree in bioethics minus the GRE because the MCAT includes a critical-thinking component. The program An M.A. degree in bioethics taken as a stand-alone degree requires 48 units in bioethics courses. However, the M.A./M.D. combined degrees student is able to reduce the total units required by sharing 18 units between the two programs in the following manner. 1.12 units from three courses in the medical curriculum count as credit toward the M.A. degree in bioethics: a) MDCJ 538 Medical , and c) PRVM 517 Lifestyle and Preventive Medicine. Acceptance of these courses for M.A. degree credit requires an integrative, supplemental eight-page paper that relates the courses' content to bioethics. The rationale: These three courses in medicine have sufciently relevant content to bioethics that they academically warrant being applied to the M.A. degree in bioethics requirements. 2.4 units come from three School of Religion courses: a) RELE 704 Medicine and Ethics , b) RELE 714 Advanced Medical Ethics , and c) the deletion of one RELT course from the medical student's combined degrees curriculum because its content is substantively duplicated in the Bioethics Program. (Students are informed of the combined degrees option at the beginning of their freshman year and are encouraged not to take RELE 704 Medicine and Ethics during Autumn Quarter if they are contemplating the combined degrees program. The School of Medicine's determination about student acceptability for the combined degrees program can be made immediately after Autumn Quarter grades are posted.)

Hogue Faculty The faculty of the M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees program is primarily drawn from Loma Linda University's School of Pharmacy and School of Religion.Admissions Students are selected through a competitive process led by the School of Pharmacy in conjunction with the Bioethics Program. The School of Pharmacy academic dean recommends students, triggering a streamlined admissions process of the M.A. degree in bioethics. HSRT scores are accepted in lieu of the GRE for pharmacy students. The program The M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees program is designed to t the schedule of Pharm.D. students. Loma Linda University has been a leader in bioethics education for health-care professionals for nearly half a century. The School of Pharmacy places a high premium on moral values and is a pioneer as one of the very few pharmacy schools in the nation to offer a Pharm.D./M.A. combined degrees program. An M.A. degree in bioethics taken as a stand-alone degree requires 48 units in bioethics courses. However, the M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees allows students to double count 25 units of the required 48 units as follows: 1.Eight (8) units come from three courses in the pharmacy curriculum that are counted for M.A. degree in bioethics credit: a) RXSA 555 Epidemiology and Public Health, b) 547 Pharmacy Law , and c) RXSA 751 Social-Behavioral Aspects of Pharmacy Practice . Acceptance of these courses for M.A. degree credit requires an integrative, supplemental eight-page paper that relates the courses' content to bioethics. 2.Eight (8) units come from the substitution of three School of Religion courses in the Pharm.D. curriculum with courses in the Bioethics Program because content is duplicated. 3.Nine (9) units of additional credit come from three electives in bioethics taken by Pharm.D. students.

Program director, Bioethics Whitny Braun Program director, Social Welfare and Social Research, Department of Social Work and Social Ecology Larry Ortiz Faculty The faculty for the combined degrees\u2014Bioethics with Social Welfare and Social Research Program is drawn from the School of Religion and from the Department of Social Work and Social Ecology in the School of Behavioral Health. Purpose of the program The purpose of the M.A./Ph.D. combined degrees\u2014Bioethics with Social Welfare and Social Research Program is to facilitate an integrated and more efcient completion of two graduate degrees for students with strong interests in both bioethics and social policy. Students who complete this combined degrees program will be prepared to makesignicant interdisciplinary contributions to the eld of social policy and ethics. Individuals working in the area of social policy must be able to undertake and publish research on social problems. This requires the ability to apply ethical theory to real-world policy scenarios. Graduates will be able to provide leadership to the social policy arena by conducting interdisciplinary research on various issues and agendas that have signicant moral implications. Admissions To enter the proposed program, students must gain separate acceptance to both graduate programs. The Social Policy and Social Research Program director recommends students. This recommendation triggers a streamlined admissions process for the M.A. degree in bioethics. Course work requirements If an M.A. degree in bioethics is taken as a stand-alone degree, the requirement is 48 units. However, the M.A./Ph.D. combined degrees student is able to double count 13 of the needed 48 units. Specic courses are identied by footnote 1. To the extent possible, research projects in both programs focus on the interface of ethics and social policy.

Program directors Kimberly Freeman Loma Linda University's motto, \"To make man whole, \" provides a powerful context in integrated practice. Both social work and criminal justice\u2014 within a behavioral health framework\u2014emphasize recovery, healing, and restoration. A multidisciplinary approach considers the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being of victims, offenders, and communities; and provides a deeper understanding of crime and the struggle of the modern criminal justice system in a behavioral health context. The combined degrees program offers a unique opportunity for individuals interested in working in settings such as mental health court, detention centers, forensic inpatient programs, and forensic outpatient behavioral health systems. Mission The mission, program goals, and objective build on elements from the M.S.W and M.S. in criminal justice degrees. Please refer to each of these programs for this content. General overview The combined M.S.W./M.S. in criminal justice program is a seven- quarter, full-time curriculum that begins with the social work core course work required for all students. Course work during the rst year of study includes the generalist practice curriculum, which is grounded in the liberal arts and the person-in-environment framework. Within this framework, students learn to promote social well-being and build on the strength and resiliency of all human beings through a range of prevention and intervention practice methods when working with diverse individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. During their second year, students complete a clinical practice specialization along with specialized courses and practicum in forensic behavioral health. Students choosing this area will focus on the needs of individuals in the criminal or juvenile justice systems who experience severe mental illness and who may also present with co-occurring substance use. Students will gain knowledge and skills in treatment programming. In addition, students will be prepared to assess and provide expert testimony regarding continued institutionalization versus readiness for community treatment. Students gain knowledge and skills in treatment programming within a forensic mental health framework. This context prepares students to assess and provide expert testimony regarding continued institutionalization versus readiness for outpatient psychosocial rehabilitation, including the development and implementation of recovery and resiliency informed treatment plans. An integrated practicum and seminar class in criminal justice typically begins in the Summer Quarter of the second year.
