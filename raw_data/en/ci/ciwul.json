Herbal Medicine for the Soul An Herbal Certification Program & A Home for Your Personal Healing What's possible... \"In under a month of working together, I was already in significantly less pain and not having to rely on pharmaceutical pain meds to get me through the day.\" - Christina Haskin This is Your Invitation to Heal Are you experiencing physical chronic pain, childhood trauma, or PTSD? Do feelings of shame and resentment haunt you and prevent you from experiencing the freedom to love and live out your life's goals? There is a natural and holistic path to healing those traumas - and you can start today. If you are ready to begin the healing process, I have an incredible experience for you. Physical ailments and disease are directly connected to unresolved emotional traumas in the body. These traumas also affect our moods, our confidence levels, and our self-esteem provoking feelings of mental instability and inadequacy. My program will help you eliminate your physical and mental pain and unchain you from the trauma you have been carrying around in your spirit. From Pain to Purpose Let's start this journey of healing -- from illness to wellness, from broken to whole life. I will be with you every step of the way. In six months, you can reclaim your entire life using the following process: - Breakthrough Discoveries: The CALYPSO Healing Method, is a proven process helping you become hyper-aware of how to change the mental patterns and triggers that are the root cause of all pain. Pain is experienced from the inside out. It happens first in the emotions, then, if not resolved, manifests in the physical. You learn to release what happened to you in the past, so that you can break the cycles of pain for good. - Healing Plant Medicine: We will teach you how to make and take the medicinal herbs to address your physical and mental pain. This process includes providing you with 55+ materia medica (comprehensive medicinal plant profiles) and guiding you through the Six Pillars of Plant-to-Person Matchmaking, so that you choose the right herbal medicines that will be compatible with you, thus actually work to restore your body to its natural state of well-being and balance. - Your Astrological Chart: Using Medical Astrology, I teach you how to interpret the energy of the planets and your natal chart, to see how the planets affect your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. With this invaluable insight, you're able to identify where your personality requires spiritual growth, prevent future illness (or at least lessen its severity), and see your constitutional health weaknesses that doctors can't diagnose. This uniquely designed and personalized program is life-changing, and you will see and feel results throughout the process: - By Week Four: You'll experience immediate relief in your mental stability. - By Month Four: You'll feel a reduction in your physical symptoms. - By Month Six: Your mind, body, and life will be radically improved. We strongly believe that wellness starts from within. If you believe that pain is accidental, inherited, or is separate from your mind and emotions, then this program is not for you. If you have been struggling to find a holistic practice, formula, or remedy to help you reset your path and reclaim your personal power, let's get started! Invest in your freedom and the opportunity to live the life you know you deserve.

Online Learning Herbal Medicine for the Soul Mentorship has been 100% virtual and flexible since its inception in 2018. Unlike with many other programs that rushed to go online during the pandemic, Herbal Medicine for the Soul was designed for online learning that's flexible and fits in with your life. Each week, you'll receive 3 video lessons (Lecture, Lab, Materia Medica). You'll be able to flow through the curriculum according to your own schedule and life's demands. Whether you're an early-riser, night-owl, or have to study while the kiddos are doing their own learning, you'll be able to comfortably learn at your own pace. Community Calls Every Thursday we meet live over Zoom at 2:00pm Eastern time for group calls (they are all recorded and available for replay access forever). During this time, we do community check-in, tarot readings, Q&A, workshops, case studies, and learn from guest speakers. This is a collaborative learning space for everyone in the program to explore new topics and to practically understand how to develop holistic protocols that alleviate people's health concerns. Currently, we have a portfolio of over 86 clinical case studies that you can use as a foundation for healing yourself and helping those in your community. Case study conditions include gallstones, Lupus, diabetes, ADHD, anxiety and depression, bi-polar, fibromyalgia, Crohn's Disease, PCOS, endometriosis, pregnancy, postpartum and fertility, grief, establishing healthy boundaries, and more. Students can also volunteer to be in the Hot Seat, a time where we specifically address your personal health issues, discuss the emotional root causes, analyze your natal chart, develop herbal formulas according to your constitution, and discuss other bodywork, therapies, vitamins, and lifestyle changes that would be supportive for you. Get a Sneak Peak of What's Inside Student Testimonials M. Nelson \"Selima gracefully helped me to understand the emotional aspects of my life that needed healing in order to counter the negative physical manifestations that were occurring. I have made major breakthroughs in my relationship and am not plagued by anxiety. With the herbs I'm also successfully controlling my blood pressure, which was a major concern. I'm balancing the day-to-day. Instead of being distracted, I'm focused on my purpose and goals.\" J. Ah Sam \"The course is helping me get to the roots of things way better, and I am encouraged at what this process is helping me do as far as honing my intuition and making decisions to set better standards and boundaries for myself in my everyday interactions. I value the emphasis you put on realizing that health is all-inclusive and radiates to all other areas of your life vs. just taking an extra-strength Tylenol for a headache that occurs after arguments.\" A. Brown \"This herbalism class has been the absolute best. Selima is so knowledgeable on plants and the connection to your birth chart and always has the best energy. She pushes you to be your best and shows you how to use plants to your advantage so that you can heal yourself and take control of your life. I appreciate everything that she has shown me and all of the knowledge that I've gained. Selima is a gem and you won't regret taking her course.\" \"I love Selima's holistic approach to working with plants: spirit, mind, emotions, body. I have taken programs that focus mostly on the body and the physical, and I always felt like something was missing. Finding Herbal Medicine for the Soul was a breath of fresh air. Herbal Medicine for the Soul has helped me gain more confidence as an herbalist to heal myself and share herbal remedies with others. Thank you Selima for creating a space for me to connect to my spirit and build deeper relationships with myself and the plants.\" - N. Ricco \"I want to thank you for being you.

Howard \"When I found myself in the midst of a major emotional disturbance, I knew I needed more support than I could muster up within myself alone. I reached out to Selima because I know her caring, healing nature, and I needed help. It was one of the best decisions I ever made. She got to know my struggles and made a plan to help me reclaim my power and reclaim my joy. She had faith in me and extended her patience, herbal skills, and spiritual practices to give me comprehensive guidance. Her teas, tinctures, and herbal candies help fortify my body with the nutrients needed to assist in my total healing.
