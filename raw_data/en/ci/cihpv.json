However, we wish to put forward some advice on decreasing the possibility of chronic arsenic poisoning of TCM herbs. In fact, arsenic is not always to be blamed as sometimes it could be used as a therapeutic drug in some serious diseases like cancer, this phenomenon reflects a well known principle of \"ghting re with re\" in the theory of TCM[2]. Thus poisonous drugs can be transformed into effective medicine if the boundary between toxic and non-toxic is crucial has been understood well. Duality is a nature for most of the drugs, TCM herbs are no exception, low dose can generate therapeutic effect, while high dose could result in adverse effects, even toxicity or death. The famous saying of the ancient Greek scholar Paracelsus still makes sense: \"The dose makes the poison\"[3]. Thus, avoiding high dose of arsenic administration is essential for the prevention of arsenic poisoning. Long-term administration of medicines containing arsenic might produce a potential health hazard, thus patients on long-term application of arsenic medicines should be instructed to monitor the concentration of arsenic in their body and the functions of vital organs. On account of growing popularity of TCM in the world, millions of people mistakenly believe that TCM herbs are natural and nontoxic. On this account, excessive or improper use of TCM herbs could be quite common, especially through self-administration rather under the direction of doctors. Therefore, enhancing the awareness of the public about the harmful effects of TCM herbs is another vital method for preventing arsenic poisoning[4]. In addition, processing methods of TCM herbs (including washing, soaking, baking, forging, steaming, powdering, grinding, and so on.) can help purify and reduce the toxicity of TCM herbs. Besides, compatibility of medicines, storage, species, geographical sources, methods of taking medicine could also affect the toxin of TCM herbs[2]. Qualitative and quantitative analysis, quality control of active and toxic components are the most direct and effective way to control the quality and ensure the safety of TCM herbs. Perhaps more work should be done in the future. Abbreviations TCM: traditional Chinese medicine Competing interests None. Acknowledgments None References: 1. Spilchuk V, Thompson A.
