In particular, manipulation of the upper spine has been associated with serious adverse events. A recent retrospec-tive case-control study from Ontario yielded perhaps themost conclusive findings so far. 3It showed that, among people younger than 45 years, the odds of experiencing avertebrobasilar accident (VBA) was increased 5 times ifthey saw a chiropractor within the week before the event(odds ratio [OR] 5.03 for chiropractic visits of any type[95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-43.87, p= 0.006] and OR 5.52 for chiropractic visits with a cervical diagnosis[95% CI 1.03-72.02, p= 0.009]). Of the 582 cases of VBA included in this study, 57 were associated with visits to chi-ropractors. The authors concluded that these results were\"consistent with a positive association in young adults\" butwarned that potential sources of bias have to be considered. Yet unbiased findings are incredibly hard to come by. Our group recently conducted a survey of all neurologistsin Britain. 4Our main research question was whether they had seen cases of serious neurological complications occur-ring 24 hours after cervical spinal manipulation during thepast year. Twenty-four respondents had observed 35 suchcases, none of which had been reported. Ten cases were ofvascular accidents. Sadly, survey data are never free frombias, and we would certainly not claim that our results areconclusive. Case reports can be valuable in several respects. Their important disadvantage is that they may indicate only thetip of a much bigger iceberg of problems, particularly as noreliable system exists to record adverse events comparable,for instance, to post-marketing surveillance of drug thera-pies. Recent reports (published since 1995) of complica-tions associated with spinal manipulation include dissectionof the vertebral carotid cord, myelopathy, radiculopathy andperipheral nerve palsy. 5Unfortunately such case reports, even though valuable for pointing us to potential problems,do not bring us closer to defining the incidence of adverseeffects of spinal manipulation. Clearly, the best way forward is to look at prospective studies. Six such reports were found in a recent systematicreview; 6in total they included over 2000 patients. Not a single case of a serious adverse event was reported. How-ever, about 50% of the patients experienced mild and tran-sient adverse effects (e.g., local discomfort, headache, tired-ness and radiating discomfort) after the procedure. These studies exemplify the difficulties in systematically collecting prospective information about adverse effectsand complications of spinal manipulation. In the 2 largestprospective studies (involving 1058 and 625 patients re-spectively), loss at follow-up was a potentially serious prob-lem. 7,8Their design was such that adverse events after one treatment were assessed at each subsequent consultation.Almost by definition, patients who experienced a severe ad-verse effect would simply not return for such a follow-upvisit. It is therefore hardly surprising that only mild com-plaints were registered in these studies. 6To date, no pro- spective investigation of adverse events of spinal manipula-tion is available that has overcome this problem. Thepessimist (and in matters of safety one is wise to take thepessimist's view) therefore suspects that the existing dataare accurate only for minor complaints. Current chiropractic practice seems to take little ac- count of these problems. Either the fact that about 50% ofpatients will experience mild adverse events is completelyignored or these events are labelled as necessary experi-ences on the patient's path to clinical improvement. Criti-cal statements about the value of spinal manipulation getdenounced as \"misleading\" or \"deceitful.\" 9Patients con- tinue to be advised that chiropractic is devoid of risks (un-published data). Early warning symptoms of vascular acci-dents are often ignored; in their systematic review of thesubject, Hurwitz and Morgenstern 10stated that, \"in many cases, the manipulator failed to cease treatment even afterthe patient experienced signs and symptoms of vertebro-basilar ischemia (e.g., dizziness, vertigo, nausea, loss of con-sciousness).\" One gets the impression that the risks ofspinal manipulation are being played down, particularly bychiropractors. Perhaps the best indication that this is true 40 JAMC 8 JANV. 2002; 166 (1) \u00a9 2002 Canadian Medical Association or its licensorsSpinal manipulation: Its safety is uncertain Edzard Ernstare estimates of incidence rates based on assumptions, which are unproven at best and unrealistic at worse. Onesuch assumption, for instance, is that 10% of actual compli-cations will be reported. Our recent survey, however,demonstrated an underreporting rate of 100%. 4This ex- treme level of underreporting obviously renders estimatesnonsensical. What is the message for primary care physicians? On the one hand, there is little evidence to demonstrate thatspinal manipulation has any specific therapeutic effects. 11 On the other hand, there is convincing evidence to showthat it is associated with frequent, mild adverse effects 6as well as with serious complications of unknown inci-dence. 3-5Therefore, it seems debatable whether the bene- fits of spinal manipulation outweigh its risks.12Specific risk factors for vascular accidents related to spinal manip-ulation have not been identified, 10which means that any patient may be at risk, particularly those below 45 years ofage. 3Definitive, prospective studies that can overcome the limitations of previous investigations are now a matter ofurgency. Until they are available, clinicians might telltheir patients to adopt a cautious approach and avoid thetype of spinal manipulation for which the risk seemsgreatest: forceful manipulation of the upper spine with arotational element.
