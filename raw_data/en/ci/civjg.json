Who's Melissa? It's so good to finally meet you No matter what it is, there's a reason you've ended up here right now, reading these words. I'd like to thank you for taking the time to learn a bit more about me. So, what led me to where I am now? A fabulous path with lots of twists and turns! In the early 2000s, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery which lead to a very rewarding and beautiful spiritual awakening. I since mastered the healing arts of massage and Reiki (a form of energy healing). I also sharpened my intuitive skills and awareness, as well as created my own 'spin' on healing, which I refer to as \"loving energy healing\" - you'll often see me hashtag it as #biglove! I'm the proud Founder and lead instructor of Natural Healer, a Usui Reiki Master Teacher (2014) and Practitioner, an Accredited Training Provider (IAOT), CPE Provider and Full Member of the MAA, President of the Natural Healer Society (NHS), Certified Meditation Teacher (MSA), and Massage Therapist (DMA). I'm also an author, podcaster, blogger, and speaker. I absolutely love creating easy, actionable ways for everyday people to heal themselves, others and even their pets! My goal, my purpose, is to help Natural Healer bring high quality information and content - be it a blog post, book or course - that serves your greatest and highest good in today's busy, modern age. Enjoy this journey "}
