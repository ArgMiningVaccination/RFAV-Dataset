The objective of this study was to explore whether there are decadal variations in wheat (winter crop) and maize (summer crop) produc- tion and whether these decadal variations correlate with any known variations of climate. Over one hundred years of wheat and maize yields were simulated using process-based crop models with dynam- ically downscaled daily reanalysis data over four locations in the southeast USA. Using wavelet and cross-wavelet analysis, we found that winter crop yields were dominated by 10- and 22-year decadal oscillations; the decadal variations of winter crop yields were driven by decadal variations of winter temperature and spring precipitation; no decadal variations were detected for summer crop yields and summer precipitation and temperature. Cross-wavelet analysis showed that the decadal variations of winter crop yields were correlated with indices of the annual Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), the annual Pacic Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Therefore, this knowledge of decadal climate variability could potentially be leveraged to predict winter seasonal yields of crops. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Climate factors have a major influence on crop production (Hoogenboom, 2000 ). Variability of climate from one year to another poses risks on decision-making of crop management. For example, higher or lower than normal precipitation (drier or wetter season type) can cause damages or bring benets to farmers. If these climate conditions can be forecasted in advance, decision-makers can benet from using this information to change their strategies to adapt to the upcoming season type. For example, a forecast of the season type (e.g., wet or dry) before the start of the season could potentially be used to adjust crop management strategies to save input costs in dry seasons and to increase inputs in wet seasons to get higher achievable yields (Asseng et al., 2012a,b ).

Tian).Teleconnections refer to statistical associations among differ- ent climatic variables among large distances. Recent studies have focused on using the teleconnection of large-scale climate patterns with local climate to improve seasonal crop management (e.g., Bannayan et al., 2010; Brown, 2013; Jarlan et al., 2013; Maxwell et al., 2013; Royce et al., 2011; Vizard and Anderson, 2009 ). In the southeast USA, agricultural yields have found to be influenced by the El Nino South Oscillation (ENSO) (e.g., Hansen et al., 1998, 1999; Royce et al., 2011 ), as well as other large-scale climate indices including Pacic/North American teleconnection pattern, tropical North Atlantic and eastern tropical Pacic sea surface tem- perature (SST), and Bermuda high indices (Martinez et al., 2009; Martinez and Jones, 2011 ). However, most of these studies were based on correlation or regression approaches that assumed the teleconnection relationships did not change through time, but the variability of large-scale climate patterns are often non-stationary processes (e.g., Coulibaly and Burn, 2004 ) and their relationships with crop yields may change over time. Besides using observed climate teleconnections, GCM-based seasonal forecast tools have http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2015.01.013 0168-1923/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 2 D. Tian et al. / Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 204 (2015) 1-9 Fig. 1. Study locations in three states of the Southeast USA. also been used to improve crop management systems in different regions (e.g., Asseng et al., 2012a,b; Baigorria et al., 2010, 2008a,b; Cantelaube and Terres, 2005 ). However, since the skills of GCMs were still marginal, any crop management improvements from this strategy are limited by the forecast skill of a GCM. Decadal climate variability information can be potentially com- bined with the information of short-term climate variability and GCM-based forecasts to further improve seasonal forecasting for crop management. To make use of decadal climate information, the prerequisite step is to know whether there are decadal variations in historical crop production and whether these decadal variations correlate with any known variations of climate. Crop yield and cli- mate data over multiple decades or even a century can be used to investigate the impact of decadal climate on crop yields. Since vari- ation in crop yields is driven by numerous factors not only including fluctuations of climate but also agronomic management (e.g., sow- ing date, cultivar choice, fertilizer amount, plant density), in this study, dynamic crop simulation models (CSMs) were used as a tool to study the response of crop yields to climate variations by keep- ing all other factors constant over time. CSMs allow simulating the growth and development of crops beyond a single experimental site, and thus can be used to conduct regional climate impact stud- ies. Climatic inputs such as daily precipitation, temperature, and solar radiation are particularly important for CSMs to simulate crop growth and development (van Ittersum et al., 2003 ). Since com- plete sets of these observed weather variables are difcult to obtainover a period of multiple decades at a regional scale, reanalysis data, which provides a temporally and spatially consistent rep- resentation of the observed weather, can be used as a surrogate for inputs into CSMs (e.g., Cammarano et al., 2013; Challinor et al., 2005 ). This study is aimed to assess the decadal variability of crop yields and the possible links to dominant climatic patterns. Most previous assessment studies were based on correlation- or regression-based analysis between crop yields and the teleconnection pattern indices by assuming stationary time series. However, wavelet analysis has revealed that climatic patterns are non-stationary processes, since their variance, frequency, and duration changes through time (Grinsted et al., 2004; Torrence and Compo, 1998 ). The time series of climate-driven simulated crop production may also exhibit non-stationarity. Therefore, using wavelet analysis as opposed to traditional stationary approaches can capture the intermittent fea- tures of the relationship between time series of simulated crop production and climate factors and can enhance the understand- ing and potential predictability of crop yields. While in recent years, wavelet analysis has been widely used in detecting non-stationary features and correlations in geophysical time series such as cli- mate and hydrology (e.g., Carey et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2010 ), this method has not yet been used in assessing the impact of cli- mate variability on crop yields. To the authors' knowledge, this study is the rst to introduce wavelet methods to climate impact assessment of crop production. D. Tian et al. / Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 204 (2015) 1-9 3 Wheat (winter crop) and maize (summer crop) are two of the most important crops in the world. The main objectives of this study were to explore possible decadal variations and their drivers for wheat and maize production in the southeast USA using wavelet methods. CSMs driven by reanalysis data were used to simulate trend-free crop production in multi-decadal time scales. Wavelet analysis methods were then applied to analyze the climate driven crop productions and their relationships to climate patterns. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Reanalysis dataset Reanalysis data used in this study was from the Florida Cli- mate Institute-Florida State University Land-Atmosphere Reanal- ysis data set for the southeastern United States at 10- km resolution version 1.0 (FLAReS1.0, http://coaps.fsu.edu/pub/ Southeast/FLAReS1.0/daily/ and Misra (2012) and Misra et al. (2013) noted that local climate variability and its teleconnections with large-scale climate patterns are well-represented by FLAReS1.0 on seasonal, interannual, and decadal time scales, which made it suit- able for local climate impact studies. FLAReS1.0 was dynamically downscaled from the 20th Century Reanalysis (Compo et al., 2011) using the Regional Spectral Model. It archived 106 years of pre- cipitation, solar radiation, mean temperature, and maximum and minimum temperature data in daily time steps from 1903 to 2008. These daily weather variables were used as inputs into CSMs to sim- ulate crop production and allowed for the examination of decadal scale variations of crop production in the southeast USA. 2.2. Crop simulations Crop simulations were performed using the DSSAT 4.5 (Hoogenboom et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2003 ) CERES-maize model (Jones et al., 1986 ) and the APSIM-Nwheat model version 1.55s (Asseng, 2004 ). The winter wheat cultivar Baldwin and a mid- season maize hybrid were used in this study because these two cultivars are representative for wheat and maize grown in the southeast USA. The models were calibrated and evaluated usingTable 2 Study locations and crop management. Locations Wheat sowing Maize sowing Latitude Longitude Belle Mina, data from three locations in Alabama for wheat cultivar Baldwin (from 2009 to 2011) [Tennessee Valley Research and Extension Center at Limestone County located in Belle Mina, northern Alabama (3441/primeN, 8653/primeW), Wiregrass Research and Extension Center at Henry County Headland, southern Alabama (3122/primeN, 8518/primeW), and E.V. Smith Research and Extension Center at Macon County, Shorter, Central Alabama (3225/primeN, 8553/primeW)], and Tifton in Georgia (3171/primeN, 8334/primeW) for a mid-season maize hybrid (from 1997 to 2008). The mid-season maize hybrid was sim- ulated for the mean yield and mean life cycle across a set of about 20 or more maize hybrids for a given season using Tifton, Georgia variety trials. So the maize cultivar used in this study is a compos- ite representative hybrid. The root mean square error (RMSE) for calibration and validation was 1.89 t ha1for maize and 0.74 t ha1 for wheat. The calibrated genetic coefcients are shown in Table 1. We assume that the same cultivars are applicable for the region, including northern Florida, Alabama and Georgia. Four representa- tive locations were selected for maize and wheat model simulations (Table 2 and Fig. 1) using the calibrated cultivars (Table 1). An important implication of using the same cultivar across the region is that the ndings are due differences in climate as the main subject and not influenced by different cultivars. A soil with a high water-holding capacity (silty-clay soil) was used for four locations in the southeast USA after Cammarano et al. (2013) because this type of soil is representative for an average soil for the southeast USA. Both maize and wheat models were simu- lated with a rainfed (non-irrigated) scheme and with no nitrogen (N) stress by switching N limitations off (DSSAT) and supplying plenty of N fertilizer (APSIM-N wheat). The planting density was 6 and 350 plants m2for maize and wheat, respectively. We initial- ized the crop models with soil water content at 50% above the lower Table 1 Genetic coefcients used to describe a mid-season maize hybrid for DSSAT crop model and the wheat cultivar Baldwin for the N-wheat model (from Cammarano et al., 2013 ).

This initial soil water content was reset in the models before planting to avoid any variability in water carry-over effects. Har- vest for both crops occurred automatically at maturity. The crop growing seasons were different for maize and wheat at the differ- ent locations. The planting dates in these simulations were chosen as average \"usual planting dates\" (Table 2), which are most \"repre- sentative\" planting dates for these four locations (Cammarano et al., 2013 ). Following Cammarano et al. (2013) , we dene the grow- ing season for summer maize from March to July and for winter wheat from October to May. A wheat growing season was across two years (for example when sown in Fall 1979, it was harvested in Spring 1980) and a maize crop was sown and harvested in the same year. Since the wheat growing season was across two years, wheat production was simulated for 105 years, starting from Fall 1903. Maize production was simulated for 106 years, starting from Spring 1903. 2.3. Selected climate indices This study included three large-scale climate patterns that have shown impacts on the regional climate of the southeast USA. These selected indices were the annual mean Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) index, annual mean Pacic Decadal Oscillation(PDO) index, and winter (December thru March) index of the annual North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). These indices have been found to be the predominant patterns for displaying variability of decadal timescales and have impacts on the regional cli- mate in the southeast USA (Eneld et al., 2001; McCabe et al., 2004; Seager et al., 2010 ). The AMO was dened as the leading mode of detrended North Atlantic Ocean Sea Surface Temper- atures (SSTs; Eneld et al., 2001 ) and was obtained from the Physical Sciences Division of the Earth Systems Research Labo- ratory (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/timeseries/AMO/ ). The annual mean AMO index was calculated as the average of the unsmoothed monthly AMO index for each year. The PDO was dened as the rst principal component of SST anomalies in the North Pacic Ocean (poleward of 20N) after the global mean SST anomalies has been removed (Mantua et al., 1997 ). The monthly PDO index was obtained from the Joint Institute for the study of Atmosphere and Ocean at the University of Wash- ington (http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest ). The annual mean PDO index was the average of the monthly PDO index for each year. The winter index of the NAO used in this study was based on the difference of normalized sea level pressure between Lisbon, Portugal and Stykkisholmur/Reykjavik, Iceland and was obtained from the Climate Analysis Section of the National Center for Atmo- spheric Research (Hurrell and National Center for Atmospheric Research Staff, 2014 ).

Wavelet method The continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) was used to detect intermittent periods of a time series. The cross wavelet transformation (XWT) was applied to detect localized relation- ships between two time series (weather variables and simulated crop productions, or climate indices and simulated crop produc- tions). The following is a brief summary of CWT and XWT relevant to this study. For a more detailed description of CWT and XWT see Torrence and Compo (1998) and Grinsted et al. (2004) . The CWT decomposes a time series from the time domain to the time- frequency (or time-period) domain. The CWT of a discrete sequence xnis dened as the convolution of xnwith a /bracketleftbigg (n/prime n)t s/bracketrightbigg (1) where n is the localized time index, s is the scale, t is the sam- pling period, N is the number of points in the time series, and the (*) indicates the complex conjugate. The wavelet power spectrum is dened as |Wn(s)|2. Large wavelet power indicates dominant period. o(h) is the wavelet function (or mother wavelet). The Morlet wavelet function was used in this research and is written as: 0(/DC1) = /EM1/4ei0/DC1e/DC12/2(2)where /DC1 is the nondimensional time factor, ois the nondimen- sional frequency. The spectrum =1 NN1/summationdisplay n=0/vextendsingle/vextendsingleWn(s)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2 (3) The XWT was used to examine whether regions in time- frequency space with large common power have a consistent phase relationship (Grinsted et al., 2004 ). The XWT of two time series xn and ynis as WXY= WXWY, where (*) The cross wavelet power is dened as |WXY|. The complex argument arg( WXY) can be interpreted as the local relative phase between xnand ynin the time frequency space. The cone of influence (COI) is the region of the wavelet or cross- wavelet spectrum in which edge effects become important and distort the results. The statistical signicance (95%) of the wavelet and cross-wavelet power spectrums was assessed relative to the null hypothesis that the time series was generated as red noise (Torrence and Compo, 1998 ). 3. Results 3.1. CWT of wheat and maize yields CWT of simulated annual wheat and maize yields are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The wheat yield oscillations were dominated by decadal variability of 10- and 22-year periods and a short-term 4 year variability (i.e., orange to red areas, statistically signicant when circled with black line) at four locations (N-AL, 6 D. Tian et al. / Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 204 (2015) 1-9 S-AL, S-GA, and N-FL) in the southeast USA. The wavelet power spectrums of wheat yields were high from the 1960s to 1980s for a 10-year period and from the 1930s to 1980s for a 22-year period. It is worthwhile to note that the signicance regions around 10 and 22 year periods were different for all 4 sites. N-AL and S-AL had the greatest 5% signicance regions around 10 and 22 year periods and showed the strongest occurrence of decadal variations. While N-FL and S-GA had high wavelet power spectrums around 10 and 22 year periods, they had very small or no 5% signicance regions compared to the N-AL and S-AL. This difference implicates that the western region had stronger decadal climate variations than in the eastern region of the southeast USA and the strongest decadal cli- mate variations occurred in the northwestern region of this study area and therefore, drove the decadal variations of simulated wheat yields. The maize yield oscillations were dominated by short-term 4-year periods but no decadal variations were found. Fig. 4 is the 11-year and 5-year moving average of the time series of wheat yields after standardization by subtracting the mean and dividing the standard deviation at four locations in the southeast USA. The 22-year period (and 10-year period) oscillations are clearly seen during the 1930-1980s (and the 1960-1980s), which conrms the ndings of CWT in Fig. 2. Fig. 5 is a 11-year and 5-year moving average of the time series of maize yields after standardization by subtracting the mean and dividing the standard deviation at four locations in the southeast USA. 22-year period (and 10-year period) oscillations cannot be seen in this gure. Fig. 5 shows a longer oscillations (more than 30 years) in the early half of the time series. While CWT has identied these longer oscillations, they are within the COI where the wavelet transformations are affected by the edge effect (Fig. 3). 3.2. XWT of crop yields and weather variables Decadal variations of crop yields can be driven by various weather factors, including daily maximum and minimum air tem- peratures and precipitation. Since no decadal variations were detected for maize yields, the XWT analysis is only shown for wheat yields. The XWT was rstly applied for wheat yields and mean temperatures or precipitation over the growing sea- son (October-May) at four locations in the southeast USA, but no relationships at decadal scales were detected (not shown). The XWT was then conducted for wheat yields and monthly and seasonal mean temperatures or precipitation during the growing season (October-May) at these four locations. The cross-wavelet power spectrum indicated that the 10-year and 22- year variations of wheat yields were mostly related to winter (December-January-February, DJF) temperature and May precip- itation at all four locations, and the phase relationship for both 10-year and 22-year variations were in 'in-phase' (i.e., winter temperature or May precipitation simultaneously fluctuated with wheat yields in the same direction for 10-year and 22-year periods). For example, Fig. 6 shows the XWT between winter temperature, May precipitation, and wheat yield in N-AL. The cross-wavelet power spectrums were high for both 10-year and 22-year varia- tions and the phase relationship for were in 'in-phase', which means low (or high) May precipitation or winter temperature is associated with low (or high) wheat yields, suggesting a strong causal relation- ship. Similar relationships were detected for the locations at S-AL, S-GA, and N-FL (data not shown). 3.3. XWT of crop yields and large-scale climate indices XWT was conducted between wheat production and climate indices and between maize production and climate indices for the same four locations in the southeast USA. Again, since no decadal variations were detected for maize yields, only wheat data are Fig. 4. Time series plot of wheat yields from 1903 to 2008 at four locations (a) N-AL, (b) S-AL, (c) S-GA, and (d) N-FL in the southeast USA. Black line, red full line, and red dotted line are original time series, 11-year moving average, and 5-year moving average, respectively. presented. Fig. 7 shows, in N-AL, the 22-year variability appears to be correlated to all three indices (annual mean AMO index, annual mean PDO index, and winter NAO index) with the highest and sta- tistically signicant cross-wavelet power spectrum values for the annual mean PDO index, followed by winter NAO index, and annual mean AMO index. The 10-year variability appears to be mainly driven by the NAO winter index but is also correlated with the annual mean AMO index. Note, for the 22-year variability phase relationship, while the PDO and wheat yields are in in-phase (for example, low (or high) PDO is associated with low (or high) wheat yield), the NAO and wheat yields are in opposite phase (for example, low (or high) NAO is associated with high (or low) wheat yield), which sug- gests that the PDO and NAO effect weaken each other. Similar XWT D. Tian et al. / Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 204 (2015) 1-9 7 Fig. 5. As in Fig. 4, but for maize yields. patterns were also found for the other three locations at S-AL, S-GA, and N-FL (data not shown). 4. Discussion In this study, we have detected short-term (e.g., a few years) and decadal variations in simulated winter crop yields (e.g., wheat) driven by climate reanalysis in the southeast USA. Furthermore, we found that there were short-term (seasonal to interannual) varia- tions in simulated summer crop yields (e.g., maize) in the southeast USA. These decadal variations of simulated winter crop yields were associated with decadal variations in boreal winter season temper- ature and spring (i.e., May) precipitation. This is because winter temperature is important to vernalization of winter wheat and spring precipitation determines soil water availability to wheat growth such as stem elongation, heading, and flowering during spring season. In addition, the simulated winter wheat yields in Fig. 6. Cross-wavelet power spectrum of wheat yields and (a) winter (DJF) tem- perature, (b) May precipitation in N-AL. The red color pixels represent highest cross-wavelet power spectrum. The black contour (surrounding red and orange areas) designates the 5% signicance level against \"red noise\". Inside the black cone shape contour is the region without an edge effect. Outside the black cone contour is the region of cone of influence (COI) - which is due to the nite length of the time series where the edge effects become important and distort the results. The rela- tive phase relationship is shown as arrows (with in-phase pointing right, anti-phase pointing left, and temperature or precipitation leading wheat yields by 90 degree pointing straight down)[For interpretation of the references to color in this gure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article]. the southeast USA showed strong correlations with decadal-time scale climate indices, including annual mean AMO index, annual mean PDO index, and the winter NAO index. There were no signi- cant decadal variations in simulated summer crop production. This is because temperature and precipitation have no decadal climate variation during the summer growing season. These ndings are signicant given the fact that seasonal cli- mate and crop yields forecasts often have low skill and therefore, little value in crop management in many parts of the world (Ash et al., 2007; Vizard and Anderson, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; McIntosh et al., 2007; Mauget et al., 2009; Letson et al., 2009; Messina et al., 1999 ), including the southeastern USA (Cabrera et al., 2007; Jones et al., 2000; Stefanova et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2014 ). The knowl- edge of teleconnections between decadal climate variability and local seasonal climate variability could be potentially useful to further rening seasonal forecasts to improve seasonal crop man- agement. For example, knowing the phase of the AMO, PDO, and NAO will provide further information of the influence of season- ally forecasted ENSO teleconnection on a winter crop like wheat in the southeast USA. The AMO and PDO have a broad tempo- ral variability in the time range of 50-70 years and 20-30 years, respectively. The NAO on the other hand has far broader tempo- ral variability with periods ranging from a few years to decades apart. These oscillations have shown some degrees of predictabil- ity in current dynamic climate models (e.g., Johansson, 2007; Wen 8 D. Tian et al. / Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 204 (2015) 1-9 Fig. 7. Cross-wavelet power spectrum of wheat yields and (a) annual mean AMO, (b) annual mean PDO, and (c) winter NAO for N-AL. The red color pixels represent highest cross-wavelet power spectrum. The black contour (surrounding red and orange areas) designates the 5% signicance level against \"red noise\". Inside the black cone shape contour is the region without an edge effect. Outside the black cone contour is the region of cone of influence (COI) - which is due to the nite length of the time series where the edge effects become important and distort the results. The relative phase relationship is shown as arrows (with in-phase pointing right, anti-phase pointing left, and the climate index leading wheat yields by 90 degree pointing straight down)[For interpretation of the references to color in this gure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article]. et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013 ). In addition, the inertia of their low frequency variations offer an opportunity to exploit their forcing on higher frequency variability. Several decadal reforecasts conducted as part of the IPCC AR5 have demonstrated that climate models can derive skill from the persistence, for example, of the AMO in the initial condition for a decade (Corti et al., 2012; Doblas-Reyes et al., 2011 ). From the application point of view, empirical models can be developed using these observed large-scale climate information to improve seasonal crop management. Seasonal prediction of these climate oscillations from dynamic climate models can be used or combined with empirical- or process-based crop models to assistcrop management. The effects of long-term climate patterns such as the AMO, PDO, and NAO are not just limited to a particular region. Besides the southeast USA, the importance of these long-term cli- mate patterns for crop productions were also found in other regions of the world (e.g., Atkinson et al., 2005; Gimeno et al., 2002; Persson et al., 2012 ). Similar to ENSO impacts on crop yields at a global scale (Iizumi et al., 2014 ), long-term climate patterns such as the AMO, PDO, and NAO could also be considered when investigating the climate impacts on global crop production. This study provides quantitative information that is essential to investigate the effects of climate change on crop production. For example, since climate-driven simulated winter crop production showed strong decadal variations in a region, the decadal variability should be separated from climate change signals when investigat- ing the agricultural effects from climate change. Dynamically downscaled reanalysis was used to drive CSMs to simulate crop production by keeping other factors constant, so that the climate variability effects on crop production could be separated. However, the reanalysis-driven crop simulations have uncertainties from different sources such as the reanalysis data and the CSM (Asseng et al., 2013; Cammarano et al., 2013 ). The atmospheric reanalysis data (FLAReS1.0) used in this study is an atmospheric model dependent product, which is influenced and limited by the delity of the atmospheric model. Similarly the CSM is a numerical, discretized representation of crop growth and development which also has limitations (Asseng et al., 2013 ). Fur- thermore, this study only considered one soil type and different soil types might also impact on the soil-climate interactions and consequently the yield-climate correlations. 5. Conclusion A wavelet analysis revealed that there were strong decadal variations for simulated winter crop yields but not for simulated summer crop yields in the southeast USA. Simulated winter crop yields were dominated by 10- and 22-years decadal oscillations, which are associated with decadal variations in winter temperature and May precipitation. Simulated winter wheat yields were posi- tively or negatively correlated with the AMO, PDO, and NAO winter indices for decadal periods. No decadal variations were detected for simulated summer crop production. This knowledge of decadal variability could be potentially useful to rene seasonal forecasting of crop management.
