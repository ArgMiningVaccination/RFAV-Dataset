With their eyes closed and hands in their laps, they listened to soft music playing in the background and prepared themselves to engage in an ancient Christian practice. Coming from a variety of occupations and denominations, they had gathered on a wintry Monday night to meditate. Once the music finished, a soft silence filled the room as most of the participants mouthed a sacred word or phrase in an attempt to enter a holy space. \"You feel the energy when you're with a group of serious prayers,\" said Terrilyn Krueger, a Portage, Mich., psychologist. \"There is a unity of spirit without knowing the details of the other people. It's not a social group,\" said Donna Harmon, a hospice nurse. Many people probably think of meditation as some kind of New Age, or at the least Hindu or Buddhist, practice. But this way of entering into the spiritual realm has roots in mystic traditions of the Christian church. Meditation's Christian beginning is traced to the Desert Fathers, early Christian monks who lived in Egypt in the third century. The practice also has ties to Lectio Divina, a time-tested way of praying the Scriptures, and to Christian mystics St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Avila. \"Meditation has a very deep tradition in the Christian church,\" said Steve Cartwright, coordinator of the weekly gathering at St. Thomas More, a Catholic church. \"You have references to it in the Psalms and in the teachings of Jesus.\" Although the practice of Christian meditation had been largely set aside in the more technologically based 19th and early 20th centuries, in recent years it has slowly made a comeback. \"We do this as a way to enter into deeper interior silence in order to see the work of God inside of you,\" Cartwright said. At a recent conference at the church, led by David Muyskens, coordinator of Contemplative Outreach in West Michigan, and Cartwright, Midwest regional director of World Community for Christian Meditation, participants explored different approaches to contemplation. Harking back to the Desert Fathers, the World Community approach asks the participant to relax and open up to the spirit of God by quietly chanting a sacred word. Often, participants chant the word \"maranatha,\" which means \"Come, Lord Jesus.\" In this type of meditation, said Cartwright, a person simply sits down or kneels _ the only rule of posture is that the spine be upright and that the body be relaxed and alert _ and then begins to say the chosen word or mantra. \"The goal is, over a long period of time ... to enter into a deeper stillness, silence and attentiveness wherein one knows oneself as known and loved by God and finds one's humanity becoming restored,\" Cartwright said. Contemplative Outreach focuses on \"centering prayer,\" a simple method of connecting to God that was distilled from other sources by three Trappist monks in the 1970s. This approach has less emphasis on saying a word or phrase, and the utterance may even disappear during the contemplative time. But people are encouraged to resume using a chosen utterance when outside thoughts intrude. \"There are an increasing number of people who find it (centering prayer) to be a method of silent prayer in which they receive the gift of the presence of God,\" Muyskens said. The things the two approaches share far outweigh the approaches that separate the two. In each, said Cartwright, there is \"no analysis of experience, no internal discourses ... no expectations, just emphasis on faithfully and gently saying one's word and coming to silence.\" A group has gathered to meditate at St. Thomas More weekly since 1991. Sometimes only Cartwright has been on hand, but recently up to a dozen people have attended. Generally, they all use a similar technique. \"Many of us continually repeat a sacred phrase,\" Cartwright said. \"Over a period of time, it gets out the monkey chatter in the brain.\" Everyone attends the Monday night meetings for basically the same reason. \"I get plugged in and am able to go deeper more quickly when I'm with a group,\" Krueger said. Hildy Kierney, a regular at the weekly gatherings, says she still hasn't mastered meditation even though she has been practicing it on and off for many years. \"Sometimes meditation can be discouraging. I just show up,\" Kierney said. But other times she is able to open her mind and make the link that provides a powerful level of inner calm and contentment. \"It's not good or bad. It just is. You just need to stick to it,\" she said. Harmon, the other hospice nurse, says she finds solace and strength by closing her eyes and trying to open her mind and heart to the presence of God that she says is already in her. \"Meditation is natural,\" she said. \"It helps you accept the gift of your being and of God's being. This is a gift that never "}
