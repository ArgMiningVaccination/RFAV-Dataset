Our fundamental mission is to harness the power of vaccines to prevent disease and save lives in the most vulnerable populations. Our research, surveillance, and [vaccine development](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/CVD/Vaccines/) focus on four key areas: Enteric Diseases, [Malaria](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/malaria/), Influenza and Respiratory Diseases, and Emerging Pathogens. For over [40 years](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/CVD/About-Us/History--Founding/), researchers in the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health (CVD) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) in Baltimore, MD, have developed, tested, and deployed vaccines to aid the world's underserved populations. The CVD is an academic enterprise engaged in infectious disease interventions, from basic laboratory research through vaccine development, pre-clinical and clinical evaluation, large-scale pre-licensure field studies, and post-licensure assessments. Training is a critical component of our work to ensure the foundation for the next generation of scientists and researchers committed to global health initiatives. "}
