However, there are countless ways to boost your immunity while also improving your overall wellness. Eating healthy, taking vitamins, exercising and getting enough sleep have all been scientifically proven to improve your body's immune response. Learn more about the steps you can take below. Taking Vitamins Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin E all have immune-boosting powers. Vitamin C is found in countless foods, including strawberries, oranges, spinach, broccoli and other fruits and veggies. Vitamin B6 is found in fish, whole grains, eggs, many veggies and poultry, among other meats. And Vitamin E levels are highest in leafy green vegetables, nuts and some vegetable oils. As you can probably tell, the common theme for getting enough vitamins is to eat your fruits and vegetables. While you can usually get most of the vitamins you need from diet alone, it's also possible to supplement your diet with a daily multivitamin or by taking certain vitamins individually. But anytime you use supplements, including vitamins, it's a good idea to ask a doctor or nutritionist first. Most are harmless, but some can lead to other health problems if they're misused. Controlling Stress When you feel overwhelmed, it's probably because your body is producing a higher level of cortisol, also known as the stress hormone. Feeling stressed for a prolonged period of time can increase inflammation in your body while also decreasing your white blood cells, which are responsible for fighting off infection.

Not only that, sleep deprivation increases the amount of time it takes you to recover when you do get sick. As the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/expert-answers/lack-of-sleep/faq-20057757) explains, your body doesn't release as many infection-fighting antibodies to help keep illness at bay when you are sleep deprived. You can't boost your immune system by getting more sleep than you need. In fact, getting too much sleep is associated with an increase for many health problems such as diabetes, heart disease and depression, among other conditions. To maximize the health benefits of sleep, aim to get the recommended amount for your age group. Most adults need seven to eight hours per night, while teens and kids need more. Exercising Getting enough exercise is important for so many reasons. Not only does it make you feel better and reduce your risk of serious health conditions, it can also help keep your immune system up. Research hasn't proven the exact reason why exercise boosts your immune system, but there are several [connections](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007165.htm).
