NIMENRIX is a vaccine used to help prevent meningococcal disease, caused by four types of Neisseria meningitidis bacteria (types A, C, W and Y). NIMENRIX works by causing your body to produce its own protection (or antibodies), against these types of meningococcal bacteria. NIMENRIX cannot cause meningococcal disease. The most common types of meningococcal disease are meningitis (infection of a lining around the brain and spinal cord) and septicaemia (blood infection). Neisseria bacteria can less commonly infect the joints, lungs or other organs. Meningococcal disease is spread by small droplets from the nose, mouth or throat. Meningococcal disease is generally serious and sometimes causes long-term effects (eg deafness, memory problems, loss of fingers or toes), or death. As with all vaccines, NIMENRIX may not protect all people who are vaccinated. Also, NIMENRIX does not help to protect against meningococcal disease caused by other types of Neisseria, or meningitis caused by other bacteria or viruses. NIMENRIX can be used in infants from 6 weeks of age, children and adults and is particularly recommended for: - Travellers to countries where meningococcal A, W or Y disease outbreaks may happen (eg parts of Africa, annual Hajj) - Close contacts of people with meningococcal A, W or Y disease - People with medical conditions that make them more likely to get meningococcal disease (eg. people without a functioning spleen or some people with a poor immune response to infections). NIMENRIX may also be prescribed for other people or situations. 2. What should I know before I use NIMENRIX? Warnings Do not use NIMENRIX if: - You or your child are allergic to NIMENRIX, or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet. Symptoms of an allergic reaction may include: - shortness of breath - wheezing or difficulty breathing - swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body - rash, itching or hives on the skin - If you or your child have been given NIMENRIX before and become unwell, tell your doctor or nurse before the vaccine is given. - You or your child have a severe infection with a high temperature. A minor infection, such as a cold, should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor or nurse before having the vaccine.
