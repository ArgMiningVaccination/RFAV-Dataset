My mother took me to see a Chinese Medicine Doctor who helped clear a recurrent sty infection in both eyes. He was an elderly man in his 80's but full of vigor.\" - Siatnee Chong Growing up in a Chinese family in Borneo, my family culture was rich in using Chinese Medicine and Native Herbs in everyday meals, herbal teas, tonics to boost immunity, and natural foods to prevent diseases. My interest in natural medicine was cemented at a young age. My very first experience with acupuncture was when I was five years old. My mother took me to see a Chinese Medicine Doctor who helped clear a recurrent sty infection in both eyes. He was an elderly man in his 80s but full of vigor. Like my family and thousands of others, he fled to South East Asia to escape Mao's Close Door Policy and The Cultural Revolution, bringing a vast knowledge of medicinal practices before the communists burned the old books. He used ear acupuncture (Vaccaria seeds instead of needles) soaked in herbal medicine to place at various points on my ears. He also prescribed an herbal formula regimen. Within a short time, my infection was gone for good. From there, my love for natural medicine was seeded. When I migrated to California, I fell in love with the sunshine state's healthy lifestyle and eco-conscious living. With my multilingual skills and entrepreneurial spirit, I worked for several international companies in sales and marketing roles traveling the globe and working 60+ hour weeks. Not long before, my intense work and travel schedule drained my energy and affected my health. I was beginning to go gray and losing hair. I was consistently tired, overworked, and ill. To recuperate, I turned to Yoga, meditation, Qi Gong, Tai Ji, and vegetarianism. My love for yoga inspired me to become a yoga teacher. I also studied Qi Gong, Tai Ji, and various ancient practices to recharge. During this journey, my love for natural medicine and the unique capability of our bodies to heal themselves was ignited. I started the journey back to my roots, studying Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), building the blocks on a foundation that I grew up with the Yin and the Yang, the Qi and the Xue, 5 Elements, herbs, and meridians; only this time, more profound and comprehensive. One thing led to another. When one of my older sisters was diagnosed with Stage 4 Ovarian cancer, I held her hands during the most challenging journey she had to walk on. She was supported with herbs, Moxa, massage, and energy work throughout her multiple surgeries, chemotherapy treatments, radiation treatments, and many Western medications. The combination of Eastern and Western medicine prolonged her life and improved her quality of life. However, due to the advanced stage of her cancer, she eventually passed away peacefully after a 5-year battle. The combination of Eastern and Western medicine extended her quality of life for five years. Every day was precious, and she could check off everything on her bucket list, including leaving a legacy for her young son. I am grateful to have been able to help extend her life and her time with her family. \"No matter what kind of ailments you have, having a true healer by your side is equally important as the type of medicine you are taking.
