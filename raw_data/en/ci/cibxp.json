Other Name: High-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine | Active Comparator: TIV-HD1 (Licensed TIV-HD1) | Participants randomized to receive a single injection of 0.5 mL licensed TIV-HD1 by IM route at Day 0. | Biological: Licensed TIV-HD1 | 0.5 mL-dose was administered IM into the upper arm area. Other Name: High-dose trivalent influenza vaccine | Active Comparator: TIV-HD2 (Investigational TIV-HD2) | Participants randomized to receive a single injection of 0.5 mL investigational TIV-HD2 by IM route at Day 0. | Biological: Investigational TIV-HD2 | 0.5 mL-dose was administered IM into the upper arm area. Other Name: High-dose trivalent influenza vaccine (alternate B strain) - Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of Influenza Antibodies Following Vaccination With Either a High-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or High-Dose Trivalent Influenza Vaccine [ Time Frame: Day 28 post-vaccination ]GMTs of anti-influenza antibodies were measured (HAI) assay for 4 strains: A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B Victoria lineage (B1), and B Yamagata lineage (B2). For each A strain, the comparison was made with the pooled TIV-HD groups. For each B strain, the comparison was made with the TIV-HD group containing the corresponding B strain. TIV-HD 1 did not contain B2 strain; TIV-HD2 did not contain B1 strain. - Percentage of Participants Achieving Seroconversion Against Antigens Following Vaccination With Either a High-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or High-Dose Trivalent Influenza Vaccine [ Time Frame: Day 28 post-vaccination ]Anti-influenza antibodies were measured using an HAI assay for 4 strains: A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B Victoria lineage (B1), and B Yamagata lineage (B2). Seroconversion was defined as either a HAI titer less than (<) 10 (1/dilution) at Day 0 and post-injection titer greater than or equal to (>=) 40 (1/dilution) at Day 28, or HAI titer >=10 (1/dilution) at Day 0 and a >=4-fold increase in HAI titer (1/dilution) at Day 28. For each A strain, the comparison was made with the pooled TIV-HD groups. For each B strain, the comparison was made with the TIV-HD group containing the corresponding B strain. TIV-HD 1 did not contain B2 strain; TIV-HD2 did not contain B1 strain. - GMTs of B Strains Influenza Antibodies Following Vaccination With Either a High-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or High-Dose Trivalent Influenza Vaccine [ Time Frame: Day 28 post-vaccination ]Anti-influenza antibodies were measured using HAI assay for 4 strains: A/H1N1 (A1), A/H3N2 (A2), B Victoria lineage (B1), and B Yamagata lineage (B2).

Seroprotection was defined as a HAI titer >=40 (1/dilution) at Day 0 and Day 28. - Geometric Mean Titers of Influenza Antibodies (Seroneutralization [SN] Assay) Following Vaccination With Either a High-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or High-Dose Trivalent Influenza Vaccine [ Time Frame: Day 0 (pre-vaccination) and Day 28 post-vaccination ]GMTs of anti-influenza antibodies were 4 strains: A/H1N1 (A1), A/H3N2 (A2), B Victoria lineage (B1), and B Yamagata lineage (B2). - GMTRs of Influenza Antibodies (SN Assay) Following Vaccination With Either a High-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or High-Dose Trivalent Influenza Vaccine [ Time Frame: Day 0 (pre-vaccination) and Day 28 post-vaccination ]GMTRs of anti-influenza antibodies were 4 strains: A/H1N1 (A1), A/H3N2 (A2), B Victoria lineage (B1), and B Yamagata lineage (B2). GMTRs were calculated as the ratio of GMTs post vaccination and pre-vaccination. - Number of Participants With Neutralization Antibody Titers at Day 0 and Day 28 [ Time Frame: Day 0, Day 28 ]Neutralizing Antibody titer was measured for each influenza strain with the SN method for 4 strains: A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B Victoria lineage (B1), and B Yamagata lineage (B2).

Unsolicited AE was an observed AE that did not fulfill the conditions prelisted in the CRB in terms of symptom and/ or onset post-vaccination. Unsolicited AEs included both serious and non-serious unsolicited AEs. A serious adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was an important medical event. - Number of Participant With Unsolicited Adverse Event (AE) [ Time Frame: Within 28 days after vaccination ]An unsolicited AE was an observed AE that did not fulfill the conditions prelisted in the CRB in terms of symptom and/or onset post-vaccination. Unsolicited AEs included both serious and non-serious unsolicited AEs. A serious adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was an important medical event. - Number of Participant With Serious Adverse Event [ Time Frame: Up to 6 months after vaccination ]An serious adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, was life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was an important medical event.
