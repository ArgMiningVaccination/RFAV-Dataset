It also can be used as a companion product to a standard multivitamin or to any aging protocol. Oxidative stress can have far-reaching bodily effects, including on immune system function and metabolic health. Because free radicals are important to our bodies' functions, the goal of Hormone Balance* is not to eliminate them, but to support normal balance between generation and elimination. Detoxification and reactive oxygen species (free radicals) are inextricably linked. The plant compounds known interchangeably as phytonutrients or phytochemicals serve various functions for plant vitality. Legumes, herbs, spices and nuts are sources of phytonutrients; fruits and vegetables are concentrated sources. When we consume these phytonutrient-rich plants, we offer our bodies natural free radical scavenging support.
