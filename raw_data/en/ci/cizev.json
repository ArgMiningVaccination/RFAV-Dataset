Anne has been practising since 1988 and has worked in close association with doctors, chiropractors and naturopaths in private practice. In 1997 Anne studied and trained in a traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in China. She is registered with the AHPRA Chinese Medical Board of Australia and is a member of both the Australian National Association of Chinese Herbalists and Acupuncturists and the Australian Association of Massage Therapists. Both acupuncture and Chinese medicine date back more than 2000 years, which means they are one of the oldest health care systems in the world and also one of the most utilised! Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM, incorporates acupuncture and is a type of holistic, natural health care system because it stimulates the body's own healing mechanisms and takes into account all aspects of a patients life, rather than just several obvious signs and symptoms. TCM practitioners view the body as a complex network of interconnected parts (part of a larger concept known as Qi) rather than separate systems or organs, and as such, their treatment protocols are aimed to \"fix the body as a whole\". According to the University of Maryland Medical Centre, [Traditional Chinese Medicine](https://www.umms.org/ummc/health-services/orthopedics/services/acupuncture) treatments aim to correct imbalances in the body and primarily work in three major ways: Addressing a patient's external factors and environment Helping patients relate to their internal emotions in a healthier way, including managing stress Improving someone's lifestyle factors, including diet and exercise routine.
