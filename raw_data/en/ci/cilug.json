Ram Manohar, Director of Research, Ayurvedic Trust at Combatore writes on the evolution and regional adaptation of Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia. Ayurveda is much more than wellness massage - this should have got around among experts by now. For good reason, there is now a course of study in Ayurvedic medicine at the European Academy of Ayurveda. But Ayurveda is also much more than medicine, which often intervenes only when damage has already occurred. Therefore, it is worthwhile to look at health resources from an Ayurvedic point of view. At the center of an Ayurvedic health education is the conscious perception, the sensitivity for the manifold influences that promote or disturb the balance of life forces. No general rules can be set up for this, since there are always new combinations of influences. The basis of conscious perception is the development of self-knowledge and openness to external and internal processes. A variety of methods have been developed for this purpose, which can be used in daily life. All activities of life should have the right measure, which again is not defined in general by Ayurvedic doctors, but always with regard to the individual person and his current situation. Thus, when eating, the right amount is the one that can be consumed without feeling heavy and burdened. This can change in an individual person within a few hours, e.g. due to stress and tension or emotional stress, the digestive capacity can be drastically reduced. What possibilities does Ayurvedic medicine offer? At the European Academy of Ayurveda you will get a profound insight into the Ayurvedic view of health and disease.

The seminar offers you a sound introduction to Ayurvedic medicine. The 2nd part of the basic course together with part 1 forms the basis of every certified training at the European Academy of Ayurveda. Ayurveda also sees itself as a health system that wants to help people avoid getting sick in the first place. The Sanskrit term for health is svasthya, literally translated this means \"resting in the self\". Health in this sense is a functioning self-reference, a situation in which the person knows himself in harmony with himself. This includes a knowledge of one's own constitution with its strengths and weaknesses and the affirmation of this individual being. Important dimensions of Ayurvedic health education are: Humans do not live in isolation, but are embedded in the rhythms of nature, especially day and night and the seasons. Today we know that many organ functions are controlled circadian, which should actually be considered in the lifestyle. Ayurveda recommends daily self-massage, which refreshes and invigorates the body and leads to a positive relationship with one's own body. From an Ayurvedic point of view, it is very detrimental to health if natural bodily functions are suppressed, including in particular excretion (faeces, urine, semen, vomiting), yawning, belching, hunger and thirst, crying, sleeping and the need to breathe intensely. The basic principle here is to let nature take its course. This area includes a variety of measures: Use of collyrium for the eyes, inhaling fragrant incense, cleansing the body, including especially the tongue, gargling with oil, massaging the scalp and ears with oil, oil massage of the whole body (including the feet), bathing, wearing clean clothes and flower garlands, wearing precious stones and jewelry, taking care of the hair, beard and nails, using appropriate footwear and sunscreen. A healthy diet is always a diet according to type, which is varied, fresh and tasty. Since it meets the inclinations of the individual, it requires basically no overcoming and effort to implement it in everyday life. \"The tongue is the best Ayurvedic doctor,\" ancient texts say in this regard. In addition, there is the development of a culture of eating, which involves consciously tasting and enjoying the food in pleasant surroundings. From the point of view of Ayurveda, many health disorders are caused by deposits of metabolic products that have not been fully processed or eliminated. Therefore, it is recommended to use spa treatments regularly. These are aimed at regenerating and purifying the body. The so-called \"Pancakarma treatment\" includes massages, heat applications, taking herbal extracts, diet and other measures and is used both preventively and curatively. Ayurveda knows special formulas and pharmaceutical preparations, which are primarily not used therpeutically, but to strengthen the organism and keep it young. Here, the specific view of Ayurveda, which is concerned with the right measure in all areas of life, becomes particularly clear. Physical activity is basically seen positively and recommended, it serves to develop endurance and strength. The effects of regular exercise are: \"ease, the ability to perform one's duties, perseverance, the ability to respond appropriately to difficult situations, reduction of imbalances in the vital forces, and a boost to the digestive fire.\" (Caraka Samhita 1.7.32) At the same time, the classical texts warn intensely against over-exertion, because it can lead to unpleasant symptoms such as exhaustion, fatigue, circulatory problems or fever. Many activities of daily life lead to tension and cramping, which are the precursors of manifest diseases. Besides the already mentioned self-massage, Ayurveda recommends the breathing and physical exercises of yoga. The human image of Ayurveda assumes that the personality core of each person is free from disease. This self is the source of all life energy. Meditative processes open the access to the inner source of power, promote conscious perception, develop relaxation, serenity and inner stability and also physiologically lead to the activation of regeneration mechanisms. Therefore, meditation should be a natural part of daily life. The lively inner reference to oneself simultaneously serves as a catalyst for many other health-promoting behaviors and promotes self-motivation. Dr. P.
