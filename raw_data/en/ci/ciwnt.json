Discussions by artists, archivists, academics, lawyers, teachers, journalists and others. Forty Years an Archive Rat in Five Continents Ramachandra Guha sociology, Ramachandra Guha became a historian by chance, after a village elder in Uttarakhand told him an unlikely tale of peasant protest that he found confirmation of in the archives. This was in 1982. For the next four decades, Guha has scoured archives around the world, in search of materials for his books and essays. He has done research in archival repositories in different parts of India, the UK, and the USA, and in Israel, South Africa, and Australia. He has worked in government archives, university manuscript collections, company record rooms, and newspaper offices, and consulted personal collections held in private hands. This talk will recall some professional and personal highlights from those journeys. Guha will speak of different kinds of primary sources; government documents, personal letters, diaries, court records, fugitive newspaper reports, etc, providing illustrations of the insights each can provide into our past. Much of this work was done before the invention of the World Wide Web, when one had to go physically to an archive to know what it contained, and when one had to take notes by hand. He will end his talk with reflections on how the digital age simultaneously makes the historian's job easier as well as less enjoyable. Bio: Ramachandra Guha is a historian and biographer based in Bengaluru. His books include a pioneering environmental history, The Unquiet Woods (University of California Press, 1989), and an award-winning social history of cricket, A Corner of a Foreign Field (Picador, 2002), which was chosen by The Guardian as one of the ten best books on cricket ever written. His book, India after Gandhi, was chosen as a book of the year by the Economist, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal, and as a book of the decade in the Times of London and The Hindu. These were followed by Gandhi Before India (Knopf, 2014), and Gandhi: The Years That Changed the World (Knopf, 2018). More recently, this year, he published Rebels Against the Raj: Western Fighters for India's Freedom. His awards include the Leopold-Hidy Prize of the American Society of Environmental History, the Daily Telegraph/Cricket Society prize, the Malcolm Adideshiah Award for excellence in social science research, the Ramnath Goenka Prize for excellence in journalism, the Sahitya Akademi Award, and the Fukuoka Prize for contributions to Asian studies. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Microglia perform a remarkably broad range of functions in the brain, which include core 'glial' functions such as regulating neuronal activity in the healthy brain, and 'immune' functions that are evoked in response to perturbations, such as injury. Whether all microglia can attain any required functionality, or whether there are dormant microglial subsets, poised to perform specialized functions has been a question of keen interest in the field. It is also unclear if and how microglia revert back to their original state after performing specialized functions. With these broad questions in mind, we examined microglia through the lens of a transcription factor, Tcf4 (Transcription factor 4). We focused on Tcf4 given its neuro-immune relevance. While Tcf4 function in brain development and neurological diseases is well-known, recent studies from our lab have identified important cell-specific functions of Tcf4 in the healthy adult brain. Formerly, Tcf4 was shown to regulate and maintain cellular fate of a blood cell type through regulation of cellular form and function. Given the relevance of functional-fate changes for microglia, we asked if Tcf4 could be involved. For this, we first characterized Tcf4 expression in microglia, which showed that while early-postnatal and aged-brain microglia express Tcf4, adult brain microglia in minimal Tcf4 expression. However, adult microglia up-regulate Tcf4 expression during injury-response, suggesting a context-specific role for Tcf4 in microglia. To test the function of Tcf4 using a loss-of-function strategy, we planned to use the Cre-LoxP system to conditionally delete Tcf4 in microglia. Surprisingly, we discovered a biological caveat in a widely used inducible-deletion system for microglia, the Cx3cr1-CreER system. This work demonstrated how chromatin accessibility, based on the cellular-state, could cause unwanted Cre-mediated DNA-damage. We demonstrated that Cx3cr1-mediated Cre induction, specifically in neonatal microglia, causes DNA damage leading to aberrant microglia development and function, while adult microglia are unaffected by Cre induction. In the final segment of my dissertation, I investigated the question of microglial functional heterogeneity and cell-fate during injury-response using single-cell transcriptomics. This study indicates the presence of distinct functional subsets of microglia and a potential role of Tcf4 in tissue recovery. Overall, my studies uncover a potentially important regulator of microglia and provide conceptual insights into microglia heterogeneity. As a tangent study, my work also identifies a hidden caveat of the Cre-LoxP system, emphasizing correct use of controls and providing useful strategies for microglial gene-manipulation using currently existing tools.

Protein misfolding causes functional inefficiencies, loss of function, or toxicity, ultimately leading to disease. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, type II diabetes, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases are some diseases caused by protein misfolding. In this thesis, we studied the salt-induced misfolding of the prion protein. Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases caused by the prion protein's misfolding to a toxic oligomeric form. Prion protein (PrP) in its native, non-toxic, cellular (PrPC) form has an unstructured N-terminal domain (NTD) attached to a globular C-terminal domain (CTD) that has 3 alpha-helices and Conversion of PrPC to a misfolded, beta-sheet-rich, oligomeric form, also known as the scrapie form (PrPSc), is associated with prion disease. In this thesis, we have studied the misfolding and oligomerization of PrP under acidic conditions in the presence of salt. At pH 4, PrP remains monomeric and helical. It only converts to a misfolded, oligomeric form in the presence of physiological salt concentrations and at physiological temperature. We have extensively used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to observe and understand the salt-induced changes in the monomeric and helical PrP before misfolding at residue-level resolution. We have studied the changes in the following three aspects of the misfolding PrP using NMR. 1) chemical environment 2) backbone hydrogen bonding 3) backbone dynamics. First, in Chapter 2, we observed the changes in the chemical environment of PrP by titrating PrP against salt and measuring the changes in the chemical shift of the backbone amides using [15N, 1H] HSQC spectra. We concluded from these experiments that salt breaks the E195-K193 salt bridge and disrupts the region around Q211 in in PrPC. We also monitored the real time misfolding of PrP using NMR. We show show that PrP misfolding is association-limited and not limited by conformational change. Amide hydrogen temperature coefficients (TC) are excellent reporters of hydrogen bond strength in proteins. In our second study (Chapter 3), we used TCs to measure the changes in hydrogen bond strengths of PrP residues under native and salt-bound conditions. We have observed that upon binding to salt, mainly the strength of the backbone hydrogen bonds of polar residues show changes which is the trigger for misfolding. This was corroborated by the rapidly misfolding polar pathogenic mutation Q216R-PrP under native conditions and the protective mutant A6-PrP under native and misfolding conditions. Using TCs, we discovered that the curvature of alpha3 changes in the salt-bound form. In the third study (Chapter 4), we studied the dynamics of misfolding PrP by NMR spectroscopy. Measuring the dynamics of PrP under misfolding conditions is tricky as the protein signal intensity is constantly decreasing, and the dynamics experiments are intensity-dependent. Therefore, we reduced the temperature of the misfolding PrP sample to 298 K during the NMR experiment to significantly reduce misfolding rate. We could reliably measure the T1 and T2 relaxation times at this temperature, which describe the protein dynamics in the ps\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2ns timescale. We also used mutagenesis to understand the changes in protein dynamics caused by the binding of salt to PrP. We made a double mutant of PrP (dm-PrP) using two pathogenic mutations, E195K and E210K. We observed that dm-PrP misfolds significantly faster than wt-PrP. We then used the truncated C-terminal domain of PrP (CTD-PrP and dm-CTD-PrP) to observe the ms - ms dynamics of the protein using CPMG relaxation-dispersion experiments. These experiments show that the alpha1-beta2 loop near E195 has alternate conformations and plays a major role in PrP misfolding. CPMG experiments also identified a few residues which have alternative conformations. The thesis describes the changes in PrPC under misfolding conditions at high resolution. We have characterized the changes in a chemical environment, backbone hydrogen bonding, and dynamics of misfolding PrP using NMR spectroscopy. The critical regions for misfolding and oligomerization of PrP identified by this study are the E195-K193 salt bridge at the end of alpha2 and the region around Q211 in alpha3. We also show that during salt-induced misfolding, PrP's native electrostatic interaction network is disrupted. We have identified residues that have alternative conformations under native conditions. These residues are located from beta1 to alpha1. In addition, we have studied the dynamics of the misfolding PrP in the timescale range of picosecond to microseconds. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Transformational discoveries and inventions in many disciplines are enabling a virtuous cycle of innovation in Global BioPharma R&D. We now have: Clearly, BioPharma R&D has become a multi-disciplinary field presenting tremendous opportunities for those willing to cross the barriers of disciplines and collaborate. In our presentation, we'll share highlights of our work with the Global BioPharma R&D community. Specifically, we'll talk about our collaborations in: We've started collaborating in a small way with one of the NCBS labs and look forward to greater collaboration with BLiSC labs and researchers.

Given scarce fossil evidence, experimental evolution has been an important tool to study the likely first step of this transition, namely the formation of undifferentiated cell clusters. However, experimental evolution suffers from two major blind spots: Although multicellularity first evolved in bacteria, the extant experimental evolution literature on this subject has primarily used eukaryotes. Moreover, it focuses largely on mutationally driven (and not environmentally induced) phenotypes. Here we show that both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria exhibit phenotypically plastic (i.e., environmentally induced) cell clustering. Under high salinity, they grow as elongated ~ 2 cm long clusters (not as individual planktonic cells). However, under habitual salinity, the clusters disintegrate and grow planktonically. We used experimental evolution with Escherichia coli to show that such clustering can be canalized successfully: the evolved bacteria inherently grow as macroscopic multicellular clusters, even without environmental induction. Highly parallel mutations in genes linked to cell wall assembly formed the genomic basis of canalized multicellularity. While the wildtype also showed cell shape plasticity across high versus low salinity, such plasticity was either canalized or reversed after evolution. Interestingly, a single mutation could canalize multicellularity by modulating plasticity at multiple levels of organization. Taken together, we show that phenotypic plasticity can prime bacteria for evolving undifferentiated macroscopic multicellularity. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Individuals affected by autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) exhibit affective symptoms such as enhanced anxiety, which has been seen in rodent models of ASDs as well. Exposure to stress is also known to be anxiogenic. However, the effects of stress on animal models of ASDs remains less explored. Hence, in my thesis, I examined the impact of acute foot shock stress on anxiety-like behavior in two monogenic rat models of ASDs, fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (Fmr1-/y) and phosphatase and tensin homolog heterozygous Before exposure to stress, the basal levels of anxiety-like behavior in both Fmr1-/y and Pten+/- rats were comparable to that seen in wild-type (WT) control rats in an open-field arena. After exposure to the foot shock stress, however, Fmr1-/y rats showed the highest levels of anxiety-like behavior. WT animals also showed enhanced anxiety-like behavior but not as robustly as the Fmr1-/y animals. In Pten+/- animals, on the other hand, the same stressor did not elicit any anxiogenic effects. In a separate group of rats, the efficacy of the acute foot shock in triggering a stress response was confirmed wherein a comparable surge in circulating corticosterone was seen in all three experimental groups. Thus, the same acute stress led to different effects on anxiety-like behavior in different rodent models of ASDs, suggesting that vulnerability to stress-induced changes in anxiety may vary with the underlying genetic mutations. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Super-enhancers comprise of multiple enhancer elements with unusually high enhancer activity, allowing them to robustly regulate the expression of their target genes. Super enhancers have been demonstrated to drive the expression of cell identity genes. Furthermore, acquired super-enhancer elements govern strong oncogene expression in various malignancies, making super-enhancers promising targets for cancer therapy. However, the relationship between the various elements that make up a super-enhancer, for example, is one of the inherent aspects of super-enhancers that is currently elusive. Here we dissect the intrinsic properties of the super-enhancer cluster positioned upstream of the INK4a/ARF locus. We report that only a subset of enhancers from the dense multi-enhancer cluster interacts with the promoters, independent of their H3K27ac and eRNA levels. The promoter interacting enhancer subset is indispensable for INK4a/ARF locus regulation. Interacting enhancers transcriptionally control each other and INK4a/ARF promoters over long distances as an interdependent single unit. The deletion of even a single interacting enhancer results in an unanticipated collapse of the entire enhancer cluster, leading to EZH2 enrichment on promoters in an ANRIL-independent manner. Dysregulated genes genome-wide mimic 9p21-associated diseases under these scenarios. Our findings highlight the intricate dependencies of the promoter-interacting enhancers on each other. 11:30 AM, Thursday, Oct 27, 2022 | Haapus (LH1)Thesis Seminar by Ms Rumamol C of junctional Maithreyi Narasimha on 'Sculpting during morphogenesis: cellular heterogeneity, interface geometry and tissue fluidity' 10:00 AM, Saturday, Oct 29, 2022 | Remote VCTalk by Prof K.
