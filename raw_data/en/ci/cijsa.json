HL has a heterogeneous etiology with the highest incidence in Caucasians, followed by African Americans and Hispanics, and the lowest incidence in Orientals1. The annual incidence of HL in Europe and North America has been estimated to be 1.3 to 4.0 per 100,000 in males and 0.9 to 3.1 per 100,000 in females, in Asian countries the incidence is 0.1 to 1.3 per 100,000 in males and less than 0.7 per 100,000 in females2. In general, HL accounts for about 1% of all cancers and ~30% of the lymphoid malignancies worldwide1. Early stage HL is curable in the vast majority of patients. The treatment of patients with advanced disease stages, primary refractory disease after initial standard treatment, and relapses, is still challenging3. A considerable proportion of the patients suffer from treatment-related long-term toxicity, including cardiovascular diseases and treatment-related secondary malignancies, even 20 years after treatment4. So there is a need to deepen our understanding of the biological basis of HL. Pathology of HL HL is currently classified as two different disease entities: classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). Both HL subtypes are characterized by a minority of malignant cells that usually represent about 1% of cells in the tumor mass. The tumor cells in cHL are called Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS). The mononuclear Hodgkin cells generate the multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells by incomplete cytokinesis and cell re-fusion of daughter cells5. The Reed-Sternberg cells have a limited proliferative ability 6, 7. HRS cells are surrounded by reactive cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils and histiocytes8. Based on morphology of the HRS cells and the composition of the background cells cHL can be classified into 4 different subtypes: nodular sclerosis Introduction and scope of the thesis 9 60-80%, mixed cellularity tumor cells in NLPHL are called lymphocytic predominant (LP) cells. Despite extensive efforts in the last years, the pathogenesis of HL is not completely understood. HRS cells show crippling somatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes9, indicating a germinal centre antigen-experienced B cell origin. In the germinal centre reaction na\u00efve B cells differentiate into memory and plasma B cells via positive selection, whereas auto-reactive B cells and B cells lacking functional Ig expression are eliminated. HRS cells escape from apoptosis by a variety of pro-survival mechanisms (see below). In contrast, LP cells of NLPHL usually have somatically mutated functional Ig gene rearrangements. In general, B cell malignancies including NLPHL, retain key B cell markers10. HRS cells, on the contrary, have lost expression of most of the B cell lineage-specific gene expression program, including expression of Ig11. HRS cells retain B-cell features related to antigen-presentation and factors involved in the cross talk with T helper (Th) cells, such as MHC II, CD40 (TNFRSF5) and CD8012, 13. At the same time non-B cell lineage proteins are upregulated14-16. The mechanisms for the loss of B cell phenotype include methylation of the promoter regions of the B cell associated genes17-19, loss of E2A function20, upregulation of NOTCH1 , a negative regulator of the B cell program21 and activation of STAT522. HRS cells consistently express non-B cell proteins CD15 and CD30. These two markers are used as diagnostic markers of cHL. The CD15 and CD30 staining pattern is characterized by a membranous staining combined with staining of the Golgi apparatus. CD30 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily (TNFRSF8) was originally identified as a HRS cell marker almost 30 years ago23. CD30 can mediate activation of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-KB) pathway and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway and prevent induction of apoptosis of HRS cells24, 25. In addition, HRS cells often express markers of cytotoxic T cells (granzyme B) 26 and dendritic cells (Fascin) 27. A number of genomic aberrations have been identified in HRS cells. These include Chapter 1 10 gains or amplifications of the gene loci for JAK2 , FGFR3 , REL and ID228, 29. Especially increases of the gene locus for REL and JAK2 locus were reported as recurrent alterations in primary HRS cells28. A gene fusion involving the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator CIITA has also been reported in 15% of cHL30. In addition to these structural aberrations, mutations in HRS cells frequently carry mutations in members of the NF-KB family, such as A20/TNFAIP3, NFKBIA and NFKBIE31. EBV 30-60% of cHL copies of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome in the HRS cells32. There are two known mechanisms that support the relevance of EBV in the pathogenesis of cHL: EBV latent membrane protein LMP1 can mimic CD40 resulting in activation of the NF-kB transcription factor33, 34 and LMP2a can mimic immunoglobulin (Ig) and may rescue HRS cells that lack Ig expression35. Based on the function of LMP1 and LMP2a proteins and the clonal infection pattern, EBV is considered to be a causal event in EBV+ cHL32, 36. The prevalence of EBV infection in cHL is highly variable between racial groups and geographic locations37, 38. The proportion of EBV involvement is almost 100% in Hispanic cHL patients39, intermediate in the Asian population and around 30% in Caucasians37, 40-42. EBV-associated cHL is more common in mixed cellularity subtype, males, children and in the elderly43-45. In EBV+ cHL patients response to therapy and 2-year failure-free survival of young patients (<50 years of age), is significantly better than in older patients46-48. In older patients treatment failure is associated with a positive tumor cell EBV status49. The effectiveness of the immune reaction to EBV derived antigenic peptides depends on the HLA-restricted T cell responses. The T cell response is dependent on the affinity and immunogenicity of the antigen presented in the context of specific HLA alleles. Two microsatellite markers, D6S265 and D6S510, located in the HLA class I region were associated with the risk of EBV+ cHL in a Dutch population50. Follow-up Introduction and scope of the thesis 11 studies indicated that HLA-A*01 and HLA-A*02 were responsible for this association, with HLA-A*01 giving an increased and HLA-A*02 a decreased risk for developing EBV+ cHL51. The possible reason for this is that HLA-A*02 molecules are able to effectively present antigenic EBV-derived peptides, while HLA-A*01 molecules are not. In EBV+ cases HRS cells may survive the anti-tumor immune response by downregulating both class I and class II HLA antigens. Interestingly, in EBV- HL patients HLA class I was present on HRS cells in only 30% of cases while in EBV+ cHL HRS cells in 79% of the cases retained HLA class I expression. Downregulation or lack of HLA class II expression was observed in HRS cells in 40-50% of the cHL, with no significant differences between EBV+ and EBV- cHL52. So, immune escape by downregulation of HLA antigens is not an obvious mechanism applied by HRS cells in EBV+ HL. Survival strategies of HRS cells and function of the microenvironment Normally B cells that fail to produce high affinity immunoglobulin (Ig) undergo apoptosis during the germinal center reaction53-55. Survival strategies applied by the HRS cell precursors include a combination of aberrant growth signals provided by ligation of TNF receptor (TNFR) members CD30, CD40 and receptor activator of NF-kB (RANK)56,57 and in addition, activation of the activator protein 1 (AP-1)58, members of the STAT signaling pathway and deregulation of NOTCH1 signaling56. Overexpression of c-Jun and JunB leads to constitutive of AP-1, which plays a role in proliferation58. Overexpression of CD30 can induce JunB overexpression59. STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6, and IL-13 and IL-2160 contribute to activation of these pathways. Notch1 and Notch2 are aberrantly expressed in HRS cells, and the Notch ligand Jagged1 stimulates Notch signaling in HRS cells21. Together this leads to a strong and constitutive activity of the NF-kB pathway which is essential for survival and growth of HRS cells61. In EBV+ Chapter 1 12 cases, LMP1 also activates this pathway, independent of ligand binding34, whereas mutations of the negative regulator of NF-KB, A20, are observed predominantly in EBV- cases, which might enhance the NF-KB activation state31. In addition, over 80% of the cHL cases show constitutive expression of c-FLIP which protects the HRS cell precursor cells from Fas/CD95 triggered apoptosis without the need for CD40L survival signals62, 63. Another mechanism to escape from FAS induced apoptosis, might involve triggering of the IL-21 receptor with IL-21, both produced by the HRS cells. This leads to activation of the STAT3 pathway and protects HRS cells from CD95 induced apoptosis64. Several studies indicate that it is difficult to grow HRS cells in culture or in immunodeficient mice65. This supports a crucial role of the microenvironment for HRS cell survival. Indeed, there is a complex cytokine network between tumor and inflammatory cells. HRS cells secrete TARC and MDC, which attract Th2 cells and T MIP-3 , IL-21 attracts Treg cells64. A large proportion of the infiltrating cells in cHL indeed consist of CD4+ Th and Treg cells. These cells have an immunosuppressive activity on infiltrating cytotoxic T cells which is favorable for HRS cells. Besides attraction by chemokines these cells can also be obtained by promoting differentiation of naive CD4+T cells into Th2 and Treg cells68. HRS cells may further orchestrate the microenvironment by changing a cellular Th1 response to a humoral Th2 response, which has tumor cell survival effects69. HRS cells produce immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF , and other factors such as galectin-1, to inhibit T cell function70-72. Moreover, HRS cells express programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) ligand to inhibit T-cell effector functions by binding of PD1 on T cells73, 74. In some cases CIITA chromosomal translocations involving the Programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L) 1 or PD-L2, gene loci, lead to PD-1 ligand by HRS cells. High PD-1 ligand expression levels results in exhaustion of PD-1 positive cytotoxic T cells. Expression of Galectin-1 and PD-1L can be regulated through AP-1 dependent enhancers70, 75. Moreover, HRS cells trigger IL-3 secretion by activated T cells 76, which has growth- and survival-promoting effects on HRS cells by binding to the IL-3R. Introduction and scope of the thesis 13 Receptors tyrosine kinase pathways Figure 1: Receptor tyrosine kinases expressed in HL. Triggering of these kinases leads to activation of PI-3K- AKT and MAPK-ERK pathways, which promote survival and proliferation of HRS cells. Many receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) have emerged as key regulators of critical cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, metabolism and migration77. In humans there are 58 RTKs belonging to 20 subfamilies. All RTKs have a similar molecular structure: an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain that contains the tyrosine kinase (TK), carboxy (C-) terminal and juxtamembrane regulatory regions. Nowadays RTK abnormalities have been found in a variety of cancer types78. In HL, several RTKs have been shown to be expressed and possibly contribute to survival of HRS cells. Renne et al. reported aberrant expression of 6 RTKs in HL, i.e.: platelet-derived type 2 (TRKB). Aberrant RTK expression was most pronounced in the NS subtype79. There was an inverse correlation between expression of RTKs and EBV Chapter 1 14 status, indicating that the RTK pathway might represent a complementary mechanism for the survival of HRS cells in EBV negative cases of cHL80. The ligand for DDR2, collagen 1, is present at high levels in the sclerotic bands of NS-HL. Nerve Growth factor, the ligand for TRKA is produced by granulocytes in HL. The ligands for PDGFRA and EPHB1 are expressed by the tumor cells and not by the microenvironment and may thus act as autocrine factors. However, phosphorylation of the receptor was found in HRS cells of only 25-30% of the patients expressing PDGFRA and TRKA. In general, HRS cells showed higher phosphorylation level than non-Hodgkin lymphomas, these high phosphorylation levels were observed especially in NS-HL79. Hepatocyte growth factor or scatter factor (HGF/SF) is produced by cells of mesenchymal origin. HGF activity is mediated by binding to its receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) encoded by the proto-oncogene c-Met. After binding to HGF, c-Met undergoes auto-phosphorylation and this leads to activation of several cellular targets involved in a variety of biological processes, including proliferation, survival and migration. c-Met expression has been reported in HRS cells in 33% to 100% of cHL tissue samples81-83. HGF was observed in the HRS cells of 8% (10/121) of the cases83. In addition, HGF expression was observed in infiltrating cells, especially in dendritic cells. c-Met expression correlated with a good 5-year freedom from tumor progression. In functional studies activation with HGF did not affect cell growth, while the c-Met inhibitor SU11274 suppressed cell growth by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest83. In contrast to the above mentioned RTKs, there are limited or no publication on the role of other potentially interesting RTKs. IGF-1R has been implicated in survival and cell cycle progression in many cancers. A unique feature of IGF-1R is that at least three PI3K molecules can be recruited by one IGF-1R molecules. PI3K is constitutively activated in HRS cells and promotes their survival. Together these data support a potential role of IGF-1R In HL pathogenesis, but this remains to be studied. The Ephrin family, which is the largest TK family, is deregulated in various tumor types including hematopoietic malignancies, but the family has not been studied in HL. Introduction and scope of the thesis 15 Scope of the thesis The aim of this thesis is to further investigate tumor cell survival mechanisms. In Chapter 2 we evaluated the expression, functionality and prognostic significance of IGF-1R in cHL. In chapter 3 we explored the Ephrin family expression patterns of both the tumor cells and the normal cells in the microenvironment in both cHL and NLPHL. As stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by microbial pathogen associated ligands results in the activation of NF- B, which is one of the hallmarks of cHL, we reviewed current knowledge on TLR in B cell lymphoma in chapter 4. In chapter 5 we analyze the expression pattern of TLRs in HL and perform a preliminary functional study. Downregulation of HLA class I and II is one of the mechanisms to escape from an anti-tumor response in EBV+ tumor cells. In HL, downregulation is more common in EBV- cases, which indicates that EBV+ tumor cells use alternative mechanisms. In chapter 6 we evaluated the expression of HLA class I, HLA class II, CLIP, HLA-DM and HLA-DO in EBV positive cHL and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), to explore if the peptide binding groove of HLA class II is blocked binding to EBV-derived antigenic peptides by retention of CLIP in the binding groove.

PlosOne, 2014 9:e87474 Chapter 2 24 Abstract The interaction between the tumor cells in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and the microenvironment includes aberrant activity of receptor tyrosine kinases. In this study we evaluated the expression, functionality and prognostic significance of Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in cHL. 55% (44/80) of cHL patients. Phosphorylated IGF-1R was detectable in a minority of the IGF-1R positive tumor cells. The overall survival (OS, 98%) and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS, 93%) was significantly higher in IGF-1R positive cHL patients compared to IGF-1R negative patients (OS 83%, p= .029 and PFS 77%, p= .047, respectively). Three cHL cell lines showed expression of IGF-1R, with strong staining especially in the mitotic cells and expression of IGF-1. IGF-1 treatment had a prominent effect on the cell growth of L428 and L1236 cells and resulted in an increased phosphorylation of IGF1R, Akt and ERK. Inhibition of IGF-1R with cyclolignan picropodophyllin (PPP) decreased cell growth and induced a G2/M cell cycle arrest in all three cell lines. Moreover, a decrease in pCcd2 and an increase in CyclinB1 levels were observed which is consistent with the G2/M cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, IGF-1R expression in HRS cells predicts a favorable outcome, despite the oncogenic effect of IGF-1R in cHL cell lines. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor is a prognostic factor in classical Hodgkin lymphoma 25 Introduction Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is characterized by a minority of malignant Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells that usually represent only about 1% of the total number of cells in the tumor tissue. The HRS cells are surrounded by a vast majority of reactive cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils and histiocytes1. HRS cells are dependent on interactions with other cell types for their survival. These interactions include, among others, tumor cell activation by multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), which have been shown to be overexpressed in HRS cells2. The Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF-1R) is a receptor tyrosine kinase consisting of two ligand-binding extracellular -subunits are bound by disulfides to two single transmembrane -subunits3. The molecular structure of its ligand Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) is similar to Insulin. IGF-1 is produced primarily by the liver and bone marrow stromal cells as an endocrine factor, under the control of hypothalamic growth hormone releasing hormone and pituitary growth hormone. A unique feature of IGF-1R, different from other RTKs, is that it is in a constitutive dimerized state, even in the absence of its ligand4-6. Upon ligand binding, the three tyrosine residues kinase (TK) domain of the -subunit7, resulting in an increase in catalytic activity. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as docking sites for other signaling molecules such as insulin receptor substrate 1-4 (IRS-1-4) and SRC homology 2 domain-containing proteins activate (PI3K)/Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways3, 8, 9. Another unique feature of IGF-1R is that at least three PI3K molecules can be recruited by one IGF-1R. PI3K binds directly to the pY1316 residue of the C-terminal domain of IGF-1R10, and two additional PI3K molecules bind to pY608 and pY939 of IRS-111. Activation of Akt exerts anti-apoptotic effects through inhibitory phosphorylation of Chapter 2 26 pro-apoptotic factors as BAD, as well as increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL-2, and BCL-XL12. PI3K was found to be constitutively activated in HRS cells and promoted their survival13. The MAPK pathway mediates diverse biological functions depending upon the cellular context, including cell growth, survival, and differentiation14. Aberrant IGF-1 signaling has been found in multiple aspects of tumor biology, including proliferation, transformation, apoptosis protection and chemotherapy-resistance15-17. In hematopoietic malignancies, a critical role was shown of the IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling pathway for proliferation and survival in multiple myeloma (MM) 18 and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 19. The functionality of IGF-1R in cHL is unknown. In this study we evaluated the expression, function and prognostic significance of IGF-1R in cHL. Materials and methods Patient and tissue data Primary cHL tissues were retrieved from the Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands (n=80 collected from 1993 to 2010). The basic characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1. The histological diagnosis was based on the currently used criteria defined by the World Health Organization 2008 classification. The median follow-up was 55 months (interquartile range, 34.5-104.5 months). The study protocol was consistent with international ethical guidelines (the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice). The same patient cohort was used in an earlier study20, and according to the Medical ethics review board of the University Medical Center Groningen fulfilled requirements for patient anonymity and were in accordance with their regulations. The Medical ethics review board waives the need for approval if rest material is used under law in the Netherlands, and waives the need for informed consent when patient anonymity is assured. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor is a prognostic factor in classical Hodgkin lymphoma 27 Immunohistochemistry Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens were cut into 4- \u00b5m sections, mounted onto polylysine-coated slides, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in a graded ethanol series. The sections were quenched for endogenous peroxidase with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide, and then boiled in EDTA (1 mmol/L; pH8.0) for 15 minutes in a microwave oven for antigen retrieval. The sections were incubated at 37\u00b0 C for 1 hour with the first antibody, IGF-1R (3C8B1, with horse-radish peroxidase-labeled secondary and tertiary antibodies (Dako). 3, 3 -diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was used as substrate and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. CD30 expression was used to identify the tumor cells. For positive controls tonsil and breast carcinoma tissue was used. For negative controls, tissue sections were incubated under the same experimental conditions without primary antibody. For immunocytochemistry on the 3 cHL cell lines, cytocentrifuge preparations were made and fixed with acetone for 10 minutes. Cells were stained with the primary antibody, and subsequently incubated with secondary and third antibodies; 3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole was used as a chromogen. Evaluation of IGF-1R expression was performed by a hematopathologist without knowledge of the clinical outcome. A case was defined positive when HRS cells showed homogenous staining for IGF-1R. Blood vessels in all tissue sections served as internal controls for IGF-1R. Expression of IGF-1R was correlated to age, sex, and histological subtype, stage of disease, EBV status and with other known prognostic factors. Chapter 2 28 Cell lines The cHL cell lines L428, KM-H2 and L1236 (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) in cHL cell line culture supernatant 2*105 cells per ml were cultured in triplicate in RPMI 1640 with FCS and supernatants were collected after 24 hours. IGF-1 protein levels were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS was used as the baseline for the levels of secreted IGF-1. Western blot analysis Cell lines were starved in medium without serum for 24 hours and treated with different concentrations of an IGF-1R inhibitor cyclolignan picropodophyllin (PPP; Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ, USA)) for hours. PPP stock solutions were prepared in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at 4\u00b0 C in 10 uM aliquots. After 30 minutes of incubation with exogenous IGF-1 (R&D Systems) at a concentration of 50 ng/mL, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (Cell Signalling Technology, Boston, MA, USA) and incubated for 20 minutes on ice. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C to remove cellular debris. The protein concentration was determined using bicinchonic acid (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cell lysate was diluted in loading buffer, boiled for 5 minutes and separated on an 8% or 12% (w/v) Tris-HCl SDS polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using standard protocols and incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00baC overnight. Immunostaining was amplified by incubation with HRP-conjugated antibodies (Dako) and chemiluminescence was detected using SuperSignal\u00aeWest Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce Chemical Co). Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor is a prognostic factor in classical Hodgkin lymphoma 29 Experiments were performed in triplicate. Antibodies used in the Western blot blue test Cellular growth after stimulation and inhibition was evaluated by alamar blue tests (AbDSerotec, Oxford, UK). Alamar blue is a measurement of metabolic activity, which can be measured at several time points in the same cells. In the absence of apoptosis, we used alamar blue as a measurement of relative cell numbers. Cell lines were seeded at 10,000 cells/ml in 96-well plates and 10 \u00b5L of alamar blue was added to each well. The fluorescence was measured with an excitation of 560 nm and emission at 590 nm. Every cell line was analyzed in triplicate (3 wells) and in three independent experiments. The fluorescence was measured with increasing concentrations of IGF-1, PPP or DMSO control at different time points. Relative percentages of cell growth were calculated as follows: mean fluorescence treated cells / mean fluorescence control cells. Cell cycle assays For the cell cycle analyses, cells were harvested after 24 hours, washed in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and ribonucease A). The percentage of cells in specific cell cycle phases (G1, S, and G2/M) was determined using a flow cytometer (Calibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA USA) and the Modfit software. Every sample was tested in three independent experiments. Chapter 2 30 Statistical evaluation The IBM SPSS Statistics 20 software package and GraphPad Prism were used for the statistical analysis and data plotting. The Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the associations between clinicopathological features with the IGF1R expressions, as appropriate. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate the association between patient age and IGF-1R expression. Proliferation and cell cycle results were analyzed by a student t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Overall survival (OS) was measured from the date of diagnosis of cHL to the date of death. 5-years Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as months elapsed between the date of diagnosis and the date of tumor progression or death from any cause, with censoring of patients who were lost to follow-up or still alive and free of cHL disease at the last date of follow-up. Survival curves were generated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. The log-rank test was used to evaluate statistical significance of the differences in the curves. Results IGF-1R expression in cHL tissue The clinicopathological data of our patient cohort are summarized in Table 1. Expression of IGF-1R was cytoplasmic and/or membranous (Figure 1A) in 55% (44/80) of the cHL patients. Expression of IGF-1R was observed in all or the vast majority of HRS cells in positive cases, whereas in negative cases virtually all HRS cells were negative. There was a significant difference in IGF-1R expression with HL subtype (p=.0157), with a high percentage of positive cases in the nodular sclerosis cases (38/61) and a low percentage of positive cases in mixed cellularity cases (1/9). We found no statistical significant differences in IGF-1R expression for age, EBV status, Ann Arbor Stage, IPS, B-symptoms, bulky disease, or treatment. In a pilot study 16 Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor is a prognostic factor in classical Hodgkin lymphoma 31 IGF-1R positive patients were stained for pIGF-1R. Only single HRS cells stained positive for phosphorylated IGF-1R (Figure 1B) in 3 of the patients, whereas the HRS cells in the remaining 13 patients were pIGF-1R negative in all HRS cells. Based on this low percentage of positive cells we decided not to stain the whole patient cohort. Prognostic value of IGF-1R We studied the prognostic value of IGF-1R in our patient cohort. The overall survival (OS) was significantly higher in the IGF-1R positive patient group (98%), as compared to the IGF-1R negative patient group (83%, Figure 2A, p= .029). The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was also significantly better in IGF-1R positive patients (93%) compared to IGF-1R negative patients (77%, p= .047, Figure 2B). Thus, absence of IGF-1R expression is a significant prognostic factor for poor 5-years PFS in our cHL cohort. This prognostic value of IGF-1R was observed in the entire cohort, but in subgroup analysis according to stage only remained prognostic among advanced stage patients due to low number of cases and events per subgroup. The International Prognostic Score (IPS) could not predict prognosis among advanced stage patients in our cohort. IGF-1R and IGF-1 expression in three cHL cell lines The 3 cHL cell lines showed IGF-1R staining (Figure 1C, D, E), with the strongest expression in L428. In all 3 cell lines mitotic cells expressed higher levels of IGF-1R. Western blot analysis of the three cHL cell lines revealed different levels of IGF-1R subunits (Figure 3A). L428 cells expressed the highest level of IGF-1R and KM-H2 the lowest. In order to evaluate a potential autocrine IGF-1R activation loop, we investigated the production of IGF-1 by the three cHL cell lines. The IGF-1 level was approximately 100 pg/ml in the cell culture supernatant after 24 hours of culture and similar levels were found for all three cell lines (Figure 3B). Chapter 2 32 L428 cell growth is enhanced by IGF-1 In an attempt to evaluate the potential of IGF-1 stimulation, we incubated the three cell lines in medium with FCS with different concentrations of IGF-1. This revealed no impact on cell growth (data not shown), suggesting that the production of IGF-1 by the HL cells could be saturating the IGF-1R or that the production of other factors by the cells masks the putative effect of IGF-1. Next we performed the same experiment after overnight serum starvation. 72 hrs of IGF-1 treatment had the most prominent and significant effect (31% increases) on the cell growth of L428 cells (Figure 3C). In L1236 a significant increase in cell growth was observed only for the high dose of IGF-1 (40 ng/ml, Figure 3D). No significant effect was observed for KM-H2 (Figure 3E). Thus L428 cells were most sensitive to IGF-1 treatment, consistent with its high IGF-1R expression level. PPP inhibits cell growth of cHL cell lines in a dose and time dependent way We next investigated the in vitro anti-proliferative effect of PPP (0.25-2 \u00b5M), without addition of IGF-1, in three cHL cell lines. PPP significantly suppressed cell growth in a dose dependent manner with the strongest effects observed at 1 and 2 \u00b5M PPP (Figure S1). The effect of PPP was time dependent and after 72 hours of PPP treatment the viability decreased significantly in all three cHL cell lines (Figure 4). The strongest effects were again observed for L428 cells with a reduction in cell growth of 48%. The reduction in cell growth was 30% in KM-H2 cells and 26% in L1236. The higher sensitivity of L428 for PPP is consistent with the high expression of IGF-1R on L428 cells and the sensitivity to IGF-1. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor is a prognostic factor in classical Hodgkin lymphoma 33 PPP induces G2/M-phase arrest in cHL cell lines after 24 hours of PPP treatment. To determine whether inhibition of IGF-1R by PPP has an effect on the cell cycle, we analyzed distribution of cells over the different cell cycle fractions by PI staining after 24 hours of treatment. Treatment with PPP induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in all three cell lines, the number of cells in the G2/M phase significantly increased from 8% to 45% in L428, from 4% to and from 3% to 38% in L1236 (Figure 5, and figure S2). The IGF-1R/IGF-1 signaling pathway in cHL cell lines L428 has the highest expression of IGF-1R, so we used L428 for studying the IGF-1R/IGF-1 signaling pathway after serum starvation with IGF-1 stimulation and PPP inhibition. The optimal time to get a strong signal of IGF-1R phosphorylation by IGF-1 in L428 was 20-30 minutes (Figure 6A). Stimulation with IGF-1 revealed an increase of pAkt and pERK1/2 (Figure 6A). After treatment with PPP the IGF-1 induced phosphorylation of the IGF-1R subunit is blocked, while the total amount of IGF-1R was not affected. The induction of pAkt was effectively blocked by PPP in a dose dependent manner without altering Akt protein levels. Induction of ERK phosphorylation was induced by PPP (Figure 6B). We next studied the effect of PPP on cell cycle regulators, including Cdc-2, pCdc-2 and CyclinB1. PPP inhibited phosphorylation of the cell cycle regulator Cdc-2 and increased CyclinB1, changes that are consistent with G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest (Figure 6C). Discussion The pathogenesis of cHL remains poorly understood. HRS cells are derived from germinal center B cells that have lost their B cell phenotype including immunoglobulin expression23. Although normal germinal center B cells that lack functional Chapter 2 34 immunoglobulin undergo apoptosis, HRS cells escape this programmed cell death24,25. Aberrant activity of multiple RTKs in HRS cells might prevent apoptosis and explain resistance to treatment-induced apoptosis and treatment failure. HRS cells aberrantly express up to 7 different RTKs with extensive heterogeneity regarding the number and combinations in individual cases2. In general, a more prominent co-expression has been observed in nodular sclerosis than mixed cellularity cHL26. Consistent with these findings we also found that IGF-1R is predominantly expressed in the nodular sclerosis subtype of cHL, although we analyzed a limited number of mixed cellularity HL patients. Overall we demonstrated IGF-1R expression in the vast majority of the HRS cells in 55% of the cHL patients. IGF-1R is not normally expressed by B cells, only some large germinal center B cells show weak expression, but it is expressed by plasma cells19. IGF-1R is expressed by mantle cell lymphomas19. So, it is possible that expression of IGF-1R by the tumor cells in HL can be an effect of malignant transformation or due to differentiation towards plasma cells. In cHL expression of IRF4/Mum1, expressed in germinal center cells and plasma cells, and Blimp-1, a regulator of plasma cell differentiation, are both detected, although for Blimp-1 only in 23% of patients in a small part of tumor cells27. We studied expression of IGF-1R and IGF-1 in three cHL cell lines and observed marked differences in IGF-1R levels, whereas the levels of IGF-1 production were similar. Cells in the process of mitosis showed strongly enhanced expression of IGF-1R in all 3 cell lines. The functionality of the IGF-1R/IGF-1 signaling pathway was studied in L428 cells, which showed the highest IGF-1R levels. Consistent with its known signaling pathway we observed enhanced pIGF-1R, pAkt and pERK1/2 levels upon stimulation with IGF-1. Treatment with the IGF-1R inhibitor PPP revealed an inhibiting effect on cell growth, and blocked the constitutive phosphorylation of IGF-1R. It has been shown that the inhibitory effect of PPP on IGF-IR did not co-inhibit the insulin receptor activity or compete with ATP in in vitro kinase assays in several cell lines, suggesting that it may inhibit IGF-1R autophosphorylation at the substrate level28. Although PPP blocked phosphorylation of Akt, it induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. These findings are similar to the results previously reported in melanoma cell Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor is a prognostic factor in classical Hodgkin lymphoma 35 lines29. PPP possibly induces ubiquitination of IGF-1R and in turn activates ERK1/2. In all cell lines PPP caused G2/M cell cycle arrest. Blocking of the cell cycle is consistent with the decrease in pCdc2 (Tyr15) and increase in CyclinB1. In MCL cell lines PPP also induced a G2/M cell cycle arrest, with similar decreased pCdc2 and increased CyclinB1 levels. In the same study inhibition of IGF-1R with siRNA was also tested, since small molecule inhibitors can have nonspecific effects, and this resulted in very similar effects. In the MCL cell lines apoptosis was induced after 24 hours of treatment19, while we did not see an increase of apoptotic cells between 4 to 72 hours of PPP treatment (data not shown). The PPP dependent effect on the G2/M cell cycle arrest correlates with the upregulation of IGF-1R expression during mitosis, and indicates the relevance of IGF-1R signaling for cell division. This might also fit the low frequency of pIGF-1R positive HRS cells and is consistent with the low number of HRS cells in mitosis in cHL tissue. The effect of PPP also highlights a potential therapeutic application of IGF-1R kinase inhibitors in combination with conventional G2 phase specific drugs (Vincristin and Bleomycin) included in the commonly used ABVD regimen in cHL. Expression of IGF-1R has been shown to correlate with an unfavorable prognosis in several types of cancer, e.g. in advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma30, but also with a favorable prognosis in studies in breast cancer31-33, non small cell lung cancer34 and soft tissue sarcoma35. In our cohort IGF-1R positivity was a significant predictor of good outcome in patients with cHL both for OS and 5-years PFS. How can the adverse prognosis of IGF-1R negative HRS cells be explained? Previous studies revealed that low IGF-1R expression is associated with de-differentiation of various human cancers36-39, indicating that IGF-1R expression is lost when cells become more malignant. Increased MDM2 expression can cause downregulation of IGF-1R and in some cancers, such as soft tissue sarcoma, MDM2 expression is associated with a more malignant phenotype40. In cHL patients, expression of MDM2 is not associated with prognosis41, and we did not find a correlation of MDM2 expression and absence of IGF-1R receptor expression in our patient cohort (data not shown). Another more likely explanation for this unexpected positive prognostic effect might be Chapter 2 36 related to the characteristic histology of cHL with only a very small percentage of tumor cells in an abundant reactive infiltrate. The IGF-1/IGF-1R pathway plays important roles in hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation and normal immune function42. There is some evidence of a role for IGF-1R in T cell growth and function. Activated T cells have an increased number of IGF-1R molecules, and IGF-1 was shown to enhance anti-CD3 stimulated proliferation43. It can be speculated that activation of IGF-1R in HRS cells might alter the immunological response of the reactive cells by shaping the microenvironment in a way that is less beneficial for survival and growth of the HRS cells. We recently reported that expression of the oncogenic RTK c-Met by HRS cells was a marker for good prognosis in HL20. Functional studies showed that the effect of c-Met inhibitors was unfavorable for growth of HL cell lines similar to the effects of IGF-1R inhibition. There was no correlation of c-Met expression with IGF-1R expression in this cohort (data not shown). In a recently published gene expression based model for the prediction of overall survival, low IGF-1 levels were correlated with a bad prognosis44. These findings are consistent with our results and support our findings that an active IGF-1/IGF-1R pathway is a favorable prognostic marker in HL. In conclusion, we showed expression of IGF-1R in 55% of cHL patients. In cHL cell lines both IGF-1R and IGF-1 were expressed and inhibition of IGF-1R induced G2/M arrest. IGF-1R expression is enhanced in mitotic cells. Despite the oncogenic effect of IGF-1R in cell lines, IGF-1R expression in HRS cells predicts a favorable outcome and might be included in future clinical risk stratification after validation in future large prospective studies.

In preparation Chapter 3 48 Abstract The Ephrin family is the largest family of tyrosine kinases. Its unique features are the expression of both receptor and ligand on the cell membrane and the bidirectional signaling. Recent studies showed altered expression of multiple Ephrin receptors (Eph) and ligands (ephrin) in several human malignancies. In this study, we explored the expression pattern of the Ephrin family in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Quantitative (q) RT-PCR was used to determine the mRNA expression levels of 21 Ephrin family members in 8 HL cell lines and in diagnostic tissue samples of 4 HL patients. Seventeen members of the Ephrin family were expressed at the mRNA level in at least one of the HL cell lines. No expression was observed for EphA2, EphA6, EphB6 and ephrin-B3. (NLP)-HL and 25 classical (c)HL patients. Ephrin-A3 was expressed in tumor cells of cHL, whilst there was no expression in the tumor cells of NLP-HL. Conversely, tumor cells of NLP-HL showed expression of EphA1, whereas cHL tumor cells did not. EphA3, ephrin-A4 and ephrin-B1 were each expressed in 60-70% of the HL patients. Besides expression in the tumor cells, we also observed EphA1 staining in the lymphocytes surrounding the LP cells in NLP-HL and EphA3, ephrin-A4 and ephrin-B1 in the infiltrating cells of cHL. In addition, EphB1, EphB2, EphB4 and ephrin-A5 were expressed at the mRNA level in HL tissue samples, indicating expression in infiltrating cells. In conclusion, members of the Ephrin family are widely expressed in the tumor cells and microenvironment of cHL and NLP-HL. The Ephrin family of tyrosine receptor kinases in Hodgkin lymphoma 49 Introduction Tyrosine receptor kinases (TRKs) are important regulators in fundamental cellular activities such as proliferation, differentiation, survival and motility. The largest RTK subfamily is the Ephrin family. The Ephrin family consists of multiple receptors (Eph) and ligands (ephrin). A unique feature of this family is that both receptors and ligands are membrane-bound proteins that require direct cell-cell contact for activation. The ligands either have a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (A-type) or a membrane-spanning protein domain (B-type). The receptors are also classified into A and B subtypes according to the type of ligand they bind to (Box 1). Two of the 16 receptors, i.e. EphA9 and EphB5, are not expressed in humans1. There are 8 ligands grouped into ephrin-A1-5 and ephrin-B1-3 (box 1). Upon receptor-ligand interaction, downstream signaling is induced not only in the receptor-expressing cell but also in the ligand-expressing cell, via bidirectional signaling 2. Box 1. Schematic overview of the affinity between Eph-receptors and ephrin ligands. EphA1 has a high affinity for ephrin-A1. The other Eph-receptors have average affinity for multiple ephrins. EphA4 can bind ephrin-B2 and B3, while EphB2 can bind ephrin-A5. EphA9 and EphB5 have not been detected in humans. In solid tumors Ephrin family members may behave as oncogenes or as tumor Chapter 3 50 suppressor genes3. Cancers that highly express Ephrin family members include melanoma4, prostate5, breast6, and esophageal7 cancer. Loss of expression has also been implicated in several types of cancer. In addition, inactivation by gene mutations has been shown e.g. for EphB2 in gastric cancer8 (Supplementary Table 1)4-39. Peripheral blood B cells and lymph node B cells show differential expression of several members of the Ephrin family. Ephrin-A4, EphB6 and EphA10 are expressed in lymph node B cells and on activated B cells39. Aberrant expression of Ephrin family members has been reported in both leukemia and lymphoma36-39. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells showed a more heterogeneous expression of the Ephrin family than their normal peripheral blood counterpart39. Oricchio36 identified EphA7 deletions and inactivating mutations in a high percentage of follicular lymphomas. The importance of this receptor in lymphomagenesis is further demonstrated by knockdown of EphA7 in a murine model, resulting in follicular lymphoma development36. Thus far, only EphB1 and its high affinity ligand ephrin-B1 have been studied and found to be expressed in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) 38. cHL is characterized by a minority of malignant Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells that are surrounded by infiltrating reactive cells. Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLP) has similar features with lymphocyte predominant (LP) cells as tumor cells. HRS and LP cells are dependent on interactions with other cell types for their survival40. These interactions include, among others, tumor cell activation by multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), which have been shown to be overexpressed in HRS cells38. In the present study, we systematically evaluated the expression pattern of the Ephrin family in HL cell lines and primary tissue samples. Materials and Methods Patients Primary HL tissues were retrieved from the Department of Pathology, University The Ephrin family of tyrosine receptor kinases in Hodgkin lymphoma 51 Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands. 25 cHL patients and 5 NLP patients were included for immunohistochemistry. The cHL samples included 7 EBV-positive and 18 EBV-negative cases, 20 cases were the nodular sclerosis subtype, 2 cases were the mixed cellularity subtype and 3 cases were classical not otherwise specified. Of 4 of these cases 2 NLP and 2 cHL cases we used frozen tissue for qRT-PCR. Normal lung tissue, tonsil, testis carcinoma, colon carcinoma and activated blood lymphocytes were used as control samples for qRT-PCR. Tonsil and lung carcinoma tissue sections were used as controls for immunohistochemistry. The study protocol was consistent with international ethical and professional guidelines (the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice). Cell lines CHL cell lines L428, L1236, KM-H2, cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with fetal 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37\u00b0 C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. RNA extraction and qRT-PCR Quantitative (q)RT-PCR was performed to determine the expression of 21 Ephrin family members (13 receptors and 8 ligands) in eight different HL cell lines and in frozen tissue sections of 4 HL patients (2 NLP and 2 cHL). Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Samples were subjected to DNase treatment using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Applied Biosystems). Total RNA of each sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamers and Superscript II (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was performed with SYBR Green and the Lightcycler 480 (Roche). Primers for Human Ephrins were designed using Primer Express 2.0 software (Table 1). Samples were assayed in triplicate and RPII was used as a housekeeping gene for Chapter 3 52 normalization of the data. Cp values over 35 were regarded as negative. The relative expression levels of the Ephrin family were quantified by calculating the difference in Cp value from the Cp value of the RPII ( Cp). The results were expressed as 2-Cp to indicate the relative mRNA level. In addition to the cell lines, we also analyzed expression of all Ephrin family members by qRT-PCR in 2 NLP (patients 1 and 4) and 2 cHL patients (patients 18 and 26). As the tumor cell percentage in HL is usually less than 1%, the qRT-PCR results of the total tissue sample will reflect the expression levels in the infiltrating cells. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies used for Cruz). Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were cut into 4- \u00b5m sections, quenched for endogenous peroxidase with 0.3% hydrogen and ephrin-A4, for 15 minutes in a microwave for antigen retrieval. The sections were incubated for 1 hour with the primary antibody and 30 minutes with horse-radish peroxidase-labeled secondary and tertiairy antibodies (Dako). 3,3 -diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was used as substrate to visualize protein expression and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Results qRT-PCR results of 21 Ephrin family members in HL cell lines Of the eight tested EphA receptors, EphA3 was expressed in 6 of the 8 HL cell lines, EphA1 was expressed in 5 and EphA4 in 2 cell lines. EphA5 and EphA7 were only expressed in UHO-1. EphA2 and EphA6 were not expressed in any of the cell lines The Ephrin family of tyrosine receptor kinases in Hodgkin lymphoma 53 (Fig. 1A). The EphA8 qRT-PCR showed no amplification product in the positive controls or in the samples. Analysis of the A-type ephrin ligands revealed ephrin-A4 expression in all 8 HL cell lines. Ephrin-A3 expression was observed in 7 of 8 HL cell lines and ephrin-A5 in 4 of 8 (Fig. 1B). Ephrin-A1 was weakly expressed in DEV and ephrin-A2 in SUPHD1. Of the 5 EphB receptors, EphB4 expression was found in 6 HL cell lines and EphB1 in 5. EphB2 was expressed only in L1236 and EphB3 was expressed only in UHO-1 (Fig. 1C). EphB6 was not expressed in the HL cell lines, but did show low expression levels in tonsil and testis. Analysis of the 3 B-type Ephrin ligands shows that ephrin-B1 was most commonly expressed (7/8 HL cell lines) (Fig. 1D). Ephrin-B2 was expressed in three cell lines and ephrin-B3 showed no expression in any of the eight cell lines, but did give weak positive results in the testis control sample. Immunohistochemistry on primary HL patients Based on the qRT-PCR data of the HL cell lines, we selected six Ephrin family members for validation by immunohistochemical staining in HL tissue samples. In Table 2 the staining results in the HRS cells have been summarized for all the patients of EphA1, EphA3, ephrin-A3, ephrin-A4 and ephrin-B1. EphB1 expression due to poor staining quality. The NLP patients showed a variable expression of the Ephrin family members tested with at least three Ephrin family members being expressed in LP cells of all five NLP patients. Representative examples are given in Figure 2. Ephrin-A4 was highly expressed in LP cells in all 5 NLP patients. Ephrin-B1 showed positive staining in LP cells in all 5 patients, but at somewhat lower intensities as compared to ephrin-A4. EphA3 expression was observed in 4 out of the 5 patients and EphA1 in 3 out of the 5 patients. Ephrin-A3 was not expressed in LP cells in NLP. HRS cells in cHL patients also showed expression of multiple family members, albeit less consistent than the NLP patients, i.e. none of the Ephrins being expressed in 2, one in 7 and more than 1 in 16 cHL cases (Table 2). In contrast to the NLP cases, EphA1 was not expressed in Chapter 3 54 any of the 25 cHL patients. Ephrin-A4 was expressed in HRS cells in 16 out of 25 cHL patients, EphA3 in 14 out of 25, ephrin-A3 in 11 out of 24 cHL patients and ephrin-B1 in 8 out of 14 patients. Representative examples are shown in Figure 2. In addition to the staining in the tumor cells, we also observed positive staining in the infiltrating cells for several of the selected Ephrin family members. EphA1 expression was observed in some of the small lymphocytes surrounding the LP cells in 4 of 5 NLP-HL patients (Figure 3A). The other staining showed a similar staining pattern in normal lymphoid tissue as well as in NLPHL and cHL tissue samples: EphA3 staining was in centroblasts (Figure 3B), cells and granulocytes and strongly positive staining of ephrin-B1 was observed in eosinophils (Figure 3C). Expression of the Ephrin family members in the infiltrating cells by qRT-PCR qRT-PCR analysis of whole tissue sections indicated expression of EphA1 and EphA3 in only one NLP patient, whereas the other EphA receptors were negative in all four patients. Ephrin-A4 and ephrin-A5 mRNA were detectable in two and three patients. EphB1 was detectable in the two cHL patients, EphB2 and EphB4 in three patients and the ephrin-B1 ligand was detectable in two patients (Figure 4). Discussion Deregulated expression patterns have been found for multiple members of the Ephrin family in various tumor types including hematopoietic malignancies. This prompted us to analyze the expression pattern of the Ephrin family in HL, in which cross talk with the microenvironment is crucial for tumor cell survival. We found expression of 17 Ephrin family members at the mRNA level in at least one of the HL cell lines. Staining of primary tissue samples of HL patients revealed marked differences for some of the Ephrin family members between NLP and cHL. Ephrin-A3 The Ephrin family of tyrosine receptor kinases in Hodgkin lymphoma 55 expression was exclusively seen in cHL tumor cells, while EphA1 was only expressed in tumor cells of NLP. In NLP we found expression of at least three Ephrin family members in each patient, while in cHL expression of at least family was observed in only 7 of 25 cases. For EphB1 we could not confirm the results of Renn\u00e9 et al38, who showed expression of the EphB1 in 12 out of 20 patients. Although our positive control lung carcinoma tissue did show a good positive staining for EphB1, we saw only very weak staining of EphB1 in HRS cells of cHL cases. The discrepancy for EphB1 could be due to differences in staining procedures and different antibodies. Our results for ephrin-B1 were consistent with the previous publication38. Renn\u00e9 et al38 proposed an autocrine signaling of EphB1 in HRS cells, since both the receptor and ligand are expressed in HRS cells. However, in general, HRS cells do not cluster together, which makes autocrine signaling unlikely. Potentially EphB1 can be activated by binding to one of its ligands, ephrin- B1, ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3, expressed on infiltrating cells. We indeed observed expression of ephrin-B1 in 2 of the 4 HL tissue samples by qRT-PCR and observed a positive staining in granulocytes, dendritic cells and centroblasts in cHL. So possibly there is an interaction between the EphB1 receptor expressed on HRS cells with infiltrating cells expressing ephrin-B1. Ephrin-B1 expressed by the tumor cells can react with B type Eph receptors expressed in the microenvironment. In cHL we found positive signals for EphB1, EphB2 and EphB4 at the mRNA level, so several potential candidates are present. These results provide an indication of possible interactions between receptors and ligands of tumor cells and infiltrating cells. We showed that ephrin-A4 is expressed on HRS cells and at similar levels on centroblasts. Ephrin-A4 is known to be expressed by normal B cells in blood and plays a role in transendothelial migration44. In CLL, ephrin-A4 is overexpressed and might impair migration across the endothelium44. EphA7 is expressed on germinal center B cells, but it is not expressed in the HL cell lines. EphA7 was also downregulated in follicular lymphoma and this was associated with DNA hypermethylation36, and it is also silenced in other germinal center B cell Chapter 3 56 derived lymphomas37. EphA7 acts as a tumor suppressor that inhibits signaling through EphA2 or EphA3 by dimerization of the truncated form of EphA7 with these receptors36. Although we did not check EphA7 expression in primary tumor cells in HL it seems likely that EphA7 acts as a tumor suppressor in HL based on the lack of mRNA. In freshly isolated normal B cells from PBMC, EphA4, ephrin-A4, EphB2 and EphB4 are expressed39. This suggests that they play a role in immune processes in which contact-dependent communication of Ephrin family members are critical for the development and differentiation of T cells45. This indicates that the Ephrin family can also play a role in interactions between activated B lymphocytes and other cell types in the microenvironment of HL. For example, a splice variant of a soluble ephrin-A4 is produced by mature B cells in the tonsil and by blood B cells and is thought to bind to EphA2 on dendritic cells46. Ephrin family members can also interact with other RTKs and proteins. EphA4 and ephrin-B1 can interact with FGFR family members47. For EphA4 it was shown in a human glioma cell line that binding of ephrin-A1 to EphA4 enhances signaling through FGFR and promotes cell proliferation48. For ephrin-B1 interactions with FGFR have been shown in Xenopus and Ciona, but not in human cells47. FGFR is expressed in HRS cells49 and can potentially interact with ephrin-B1 or EphA4 on the same cells. ADAM10, found on HRS cells50, can interact with EphA3, ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5. Co-expression to ephrin-A2 or ephrin-A5 ligands expressed on infiltrating cells, and induce cleavage of the ligand. This will disrupt cell-cell contact and induce endocytosis of the receptor-ligand complex51. Since EphA3 is present in HRS cells and ephrin-A5 is found in the microenvironment it would be interesting to see if ephrin-A5 is expressed on T cells rosetting the HRS cells. Because of the many possible interactions and bidirectional signaling, inhibition of the Ephrin family is complicated, especially when many receptors and ligands are present on the same cell or in the environment. Some small molecules and peptides are available52 that might be used for future studies to elucidate the function of these The Ephrin family of tyrosine receptor kinases in Hodgkin lymphoma 57 molecules in HL. In conclusion, we have found that the Ephrin family is widely expressed in the tumor cells of HL, while some family members, like EphA7 with tumor suppressor function, are lost. In addition, several family members appear to be expressed in the microenvironment of HL. Chapter 3 58 References: 1. Eph Nomenclature Committee.

Accumulating studies show differential expression in this heterogeneous group of cancers. Stimulation with TLR specific ligands, or agonists of their ligands, leads to aberrant responses in the malignant B-cells. According to current data, TLRs can be implicated in malignant transformation, tumor progression and immune evasion processes. Most of the studies focused on multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but in the last decade the putative role of TLRs in other types of B-cell lymphomas has gained much interest. The aim of this review is to discuss recent findings on the role of TLRs in normal B cell functioning and their role in the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies. Toll-like receptors in the B-cell malignancies 71 Introduction Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are essential receptors of the innate immune system and key regulators of the acquired immune system. Ten proteins (TLR1-10) have been identified in humans 1, 2, each of them with a particular subcellular localization depending on the specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) they recognize (Table 1). TLR2 forms functional heterodimers with TLR1 or TLR6. These heterodimers together with TLR4 and TLR5 are expressed on the cell membrane, whereas TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are located in endosomes. TLRs induce pro-inflammatory molecules but, they are also implicated in proliferation, survival, and tissue repair 3. TLRs are pattern recognition receptors structurally characterized by extracellular leucine rich repeats, transmembrane and intracellular Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains 1, 3. The extracellular domain interacts directly with PAMPs or DAMPs, triggering the downstream signaling through the TIR domain 1. In mammals, four different types of signaling adaptor proteins can be recruited by the TIR domain: Myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88), adaptor molecule and TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) (Figure 1). The MyD88 cascade and with TLR2 and TLR4. TRIF acts independently of MyD88 TLR4 activation. TRAM mediates TLR4 signaling in a MyD88-independent/TRIF-dependent way 1. The adaptor proteins serve as a scaffold for the recruitment of IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) 1, 2, 4 and M and TAB2 and TNF-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) which eventually leads to nuclear translocation of Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) 1, 3 (Figure 1). Other transcription factors that can be activated are activator protein 1 (AP-1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) 1. The contribution of TLRs to B-cell lymphoma pathogenesis has gained more interest in recent years 2, 4, but it is not completely understood. This review summarizes the Chapter 4 72 current knowledge on the expression of TLRs in normal B-cells and in B-cell malignancies and discusses how TLRs can contribute to onset and progression of these malignancies. Expression and function of TLRs in normal B-cells Although expression of TLRs in normal B-cells is interesting, what happens in B-cells when they are triggered or the role they play in B-cell maturation and differentiation is more important. TLR expression in B-cell subsets A number of studies investigated expression of TLRs in B-cell subsets isolated from peripheral blood Analysis memory subsets indicates that only TLR1, TLR7 and TLR9 are expressed at low levels in na\u00efve B-cells, while memory B-cells express high and Tonsillar B-cells than peripheral B-cells, but show higher TLR9 levels 7. Bone marrow plasma cells express TLR1, TLR8 and TLR9 in a small subset of healthy controls 8. Triggering of TLRs in B-cells Triggering of resting or na\u00efve B-cells through the B-cell receptor (BCR), CD40 or induces a quick upregulation of TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10 6, 9. Triggering of TLR9 on PBMC derived B-cells with CpG induces its downregulation and in addition leads to an upregulation of TLR7 5. Bernasconi 6hypothesized that low or null expression of TLRs in na\u00efve B-cells is a protective mechanism to avoid polyclonal activation. The high and diverse expression of TLRs in memory B-cells on the other hand, might facilitate continuous antibody production. Production of type I interferon (IFN) by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in Toll-like receptors in the pathogenesis of human B-cell malignancies 73 response to infections positively modulates the expression of TLR7 but not of other TLRs in na\u00efve B-cells 10. Triggering of TLR1/TLR2, TLR7 and in B-cells results in the B-cell activation markers, including HLA-DR, CD25, CD80 and CD86, as well as the production of several cytokines and chemokines 7,11 (Figure 2). Cytokine production levels were higher in memory B-cells as compared to na\u00efve B-cells, whereas chemokines are produced at similar levels 11. The role of TLRs in B-cell maturation and differentiation Several studies showed that TLRs are involved in the formation of germinal centers (GC) (Figure 2). Stimulation of TLR2+ human B-cells, a small subpopulation found in blood or spleen, causes a GC like differentiation with upregulation of CD77 and production of CXCL13, CXCL8 and IL-6 12. In TLR7 deficient mice no GC B-cells are formed after immunization with Friend Virus 13, whereas in IL-21Rko mice, GC formation is dependent on the presence of TLR7 ligands 14. Several studies demonstrate a crucial role of TLR triggering in the induction of class switch recombination (CSR). Stimulation of TLR4 with LPS can induce IgG2b CSR, while addition of IL-4 blocks this process 15. CpG stimulation of TLR9 in the presence of MYD88, induces CSR to IgG2a, required for CSR to IgG and IgA, in addition to BCR ligation and T-cell help 17. T-cell independent stimulation of TLR9 with CpG in combination with IL-10 treatment of na\u00efve B-cells enhances expression of activation induced deaminase (AID) and the subsequent CSR to IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 18. Upper respiratory mucosal can be stimulated with dsRNA via TLR3 and TRIF, to activate NF- B, induce expression of AID and CSR to IgG and IgA 19. BCR independent activation of murine resting B-cells via TLR2 and CD40 causes proliferation and differentiation to marginal zone precursor cells that have upregulated AID expression 20. Somatically mutated memory B-cells can be generated from immature transitional Chapter 4 74 B-cells upon CpG treatment. Most of the somatic hypermutations were observed in B cells containing VH1, VH4 and VH6 gene segments 21. This indicates that somatic hypermutation is dependent on or can be induced by TLR triggering. Differentiation to plasma cells and the production of antibodies are two processes in which TLRs also play an important role. Several immunization studies in mice show that TLRs are essential for the production of antibodies. T-cell dependent immunizations in MyD88 KO mice do not lead to the production of antibodies, while triggering of TLR4 during the immunization procedure of wild type mice induces a significant increase in antibody titers 22. Stimulation of TLR4 and TLR7 significantly enhanced antibody titers upon immunization 23. Immunization with CpG linked to the protein antigen enhances B-cell proliferation and plasma cell differentiation 24. For induction of an anti-viral response, MYD88 expression in B-cells was essential 13, 25. Na\u00efve B-cells stimulated by CpG start proliferating and differentiate to IgM producing plasma cells with increased surface expression of molecules involved in antigen presentation such as HLA-DR, CD40 and CD80. These cells indeed have an increased potential to activate allogeneic T-cells 26. Cord blood transitional B-cells express TLR9 and respond to CpG by expression of AID and BLIMP-1 and produce anti-pneumococcal antibodies as a first line defense at birth 27. CpG stimulation of TLR9 positive IgM memory B cells drives differentiation to plasma cells that produce IgM antibodies to Streptococcus pneumoniae 27. In summary, multiple studies show participation of TLRs in adaptive immunity, including modulation of the activation of B- and T-cells. In B-cells TLRs have been proposed to constitute the third essential signal for complete activation 17, along with BCR triggering and interaction with T-cells. Additionally, it has been shown that TLRs are involved in B-cell maturation by CSR, somatic hypermutation, induction and maintenance of GC and B-cell memory, differentiation to plasma cells and the production of antibodies. Considering the amount of evidence supporting TLR-MyD88 involvement in acquired immune responses mediated by B-cells, it is likely that they are involved in the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies. Toll-like receptors in the expression in B-cell malignancies B-cell malignancies are classified based on the resemblance of the tumor cells to specific maturation stages of normal B-cells, e.g. the normal counter part of follicular to germinal center B-cells, while multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy. in TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 have been reported to be expressed in MM derived cell lines. Of these TLR1, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 are expressed most commonly 8, 28. Analysis of tumor cells from sorted bone marrow mononuclear cells of MM patients showed high TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 mRNA levels and these findings were consistent with the high protein expression of TLR4 and TLR9 when analyzed by flowcytometry 29. Overall, the expression of TLR4 and TLR9 is consistently reported in MM cell lines or primary cells. Expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) TLR1, while the other TLRs were low or negative 30-32. Expression in other B-cell malignancies For other B-cell lymphoma types, studies on TLR expression are limited. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines, TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR6 and TLR7 are expressed albeit at variable levels 33. In bone marrow of ALL patients with >90% blasts TLR2 mRNA can be detected in the majority of the samples 33. BL cell lines express TLR7 and TLR9 34. Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma show strong expression of TLR4 and weak expression of TLR5 35. In mantle cell Chapter 4 76 lymphoma TLR4, TLR3, TLR5 and TLR8 are negative 36. A significant expression of TLR2 and TLR8 at both the protein and mRNA level was found in DLBCL 37. In comparison to reactive lymph node, TLR2 levels were high in in DLBCL, FL and peripheral T cell lymphoma 37. Polymorphisms in TLRs have been shown to increase the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma 38, as well as in Hodgkin lymphoma 39-41. Thus, it is evident that B-cell malignancies display a wide range of TLR expression patterns. Nevertheless, it remains to be elucidated if their expression resembles a normal B-cell phenotype or if it is a consequence of the malignant transformation. Potential role of TLRs in B-cell malignancies The survival and proliferative mechanisms used by malignant cells usually includes aberrant activation of signaling and regulatory pathways that are also used in their normal counterparts. Three possible pathogenic mechanisms can be anticipated for the TLRs which will be discussed below (Figure 3). Role of TLRs in the transformation of normal B-cells into malignant B-cells One of the main indications that TLR are involved in the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies comes from studies focusing on its adaptor protein MyD88. Knockdown of MyD88 in activated B cell type (ABC) DLBCL cell lines causes a marked decrease in proliferation, this effect was shown to be dependent on the presence of oncogenic mutations 42. Specific oncogenic mutations in the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain of MyD88 are found in 91% of lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas 43, 29% ABC lymphomas 5.6% CLL cases Toll-like in of human B-cell malignancies 77 NF-B is constitutively activated in various lymphoma subtypes and presents an important pathway to evade cell death. This is demonstrated by the frequent occurrence of somatic mutations in NF- B related genes in mature B-cell lymphomas 46. As NF- B can be activated via triggering of the TLRs, this might provide a potential mechanism to avoid apoptosis and increase their proliferation rates. Consistent with this, triggering of TLR4 and TLR9 in MM resulted in nuclear translocation of NF-kB and enhanced cell growth and IL-6 production 29. In a similar way, ligation of TLR1/2 and TLR6/2 increased tumor cell survival in CLL by triggering NF- B signaling 32. Several B-cell lymphomas have been associated with viral or bacterial infections 47-50. This led to the speculation that acute and sustained infections trigger malignant B-cell transformation via activation and induction of a prolonged proliferative state, favoring accumulation of genetic aberrations. The strongest evidence supporting this hypothesis is the regression and prolonged remission of gastric MALT lymphoma after treatment of Helicobacter (H.) pylori infections 51-53. Interestingly, there is a correlation between infection and TLR expression pattern reported for specific lymphoma subtypes. MALT lymphomas express TLR4 35 which recognizes LPS derived from Gram-negative bacteria like H. pylori 48. BL and DLBCL express TLR7, TLR8 and/or TLR9 34, 37, which mainly recognize single-stranded RNA or unmethylated CpG motifs from viruses. These lymphoma subtypes, although for DLBCL in only a small subpopulation of patients, have been associated with viruses like Epstein-Barr, Human immunodeficiency virus and HCV 47, 49, 50. As TLRs have been shown to affect somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination15,18,19,21,27. It can be speculated that TLR triggering also facilitates non-Ig somatic aberrations that leads or contributes to the malignant transformation of germinal center B-cells. In summary, the above mentioned studies provide evidence, although still mostly speculative and future analyses are required, for a possible role of TLRs in the malignant transformation via continuous TLR triggering following chronic infections or via induction of a cellular conditions that is prone to somatic mutations or DNA breaks. Chapter 4 78 TLRs in proliferation of malignant B-cells and lymphoma progression Several studies showed induction of proliferation of malignant B-cells upon TLR triggering. Stimulation of TLR9 by CpG in 31 B-cell lymphoma samples strongly induced proliferation in CLL, revealed intermediate effects in MZL, CLL/SLL, FL and DLBCL and no effect in MCL and ALL 30, 33. ALL cells also did not response to stimulation of TLR2 and TLR7 33. TLR4 triggering in MCL did show enhanced proliferation 36. In CLL, stimulation of TLR9 revealed more proliferation in unmutated compared to mutated IgH cases. Mutated cases showed a G1/S cell cycle arrest and increased number of apoptotic cells 54. In 8, 28. Activation of TLR7 and TLR9 protected MM cells from serum-deprivation or dexamethasone induced apoptosis 28. One of the main contributors to the enhanced proliferation is probably achieved via the induction of NF- B, which also protects the cells from apoptosis (see above). Together, these findings indicate that aberrant TLR activation in B-cell lymphoma may contribute to their proliferative potential and protect cells from apoptosis. TLRs in immune modulation TLRs have been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancy as modulators of the immune system. Putative mechanisms involve modulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and costimulatory molecules, induction of regulatory cells and alteration of T-cell function. Triggering of TLR7 and/or TLR9 enhanced expression of co-stimulatory molecules, cytokines and/or chemokines in BL, CLL and ALL 30,31,34,55,56. This indicates that the tumor cells become more immunogenic. Indeed, activation of TLR7 increases the sensitivity of CLL cells to cytotoxic T-cells 31, 57. LPS pre-treated primary MCL cells are able to resist killing by allogeneic cytotoxic T-cells by producing IL-10 and VEGF 36. Triggering of ALL cells with the TLR9-ligand, failed to promote T-cell proliferation by Toll-like receptors in the pathogenesis of human B-cell malignancies 79 primary ALL cells, but turned the T-cell cytokine profile towards Th1 by upregulating IFN- production of T-cells 57. TLR2-stimulated ALL cell lines also enhanced expression of co-stimulatory markers and IFN- , but failed to induce T-cell proliferation33. In the normal B-cell response, enhancement of IL-6, IL-10, or IFN- in response to TLR stimulation has been correlated to immunosuppressive functions. IL-10 induces IL-10 producing T regulatory (Treg) cells59. Patients with MM or such as FL, DLBCL and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, frequently have high numbers of Treg cells in the microenvironment 60, 61. In addition, the in vivo and in vitro generation of Treg cells by B-cells was recently reported to be MyD88-dependent indicating another link with TLR stimulation59. Overall, there is clear evidence that supports a putative role of the TLRs in the modulation of the immune response and microenvironment in B-cell malignancies. The presence and activation of TLRs induces different mechanisms depending on the lymphoma subtype, the stimulated TLR and the microenvironment. TLR stimulation can favor proliferation of malignant B-cells by facilitating immune evasion through Treg induction and production of immunosuppressive cytokines. In contrast, in some situations, TLRs can stimulate resolution of the tumor by encouraging a cellular-mediated immune response. Therapeutic perspectives A main question to be addressed is: what are the effects of TLR agonists in vivo ? In a mouse model for ALL, treatment with CpG oligonucleotides gave long term protection from ALL, by inducing a Th1 response62, 63. Topical administration of Imiquimod, the ligand for TLR7, resolves skin manifestations in CLL patients and increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules on leukemic tumor cells64. A phase I study of TLR9 stimulation combined with rituximab in non-Hodgkin lymphoma showed no toxicity, induction of interferon and interferon inducible genes and an overall response rate of 32% (6/19) 65. The phase II follow up study in relapsed and refractory FL Chapter 4 80 patients, revealed enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in 11/23 patients,and 74% of patients were alive without progressive disease at day 9066. At least six clinical trials evaluating agonists for TLR3 (1 Trial), TLR7/8 (2 Trials) and TLR9 (3 Trials) in B non-Hodgkin lymphomas were in progress at January of 200867. Most of these have been terminated for different reasons, or the results have not been published yet. A phase I/II trial in CLL with a TLR7 agonist showed that part of the patients could be sensitized for vincristine68, as had also been shown in vitro69. Notably, the effectiveness of several TLR agonists has been reported to be low in Phase III studies, so the number of research groups following this direction has decreased 67. Conclusions TLRs have been suggested as promoters of malignant transformation, tumor cell maintenance and progression in B-cell malignancies. The TLR expression patterns are not completely known yet for each B-cell malignancy and could be normal for the B-cell phenotype or a consequence of transformation. TLR stimulation induced different effects in B-cell malignancies due to specific aberrations in the tumor cells or by differences in the tumor microenvironment. Despite these uncertainties, it is very likely that TLRs participate in the development and survival of malignant B cells. There is a strong correlation between chronic infections and the development of some specific types of B-cell lymphoma. In these subtypes, it is likely that TLRs are directly involved in malignant transformation. In other B-cell malignancies, such as MM and CLL, TLRs appear to participate in immune evasion and tumor progression. It is evident that extreme precaution should be taken when considering the use of TLR agonists as (adjuvant) therapy in B-cell malignancies, because these agonists may have tumor-promoting properties.

Toll-like receptors in the pathogenesis of human B-cell malignancies 87 Figure 1 . Signaling pathway of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). After recognition of the ligand by the extracellular domain of TLRs, adaptor proteins are recruited to the TIR domain and initiate intracellular signaling. Four types of adaptor proteins have been identified in mammals: MyD88, TRIF, TRAM, and TIRAP . The recruitment of IRAK and TRAF6 to the adaptor proteins leads to nuclear translocation of NF-kB. TRAF6 can also activate MAPK kinases (MKK) leading to the activation of transcription factor AP-1. This pathway is common to all the TLRs, except for TLR3 which uses TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and results in the activation of IRF3. Chapter 4 88 Figure 2. The role of TLRs in B-cell activation and differentiation. TLR ligation constitutes one of the three activation signals of na\u00efve-B cells next to BCR triggering and T-cell interaction through CD40. The latter two signals upregulate the expression of TLRs, which subsequently interact with their respective ligands to activate na\u00efve B-cells completely. Activation through TLRs enhances expression of membrane molecules and the production of cytokines and chemokines. It also induces proliferation, somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination. After their first encounter with the ligand and the subsequent maturation, germinal center cells can differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells or memory B cells. TLR signaling has been proven to increase antibody secretion and participates in the maintenance of serological memory. Toll-like receptors in the pathogenesis of human B-cell malignancies 89 Figure 3. Possible roles of TLRs in the pathogenesis of human B-cell lymphomas. There are three possible mechanisms by which TLRs favor the pathogenesis of B cell malignancies. First, they can indirectly induce B-cell transformation by increasing the probability of mutations and double stranded DNA breaks after activation of naive B-cells or by favoring a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that increases the chance of mutations. Secondly, TLRs can support the malignant clone by increasing proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis through the specific activation of NF- B. Finally, malignant B-cells can modulate the immune response through stimulation of TLRs in two ways possibly depending on the cell type: The-pro tumor response favoring the increase of suppressor cells (like Tregs), and the decrease of a cytotoxic response (by downregulating Th1, Th17 and CTL) or an anti-tumor response by and increasing the sensitivity to CTLs and upregulating Th1.

Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands. In preparation Chapter 5 92 Abstract Constitutive activation of NF- B is one of the hallmarks of the Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by microbial pathogen associated ligands results in the activation of NF- B and genetic polymorphisms in TLRs are associated with cHL susceptibility. In this study, we determined expression of TLR1 to TLR10 in 8 cHL cell lines at the mRNA level and of TLR2, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 in cHL patient TLR1, TLR2, TLR6, TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10 mRNA was detected at different levels in all cell lines, with the most abundant expression levels observed for TLR10. TLR2 protein was undetectable in the HRS cells in eight cHL frozen tissue sections. TLR4 stained positive in the majority of the HRS cells in 9 of 19 cHL cases and in a minority of the HRS cells in two cHL cases. TLR7 was expressed in some HRS cells in four cHL cases. TLR9 stained positive in the majority of HRS cells in 9 cHL cases and in some HRS cells in three cases. Upon TLR7 triggering, cell growth analysis showed a slightly enhanced proliferation in L1236 cells and a more pronounced induction of proliferation in KMH2 cells. Triggering of TLR9 showed a slight suppression of cell growth in L428 and U-HO1. These results show that TLRs are expressed in a proportion of the cHL cases and that triggering of at least some of the TLRs affects proliferation of HL cell lines. Based on these findings we can speculate that TLRs and microbial pathogens may be involved in the pathogenesis of cHL. Expression of Toll like Receptors in classical Hodgkin Lymphoma 93 Introduction Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is characterized by a minority of neoplastic cells, the Hodgkin and Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells, which are surrounded by an extensive infiltrate of reactive cells. The HRS cells are derived from pre-apoptotic germinal center (GC) B-cells that acquired crippling immunoglobulin gene mutations and/or lost their capacity to express a high affinity B-cell receptor (BCR)1. Constitutive activation of nuclear factor (NF-) B is one of the hall marks of HL and it contributes to the survival of the HRS cells. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane proteins that trigger innate immunity by recognition of conserved structures of microbial pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), like LPS and single stranded (ss)RNA. Stimulation of TLR results in activation of myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88) and subsequent activation of NF- B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). TLRs and MYD88 gene polymorphisms have been implicated in cHL susceptibility by altering immunoregulatory and inflammatory responses2. Together this indicates that triggering of TLRs might contribute to the activation of NF- B in HRS cells. Normal blood derived human B cells are characterized by high expression of TLR1, TLR6, TLR7, TLR9, and TLR10, low expression and no expression of TLR3, TLR5 and TLR83. The expression of TLRs in the B-cell derived HRS cells of cHL has not been systematically investigated. Here we report that HRS cells in cHL show a distinct TLR expression prole, which includes in particular high levels of TLR4, TLR9 and TLR10. In addition, we show that ligation of TLR7 and TLR9 in cHL cell lines affects cell growth. Materials and methods Cell lines and patient samples The cHL cell lines L428, KMH2, L1236, L591, U-HO1, L540 and DEV were cultured Chapter 5 94 RPMI-1640 medium and SUPHD1 in McCoy's medium (Lonza Walkersville). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from three healthy donors by Ficoll-Isopaque density gradient centrifugation. Eight frozen and 19 formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples of cHL patients were obtained from the files of the department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University Medical Centre Groningen, the Netherlands. The frozen cHL samples were of the nodular sclerosis (NS) subtype. The paraffin embedded samples consisted of 15 NS, two mixed cellularity (MC), one lymphocyte rich (LR) and one classical, not otherwise specified (NOS) subtype. RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to determine the expression of TLR1 to TLR10 in 8 HL cell lines. qRT-PCR was performed with SYBR Green Mastermix (Life Technologies, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands) and samples were assayed in triplicate. Primers for human TLRs have been designed using Primer Express 2.0 Software (Table 1). RPII was selected as a housekeeping gene for normalization of the data. The relative gene expression levels were quantified by calculating the difference in threshold cycle (Ct) value of the TLRs from the Ct value of RPII ( Ct). Results were expressed as 2Ct to indicate the relative mRNA level in each cell subset. Only Ct values below 35 were considered positive. PBMCs were used as positive controls for the expression of TLRs3 . Immunohistochemistry Antibodies suitable for immunostaining of the TLRs only for TLR2 (frozen), TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 (paraffin embedded). monoclonal antibody against TLR2 (CD282, Hycult Biotechnology, Expression of Toll like Receptors in classical Hodgkin Lymphoma 95 Uden, The Netherlands) (1:50) on frozen cHL tissue sections, and polyclonal antibodies against TLR4 (Abcam, Cambridge, Herford, embedded sections. Positive staining was visualized using an HRP-labeled second step and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) for frozen cHL tissue sections and cytospins, and 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) for paraffin embedded cHL tissue sections. Cases were defined as positive when more than 50% of the HRS cells showed a clear staining. Proliferation assay cHL cell lines (1 X 106 cells/ml) were cultured with R837 (TLR7 blue (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) was added to the cells following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Fluorescence was measured every 24 hours at 560/590 nm. Results Toll-like receptor expression in Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines We analysed the mRNA expression levels of TLR1 to TLR10 in HL TLR2, TLR6, TLR7, and TLR10 mRNA transcripts were detected at variable levels in all cell lines. Overall, TLR1 levels were high in two, TLR6 in four, TLR7 in one HL cell lines. TLR10 was expressed at marked levels in all cell lines. For the remaining TLRs expression was in general low and expression was observed in part of the cell lines. TLR3 was expressed in 4 out of 8 cell lines, TLR4 in three, TLR5 in two and TLR9 in six of the HL cell lines with a high expression in U-HO1. No mRNA expression of TLR8 was detected in any of the HL cell line. Thus, TLRs are expressed in HL cell lines albeit at variable levels. Chapter 5 96 TLR protein expression in HL tissue samples TLR2 was undetectable in the HRS cells of eight cHL frozen tissue sections. Dendritic cells present in the reactive infiltrate showed a strong staining for TLR2 in all cHL cases. For TLR4, positive staining was observed in the majority of the HRS cells in nine out of 19 cHL cases and in a minority of the HRS cells (i.e. in 5% and 30%) in two cases (Table 3). TLR7 expression was observed in 5-20% of the HRS cells in four cHL cases. TLR9 stained positive in more than 50% of the HRS cells in nine out of the 19 cHL cases and in approximately 10% of the HRS cells in 3 cases. TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 stained positive in (part of) the reactive background cells in all cHL cases. Representative staining results of TLR2, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 are shown in Figure 1. Although the number of cases used in this study is low, there appears to be no difference between EBV+ and EBV- cHL cases. Functional effects of TLR ligation in cHL cell lines Cell growth analysis after three days of TLR ligation in cHL cell lines revealed a slightly enhanced proliferation in L1236 and a more pronounced induction of proliferation in KMH2 upon TLR7 activation (Figure 2A). Triggering of TLR9 showed a slight suppression of cell growth in L428 and U-HO1 (Figure 2B). Discussion Constitutive activation of NF- B is one of the hallmarks of HL. This activation is at least in part explained by mutations or gene amplification of members of the NF- B pathway1 or presence of EBV. Since ligation of TLRs also induces activation of the NF-B pathway we studied expression of TLRs in HL cell lines and primary tissue, and tested the effect of TLR ligation in some of the cell lines. We showed expression of TLR1, TLR2, TLR6, TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10 at variable levels in 8 HL cell lines. Although naive B cell have low expression of TLRs, B cell receptor stimulation induces expression of TLR6, TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10 4. Expression of Toll like Receptors in classical Hodgkin Lymphoma 97 Moreover, TLR 9 and TLR10 are upregulated as B cells differentiate to mature B cells 5. This indicates that expression of TLR6, TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10 might be expected in HRS cells as these cells are derived from activated germinal center B cells. Expression of TLR1 and TLR2 as observed at low levels in all HL cell lines, is unusual for B cells and might be related to the malignant transformation process. Of the four TLRs that could be tested by immunostaining in HL tissue samples, expression in HRS cells was observed for TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 and not for TLR2. TLR4 expression has been observed in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, but not in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)6. Although TLR4 was low/absent in the cell lines, TLR4 was detected in more than 50% of the HRS cells in approximately half of the cHL cases. In GCB cells, a low expression of TLR4 has been observed. These findings might indicate that HRS cells have acquired expression of TLR4 during the malignant transformation process. The fact that only a few cell lines express very low TLR4 levels might be explained by the lack of interactions with the microenvironment. Besides LPS, also some endogenous ligands that are released in the context of tissue damage, cellular stress, or cell death are thought to bind to TLR4 7. HSP60, one of the endogenous ligands for TLR4 is abundantly expressed in HRS cells 8 and this may result in activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway. TLR7 expression is found in B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia, CLL and multiple myeloma (MM)7. Unlike the high expression of TLR7 in GCB cells3, TLR7 was only detected in a low percentage (5-20%) of HRS cells in a minority of the cHL patients. TLR7 was present in 7 out of 8 HL cell lines albeit at low levels, which is consistent with the low percentage of positive HRS cells in a minority of the cases. For TLR7+ HRS cells stimulation of TLR7 might be advantageous, since triggering of TLR7 caused increased proliferation in cHL cell lines. The downregulation of TLR7 in HRS cells may be associated with immune suppression in cHL, since stimulation of TLR7 can both activate the T cells in the background and increase the immunogenicity of the tumor cells, resulting in an effective antitumor immunity9. TLR9 expression was detected in CLL, MCL, follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B cell Chapter 5 98 lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and MM 7. In cHL, expression of TLR9 was observed in more than 50% of the HRS cells in half of the cHL cases. In contrast, the mRNA expression levels of TLR9 were very low in seven cell lines and high for U-HO1. In normal B cells, expression of TLR9 was found especially on memory and GCB cells. Viral and bacterial derived unmethylated CpG DNA ligates with TLR9 and initiates production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Three out of five EBV+ cases showed positive staining for TLR9, which was quite similar to the proportion of TLR9 positive cases in the EBV- group (9 out of 14). Ligation of TLR9 had a negative effect on cell growth in the cHL cell lines, which appears contradictory with the relatively high number of HL cases that do show expression of TLR9. However, TLR9 triggering of B cells can increase the production of IL-10 which will have a suppressive effect on the microenvironment, by suppressing Th1 and Th17 cells10 . So it is possible that TLR9 expression is advantageous for the HRS cells. In summary, we show variable mRNA expression of multiple TLRs in HL cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining of primary tissues showed that TLR4 and TLR9 are expressed by HRS cells in cHL, whereas TLR7 is only occasionally expressed and TLR2 is not expressed. The responsiveness to ligation of TLR7 and TLR9 is limited with only a slight effect on cell growth in cHL cell lines.

CHAPTER 6 Aberrant HLA expression as an immune escape in Epstein Barr Virus associated classical Hodgkin Lymphoma and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma Zheng Liang1, Xishan Hao2, Arjan 1department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University of Groningen and University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands. 2Laboratory of Cancer Cell Biology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China. In preparation Chapter 6 104 Abstract Epstein Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated in the development of different kinds of cancer. To achieve full oncogenic potential, EBV positive tumor cells need to escape from immune responses. To test some possibly involved immune escape mechanisms we evaluated the expression of HLA class I, CLIP, HLA-DM and HLA-DO in 20 HLA class II positive preselected classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) patients. In addition, we evaluated the expression of HLA class I, HLA class II, HLA-DM and HLA-DO in 11 undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients by immunohistochemistry. Loss of HLA class I expression was observed in 55% of cHL patients (11/20). Aberrant membranous CLIP staining in tumor cells was observed in 40% (8/20) of the HLA class II positive cHL patients and this was highly correlated with lack of HLA-DM. Expression of HLA-DO was not related to membranous CLIP or HLA-DM expression. In NPC, HLA class I expression was lost in 2 out of 11 patients and HLA class II was expressed in 6 cases and heterogeneous in 5 patients. The expression pattern of HLA-DM and HLA-DO was similar, with a positive staining in 9 patients and a mixed pattern in two patients. In conclusion, in cHL presentation of antigenic peptides can be disturbed by downregulation of HLA class II expression or the presence of CLIP on the tumor cell surface. In NPC, HLA class I is down regulated in a few cases and partial downregulation of HLA class II expression is found more often. HLA-DM and DO are both expressed, with the latter being a novel finding for NPC. Aberrant HLA expression as an immune escape in Epstein Barr Virus associated classical Hodgkin lymphoma and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma 105 Introduction EBV infects more than 90% of the world's population and remains present as a lifelong infection1. In the acute phase, EBV primarily infects and replicates in the epithelium of the oropharynx and then establishes a latent infection in the B lymphocytes2. After the first infection most people carry EBV without serious consequences. However, in some individuals, EBV has been implicated in the development of cancer. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is an EBV associated cancer. In Caucasians EBV is present in the tumor cells in 35% of cHL patients. Presence of EBV is detected more often in males, young children, older adults, Hispanics, the mixed cellularity subtype and patients from developing countries3-5. Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is unique among head-and-neck epithelial cancers and is another type of EBV associated cancer. Virtually all undifferentiated NPC cases are EBV positive. This malignancy is common in specific geographical regions including southern China, southeast Asia, the Arctic, and North Africa6. Both cHL and NPC are EBV latency type 2 tumors expressing a restricted set of EBV proteins, consisting of EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), latent membrane protein (LMP) 1 and LMP27. Antigenic peptides derived from these proteins can be presented on the cell surface and cause HLA class I-restricted CTL responses and HLA class II-restricted CD4+ T-cell responses. To reach it's full oncogenic potential, EBV infected tumor cells need to escape from EBV specific anti-tumor immune responses. Therefore, down regulation of HLA class I and HLA class II expression might be implicated in the pathogenesis of EBV associated cancer. HLA class I molecules are expressed on all nucleated cells. HLA class II molecules are expressed on professional antigen presenting cells like dendritic cells and B cells and can be induced in epithelium and endothelium in inflammatory contexts. The tumor cells in cHL, the Hodgkin Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells, derive from antigen presenting B cells that express HLA class II naturally. The NPC tumor cells originate Chapter 6 106 from epithelial cells that are supposed to aberrantly express HLA class II8, since HLA class II is a co-receptor for EBV infection9. HLA class II molecules are synthesized with an invariant chain occupying the peptide binding groove. Part of these invariant chain bound HLA class II complexes are transported directly to the membrane, the rest is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi to the HLA class II compartment10, 11. In the HLA class II compartment, cathepsin S cleaves most of the invariant chain, leaving CLIP bound to the HLA class II peptide binding groove to prevent premature loading of antigenic peptides12-14. In lysosomes and endosomes CLIP can be released by HLA-DM, a member of the non-classical HLA class II molecules. Another member of the non-classical HLA class II molecules, HLA-DO, is mainly expressed in B cells and can suppress the activity of HLA-DM15, can act as a competitive inhibitor16, or plays a role in optimization of epitope selection17. To what extent antigen presentation in cHL and NPC is affected by expression differences in HLA is not known. To address this question, we evaluated HLA class I, HLA class II, HLA-DM, HLA-DO and CLIP expression in cHL patients from the Netherlands and NPC patients from China by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Materials and methods Patient and tissue samples Primary cHL tissues were retrieved from the Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands (n=24). Primary NPC tissue biopsies were retrieved from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital, China (n=11). The study protocol was consistent with international ethical guidelines (the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice). We selected primary diagnostic cHL tissue with available formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) and frozen tissue samples from our prior HLA class II prognostic study18. Twenty patients with HLA class II positive HRS cells were chosen. As a control we also analyzed 4 HLA class II negative cHL cases. The 11 primary Aberrant HLA expression as an immune escape in Epstein Barr Virus associated classical Hodgkin lymphoma and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma 107 NPC tissues were diagnosed as undifferentiated NPC (type III) according to the WHO classification. In situ hybridization Detection of EBV in tumor cells of cHL and NPC was performed by in situ hybridization (ISH) on paraffin sections with a biotin-conjugated peptide nucleic probe specific for the EBV-encoded EBER RNAs (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), using standard laboratory protocols. Appropriate positive and negative controls were included. Immunohistochemistry FFPE tissue specimens were cut into 4- \u00b5m sections, mounted onto polylysine-coated slides, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in a graded ethanol series. The sections were quenched for endogenous peroxidase with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide, and then boiled in EDTA (1mmol/L; pH 8.0) for 15 minutes in a microwave oven for antigen retrieval. The sections were incubated for 1 hour with the primary antibody HC10 (HLA class I, 1:200, kind gift of J. horse-radish peroxidase-labeled secondary and tertiairy antibodies (Dako). 3,3-diaminobenzidine (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was used as substrate and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. As negative controls, tissue sections were processed under the same experimental conditions without primary antibody. CLIP staining was performed on frozen tissue of cHL patients using standard protocols with CerCLIP (1:200, BD Biosciences) and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma) as a substrate. For HLA class I and II membranous staining was considered as positive (normal) and any other staining as negative (aberrant). HLA-DM and HLA-DO were evaluated for cytoplasmic staining. Positivity in more than 50% of the tumor cells in HL was considered positive and 20-50% partial positive. In NPC, areas Chapter 6 108 with different patterns were scored separately. CLIP staining was scored as cytoplasmic (normal), while membranous staining indicated aberrant expression which prevents presentation of antigenic peptides. Results In the cHL patient group we detected 10 EBV+ patients, 13 HLA class I and 12 2M+ patients (Table 1). In 8 out of 20 HLA class II+ patients we observed a membranous CLIP staining pattern (Figure 1B). CLIP expression was consistent with lack of HLA-DM indicating that the HLA class II molecules do not present antigenic peptides. In some patients all HRS cells were CLIP+/HLA-DM-, suggesting a definite loss of HLA-DM. In other patients there was a spectrum of CLIP+/HLA-DM- to CLIP-/HLA-DM+ HRS cells. Expression of HLA-DO, the repressor of HLA-DM functionality, was weak in all cases and not related to CLIP or HLA-DM results (Figure 1). Of 20 patients with HLA class II expression 9 (45%) patients co-expressed membranous HLA class I and 11 patients (55%) were HLA class I negative. The four HLA class II negative cases were all positive for HLA class I. All 11 NPC cases were EBV positive (Table 2). The tumor cells were negative for HLA class I in 2 out of 11 patients, the other 9 patients showed membranous expression of both HLA class I and 2M. HLA class II was positive in all patients although in some patients the staining pattern was heterogeneous. In 4 patients areas of tumor cells without HLA class II expression were also seen and in 1 patient an incomplete downregulation of HLA class II expression was seen in some areas. The expression of HLA class II correlated with expression of HLA-DM and HLA-DO. Figure 2 shows a representative case of NPC. Overall, HLA-DM and HLA-DO staining intensity in NPC was stronger than in cHL. Since no frozen NPC material was available, CLIP staining to determine functionality of HLA class II could not be performed. Aberrant HLA expression as an immune escape in Epstein Barr Virus associated classical Hodgkin lymphoma and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma 109 Discussion In human neoplasms, downregulation of HLA class I and II molecules constitutes an important immune escape mechanism18. Cytotoxic antiviral and antitumor immune responses depend on the surface expression of HLA class I on the tumor cells. HLA class II-restricted peptides activate CD4+ T-cells to generate immune memory and facilitate activation of CD8+ T-cells. In cHL, infiltration by T cells is a well known feature. In EBV+ cHL more CD8+ cells and natural killer cells are seen than in EBV- cHL19. Virus specific T cell immunity is similar in EBV+ and EBV- cHL, and comparable to that of healthy EBV carriers20. Down regulation of HLA class I and II has been studied before21-24 and our results are consistent with these findings. We have previously reported that HRS cells lack HLA class I and class II expression in ~40% of the cHL patients. The cHL patients we used in this study are a selected group of HLA class II positive patients to assess the relation between the expressed HLA class II and other non-classical HLA class II molecules. We found membranous CLIP expression in 40% of the HLA class II positive patients and membranous CLIP expression was highly correlated with lack of HLA-DM and vice versa. These findings are consistent with a previous study that showed CLIP in a proportion of the HLA class II molecules on HRS cells 25. Loss of HLA class II is associated with an adverse failure free survival21. Within the favorable prognosis group of HLA class II positive cHL cases, it is possible that CLIP expression could determine a subset of patients with a worse prognosis, since in these cases HLA class II is also not functional. Studies in AML showed that CLIP expression by leukemic blasts is associated with poor patient prognosis26. A large cHL patient cohort needs to be studied to verify these findings. In cHL cases the expression of HLA-DO was not related to membranous CLIP or HLA-DM results, indicating that HLA-DO does not interfere with the function of HLA-DM in cHL. Despite abundant infiltrating CD4 and CD8 positive T cells in the stroma of NPC27, the immune responses in NPC patients seem be dampened in general and virus specific Chapter 6 110 T cell immunity reduced28, although NPC cells can effectively process EBV-derived epitopes29. The cases we studied show minimal infiltration by lymphocytes. We found HLA class I down-regulation in 2 out of 11 NPC patients. This is consistent with previous studies showing loss of HLA class I in 15-25% of the patients30, 31. This indicates that in NPC HLA class I down-regulation is present albeit in a low percentage of patients. Ogino et al suggested that the tumor cells in NPC may utilize dysfunction of HLA class I to escape from an effective anti-tumor immune reaction30. HLA class II has been shown to act as a co-receptor for EBV infection9 and in another study it was shown that specific EBV proteins may enhance the level of HLA class II expression32. NPC is characterized by an aberrant HLA class II expression8, 33. Down regulation of HLA class II has been shown in 37% and 33% of NPC patients31,34, in the first study there was down regulation of HLA class II in a substantial proportion of cells within the tumor mass31, while in the second study only positive or negative values were given without criteria34. Our results are heterogeneous with positive as well as negative areas in 4 of the patients, and partial downregulation in 1 patient. HLA class II downregulation, although heterogeneous, is found in a large percentage of patients, comparable to cHL. In NPC patients there is a correlation between expression of HLA class II and HLA-DM and HLA-DO, but expression of CLIP could not be analyzed. HLA-DO has only been reported in B cells, thymic medullary cells, trophoblasts and subpopulations of dendritic cells35, so expression in NPC is novel. It is possible that HLA-DO interferes with peptide loading by HLA-DM16, but cooperation of HLA-DO with HLA-DM in optimization of peptide loading is also possible17. These results are different from cHL. In conclusion, besides down regulation of HLA expression, there is a subset of HLA class II+ patients in cHL in which absence of HLA-DM prevents presentation of antigen. In NPC patients the presence of HLA-DO is novel, but the effect on the functionality of HLA class II is not known.

These reactive cells provide a microenvironment that supports survival and growth of HRS cells. HRS cells are derived from germinal center B cells that have lost their B cell phenotype including expression of the immunoglobulin genes1. Although normal germinal center B cells that lack functional immunoglobulin undergo apoptosis, HRS cells can escape this programmed cell death2, 3. Besides the constitutive activation of NF-B and the JAK/STAT signaling pathways which both are hallmarks of cHL, HRS cells also show aberrant activity of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are not normally expressed by B cells4. These factors all contribute to survival and proliferation of HRS cells. In this thesis, the expression and relevance of known and novel players in the pathogenesis of cHL were studied to explore novel survival mechanisms employed by HRS cells and novel anti-tumor escape mechanisms. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor is a prognostic factor in cHL The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a RTK that has been implicated in many malignancies and plays a crucial role in proliferation, transformation, apoptosis protection and chemotherapy-resistance5,6. In chapter 2, we evaluated the expression, prognostic significance and functionality of IGF-1R in cHL and studied the IGF-1R signaling pathway in cHL cell lines. Overall, IGF-1R was expressed in 55% of the cHL patients. The percentage of IGF-1R positivity was much higher in the nodular sclerosis subtype of cHL (38/61 cases) as compared to mixed-cellularity (1/9 cases). 5-years progression-free survival (PFS) was 93% in the IGF-1R positive patient group, which was significantly higher than the 5-years PFS in the IGF-1R negative patients (77%, p=0.047). We Summary, Discussion and Future perspectives 119 observed marked differences in IGF-1R levels in three cHL cell lines, with the highest levels observed for L428 cells. The levels of IGF-1 in cell culture supernatant of these three cell lines were similar. IGF-1 treatment had the most prominent effect on the proliferation of L428 cells. Thus L428 cells were most sensitive to IGF-1 treatment, consistent with its high IGF-1R expression level. After 72 hours of treatment with the IGF-1 inhibitor picropodophyllin (PPP), both the viability and proliferation decreased in all 3 cHL cell lines. The strongest effects were again observed for L428 cells. Treatment with PPP induced a marked increase in the G2/M cell population in all three cell lines, indicating an effective G2/M cell cycle arrest. Consistent with other cancer cell lines, we observed enhanced phosphorylation of IGF-1R, AKT and ERK1/2 levels upon stimulation with IGF-1. PPP treatment in L428 decreased IGF-1R phosphorylation and AKT phosphorylation, while ERK phosphorylation was upregulated. These findings are similar to the results previously reported in melanoma cell lines7. The proposed mechanism behind the enhanced ERK phosphorylation is that PPP induces ubiquitination of IGF-1R which in turn activates ERK1/27. PPP also decreased phosphorylation of CDC2 (Thr14/Tyr15) and induced cyclinB1 expression, which is consistent with the observed G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest. To explain the unexpected discrepancy between the enhanced survival in IGF-1R positive patients and the favorable effect of IGF-1 stimulation, additional functional studies are required. Previous studies revealed that low IGF-1R expression is associated with de-differentiation of various human cancers8-11. In some cancers, the p53 inhibiting oncogene MDM2 downregulates IGF-1R and is associated with a more malignant phenotype12. So, IGF-1R negative HRS cells might be more aggressive than IGF-1R positive HRS cells. Another explanation might be related to anti-tumor immune responses of the reactive cells. The IGF-1/IGF-1R pathway plays important roles in hematopoietic cell growth, differentiation and normal immune functioning13. Activated T cells have been shown to be more sensitive to IGF-1 and proliferate more after the addition of IGF-114. So, if increased IGF-1R expression in tumor cells indicates increased presence of IGF-1 in the microenvironment, this could imply stronger anti-tumor immune responses. Chapter 7 120 Expression patterns of the Ephrin family members in HL The Ephrin family is the largest RTK family and it is of increasing interest in cancer research in recent years. We investigated expression of the Ephrin family members in HL in chapter 3. At the mRNA level 17 of the 21 Ephrin family members were detectable in at least one of the eight HL cell lines. In total tissue samples of 2 cHL and 2 nodular lymphocyte predominant (NLP) HL cases several family members were found to be expressed, indicating that cells in the microenvironment also express Ephrin family members. We next analyzed five Ephrin family members (EphA1, EphA3, ephrin-A3, ephrin-A4 and ephrin-B1) by immunohistochemistry. A different expression pattern in primary tissue was observed between NLPHL and cHL. In NLPHL, EphA3, ephrin-A4 and ephrin-B1 were expressed in all cases, EphA1 in part of the cases while ephrin-A3 was not expressed. In cHL, EphA3, ephrin-A3, ephrin-A4 and ephrin-B1 were detected in a high percentage of cases, whereas EphA1 was negative in all cases. Overall, we showed that the Ephrin family is widely expressed in the tumor cells in HL, while some family members with tumor suppressor function, like EpHA7, are lost in the cell lines. This is similar to other germinal center derived lymphomas including follicular lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma and germinal center B cell like diffuse large B cell lymphoma15, since normal germinal center B cells express EphA7. Further support of a potential tumor suppressor role of EphA7 in follicular lymphomas are the occurrence of hemizygous 6q including the EphA7 gene locus on 6q19 and methylation of the promoter region caused loss of EphA7 expression15. In Sezary syndrome, a T cell leukemia, missense mutations have been found in EphA716. Besides expression in tumor cells, we found EphA3, ephrin-A4 and ephrin-B1 positive cells in the microenvironment of cHL, and EphA1 expression on the infiltrating lymphocytes surrounding the tumor cells in NLPHL. These results suggest that there is a potential role for the Ephrin family in HL pathogenesis. Summary, Discussion and Future perspectives 121 The role of Toll-like receptors in the pathogenesis of human B cell lymphomas Toll-like receptors (TLRs) initiate the first line of defense against microbial infection by recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns. They activate innate immunity and modulate adaptive immune responses. In chapter 4 we review recent findings on the role of TLRs in the pathogenesis of B cell lymphomas and discuss their involvement in malignant transformation, tumor progression and immune evasion processes. Long-term triggering of the TLRs may lead to somatic mutations by chronic activation of naive B cells or by induction of an inflammatory microenvironment that favors induction of mutations. Secondly, TLRs can favor survival of precursor cells by increasing proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis through activation of the NF- B pathway. Finally, malignant B cells can induce an immune suppressive microenvironment through stimulation of specific TLRs on reactive infiltrating cells. It has become clear that TLRs have a role in the transformation process of B cell lymphomas originating from marginal zone and follicular cells17,18. For other types of B cell lymphomas, as multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, TLRs probably participate in immune evasion and tumor progression19-22. The role of TLRs in normal B cells has indicated them as potential therapeutic targets. Agonists have been used as adjuvants or vaccines to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses in vivo23-27. In chapter 5, we analyzed the expression of TLRs in 8 cHL cell lines and primary cHL tissue samples. Expression of TLR1, TLR2, TLR6, TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10 was detected at the mRNA level in all cell lines, at variable levels. TLR4 and TLR9 were expressed in the tumor cells in a large proportion of the cHL cases. Ligation of TLR4 might be associated with damage associated molecular patterns such as HSP60, which is expressed in HL28, while ligation of TLR9 might be associated with the presence of Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Responsiveness of the cHL cell lines to TLR7 and TLR9 ligation was limited. Expression of TLRs in B cells and B cell malignancies, Chapter 7 122 including HL, has important functional roles in differentiation and pathogenesis. Immune escape strategies in Epstein Barr virus associated cHL and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma EBV has been implicated in the development of multiple cancer types, such as Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In cHL, EBV is present in the tumor cells of 30 to 60% of the cases and the frequency is dependent on race and geographical area29. In NPC, which has a high incidence especially in South East Asia, EBV is present in all cases30. In both cancer types, a latency type II infection pattern is observed, with expression of latent membrane protein (LMP)1, LMP2 and EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA)1. Despite the restricted set of EBV proteins expressed in both cancer types, escape from host anti-tumor immune responses is necessary for the tumor cells to survive. Tumor cells can use different immune escape mechanisms with loss of HLA class I and HLA class II expression being one of the most commonly applied mechanisms in the pathogenesis of EBV associated cancer. Another mechanism involves retention of the class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) in the antigen binding cleft of HLA class II preventing binding of other antigenic peptides. In the endosomes, HLA-DM promotes the dissociation of the CLIP peptide (a place-keeper peptide) from HLA class II, which allows antigenic peptides to bind. HLA-DO is a non-classical HLA protein that forms a stable complex with HLA-DM and inhibits HLA-DM function31-33. In chapter 6, we addressed the question which immune escape mechanisms are applied by the tumor cells of these two cancer subtypes. We studied expression of HLA class I, CLIP, HLA-DM and HLA-DO in a selection of HLA class II positive cHL patients. In NPC patients, we studied expression of HLA class I, HLA class II, HLA-DM and HLA-DO. About half of the HLA class II+ cHL cases stained positive for HLA class I. In a subset of the HLA class II+ cHL patients, absence of HLA-DM was associated with retention of CLIP in the HLA class II peptide-binding groove, preventing presentation of antigenic peptides derived from amongst others EBV. HLA-DO, which Summary, Discussion and Future perspectives 123 probably interferes with the function of HLA-DM, is normally only expressed in B cells. However, expression of HLA-DO was not related to the presence of CLIP or expression of HLA-DM in cHL. Retention of CLIP in HLA class II molecules provides an alternative mechanism to escape from an anti-tumor response. In NPC patients downregulation of HLA class I was found in 2 out of 11 cases and HLA class II expression was lost in part of the tumor cells in half of the cases. Levels of HLA-DM and HLA-DO correlated with each other as well as with HLA class II expression, suggesting that HLA-DO interferes with the function of HLA-DM. So, in HL absence of HLA-DM was associated with CLIP expression and HLA-DO did not seem to play a role. In contrast, in NPC HLA-DM and HLA-DO were both expressed, probably providing a different mechanism to block HLA class II function. Overall conclusion: New insights into tumor cell survival strategies and escape from anti-tumor immune responses Combination of data in these chapters shows involvement of some new players in survival of HRS cells and their escape from anti-tumor immune responses. In addition to known pathways that are aberrantly activated in HRS cells (see chapter 1), aberrant expression of IGF-1R, Ephrin family members and TLRs might provide additional signals leading to survival and growth of the tumor cells. Despite the oncogenic effect of IGF-1R in cell lines, IGF-1R expression in HRS cells predicts a favorable outcome. The wide expression of Ephrin family members both in the tumor cells and the microenvironment suggests that there is a role for the Ephrin family in HL. Similarly, the wide expression of TLRs in HRS cells also supports a role in HL pathogenesis, although the effect of TLR triggering on HL cell lines was limited. In terms of immune escape, potential mechanisms involve lack of functional antigen presentation and aberrant expression of TLRs. Mechanisms related to HLA include downregulation of HLA class I and II, and retention of CLIP in HLA class II molecules impairing antigen presentation in cHL. In NPC, HLA class I and II downregulation was observed in part of the cases. There was a strong correlation of HLA class II Chapter 7 124 expression with HLA-DO and HLA-DM expression, suggesting that HLA-DO interferes with HLA-DM function leading to expression of CLIP and impaired antigen presentation. Future perspectives A main drawback in functional HL studies is the lack of an appropriate mouse model. With the availability of newer immune deficient mice models such as Rag2/Jak3/ Balb/c mice34or NOD/SCID/gamma(null) (NOG) mice35 that are humanized easier36, it might become feasible to set up a good mouse model for HL. A good model should have HRS cells and a microenvironment that supports tumor cell growth and that can be modulated to alter anti-tumor immune responses. The first step to further explore the potential in vivo interaction loop of the IGF-1/IGF-1R pathway in HL is to stain HL tissue samples for IGF-1 and determine expression patterns in both HRS cells and reactive cells. Next, it is important to determine the phosphorylation status of IGF-1R in primary tumor cells. Although tyrosine phosphorylation staining on tissue samples is difficult, it might be worthwhile to set this up to further support the role of IGF-1R in HL. To verify the proliferative activity of IGF-1R in vivo, a double staining and Ki-67 and for phosphorylated IGF-1R and Ki-67 could be done, to demonstrate that IGF-1R positive HRS cells indeed are actively proliferating cells. To better understand the functionality of the IGF-1 pathway, we should test the effect of IGF-1R knockdown or IGF-1 neutralizing antibody on growth of HL cell lines. We showed that IGF-1R is a negative prognostic factor in HL. This finding should be validated in an independent patient cohort. It might be of interest to also study the prognostic effect of phosphorylated IGF-1R. If validated, IGF-1R expression at diagnosis may be incorporated in current risk stratification systems to improve the distinction between favorable and unfavorable prognostic subgroups. As the IGF-1/IGF-1R pathway plays important roles in hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation, it can be anticipated that the IGF-1R pathway also affects the reactive Summary, Discussion and Future perspectives 125 cells in the microenvironment. This could be studied by co-culturing na\u00efve T cells with HRS cells with or without presence of IGF-1 or IGF-1 neutralizing antibody37. EphA7 is one of the members of the Ephrin family that has tumor suppressor functions. In HL, the possible mechanisms for loss of EphA7 are largely unknown. Deletions of 6q19 are not common in HL, although loss of the 6q21-27 has been reported in 1 out of 9 cases38 and 21% of cases39. Hypermethylation of EphA7 was more pronounced in primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma as compared to HL40. Mutations of EphA7 were not found in HL cell lines in a study applying whole exome sequencing41. It will be a challenge study the functional role of the Ephrin family in HL cell lines upon inhibition or knock down of specific Eph-receptors or ephrin ligands. This is due to the complex interactions with multiple ligands that can bind to the same receptor and all ligands being able to bind to several receptors. To circumvent this problem, the use of small inhibitors targeting multiple members at the same time would present an attractive approach. For the TLRs, our analysis on primary tissue samples is still incomplete due to lack of good antibodies. In HL, the possible association with NF- B activations needs to be further resolved. Functional studies of TLRs in cHL cell lines might not represent a good model to study the in vivo relevance since in the cell lines, the tumor cells are independent of the microenvironment. To clarify the in vivo function of TLRs, functional studies should be performed on sorted primary tumor cells or in an animal model. Both approaches are challenging as primary tumor cells are not very viable in culture and an animal model is not available yet. To further establish immune escape mechanisms in EBV positive cancers, we can analyze CLIP, HLA class II, HLA-DM, and HLA-DO expression in HRS cell lines using flow cytometry. This will provide further quantitative data with respect to the expression levels of these genes. Unfortunately, there is only one EBV+ HL cell line, and the tumor cell derived origin is uncertain. To further explore a potential role we can overexpress LMP1, LMP2 or EBNA1 in the EBV- HL cell lines and determine the ability of these tumor cells to present these peptides using tetramers. We can Chapter 7 126 measure the expression of membranous CLIP upon HLA-DM knock out or HLA-DO overexpression. In this way we can unravel the strategy that tumor cells apply to escape immune surveillance. Antigen presentation by HLA class II could potentially result in a different cellular background in the HL microenvironment in comparison to HLA class II negative cases. This may be reflected by the number and activation state of T helper cells and by cytokine production. It is important to include CLIP analysis in these experiments, as HRS cells with CLIP and HLA class II expression should be regarded as being not functional and in these cases a pattern similar to HLA class II negative cases is anticipated. It is also possible to overexpress HLA-DM in a HL cell line and co-culture the cell with na\u00efve T cells to analyze the effect on the differentiation into Tregs and cytotoxic CD4 cells42. As HLA class II expression is a prognostic marker in HL43, it is of interest to study the difference of membranous CLIP positive and negative cases on the prognosis of HL patients. In NPC the expression of HLA class II, HLA-DM and HLA-DO should also be coupled to prognosis. Moreover, frozen material should be collected to screen for presence of CLIP bound to membranous HLA class II. Summary, Discussion and Future perspectives 127 References: 1. Kuppers R.

Acknowledgements 141 Acknowledgements From June 16th 2013, the day I left Groningen and backed to China, I started recalling every moment of my 2 years life in Groningen. I miss Groningen so much and realize that the people here are so hospitable and helpful. The UMCG provided a good research environment for my PhD study. Ever since I was a child I always yearned studying abroad and envisaged what is look like in western world. Actually the oversea medical PhD life is absolutely not easy. On June third 2011, after strenuous trip from Tianjin to Groningen, I arrived in Groningen at 2am, carrying 50kg of luggage. I am alone and stepped into an unfamiliar and quiet room at Kornoeljestraat 2, and settled down. At beginning I found Groningen is charming, well preserved and quiet. Besides exciting and curious I felt lonely and homesick. But being alone gives me the power to regulate and adjust my lives. It brings forth my longing to explore, the curiosity about the unknown, the fortitude to live a independent life. More importantly, I experienced a completely different and simple life that brings me more ability and development. I strived to gained skills and knowledge in the best possible way, I begin to familiar with the lab work, through paper reading and attending different seminar I start to develop the idea for the research. I am also grateful for having a chance to meet so many wonderful people and professionals who support and guide me though this PhD period in UMCG, otherwise I would never have progressed so easily. At the moment I am so close to my PhD degree, I would like to expresss my deep and sincere thanks to them. First of all, I greatly thank for all my heart to my promoter, Professor Dr. Anke van den Berg. Dear Anke, you gave me opportunity to do PhD study in Groningen under your guidance.

Every time I was indeed impressed by your quick feedback after I gave you a paper for revision. In one sentence I really learned a lot from you. Acknowledgements 142 Second, I would like to express my appreciation from the bottom of my heart to my co-promoter, Dr. Lydia Visser, who led me into the research field of Hodgkin lymphoma, to which I devoted myself in the future as well. Dear Lydia, during the past 2 years, I spent most of my working time under your supervision, thanks for all your continuous pushing, valuable support and kindness help whenever I need. From the beginning of my adaptive phase to the last exhaustive phase you always encourage me when I was in low mood . I always recall the first cell culture and the other biochemical methods you taught me in the lab during these 2 years, which will benefit me more in the future. Under your guidance, I learned not to afraid of making mistake. I enjoy the topics of our conversations, which were always so imaginational, full of fun and stimulated the idea for research. I must admit that I learnt a lot from Dr. Lydia Visser. I also appreciate very much for your organizing the delicious student dinner and the wonderful farewell party for me at your home. Thank you for exhaustive revision of the papers and tolerating my lazy working style. Without your relentless efforts in improving the project, it would have been difficult for me to finish this thesis on time. In brief I had great time under your supervision. I really hope you have the chance to visit china and reunion with your Chinese students in the near future. Third, my sincere thanks go to my co-promoter Dr. Arjan Diepstra. I am lucky that you became one of my co-promoters.
