Alternative treatments for osteoarthritis Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments for osteoarthritis (OA) usually target: - pain - stiffness - swelling Many people use such therapies alongside more traditional treatments. As is often the case, there's little research to support many CAM treatments for OA. Research on CAM is generally much less extensive than that on conventional clinical treatment options. Many people have had success in using CAM to manage OA. However, talk to your doctor before trying any CAM treatments. You need to make certain the methods are safe and right for you. Possible OA treatments may include a number of herbs and supplements. Most of them work by reducing inflammation. [Studies show](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20232616) While some research suggests there may be health benefits, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't monitor the purity or quality of supplements.You should discuss any supplements with your doctor before you start using them. Some herbs and supplements may interact with other medications you're taking. While most supplements are natural, that doesn't mean they're safe. Turmeric [Turmeric](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Turmeric&i=aps&tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) has been used for years in traditional Chinese and [Ayurvedic medicine](/health/ayurvedic-treatment-for-arthritis). It's known to have anti-inflammatory properties. [Preliminary studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19678780) and fish oil [Vitamin C](https://amzn.to/2KaZRK0?ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) and [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=omega-3+fatty+acids+(fish+oil)&i=aps&tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) found in fish oil have tentatively been shown to reduce inflammation in joints. However, the data on their efficacy is mixed. There's been more research on the use of fish oil for [rheumatoid arthritis ](/health/rheumatoid-arthritis)than for OA. Avocado-soybean unsaponifiables [Avocado-soybean unsaponifiables](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Avocado+soybean+unsaponifiables+&i=aps&tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) were symptoms in [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11279783) Cat's claw [Cat's claw](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Cat's+claw+&i=aps&tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) comes from the dried root bark of a woody vine found in Peru. It's believed to have anti-inflammatory properties. [Several studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20232616) Mind-body therapies may help with OA pain. These treatments may not have the side effects associated with many medications. However, all mind-body approaches may not be suitable for everyone with OA. Acupuncture [Acupuncture](/health/dry-needling-vs-acupuncture) uses fine needles inserted at various points on your skin. Many believe that it helps to reduce many types of pain, including pain from OA. However, it's difficult to do acupuncture research. Therefore, the scientific community questions its effectiveness. Ultrasound Ultrasound uses high-energy sound waves. For physical therapy and treatment of OA, ultrasound is used to generate heat. This heat improves the flow of blood through the tendons and joints to increase the healing process. This causes a reduction of pain and other OA symptoms. This technique can be performed by a physical or occupational therapist. Evidence of its efficacy is mixed. Alternative treatments can be effective complements to a traditional treatment plan. However, you should always check with your doctor before trying any new treatments to be sure they're safe and right for you. Just because they're natural doesn't mean they won't interfere with your current treatment plan. "}
