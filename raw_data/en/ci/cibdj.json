The other major interventions areprovision of Safe Abortion Services and services for RTIs and STIs. This policy recommends a holistic strategy for bringing about total intersectoral coordination at thegrassroot level and involving the NGOs, Civil Societies, Panchayati Raj Institutions andWomen's Group in bringing down Maternal Mortality Ratio and Infant Mortality Rate. The National Population Policy, 2000 and National Health Policy, 2002 have set the goal ofreducing MMR to less than 100 per 100,000 livebirthsby the year 2010. Accordingly, schemes andprogrammes havebeen developedandvariousinterventionsfocusedonreducing maternal deaths. The Maternal Mortality Ratio in India is212per100,000 livebirths(SRS,RGI:2007-09 Maternal Mortality Report). Over57,000womenin Indiacontinue to die of pregnancyrelated causes every year. 4.2.MATERNAL (MMR)MORTALITY RATIO MMR is defined as the number of deaths per 100,000livebirths due tocauses related site or acauseofgreatconcern. Themajorcausesofthese deaths have been identified as hemorrhage (both ante and post partum), toxemia (Hypertension during pregnancy), anemia, obstmcted labour, puerperal sepsis (infections after delivery) and unsafe abortion. Abortion, 8% Obstructed Labour, 5%Haemorrhage, 38% Sepsis, 11% Hypertensive disorders, 5% As can be seen Hemorrhage accounts for more than one- third of all deaths followed by puerperal sepsis and abortion. Besides conditions, pooraccessto are also contributing factors leading to highermaternalmortality. 4.3MATERNAL HEALTH INDICATORS The estimates of maternal mortality at StateAJTs levels notbeingveryrobust,MMRcanonlybeusedasarough indicator of the maternal health situation in IFAtabletsConsumed for 100days 46.6 20.5 PNCwithin2weeksofdelivery 49.7 N.A nationwide survey covering all States and Union Territories of India, was conducted during independently investigation , 2 doses of T.T Immunization andconsumption ofIFAtabletsfor 100 days. 4.4.I.C.Prophylaxis and mg 100mgof ironandICQelemental areprovided withdouble doseofthese tablets Health & Nutrition education to promote dietary diversification. inclusion of iron-folate rich foodandfood items that promote iron absorption.

Majority of the patients recover from topose amajorpublichealththreatindifferentpartsofthe country,particularly duetoPlasmodiumfalciparum asitissometimes pronetocomplications anddeath, if not treated early. b. There are 9 species of Malaria vectors in India, out of whichthe majorvector mosquito for rural malaria viz. Anopheles culicifacies, is distributed all over the country and breeds in clean ground water collections. Other important Anopheline species namely An.minimus and An.fluviatilis breedinrunningchannels, streamswithcleanwater. Some of the vector species also breed in forest areas,mangroves, lagoons, etc, even in those with organicpollutants. c. In urban areas,malariais mainlytransmitted by Anopheles stephensi whichbreedsinman-made watercontainers in domestic and peri-domestic situations such as tanks, wells, cisterns, which are more or less of permanent nature and hence can 79maintaindensityformalariatransmissionthroughout the year. Increasing humanactivities, such as urbanization, industrialization andconstruction cups,etc.)create mosquitogenic conditions andthus contribute to of vector borne diseases.

The emphasis is Annual Report2011-12given on keepingpigs away from humandwellings or mosquitoes. Sensitization ofthecommunity regarding avoidance ofman-mosquito contact by using bet nets and fully covering the body are also advocated. Since early reporting ofcases iscrucialto avoid any complication andmortality, community isgivenfull information about the signs and symptoms as well as availability ofhealth services at health centres/hospitals. Besides, the states are advised fogging with tanks, tyres, desert coolers,pitchers, discarded containers, junkmaterials, etc, in which water stagnates for more than a week.This is a day biting mosquito and prefers to rest in hard to find dark areas insidethe houses.Aedesalbopictus mosquitoes prefer tobreedinnaturalhabitatsliketreeholes,plantationetc. Theriskof denguehasshownanincreaseinrecentyears improper water storage practicesinurban,peri-urban andruralareas,leadingto proliferationofmosquitobreedingsites.Thediseasehas a seasonal pattern i.e., the cases peak after monsoon and it is not uniformly distributed throughoutthe year.
