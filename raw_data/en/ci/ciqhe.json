Perhaps you've had a drug problem for a long time, and you know now that it's time for you to get help. Friends and family may have recommended drug detox to start overcoming addiction, but you're unsure what your research says. Call [208.486.0130](tel:2084860130) to speak with someone from the knowledgeable team at Northpoint Recovery about holistic drug detox vs. medical drug detox and how we can help you overcome addiction and build a better, happier life. Understanding Holistic Drug Detox Holistic drug detox refers to a facility that focuses on more natural ways of helping the body cleanse itself from all the chemicals in the drugs you have been using. They rely heavily on changing your diet to include nutritious and healthy foods to help speed up your detoxification process. They also understand the importance of exercise and physical activity when detoxing the body. It's important not to confuse holistic drug detox with going cold turkey. Quitting your use of drugs on your own without professional guidance can be dangerous in many cases, and experts do not recommend that approach. Detox centers like this often offer a spiritual focus that many people appreciate. They also focus on the following: - Your family relationships - Your mental well-being - Your physical health - Your diet and nutrition If holistic drug detox seems like an option that appeals to you, you'll find that you'll receive treatment for every aspect of your life. Understanding Medical Drug Detox Unlike holistic drug detox centers, a medical drug detox facility focuses more on the physical symptoms of your addiction and how to manage them best. Detoxing drugs from your body can be difficult and painful, so many clinics prescribe medication to help you through this process. Some drugs generally require a medical approach to drug detox. This refers to allowing you to take medication to help speed up detoxification. You can also take medications such as: - Antidepressants - Anti-anxiety medications - Painkillers These are usually prescribed to help with the anxiety and physical pain of withdrawal. Medical detox centers will also use a variety of therapies to help you learn new coping skills and offer medical advice regarding your mental health. Some people find complete relief from withdrawal while they're taking these medications. During medical drug detox, you will be supervised very closely to be sure you're not experiencing any medical complications that require intervention. Some drugs can result in seizures, heart palpitations, stroke, or other serious medical issues when stopped abruptly. Combining Medical Drug Detox with Holistic Drug Detox Perhaps as you're learning about the differences between these two drug detox methods, a mix of the two sounds more appealing. Some facilities offer that to their patients. This combination allows you to get the benefits of a holistic program while taking any medication you might need if you require it to help you feel better. The most important thing you can do is to get the help you need. Once you have completed your drug detox program, further addiction treatment is highly recommended to ensure that you learn more about your addiction and how to prevent relapse. You'll be amazed at how much better you feel once the process has been completed.
