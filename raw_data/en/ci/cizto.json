Clean It Up and Clean It Out: Create a Life that Sparks Health Now Use this step-by-step program to make SURE your diet and lifestyle are setting you up for a lifetime of feeling and looking great and avoiding (and reversing!) chronic symptoms and the need for healthcare now and in the distant future. The WellBe Spark Health Program is a 6-week online program for those motivated to improve their health, the quality of their life, and their future by making research-supported lifestyle changes, which are proven to optimize their body and home for health.

The WellBe Spark Health Program can fast-track the process and give you the tools now (many of which are free!) to look and feel your best, and avoid disease and expensive healthcare in the future. WELLNESS & HEALTHCARE If you're like me, you feel like the amount of wellness information online is overwhelming, and the process of making lifestyle changes confusing and seemingly endless. You don't have hours to spend on the internet or Instagram trying to find answers, you need research-backed information, just simplified. But the research shows that certain lifestyle changes -the really important ones- can make all the difference between a life full of chronic health issues, doctor's appointments, forms, hospital visits, prescription refills, surgeries, being exhausted, not feeling well, or looking your best and a happy, long life full of great experiences, few chronic health issues and minimal need for healthcare. Not to mention better genes to pass along to your kids! The truth is, you don't need to get on board with every wellness trend, it's about implementing those often simple, research-supported lifestyle habits in each aspect of your life that will have the biggest impact on your health. Having chronic health issues now or getting chronic illnesses when you're older is not inevitable. We have the tools now to live long, disease-free lives, we just need to finally put them to use.

HOW DID WE GET HERE? You know how it's so easy to gain weight and so hard to lose it? It's the same with setting up an unhealthy home and lifestyle. The last 70 years have been the unhealthiest in human history when it comes to the creation of toxins in products, food, air, water, conventional medicines, and most of all, our minds. Over time, our lives and homes have become littered with hundreds of things that contribute to chronic disease, or keep us from kicking a chronic health issue our immune system would have overcome without so many obstacles in its way! Today, staying well is harder than ever. Most of us are doing what we think is best and what we think is healthy, only to discover that we've been duped\u2014 \"all natural\" isn't regulated and the overprescription of antibiotics is causing a public health crisis. I'VE BEEN THERE As various chronic health issues in my life and my family's came up, I struggled to navigate the conventional healthcare system and integrative medicine world to get answers. I found the amount of research it took to handle it on my own overwhelming, confusing, and beyond time-consuming. I remember thinking, I wish someone could just do all of this research for me, give me the cliff notes and take me through the process step-by-step! I also wished I had someone to do the time-consuming research for me or tell me which peanut butter is actually the cleanest, or whether my favorite moisturizer is toxic or safe or the best natural options for a headache should I get one. Most of all I wish I'd had more support, not every day or even every week, but just someone I could turn to who could help me when I became lazy or busy to keep my health on track and cheer me on when I was trying to make hard lifestyle changes or beginning to see results with my wellness practices.

Over the past twenty years, I struggled with and have been able to overcome my own health issues including chronic Lyme Disease and Amenorrhea, and then became a caretaker for my mother, who was diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder at age 58 and died at age 61. I'm in the unique position of being able to take what I've learned from my private holistic patient advocacy work, hundreds of expert's from all sides of health and wellness that I've interviewed for WellBe, and the thousands of pieces of research I've collected and broken down for WellBe readers to guide you through a simple, step-by-step process for making the changes that actually matter. I've been a patient, caretaker, worked within the conventional healthcare system, and have spent over two decades utilizing integrative medicine and practicing wellness, so I know many of the challenges and what has worked for me. I built WellBe to help others prevent and reverse chronic health issues naturally, and avoid what I experienced. I've built the WellBe Spark Health Program because I've seen that you can have all the information in the world but without action, it doesn't matter. I also don't have a lot of time these days as a busy entrepreneur, so being able to have vetted information and recommendations AND be able to quickly take action to implement them is invaluable to me!
