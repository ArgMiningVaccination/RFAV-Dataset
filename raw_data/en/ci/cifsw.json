It is the legislature's belief that through the selfless dedication of many foster parents that abused and neglected children are able to heal and go on to lead productive lives. The legislature also be lieves that some foster parents act in ways that are damaging to the children in their care and it is the department of social and health services' responsibility to make sure all children in care are safe. The legislature finds that unannounced visits to caregivers' homes isanother method by which the department of social and health services can make sure the children in foster care are safe. Sec. 2. RCW 74.13.031 and 2009 c 520 s 51, 2009 c 491 s 7, and 2009 c 235 s 2 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows: (1) The department and supervising agencies shall develop, administer, supervise, and monitor a coordinated and comprehensive plan that establishes, aids, and strengthens services for the protection and care of runaway, dependent, or neglected children.

(4) The department or supervising agencies shall offer, on a voluntary basis, family reconciliation services to families who are in conflict.

The department and supervising agencies are encouraged to group monthly visits to caregivers by geographic area so that in the event an unannounced visit canno t be completed, the caseworker may complete other required monthly visits. The department shall use a method of random selection that does not cause a fiscal impact to the department. The department or supervising agenci es shall conduct the monthly visits with children and caregivers to whom it is providing child welfare services. (6) The department and supervising ag encies shall have authority to accept custody of children from parents and to accept custody of children from juvenile courts, where authorized to do so unde r law, to provide child welfare services including placement for adoption, to provide for the routine and necessary medical, dental, and mental health care, or necessary emergency care of the children, and to provide for the physical care of such children and make payment of maintenance costs if needed.

(1) A prior conviction is a conviction which exists before the date of sentencing for the offense for which the offender score is being computed.Convictions entered or sentenced on the same date as the conviction for which the offender score is being computed shal l be deemed \"other current offenses\" within the meaning of RCW 9.94A.589.

The current sentencing court shall determine with respect to other prior adult offenses for which sentences were served concurrently or prior juvenile offenses for which sentences were served consecutively, whether those offenses shall be counted as one offense or as separate offenses using the \"same criminal conduct\" analysis found in RCW 9.94A.589(1)(a), and if the court finds that they shall be counted as one offense, then the offense that yields the highest offender score shall be used. The current sentencing court may presume that such other prior offenses were not the same criminal conduct from sentences imposed on separate dates, or in separate counties or jurisdictions, or in separate complaints, indictments, or informations; (ii) In the case of multiple prior convictions for offenses committed before July 1, 1986, for the purpose of computing the offender score, count all adult convictions served concurrently as one offense, and count all juvenile convictions entered on the same date as one offense.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. This act shall be known and cited as Hailey's Law. NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. (1) The legislature finds that: (a) Despite every effort, the problem of driving or controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs remains a great threat to the lives and safety of citizens. Over five hundr ed people are killed by traffic accidents in Washington each year and impaired vehicle drivers account for almost forty-five percent, or over two hundred deaths per y ear. That is, impairment is the leading cause of traffic deaths in this state; (b) Over thirty-nine thousand people are arrested each year in Washington for driving or controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Persons arrested for driving or controlling a vehicle while under the influence ofalcohol or drugs may still be impaired after they are cited and released and could return to drive or control a vehicle. If the vehicle was impounded, there is nothing to stop the impaired person from going to the tow truck operator's storage facility and redeeming the vehicle while still impaired; (c) More can be done to deter those arrested for driving or controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Approximately one-third of those arrested for operating a vehicle under the influence are repeat offenders. Vehicle impoundment effectively increases deterrence and prevents an impaired driver from accessing the vehicle for a specified time. In addition, vehicle impoundment provides an appropriate measure of accountability for registered owners who allow impaired drivers to drive or control their vehicles, but it alsoallows the registered owners to red eem their vehicles once impounded. Any inconvenience on a registered owner is outweighed by the need to protect the public; (d) In order to protect public safety and to enforce the state's laws, it is reasonable and necessary to mandatorily impound the vehicle operated by aperson who has been arrested for driving or controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. (2) The legislature intends by this act: (a) To change the primary reason for impounding the vehicle operated by a person arrested for driving or controlling a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The purpose of impoundment under this act is to protect the public from a person operating a vehicle while still impaired, rather than to prevent a potential traffic obstruction; and (b) To require that officers have no discretion as to whether or not to order an impound after they have arrested a vehicle driver with reasonable grounds tobelieve the driver of the vehicle was driv ing while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or was in physical control of a vehicle while under the influence ofalcohol or drugs. NEW SECTION. Sec. 3. (1)(a) When a driver of a vehicle is arrested for a violation of RCW 46.61.502 or 46.61.504, the vehicle is subject to summary impoundment and except for a commercial vehicle or farm transport vehicleCh. 167 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1172 ]under subsection (3)(c) of this section, the vehicle must be impounded. With the exception of the twelve-hour hold mandated under this section, the procedures for notice, redemption, storage, auction, and sale shall remain the same as for other impounded vehicles under this chapter. (b) If the police officer directing that a vehicle be impounded under this section has: (i) Waited thirty minutes after the police officer contacted the police dispatcher requesting a registered tow truck operator and the tow truck responding has not arrived, or (ii) If the police officer is presente d with exigent circ umstances such as being called to another incident or due to limited available resources being required to return to patrol, the police officer may place the completed impound order and inventory inside the vehicle and secure the vehicle by closing the windows and locking the doors before leaving. (c) If a police officer directing that a vehicle be impounded under this section has secured the vehicle and left it pursuant to (b) of this subsection, thepolice officer and the government or ag ency employing the police officer shall not be liable for any damages to or theft of the vehicle or its contents that occurbetween the time the officer leaves and th e time that the registered tow truck operator takes custody of the vehicle, or for the actions of any person who takesor removes the vehicle before the registered tow truck operator arrives. (2)(a) When a driver of a vehicle is arrested for a violation of RCW 46.61.502 or 46.61.504 and the driver is a registered owner of the vehicle, the impounded vehicle may not be redeemed within a twelve-hour period following the time the impounded vehicle arrives at the registered tow truck operator's storage facility as noted in the registered tow truck operator's master log, unless there are two or more registered owners of the vehicle or there is a legal owner of the vehicle that is not the driver of th e vehicle. A registered owner who is not the driver of the vehicle or a legal owner who is not the driver of the vehicle mayredeem the impounded vehicle after it arrives at the registered tow truck operator's storage facility as noted in the registered tow truck operator's masterlog. (b) When a driver of a vehicle is arrested for a violation of RCW 46.61.502 or 46.61.504 and the driver is a register ed owner of the vehicle, the police officer directing the impound shall notify the driver that the impounded vehicle may notbe redeemed within a twelve-hour period following the time the impounded vehicle arrives at the registered tow truck operator's storage facility as noted in the registered tow truck operator's mast er log, unless there are two or more registered owners or there is a legal owner who is not the driver of the vehicle.The police officer directing the impound shall notify the driver that the impounded vehicle may be redeemed by either a registered owner or legal owner, who is not the driver of the vehi cle, after the impounded vehicle arrives at the registered tow truck operator's st orage facility as noted in the registered tow truck operator's master log. (3)(a) When a driver of a vehicle is arrested for a violation of RCW 46.61.502 or 46.61.504 and the driver is not a registered owner of the vehicle, the impounded vehicle may be redeemed by a registered owner or legal owner, who is not the driver of the vehicle, after the impounded vehicle arrives at theWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 167 [ 1173 ]registered tow truck operator's storage facility as noted in the registered tow truck operator's master log. (b) When a driver of a vehicle is arrested for a violation of RCW 46.61.502 or 46.61.504 and the driver is not a registered owner of the vehicle, the policeofficer directing the impound shall notify the driver that the impounded vehicle may be redeemed by a registered owner or legal owner, who is not the driver of the vehicle, after the impounded vehicl e arrives at the registered tow truck operator's storage facility as noted in the registered tow truck operator's master log. (c) If the vehicle is a commercial vehi cle or farm transport vehicle and the driver of the vehicle is not the owner of the vehicle, before the summaryimpoundment directed under subsection (1) of this section, the police officer shall attempt in a reasonable and timely manner to contact the owner of the vehicle and may release the vehicle to the owner if the owner is reasonably available, as long as the owner was not in the vehicle at the time of the stop andarrest. (d) The registered tow truck operator shall notify the agen cy that ordered that the vehicle be impounded when the vehicle arrives at the registered towtruck operator's storage facility and has b een entered into the master log starting the twelve-hour period. (4) A registered tow truck operator that releases an impounded vehicle pursuant to the requirements stated in this section is not liable for injuries or damages sustained by the operator of the vehicle or sustained by third parties that may result from the vehicle driver's intoxicated state. (5) For purposes of this section \"farm transport vehicle\" means a motor vehicle owned by a farmer and that is be ing actively used in the transportation of the farmer's or another farmer's farm, orchard, aquatic farm, or dairy products,including livestock and plant or anim al wastes, from point of production to market or disposal, or supplies or commodities to be used on the farm, orchard,aquatic farm, or dairy, and that has a gross vehicle weight rating of 7,258 kilograms (16,001 pounds) or more. NEW SECTION. Sec. 4. If an impoundment arising from an alleged violation of RCW 46.61.502 or 46.61.504 is determined to be in violation of thischapter, then the police officer direc ting the impoundment and the government employing the officer are not liable for damages for loss of use of the vehicle ifthe officer had reasonable suspicion to be lieve that the driver of the vehicle was driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or was inphysical control of a vehicle while unde r the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug. Sec. 5. RCW 46.55.113 and 2007 c 242 s 1 and 2007 c 86 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: (1) Whenever the driver of a vehicle is arrested for a violation of RCW ((46.61.502, 46.61.504, )) 46.20.342((, )) or 46.20.345, the vehicle is subject to summary impoundment, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an applicable local ordinance or state agency rule at the direction of a la w enforcement officer. (2) In addition, a police officer may take custody of a vehicle, at his or her discretion, and provide for its prompt removal to a place of safety under any ofthe following circumstances:Ch. 167 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1174 ](a) Whenever a police officer finds a vehicle standing upon the roadway in violation of any of the provisions of RCW 46.61.560, the officer may provide for the removal of the vehicle or require the dr iver or other person in charge of the vehicle to move the vehicle to a position off the roadway; (b) Whenever a police officer finds a vehicle unattended upon a highway where the vehicle constitutes an obstru ction to traffic or jeopardizes public safety; (c) Whenever a police officer finds an unattended vehicle at the scene of an accident or when the driver of a vehicl e involved in an accident is physically or mentally incapable of deciding upon steps to be taken to protect his or her property; (d) Whenever the driver of a vehicle is arrested and taken into custody by a police officer; (e) Whenever a police officer discovers a vehicle that the officer determines to be a stolen vehicle; (f) Whenever a vehicle without a speci al license plate, placard, or decal indicating that the vehicle is being used to transport a person with disabilitiesunder RCW 46.16.381 is parked in a stall or space clearly and conspicuously marked under RCW 46.61.581 which space is provided on private property without charge or on public property; (g) Upon determining that a person is operating a motor vehicle without a valid and, if required, a specially endorsed driver's license or with a license that has been expired for ninety days or more; (h) When a vehicle is illegally occupying a truck, commercial loading zone, restricted parking zone, bus, loading, hooded-meter, taxi, street construction or maintenance, or other similar zone where, by order of the director of transportation or chiefs of police or fire or their designees, parking is limited to designated classes of vehicles or is prohibited during certain hours, on designated days or at all times, if the zo ne has been established with signage for at least twenty-four hours and where the vehicle is interfering with the proper and intended use of the zone.

Proper stewardship of, and respect for, these waters requires that, while enjoyingthem for their scenic and recreational benefits, boaters must exercise care to assure that such activities do not contribu te to the despoliation of these waters, and that watercraft be operated in a safe and responsible manner. The legislature has specifically addressed the topic of access to clean and safe waterways byrequiring the 1987 boating safety study and by establishing the Puget Sound partnership. The legislature finds that there is a need to educate Washington's boating community about safe and responsible actions on our waters and to increase thelevel and visibility of the enforcement of boating laws. To address the incidence of fatalities and injuries due to recreational boating on our state's waters, local and state efforts directed towards safe boating must be stimulated. To provide for safe waterways and public enjoyment, portions of the watercraft excise tax and boat registration fees should be made available for boating safety and other boating recreation purposes. In recognition of the need for clean waterways, and in keeping with the Puget Sound partnership's water quality work plan, the legislature finds that adequate opportunities for responsible di sposal of boat sewage must be made available. There is hereby established a five-year initiative to install sewagepumpout or sewage dump stations at appropriate marinas. To assure the use of these sewage facilities, a boater environmental education program must accompany the five-year initiative and continue toeducate boaters about boat wastes and aquatic resources. The legislature also finds that, in light of the increasing numbers of boaters utilizing state waterways, a program to acquire and develop sufficient waterwayaccess facilities for boaters must be undertaken. To support boating safety, environmental protection and education, and public access to our waterways, the legisl ature declares that a portion of the income from boating-related activities, as specified in RCW 82.49.030 and ((88.02.040 )) , should support these efforts.

Moreover, confinement of the person to a hospital, nursing home, boarding home, or adult family home does not disqualify the claim of exemption if: (a) The residence is temporarily unoccupied; (b) The residence is occupied by a spouse or a domestic partner and/or a person financially dependent on the claimant for support; or (c) The residence is rented for the purpose of paying nursing home, hospital, boarding home, or adult family home costs; (2) The person claiming the exemption must have owned, at the time of filing, in fee, as a life estate, or by contract purchase, the residence on which the property taxes have been imposed or if the person claiming the exemption lives in a cooperative housing association, co rporation, or partnership, such person must own a share therein representing the unit or portion of the structure inwhich he or she resides.

If the person claiming the exemption was retired for two months ormore of the assessment year, the combined disposable income of such personCh. 174 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1294 ]must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person during the months such person was retired by twelve. If the income of the person claiming exemp tion is reduced for two or more months of the assessment year by reason of the death of the person's spouse or theperson's domestic partner, or when other substantial changes occur in disposable income that are likely to continue for an indefinite period of time, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person after such occurrences by twelve.

If the person subsequently fails to qualify under this section only for one year because of high income, this same valuation must be used uponrequalification. If the person fails to qualify for more than one year in succession because of high income or fails to qualify for any other reason, the valuation upon requalification is the assessed value on January 1st of the assessment year in which the person re qualifies. If the person transfers the exemption under this section to a diff erent residence, the valuation of the different residence is the assessed value of the different residence on January 1st of the assessment year in which the person transfers the exemption. (b) In no event may the valuation under this subsection be greater than the true and fair value of the residence on January 1st of the assessment year. (c) This subsection does not apply to subsequent improvements to the property in the year in which the improvements are made.

(b) The legislature further finds that th ere is a trend among states to adopt a single factor apportionment formula based on sales. The legislature recognizesthat adoption of a sales factor only ap portionment method has the advantages of simplifying apportionment and making Wa shington a more attractive place for businesses to expand their property and payroll. For these reasons, the legislature adopts single factor sales apportionment for purposes of apportioningroyalty income and certain service inco me for state business and occupation tax purposes. (c) Nothing in this act may be construed, however, to authorize apportionment of the gross income or value of products taxable under thefollowing business and occupation tax classifications: Retailing, wholesaling, manufacturing, processing for hire, extracting, extracting for hire, printing, government contracting, public road construction, the classifications in RCW 82.04.280 (((2), (4), (6), and (7) )) (1)(b), (d), (f), and (g) , and any other activity not specifically included in the definition of apportionable activities in RCW82.04.460.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: NEW SECTION. Sec. 101. (1) The legislature finds that generating electricity from the combustion of coal produces pollutants that are harmful to human health and safety and the enviro nment. While the emission of many of these pollutants continues to be addressed through application of federal and state air quality laws, the emission of greenhouse gases resulting from the combustion of coal has not been addressed. (2) The legislature finds th at coal-fired electricity generation is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the state, and is the largest sourceof such emissions from the generation of electricity in the state. (3) The legislature finds coal-fired electric generation may provide baseload power that is necessary in the near-term for the stability and reliability of theelectrical transmission grid an d that contributes to the availability of affordable power in the state. The legislature further finds that efforts to transition power toother fuels requires a reasonable period of time to ensure grid stability and to maintain affordable electricity resources. (4) The legislature finds that coal -fired baseload electric generation facilities are a significant contributor to family-wage jobs and economic health in parts of the state and that transition of these facilities must address the economic future and the preservation of jobs in affected communities. (5) Therefore, it is the purpose of this act to provide for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from large coal-fired baseload electric powergeneration facilities, to effect an orderly transition to cleaner fuels in a manner that ensures reliability of the state's el ectrical grid, to ensu re appropriate cleanup and site restoration upon decommissioning of any of these facilities in the state,and to provide assistance to host communities planning for new economic development and mitigating the economic impacts of the closure of these facilities.WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 180 [ 1331 ] Sec. 102.

(6) In determining the rate of emissions of greenhouse gases for baseload electric generation, the total emissions associated with pr oducing electricity shall be included. (7) In no case shall a long-term financial commitment be determined to be in compliance with the greenhouse gas em issions performance standard if the commitment includes more than twelve percent of electricity from unspecified sources. (8) For a long-term financial commitment with multiple power plants, each specified power plant must be treated individually for the purpose of determining the annualized plant capacit y factor and net emissions, and each power plant must comply with subsection (1) of this section, except as providedin subsections (3) through (5) of this section. (9) The department shall establish an output-based methodology to ensure that the calculation of emissions of greenhouse gases for a cogeneration facilityrecognizes the total usable energy outp ut of the process, and includes all greenhouse gases emitted by the facility in the production of both electrical andthermal energy. In developing and implementing the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard, the department shall consider and act in a manner consistent with any rules adopted purs uant to the public utilities regulatory policy act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. Sec. 824a-3), as amended. (10) The following greenhouse gas emissions produced by baseload electric generation owned or contracted through a long-term financial commitment shall not be counted as emissions of the power plant in determining compliance with the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard: (a) Those emissions that are injected permanently in geological formations; (b) Those emissions that are permanently sequestered by other means approved by the department; and (c) Those emissions sequestered or mitigated as approved under subsection (16) of this section.Ch. 180 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1334 ](11) In adopting and implementin g the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard, the department of ((community, trade, and economic development )) commerce energy policy division, in consultation with the commission, the department, the Bonneville power administration, the western electricity ((coordination [coordinating] )) coordinating council, the energy facility site evaluation council, electric ut ilities, public interest representatives, and consumer representatives, shall cons ider the effects of the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard on system reliability and overall costs toelectricity customers. (12) In developing and implementing the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard, the department shall, with assistance of the commission,the department of ((community, trade, and economic development )) commerce energy policy division, and electric utilities, and to the extent practicable,address long-term purchases of electricity from unspecified sources in a manner consistent with this chapter. (13) The directors of the energy f acility site evaluation council and the department shall each adopt rules unde r chapter 34.05 RCW in coordination with each other to implement and en force the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard. The rules necessary to implement this section shall beadopted by June 30, 2008. (14) In adopting the rules for implementing this section, the energy facility site evaluation council and the department shall include criteria to be applied inevaluating the carbon sequestration plan, for baseload electric generation that will rely on subsection (10) of this s ection to demonstrate compliance, but that will commence sequestration after the date that electricity is first produced. The rules shall include but not be limited to: (a) Provisions for financial assurances, as a condition of plant operation, sufficient to ensure successful implemen tation of the carbon sequestration plan, including construction and operation of necessary equipment, and any other significant costs; (b) Provisions for geological or other approved sequestration commencing within five years of plant operation, including full and sufficient technical documentation to support the planned sequestration; (c) Provisions for monitoring the effec tiveness of the implementation of the sequestration plan; (d) Penalties for failure to achieve implementation of the plan on schedule; (e) Provisions for an owner to purchase emissions reductions in the event of the failure of a sequestration plan under subsection (16) of this section; and (f) Provisions for public notice and comment on the carbon sequestration plan. (15)(a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, as part of its role enforcing the greenhouse gas emission s performance standard, the department shall determine whether sequestration or a plan for sequestration will provide safe, reliable, and permanent protecti on against the greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere from the power plant and all ancillary facilities. (b) For facilities under its jurisdiction, the energy facility site evaluation council shall contract for review of sequestration or the carbon sequestration plan with the department consistent with the conditions under (a) of thissubsection, consider the adequacy of sequ estration or the plan in its adjudicativeWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 180 [ 1335 ]proceedings conducted under RCW 80.50.090(3), and incorporate specific findings regarding adequacy in its recommendation to the governor under RCW 80.50.100. (16) A project under consideration by the energy facility site evaluation council by July 22, 2007, is required to include all of the requirements ofsubsection (14) of this section in its carbon sequestration plan submitted as part of the energy facility site evaluation council process. A project underconsideration by the energy facility site evaluation council by July 22, 2007, that receives final site certification agreem ent approval under chapter 80.50 RCW shall make a good faith effort to implement the sequestration plan. If the projectowner determines that implementation is not feasible, the project owner shall submit documentation of that determination to the energy facility site evaluation council. The documentation shall demons trate the steps take n to implement the sequestration plan and evidence of the technological and economic barriers to successful implementation. The project owner shall then provide to the energy facility site evaluation council notification that they shall implement the planthat requires the project owner to meet the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard by purchasing verifiable greenhouse gas emissions reductions from an electric ((generating )) generation facility located within the western interconnection, where the reduction would not have occurred otherwiseor absent this contractual agreement, such that the sum of the emissions reductions purchased and the facility's emissions meets the standard for the lifeof the facility. Sec. 104. RCW 80.80.060 and 2009 c 448 s 3 and 2009 c 147 s 1 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows: (1) No electrical company may enter in to a long-term financial commitment unless the baseload electric generation su pplied under such a long-term financial commitment complies with th e greenhouse ((gases [gas] )) gas emissions performance standard established under RCW 80.80.040. (2) In order to enforce the requirements of this chapter, the commission shall review in a general rate case or as provided in subsection (5) of this sectionany long-term financial commitment entere d into by an electrical company after June 30, 2008, to determine whether the baseload electric generation to besupplied under that long-term financial commitment complies with the greenhouse ((gases [gas] )) gas emissions performance standard established under RCW 80.80.040. (3) In determining whether a long-term financial commitment is for baseload electric generation, the commiss ion shall consider the design of the power plant and its intended use, based upon the electricity purchase contract, if any, permits necessary for the operation of the power plant, and any other matter the commission determines is relevant under the circumstances. (4) Upon application by an electric utility, the commission may provide a case-by-case exemption from the greenhouse ((gases [gas] )) gas emissions performance standard to address: (a) Unanticipated electric system reliability needs; (b) extraordinary cost impacts on utility ratepayers; or (c) catastrophic events or threat of significant financial harm that may arise from unforeseencircumstances. (5) Upon application by an electrical company, the commission shall determine whether the company's proposed decision to acquire electricCh. 180 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1336 ]generation or enter into a power purch ase agreement for electricity complies with the greenhouse ((gases [gas] )) gas emissions performance standard established under RCW 80.80.040. The commission shall not decide in a proceeding under this subsection (5) issues involving the actual costs to construct and operate the selected reso urce, cost recovery, or other issues reserved by the commission for decision in a general rate case or other proceeding for recovery of the resource or contract costs. (6) An electrical company may account for and defer for later consideration by the commission costs incurred in co nnection with a long-term financial commitment, including operating and ma intenance costs, depreciation, taxes, and cost of invested capital. The defe rral begins with the date on which the power plant begins commercial operation or the effective date of the powerpurchase agreement and continues for a period not to exceed twenty-four months; provided that if during such pe riod the company files a general rate case or other proceeding for the recovery of such costs, deferral ends on the effective date of the final decision by the commission in such proceeding. Creation of such a deferral account does not by itself determine the actual costs of the long- term financial commitment, whether recovery of any or all of these costs is appropriate, or other issues to be decided by the commission in a general rate case or other proceeding for recovery of these costs. For the purpose of this subsection (6) only, the term \"long-term financial commitment\" also includes an electric company's ownership or power pur chase agreement with a term of five or more years associated with an eligib le renewable resource as defined in RCW 19.285.030. (7) The commission shall consult with the department to apply the procedures adopted by the department to verify the emissions of greenhouse gases from baseload electric generation under RCW 80.80.040. The department shall report to the commission whether baseload electric generation will comply with the greenhouse ((gases [gas] )) gas emissions performance standard for the duration of the period the baseload electric generation is supplied to theelectrical company. (8) The commission shall adopt rules for the enforcement of this section with respect to electrical companies an d adopt procedural rules for approving costs incurred by an electrical company under subsection (4) of this section. (9) This section does not apply to a long-term financial commitment for the purchase of coal transition power with termination dates consistent with the applicable dates in RCW 80.80.040(3)(c). (10) The commission shall adopt rules n ecessary to implement this section by December 31, 2008. Sec. 105. RCW 80.80.070 and 2007 c 307 s 9 are each amended to read as follows: (1) No consumer-owned utility may enter into a long-term financial commitment unless the baseload electric generation supplied under such a long- term financial commitment complies with the greenhouse ((gases )) gas emissions performance standard established under RCW 80.80.040. (2) The governing board shall review and make a determination on any long-term financial commitment by the utilit y, pursuant to this chapter and after consultation with the department, to de termine whether the baseload electric generation to be supplied under that long-term financial commitment compliesWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 180 [ 1337 ]with the greenhouse ((gases )) gas emissions performance standard established under RCW 80.80.040. No consumer-own ed utility may enter into a long-term financial commitment unless the baselo ad electric generation to be supplied under that long-term financial comm itment complies with the greenhouse ((gases )) gas emissions performance standard established under RCW 80.80.040. (3) In confirming that a long-term financial commitment is for baseload electric generation, the governing board sh all consider the design of the power plant and the intended use of the power plant based upon the electricity purchase contract, if any, permits necessary for th e operation of the power plant, and any other matter the governing board determines is relevant under the circumstances. (4) The governing board may provide a case-by-case exemption from the greenhouse ((gases )) gas emissions performance standard to address: (a) Unanticipated electric system reliability needs; or (b) catastrophic events or threat of significant financial harm that may arise from unforeseen circumstances. (5) The governing board shall apply the procedures adopted by the department to verify the emissions of greenhouse gases from baseload electricgeneration under RCW 80.80.040, and may request assistance from the department in doing so. (6) For consumer-owned utilities, the auditor is responsible for auditing compliance with this chapter and rules a dopted under this chapter that apply to those utilities and the attorney general is responsible for enforcing that compliance. (7) This section does not apply to long-term financial commitments for the purchase of coal transition power with termination dates consistent with the applicable dates in RCW 80.80.040(3)(c). NEW SECTION. Sec. 106. A new section is added to chapter 80.80 RCW to read as follows: (1) By January 1, 2012, the governor on behalf of the state shall enter into a memorandum of agreement that takes effect on April 1, 2012, with the owners of a coal-fired baseload facility in Washington that emitted more than one million tons of greenhouse gases in any calendar year prior to 2008.

(2) If at any time during the last six months of a biennium the board finds that the actual and an ticipated applications for qualified projects in rural counties are clearly insufficient to use up the allocations under subsection (1) of thissection, then the board shall estimate th e amount of the insufficiency and during the remainder of the biennium may us e that amount of the allocation for financial assistance to projects not located in rural counties. (3) The board shall solicit qualifying projects to plan, design, and construct public facilities needed to attract new industrial and commercial activities in areas impacted by the closure or potential closure of large coal-fired electric generation facilities, which for the purpos es of this section means a facility that emitted more than one million tons of greenhouse gases in any calendar year prior to 2008. The projects should be consistent with any applicable plans for major industrial activity on lands formerly used or designated for surface coal mining and supporting uses under RCW 36.70A.368. When the board receives timely and eligible project applications from a political subdivision of the stateCh. 180 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1342 ]for financial assistance for such projects, the board from available funds shall give priority consideration to such projects. NEW SECTION. Sec. 302. A new section is added to chapter 43.155 RCW to read as follows: The board shall solicit qualifying projects to plan, design, and construct public works projects needed to attract new industrial and commercial activities in areas impacted by the closure or pote ntial closure of large coal-fired electric generation facilities, which for the purposes of this section m eans a facility that emitted more than one million tons of greenhouse gases in any calendar year prior to 2008. The projects should be consistent with any applicable plans for major industrial activity on lands former ly used or designated for surface coal mining and supporting uses under RCW 36.70A.368. When the board receives timely and eligible project applications from a political subdivision of the state for financial assistance for such projects, the board from available funds shall give priority consideration to such projects. NEW SECTION. Sec. 303. A new section is added to chapter 80.04 RCW to read as follows: The legislature finds that an elect rical company's acquisition of coal transition power helps to achieve the state's greenhouse gas emission reductiongoals by effecting an orderly transition to cleaner fuels and supports the state's public policy. NEW SECTION. Sec. 304. A new section is added to chapter 80.04 RCW to read as follows: (1) On the petition of an electrical company, the commission shall approve or disapprove a power purchase agreement for acquisition of coal transition power, as defined in RCW 80.80.010, and the recovery of related acquisition costs. No agreement for an electrical company's acquisition of coal transition power takes effect until it is approved by the commission. (2) Any power purchase agreement for the acquisition of coal transition power pursuant to this section must provide for modification of the power purchase agreement to the satisfaction of the parties thereto in the event that a new or revised emission or performance standard or other new or revisedoperational or financial requirement or limitation directly or indirectly addressing greenhouse gas emissions is imposed by state or federal law, rules, orregulatory requirements. Such a modification to a power purchase agreement agreed to by the parties must be review ed and considered for approval by the commission, considering the circumstances existing at the time of such a review, under procedures and standards set forth in this section. In the event the parties cannot agree to modification of the power purchase agreement, either party to the agreement has the right to terminate the agr eement if it is adversely affected by this new standard, requirement, or limitation. (3) When a petition is filed, the commission shall provide notice to the public and potentially affected parties and set the petition for hearing as an adjudicative proceeding under chapter 34.05 RCW. Any party may request that the commission expedite the hearing of that petition. The hearing of such a petition is not considered a general rate case. The electrical company must file supporting testimony and exhibits together with the power purchase agreement for coal transition power. Information provided by the facility owner to theWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 180 [ 1343 ]purchasing electrical comp any for evaluating the costs and benefits associated with acquisition of coal transition power must be made available to other parties to the petition under a protective order entered by the commission. An administrative law judge of the commission may enter an initial order including findings of fact and conclusions of law, as provided in RCW 80.01.060(3). The commission shall issue a final order that approves or disapproves the power purchase agreement for acquisition of coal transition power within one hundred eighty days after an electrical company files the petition. (4) The commission must approve a power purchase agreement for acquisition of coal transition power pursuant to this section only if thecommission determines that, considering the circumstances ex isting at the time of such a review: The terms of such an agreement provide adequate protection to ratepayers and the elect rical company during the term of such an agreement or in the event of early termination; th e resource is needed by the electrical company to serve its ratepayers and th e resource meets the need in a cost- effective manner as determined under the lowest reasonable cost resourcestandards under chapter 19.280 RCW, including the cost of the power purchase agreement plus the equity co mponent as determined in this section. As part of these determinations, the commission shal l consider, among other factors, the long-term economic risks and benefits to the electrical company and its ratepayers of such a long-term purchase. (5) If the commission has not issued a final order within one hundred eighty days from the date the petition is filed, or if the commission disapproves the petition, the power purchase agreement for acquisition of coal transition power is null and void.

Sec. 1106. RCW 69.51A.900 and 1999 c 2 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: This chapter may be known and cited as the Washington state medical use of ((marijuana )) cannabis act. PART XII MISCELLANEOUS *NEW SECTION. Sec. 1201. (1) The legislature recognizes that there are cannabis producers and cannabis dispensaries in operation as of the effective date of this section that are unregulated by the state and who produce and dispense cannabis for medical use by qualifying patients. The legislatureintends that these producers and dispensa ries become licensed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and that this licensing provides themwith arrest protection so long as they remain in compliance with the requirements of this chapter and the rules adopted under this chapter. The legislature further recognizes that cannabis producers and cannabis dispensaries in current operation are not able to become licensed until the department of agriculture and the department of health adopt rules and, consequently, it is likely they will remain unlicensed until at least January 1, 2013. These producers and dispensary owners and operators run the risk of arrest between the effective date of this section and the time they become licensed. Therefore, the legislature intends to provide them with anaffirmative defense if they meet the requirements of this section.WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 181 [ 1373 ](2) If charged with a violation of state law relating to cannabis, a producer of cannabis or a dispensary and its owners and operators that are engaged in the production or dispensing of cannabis to a qualifying patient or who assists a qualifying patient in the medical use of cannabis is deemed to have established an affirmative defense to such charges by proof of compliance with this section. (3) In order to assert an affirmative defense under this section, a cannabis producer or cannabis dispensary must: (a) In the case of producers, so lely provide cannabis to cannabis dispensaries for the medical use of cannabis by qualified patients; (b) In the case of dispensaries, solely provide cannabis to qualified patients for their medical use; (c) Be registered with the secretary of state as of May 1, 2011;(d) File a letter of intent with the department of agriculture or the department of health, as the case may be, asserting that the producer ordispenser intends to become licensed in accordance with this chapter and rules adopted by the appropriate department; and (e) File a letter of intent with the city clerk if in an incorporated area or to the county clerk if in an unincorporated area stating they operate as aproducer or dispensary and that they comply with the provisions of this chapter and will comply with subsequent department rule making. (4) Upon receiving a letter of intent under subsection (3) of this section, the department of agriculture, the depar tment of health, and the city clerk or county clerk must send a letter of acknowledgment to the producer or dispenser. The producer and disp enser must display this letter of acknowledgment in a prominent place in their facility. (5) Letters of intent filed with a publ ic agency, letters of acknowledgement sent from those agencies, and other materials related to such letters are exempt from public disclosure under chapter 42.56 RCW. (6) This section expires upon the es tablishment of the licensing programs of the department of agriculture and the department of health and thecommencement of the issuance of licen ses for dispensers and producers as provided in this chapter. The depar tment of health and the department of agriculture shall notify the code reviser when the establishment of the licensing programs has occurred. *Sec. 1201 was vetoed. See message at end of chapter. *NEW SECTION. Sec. 1202. A new section is added to chapter 42.56 RCW to read as follows: The following information related to cannabis producers and cannabis dispensers are exempt from disclosure under this section: (1) Letters of intent filed with a public agency under section 1201 of this act; (2) Letters of acknowledgement sent from a public agency under section 1201 of this act; (3) Materials related to letters of intent and acknowledgement under section 1201 of this act. *Sec. 1202 was vetoed.

(b) If the amount in (a)(i) of this subsection exceeds the amount in (a)(ii) of this subsection, the state treasurer shall transfer an amount equal to the difference from the general fund to the health professions account. (2)(a) Annually, beginning July 1, 2016, the department of health shall report the following information to the state treasurer: (i) The expenditures from the health professions account related to the administration of chapter 69.51A RC W for the preceding fiscal year; and (ii) The amounts deposited into the health professions account under sections 702, 802, and 901 of this act during the preceding fiscal year.

Section 1002 of this act takes effect January 1, 2013. *Sec. 1206 was vetoed. See message at end of chapter. Passed by the Senate April 21, 2011. Passed by the House April 11, 2011. Approved by the Governor April 29, 2011, with the exception of certain items that were vetoed. Filed in Office of Secretary of State April 29, 2011. Note: Governor's explanation of partial veto is as follows: \"I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 101, 201, 407, 410, 411, 412, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 701, 703, 704, 5073entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to medical use of cannabis.\" In 1998, Washington voters made the compassionate choice to remove the fear of state criminalprosecution for patients who use medical marijuana for debilitating or terminal conditions. Thevoters also provided patients' physicians and care givers with defenses to state law prosecutions. I fully support the purpose of Initiative 692, and in 2007, I signed legislation that expanded the ability of a patient to receive assistance from a designated provider in the medical use of marijuana, and added conditions and diseases for which medical marijuana could be used. Today, I have signed sections of Engrossed Seco nd Substitute Senate Bill 5073 that retain the provisions of Initiative 692 and provide additional state law protections. Qualifying patients or theirWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 181 [ 1375 ]designated providers may grow cannabis for the patient's use or participate in a collective garden without fear of state law criminal prosecutions. Qualifying patients or their designated providers arealso protected from certain state civil law consequences. Our state legislature may remove state criminal and civil penalties for activities that assist persons suffering from debilitating or terminal conditions. While such activities may violate the federalControlled Substances Act, states are not required to enforce federal law or prosecute people forengaging in activities prohibited by federal law. However, absent congressional action, state lawswill not protect an individual from legal action by the federal government. Qualifying patients and designated providers can evaluate the risk of federal prosecution and make choices for themselves on whether to use or assist another in using medical marijuana. The UnitedStates Department of Justice has made the wise decision not to use federal resources to prosecuteseriously ill patients who use medical marijuana. However, the sections in Part VI, Part VII, and Part VIII of Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5073 would direct employees of the state departments of Health and Agriculture to authorize andlicense commercial businesses that produce, process or dispense cannabis. These sections wouldopen public employees to federal prosecution, and the United States Attorneys have made it clearthat state law would not provide these individuals safe harbor from federal prosecution. No state employee should be required to violate federal criminal law in order to fulfill duties under state law. For these reasons, I have vetoed Sections 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 704, 705, 801, 802, 803, 804, 805, 806 and 807 of Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill5073. In addition, there are a number of sections of Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5073 that are associated with or dependent upon these licensing sections. Section 201 sets forth definitions of terms. Section 412 adds protections for licensed producers, processors and dispensers. Section 901 requires the Department of Health to develop a secure registration system for licensed producers,processors and dispensers. Section 1104 would require a review of the necessity of the cannabisproduction and dispensing system if the federal government were to authorize the use of cannabis formedical purposes. Section 1201 applies to dispensaries in current operation in the interim before licensure, and Section 1202 exempts documents filed under Section 1201 from disclosure. Section 1203 requires the department of health to report certain information related to implementation of thevetoed sections. Because I have vetoed the licensing provisions, I have also vetoed Sections 201,412, 901, 1104, 1201, 1202 and 1203 of Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5073. Section 410 would require owners of housing to allow the use of medical cannabis on their property, putting them in potential conflict with federal law. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 410 ofEngrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5073. Section 407 would permit a nonresident to engage in the medical use of cannabis using documentation or authorization issued under other state or territorial laws. This section would not require these other state or territorial laws to meet the same standards for health care professional authorization as required by Washington law. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 407 ofEngrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5073. Section 411 would provide that a court may permit the medical use of cannabis by an offender, and exclude it as a ground for finding that the offender has violated the conditions or requirements of the sentence, deferred prosecution, stipulated order of continuance, deferred disposition or dispositionalorder. The correction agency or department responsible for the person's supervision is in the bestposition to evaluate an individual's circumstances and medical use of cannabis. For this reason, Ihave vetoed Section 411 of Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5073. I am approving Section 1002, which authorizes studies and medical guidelines on the appropriate administration and use of cannabis. Section 1206 would make Section 1002 effective January 1,2013. I have vetoed Section 1206 to provide the discretion to begin efforts at an earlier date. Section 1102 sets forth local governments' authority pertaining to the production, processing or dispensing of cannabis or cannabis products within their jurisdictions. The provisions in Section 1102 that local governments' zoning requirements cannot \"preclude the possibility of siting licenseddispensers within the jurisdiction\" are without meaning in light of the vetoes of sections providingfor such licensed dispensers. It is with this understanding that I approve Section 1102.Ch. 181 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1376 ]I have been open, and remain open, to legislation to exempt qualifying patients and their designated providers from state criminal penalties when they join in nonprofit cooperative organizations to shareresponsibility for producing, processing and dispensing cannabis for medical use. Such exemptionfrom state criminal penalties should be conditioned on compliance with local government location and health and safety specifications. I am also open to legislation that establishes a secure and confidential registration system to provide arrest and seizure protections under state law to qualifying patients and those who assist them. Unfortunately, the provisions of Section 901 that would provide a registry for qualifying patients anddesignated providers beginning in January 2013 are intertwined with requirements for registration oflicensed commercial producers, processors and dispensers of cannabis. Consequently, I have vetoedsection 901 as noted above. Section 101 sets forth the purpose of the registry, and Section 902 iscontingent on the registry. Without a registry, these sections are not meaningful. For this reason, I have vetoed Sections 101 and 902 of Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5073. I am not vetoing Sections 402 or 406, which establish affirmative defenses for a qualifying patient ordesignated provider who is not registered with the registry established in section 901. Because thesesections govern those who have not registered, this section is meaningful even though section 901 has been vetoed. With the exception of Sections 101, 201, 407, 410, 411, 412, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 701, 703, 704, 705, 181____________________________________ CHAPTER 182 [House Bill 1031] BALLOT ENVELOPES 182AN ACT Relating to ballot envelopes; and amending RCW 29A.40.091.

The instructions that accompany a ballot for a partisan primary must include instructions for voting the applicable ballot style,as provided in chapter 29A.36 RCW. The voter's name and address must be printed on the larger return envelope, which must also contain a declaration by the voter reciting his or her qualifications and stating that he or she has not voted in any other jurisdiction at this election, together with a summary of the penaltiesfor any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. The declaration must clearly inform the voter that it is illegal to vote if he or she is not a United States citizen; it is illegal to vote if he or she has been convicted of a felony and has not had his or her voting rights restored; and, except as otherwise provided by law, itis illegal to cast a ballot or sign a return envelope on behalf of another voter. The return envelope must provide space for the voter to indicate the date on which the ballot was voted and for the voter to sign the oath. It must also contain aspace so that the voter may include a telephone number. A summary of the applicable penalty provisions of this chapter must be printed on the return envelope immediately adjacent to the space for the voter's signature. The signature of the voter on the return envelope must affirm and attest to the statements regarding the qualifications of that voter and to the validity of the ballot. The return envelope may provid e secrecy for the voter's signature andWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 182 [ 1377 ]optional telephone number. For overseas and service voters, the signed declaration on the return envelope constitutes the equivalent of a voter registration for the election or primary for which the ballot has been issued. The voter must be instructed to either return the ballot to the county auditor by whom it was issued or attach sufficient first-class postage, if applicable, and mail the ballot to the appropriate county auditor no later than the day of the election or primary for which the ballot was issued. If the county auditor chooses to forward ballots, he or she must include with the ballot a clear explanation of the qual ifications necessary to vote in that election and must also advise a voter with questions about his or her eligibility to contact the county auditor. This explanation may be provided on the ballot envelope, on an enclosed insert, or printed directly on the ballot itself. If the information is not included, the envelope must clearly indicate that the ballot is not to be forwarded and that return postage is guaranteed. Passed by the House February 23, 2011.

Filed in Office of Secretary of State April 29, 2011. Note: Governor's explanation of partial veto is as follows: \"I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 19, Substitute House Bill 1257 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to adopting the investments of insurers model act.\" This bill updates the statutes on insurer investments to increase financial security and to provide more flexibility for insurers to manage their investments. Section 19 would require the Office of the Insurance Commissioner to submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature, in consultation with the Department of Financial Institutions and the State Investment Board, by December 1, 2011. This is prior to the effective date of the act, July 1,2012. Section 19 would require the Office of the Insurance Commissioner to gather information thatis a redundant to the bill analysis, overly burdensome to obtain, or difficult to analyze prior toimplementation of the law. Further, requiring proposed rules to be submitted to the Governor andLegislature would infringe upon the role of the Insurance Commissioner and would blur the distinction between the Legislature and a state executive office with regard to the rulemaking process.

NEW SECTION. Sec. 15. This act takes effect January 1, 2012. Passed by the House April 13, 2011. Passed by the Senate April 6, 2011. Approved by the Governor April 29, 2011. Filed in Office of Secretary of State April 29, 2011. 189____________________________________ CHAPTER 190 [Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1367] FOR HIRE VEHICLES AND VEHICLE OPERATORS 190AN ACT Relating to for hire vehicles and for hire vehicle operators; adding new sections to chapter 51.12 RCW; adding a new section to chapter 51.16 RCW; adding a new section to chapter 46.72 RCW; adding a new section to chapter 46.72A RCW; adding new sections to chapter 81.72RCW; prescribing penalties; and providing an effective date. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. A new section is added to chapter 51.12 RCW to read as follows: The legislature finds that taxicab, lim ousine, and other for hire vehicle operators are at significant risk of inju ry due to work-related accidents or crimes such as robbery that may not be covered by standard vehicle insurance policies. Since almost all taxicab, limousine, and other for hire vehicle business operations are independent small business franchises, their owners or operatorsmay opt out of industrial insurance coverage without full consideration for the risk of financial exposure to themselves or to their businesses. As a result, health care may be provided to them at public expense or not at all, and erroneous claims may be made by health care providers for insurance coverage, against the state department of labor and industries, private businesses, or the taxicab associations in which certain mu nicipalities require participation. Most for hire vehicle operators do not enjoy the benefit of the broad public policyembodied in this title that mandates industrial insurance protection for workers. The legislature therefore declares that all taxicab, limousine, for hire vehicle businesses, and for hire vehicle operat ors are subject to mandatory industrial insurance coverage under this title. NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 51.12 RCW to read as follows: (1) Any business that owns and operates a for hire vehicle licensed under chapter 46.72 RCW, a limousine under chapter 46.72A RCW, or a 190 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1420 ]chapter 81.72 RCW and the for hire opera tor or chauffeur of such vehicle is within the mandatory coverage of this title. (2) Any business that as owner or agent leases a for hire vehicle licensed under chapter 46.72 RCW, a limousine under chapter 46.72A RCW, or a taxicab under chapter 81.72 RCW to a for hire operator or a chauffeur and the for hire operator or chauffeur of such vehicle is within the mandatory coverage of this title. (3) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a) \"Chauffeur\" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 46.04.115; and (b) \"For hire operator\" means a person who is operating a vehicle for the purpose of carrying persons for compensation. NEW SECTION. Sec. 3. A new section is added to chapter 51.16 RCW to read as follows: (1) For the purposes of section 2 of this act: (a) By no later than January 1, 2012, the department must determine by rule the basis for industrial insurance premiums for: (i) Any business that owns and operates for hire, limousine, or taxicab vehicles; and (ii) any business that owns and leases for hire, limousine, or taxicab vehicles to a business operating suchvehicle; and (b) Not more than ninety days after the department has determined the basis for industrial insurance premiums by rule under (a) of this subsection, the department must assess such premiums on: (i) Any business that owns and operates for hire, limousine, or taxicab vehicles; and (ii) any business that owns and leases for hire, limousine, or taxicab vehicles to a business operating such vehicle.

I am vetoing Section 5 of this bill. I understand the importance of involving livestock growers, feeders, farmers, and businessinterests in guiding this disease traceability program, but that does not necessitate creating a formalcommittee in statute. However, along with this veto, I am directing the director of the Department ofAgriculture to convene an informal advisory group made up of key livestock industry representativesto assist the department as it implements the animal disease traceability program. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 5 of Substitute House Bill 1538.

See message at end of chapter. *Sec. 3. RCW 10.40.200 and 1983 c 199 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: (1) The legislature finds and declares that in many instances involving an individual who is not a citizen of the United States charged with an offensepunishable as a crime under state law, a plea of guilty is entered without the defendant knowing that a conviction of such offense is grounds for deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this section to promote fairness to such accused individuals by requiring in such cases that acceptance of a guilty plea be preceded by an appropriate warning of the special consequences for such adefendant which may result from the plea. It is further the intent of the legislature that at the time of the plea no defendant be required to disclose his or her legal status to the court. (2) Prior to acceptance of a plea of guilty to any offense punishable as a crime under state law, except offenses designated as infractions under statelaw, the court shall determine that the defendant has been advised of the following potential consequences of conviction for a defendant who is not a citizen of the United States: Deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States. A defendant signing a guilty pl ea statement containing the advisement required by this subsection shall be presumed to have received the required advisement. If, after September 1, 1983, the defendant has not been advised as required by this section and the defendant shows that conviction of the offense to which the defendant pleaded guilty may have the consequences for the defendant of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States, the court, on defendant's motion, shall vacate the judgment and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea of guilty and enter a plea of not guilty. Absent a written acknowledgement by the defendant of the advisement required by this subsection, the defendant shall be pres umed not to have received the required advisement. (3) With respect to pleas accepted prior to September 1, 1983, it is not the intent of the legislature that a defendant's failure to receive the advisementrequired by subsection (2) of this section should require the vacation of judgment and withdrawal of the plea or constitute grounds for finding a priorconviction invalid. (4) Prior to acceptance of a plea of guilty to any offense punishable as a crime under state law, except offenses designated as infractions under state law, the court shall advise the defendant that, pursuant to RCW 9.94A.685, the defendant may be subject to early release from custody for removal from theWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 206 [ 1505 ]United States as a consequence of conviction and that the defendant may be able to contest a removal order. *Sec. 3 was vetoed. See message at end of chapter. NEW SECTION. Sec. 4. This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health , or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public in stitutions, and takes effect immediately. Passed by the House April 21, 2011. Passed by the Senate April 21, 2011.Approved by the Governor April 29, 2011, with the exception of certain items that were vetoed. Filed in Office of Secretary of State April 29, 2011. Note: Governor's explanation of partial veto is as follows: \"I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 2 and 3, Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1547 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to the deportation of criminal alien offenders.\" Section 2 requires the Department of Corrections to provide written notice of rights in removal proceedings to all offenders in the department's custody subject to potential conditional release under this statute. Advising offenders of these rights is the responsibility of the federal government at thetime removal proceedings are initiated. Section 3 requires a court to advise a defendant that he or she may be subject to early release from custody for removal from the United States as a consequence of conviction and that the defendant may be able to contest a removal order. Current law and court practices and procedures provide defendants with adequate notice of potential deportation consequences of a plea of guilty. For these reasons, I have vetoed Sections 2 and 3 of Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1547. With the exception of Sections 2 and 3 Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1547 is approved.\" 206____________________________________ CHAPTER 207 [House Bill 1582] FOREST PRACTICES\u2014LAND CONVERSION 207 AN ACT Relating to forest practices applications leading to conversion of land for development purposes; and amending RCW 76.09.050, 76.09.240, and 43.21C.037.

(3) Those forest practices determined by rule of the forest practices board to have a potential for a substantial impact on the environment, and thus to be Class IV practices, require an evaluation by the department of natural resources as to whether or not a detailed statement must be prepared pursuant to this chapter. The evaluation shall be made within ten days from the date the departmentreceives the application. A Class IV forest practice application must be approved or disapproved by the department within thirty calendar days from the date the department receives the appli cation, unless the department determines that a detailed statement must be made , in which case the application must be approved or disapproved by the department within sixty days from the date the department receives the application, unless the commissioner of public lands, through the promulgation of a formal order, determines that the process cannot be completed within such period.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: Sec. 1. RCW 28B.45.014 and 2005 c 258 s 2 are each amended to read as follows: (1) The primary mission of the higher education branch campuses created under this chapter remains to expand access to baccalaureate and ((master's level )) graduate education in underserved urban areas of the state in collaboration with community and technical colleges. The top priority for each of the campuses is to expand courses and degree programs for transfer and graduate students. New degree programs should be driven by the educational needs and demands of students and the community, as well as the economic development needs of local businesses and employers. (2) Branch campuses shall collaborat e with the community and technical colleges in their region to develop articulation agreements, dual admissionspolicies, and other partnerships to ensure that branch campuses serve as innovative models of a two plus two educational system. Other possibilities for collaboration include but are not limited to joint development of curricula and degree programs, colocation of instructio n, and arrangements to share faculty. (3) In communities where a private postsecondary institution is located, representatives of the private institution may be invited to participate in theconversation about meeting the baccalaureate and ((master's level )) graduate needs in underserved urban areas of the state. (4) However, the legislature recognizes there are alternative models for achieving this primary mission. Some campuses may have additional missions in response to regional needs and demands. At selected branch campuses, an innovative combination of instruction and research targeted to support regional economic development may be appropriat e to meet the region's needs for both access and economic viability. Other campuses should focus on becomingmodels of a two plus two educational system through continuous improvement of partnerships and agreements with community and technical colleges. Still other campuses may be best suited to transition to a four-year university or be removed from designation as a branch campus entirely. (5) The legislature recognizes that size, mix of degree programs, and proportion of lower versus upper division and graduate enrollments are factorsWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 208 [ 1513 ]that affect costs at branch campuses. However over time, the legislature intends that branch campuses be funded more similarly to regional universities. (6) ((In consultation with )) Subject to approval by the higher education coordinating board, ((a branch campus may propose legislation to authorize practice-oriented or professional doctoral programs if: (a) Unique research facilities and equipment are located n ear the campus; or (b) the campus can clearly demonstrate student and employer demand in the region that is linked to regional economic development )) in accordance with RCW 28B.76.230, research universities are authorized to develop doctoral degree programs at their branch campuses . (7) ((It is not the legislature's intent to have each campus chart its own future path without legislative guidance. Instead, the legislature intends to consider carefully the mission and model of edu cation that best suits each campus and best meets the needs of students, the community, and the region. )) The higher education coordinating board shall monito r and evaluate ((the addition of lower division students to )) growth of the branch campuses and periodically report and make recommendations to the higher ed ucation committees of the legislature to ensure the campuses continue to follow the priorities established under this chapter.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. The legislature finds that significant changes have been made in recent years to impr ove Washington's mathematics standards. Additional mathematics coursework, at a more rigorous level, will be required for high school graduation. Efforts to increase the rigor of high school mathematics will ultimately not be successful unless students in elementary and middle school are better prepared in mathematics. Succe ssful preparation is more likely to occur if students have th e opportunity to receive instruction from a teacher with proficiency in both mathematics content and effective instructional methods in mathematics for elementary and middle schoolstudents. It is the legislature's intent to encourage elementary teachers who enjoy and excel in mathematics to beco me specialists, and to encourage school districts to assign these specialists to teach elementary and middle school mathematics, thereby transmitting both their expertise and their enthusiasm for the subject to their students. NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 28A.410 RCW to read as follows:Ch. 209 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1514 ](1) For the purposes of this section, an elementary math ematics specialist is a certificated teacher who has demonstr ated at least the following knowledge and skills: (a) Enhanced mathematics content knowledge and skills necessary to provide students in grades kindergarten through eight a deep understanding of the essential academic learning requirem ents and performance expectations in mathematics; (b) Knowledge and skills in a variety of instructional strategies for teaching mathematics content; and (c) Knowledge and skills in instructional strategies targeted for students struggling with mathematics. (2) The legislature encourages the prof essional educator standards board to develop standards for and adopt a sp ecialty endorsemen t for elementary mathematics specialists as defined under this section. (3) School districts may work with local colleges and univ ersities, educator preparation programs, and educational se rvice districts to develop and offer training and professional development opportunities in the knowledge and skills necessary for a teacher to be considered an elementary mathematics specialist under this section. (4) School districts are encouraged to use elementary mathematics specialists for direct instruction of st udents using an itinerant teacher model where the specialist rotates from classroom to classroom within the school.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. The legislature recognizes that existing floating homes, as part of our state's existing houseboat communities, are an important cultural amenity and el ement of our maritime history. These surviving floating home communities are a linkage to the pa st, when our waterways were the focus of commerce, transport, and development. In order to ensure the vitality and long-term survival of these existing floating home communities, consistent with the legislature's goal of allowing their continued use, improvement, and replacement without undue burden, the legislature finds that it is necessary to clarify their legal status. Sec. 2. RCW 90.58.270 and 1971 ex.s. c 286 s 27 are each amended to read as follows: (1) Nothing in this statute shall constitute authority for requiring or ordering the removal of any structures, improvements, docks, fills, or developments placed in navigable waters prior to December 4, 1969, and the consent and authorization of the state of Washington to the impairment of public rights ofnavigation, and corollary rights incidental thereto, caused by the retention and maintenance of said structures, improvements, docks, fills or developments are hereby granted: PROVIDED, That the consent herein given shall not relate to any structures, improvements, docks, fills, or developments placed on tidelands, shorelands, or beds underlying said waters which are in trespass or in violation of state statutes.

(5)(a) A floating home permitted or legally established prior to January 1, 2011, must be classified as a conforming preferred use. (b) For the purposes of this subsection: (i) \"Conforming preferred use\" means that applicable development and shoreline master program regulations may only impose reasonable conditions and mitigation that will not effectively preclude maintenance, repair, replacement, and remodeling of existing floating homes and floating home moorages by rendering these actions impracticable. (ii) \"Floating home\" means a single-family dwelling unit constructed on a float, that is moored, anchored, or otherwise secured in waters, and is not a vessel, even though it may be capable of being towed.WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 212 [ 1521 ]Passed by the House April 14, 2011.

(5) The legislature further finds that currently the department of natural resources lacks a full complement of policy and management tools necessary to protect or manage working forest lands at high risk of conversion. (6) The legislature further finds that through modest enhancements to existing department of natural resources' programs and authorities, thelegislature can expand Washington's ability to protect communities' working forest lands, while simultaneously improving the revenue generating performance of fiduciary trust lands ma naged by the department of natural resources.WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 216 [ 1551 ](7) The legislature further finds that there has been past and present legislative intent to ensure continue d public access for recreation compatible with the purposes of the lands involved.

(1) The department shall, if it establishes a community forest trust program, develop criteria to be used for the identificationand prioritization of forest land that is suitable for potential inclusion in the community forest trust due to its ability to most closely satisfy the goals of the community forest trust outlined in section 3 of this act. (2) In prioritizing forest land for inclus ion in the community forest trust, the department shall give priority consideration to lands that are: (a) The subject of established ma nagement and revenue production objectives of potential local community partners; (b) At greatest risk of conversion; (c) Helping buffer commercial public or private forest lands from encroaching development; (d) Helping to block up other community forest assets to be managed consistently with the community forest trust acquisition; (e) Able to be managed, considering surrounding current or expected future land use, as economically sustainable working forest land either alone or in combination with ad jacent and nearby working forest land, including other lands incorporated into a community forest by the department, a local governmental entity, or a not-for-profit conservation organization managing forest lands; (f) Eligible for trust land transfer capital appropriations; (g) Available for acquisition through existing or new programs or funding; (h) Supporting existing or expanded forest product manufacturing infrastructure; (i) Useful in leveraging funds to match available acquisition moneys;(j) Positioned to have their development rights extinguished through transfer, purchase, conservation easement, lease, or by some other comparable mechanism; or (k) Enhancing state fiduciary trust land revenues by repositioning underperforming state trust lands to provide short and long-term revenues to thattrust.

(2) Following initial agreement between potential local community partners and the department regarding management and revenue production objectives for the lands in question, the local co mmitment to preserving the land as a working forest must be demonstrated by the county, city, or other local entityproviding a financial contribution to the specific community forest of at least fifty percent of the difference between the parcel's appraised fair market value and the parcel's timber and forest land value. The local community contribution may be provided through any means deemed acceptable by the department and the local contributor, including: (a) Traditional financing or bonding; (b) The purchase of conservation easements; or (c) The purchase or transfer of development rights.(3) The local financial contribution must be deposited into the park land trust revolving fund created in RCW 43.30.385 and used solely for acquisition of the community forest trust land parcel or parcels for which it is intended.

Comments and advice should, at a minimum, include plans for how the department willmaintain the land's working status and economic viability objectives through revenue-generating activities that are sufficient to generate ongoing revenue at a level that reimburses administrative costs, while satisfying, or contributing to, identified community conservation and recreation objectives. (4)(a) If, after a good faith effort by all parties, the department and the local advisory committee fail to reach a c onsensus on a conceptual postacquisition management plan for the parcel in question, the department may either adopt amanagement plan informed by the community or recommend to the board that the parcel be divested through the exis ting authority of the department and the board. If the parcel is divested, th en, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, proceeds must return to the pa rk land trust revolving fund created in RCW 43.30.385.

However, local entities are only eligible for reimbursement upon divestiture under this subsection if the board determines that: (i) The subsequent parcel use is likely to remain a working forest, the department secures full fair market value for the parcel, and the local entity'scontribution was not provided by a state or federal grant; or (ii) The funds used as part of the lo cal contribution were originally provided through a grant that requires, as a co ndition of the grant, the repayment of granted dollars if the purposes of the grant are not or cannot be fulfilled and the decision to divest the land creates an inab ility for the purposes of the grant to be fulfilled. NEW SECTION. Sec. 9. (1) Any revenue produced on community forest trust lands must be, consistent with RCW 79.64.040, allocated as follows: (a) All costs incurred by the department in managing the parcel must be fully reimbursed; and (b) After the department's management costs are reimbursed, any remaining revenue must then be prioritized to fulfill the management objectives for the specific parcel as identified in the postacquisition management plan developed under section 8 of this act consistent with the management principles outlined in section 3 of this act.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. The legislature finds that the work that is already underway in exploring the potential of linking Washington's forest products and aeronautics industries in producing a sustainable aviation biofuel with feedstock from the state's public and private forest lands is important to this state's economy and its sustainable energy policies. The sustainable aviation fuelNorthwest initiative has set the stage by beginning the process and initiating stakeholder involvement in assessing the options for developing the biofuel industry in the Northwest. The legislature further finds that th e work that is being done by the department of natural resources and our state research universities in exploring opportunities to develop aviation biofuel in Washington will provide the scientific and technological analyses needed to determine a pathway for the sustainable use of forest biomass to produce biofuels. NEW SECTION. Sec. 2.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: Sec. 1. RCW 76.13.120 and 2004 c 102 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: (1) The legislature finds that the stat e should acquire easements primarily along riparian and other sensitive aquatic areas from qualifying small forest landowners willing to sell or donate such easements to the state provided that the state will not be required to acquire such easements if they are subject to unacceptable liabilities. The legislature therefore establishes a forestry riparianeasement program. (2) The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section and RCW 76.13.100 ((and )), 76.13.110, 76.13.140, and 76.13.160 unless the 2011 Ch. 218 [ 1561 ](a) \"Forestry riparian easement\" m eans an easement covering qualifying timber granted voluntarily to the state by a qualifying small forest landowner. (b) \"Qualifying small forest landowner\" means a landowner meeting all of the following characteristics as of the da te the department offers compensation for a forestry riparian easement: (i) Is a small forest landowner as defined in (d) of this subsection; and (ii) Is an individual, partnership, corporation, or other nongovernmental for- profit legal entity. (c) \"Qualifying timber\" means those forest trees for which the small forest landowner is willing to grant the state a forestry riparian easement and must meet all of the following: (i) The forest trees are covered by a forest practices application that the small forest landowner is required to leave unharvested under the rules adopted under RCW 76.09.055 and 76.09.370 or that is made uneconomic to harvest by those rules((, and for which the small landowner is willing to grant the state a forestry riparian easement. \"Qualifying timber\" is timber )); (ii) The forest trees are within or bordering a commercially reasonable harvest unit as determined under rules ad opted by the forest practices board, or ((timber )) for which an approved forest pr actices application for timber harvest cannot be obtained because of restrictions under the forest practices rules; (iii) The forest trees are located within, or affected by forest practices rules pertaining to any one, or all, of the following: (A) Riparian or other sensitive aquatic areas; (B) Channel migration zones; or (C) Areas of potentially unstable slopes or landforms, verified by the department, and must meet all of the following: (I) Are addressed in a forest practices application; (II) Are adjacent to a commercially reasonable harvest area; and (III) Have the potential to deliver sediment or debris to a public resource or threaten public safety . (((c))) (d) \"Small forest landowner\" means a landowner meeting all of the following characteristics: (i) A forest landowner as defined in RCW 76.09.020 whose interest in the land and timber is in fee or who has rights to the timber to be included in the forestry riparian easement that extend at least fifty years from the date the ((forest practices )) completed forestry riparian easement application associated with the easement is submitted; (ii) A n entity that has harvested from its own lands in this state during the three years prior to the year of application an averag e timber volume that would qualify the owner as a small harvester under RCW 84.33.035; and (iii) A n entity that certifies at the time of application that it does not expect to harvest from its own lands more than the volume allowed by RCW 84.33.035 during the ten years following application. If a landowner's prior three-year average harvest exceeds the limit of RCW 84.33.035, or the landowner expects to exceed this limit during the ten years following application, and that landowner establishes to the ((department of natural resources' )) department's reasonable satisfaction that the harvest lim its were or will be exceeded to raise funds to pay estate taxes or equally co mpelling and unexpected obligations such as court-ordered judgments or extraordinary medical expenses, the landownerCh. 218 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1562 ]shall be deemed to be a small forest landowner. For purposes of determining whether a person qualifies as a small forest landowner, the small forest landowner office, created in RCW 76.13.11 0, shall evaluate the landowner under this definition, pursuant to RCW 76.13.160, as of the date that the forestpractices application is submitted ((or the date the landowner notifies the department that the harvest is to begin with which the forestry riparian easement is associated )) and the date that the department offers compensation for the forestry riparian easement . A small forest landowner can include an individual, partnership, ((corporate )) corporation , or other nongovernmental legal entity. If a landowner grants timber rights to another entity for less than five years, thelandowner may still qualify as a small forest landowner under this section. If a landowner is unable to obtain an approved forest practices application for timber harvest for any of his or her land because of restrictions under the forest practices rules, the landowner may still qu alify as a small forest landowner under this section. (((d) )) (e) \"Completion of harvest\" means that the trees have been harvested from an area and that further entry into that area by mechani zed logging or slash treating equipment is not expected. (3) The department ((of natural resources )) is authorized and directed to accept and hold in the name of the st ate of Washington forestry riparian easements granted by qualifying small forest landowners covering qualifying timber and to pay compensation to such landowners in accordance with ((subsections (6) and (7) of )) this section. The department ((of natural resources )) may not transfer the easements to any entity other than another state agency. (4) Forestry riparian easements shall be effective for fifty years from the date ((the forest practices application associated with the qualifying timber is submitted to the department of natural resources )) of the completed forestry riparian easement application , unless the easement is voluntarily terminated earlier by the department ((of natural resources voluntarily )), based on a determination that termination is in the best interest of the state, or under theterms of a termination clause in the easement. (5) Forestry riparian easements shall be restrictive only, and shall preserve all lawful uses of the easement premises by the landowner that are consistent with the terms of the easem ent and the requirem ent to protect riparian functions during the term of the easement, subject to the restriction that the leave trees required by the rules to be left on th e easement premises may not be cut during the term of the easement. No right of public access to or across, or any public use of the easement premises is created by this statute or by the easement. Forestry riparian easements shall not be deemed to trigger the compensating tax of or otherwise disqualify land from being taxed under chapter 84.33 or 84.34 RCW. (6) ((Upon application of a small forest landowner for a riparian easement that is associated with a forest practi ces application and the landowner's marking of the qualifying timber on the qualifyi ng lands, the small forest landowner office shall determine the compensation to be offered to the small forest landowner as provided for in this section. The small forest landowner office shall also determine the compensation to be offered to a small forest landowner for qualifying timber for which an approved forest practices application forWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 218 [ 1563 ]timber harvest cannot be obtained becau se of restrictions under the forest practices rules. The legislature recogni zes that there is no t readily available market transaction evidence of value fo r easements of this nature, and thus establishes the following methodology to ascertain the value for forestry riparian easements. Values so determined shall not be considered competent evidence of value for any other purpose. The small forest landowner office shall establish the volume of the qualifying timber. Based on that volume and using data obtained or maintained by the department of revenue under RCW 84.33.074 and 84.33.091, the small forest landowner office shall attempt to determine the fair market value of the qualifying timber as of the date the forest practices application associated with the qualifying timber was submitted or the date the landowner notifies the department that the harvest is to begin. Removal of any qualifying timber before the expiration of the easement must be in accordance with the forest practices rules and the terms of the easement. There shall be no reduction in compensation for reentry )) The small forest landowner office shall determine what constitutes a completed application fo r a forestry riparian easement. Such an application shall, at a minimum, in clude documentation of the owner's status as a qualifying small forest landowner, identification of location and the types of qualifying timber, and notification of completion of harvest, if applicable . (7) ((Except as provided in subsection (8) of this section, the small forest landowner office shall, subject to availa ble funding, offer compensation to the small forest landowner in the amount of fifty percent of the value determined in subsection (6) of this section, plus the compliance and reimbursement costs as determined in accordance with RCW 76 .13.140. If the landowner accepts the offer for qualifying timber that will be harvested pursuant to an approved forest practices application, the department of natural resources shall pay the compensation promptly upon (a) completion of harvest in the area covered by the forestry riparian easement; (b) veri fication that there has been compliance with the rules requiring leave trees in the easement area; and (c) execution and delivery of the easement to the department of natural resources. If the landowner accepts the offer for qualifying timber for which an approved forest practices application for timber harvest cannot be obtained because of restrictions under the forest practices ru les, the department of natural resources shall pay the compensation promptly upon (i) verification that there has been compliance with the rules requiring leav e trees in the easement area; and (ii) execution and delivery of the easement to the department of natural resources. Upon donation or payment of compensation, the department of natural resources may record the easement. (8))) Upon receipt of the qualifying small forest landowner's forestry riparian easement application, and subj ect to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific pu rpose, the following must occur: (a) The small forest landowner office shall determine the compensation to be offered to the qualifying small forest landowner for qualifying timber after the department accepts the completed forestry riparian easement application and the landowner has completed marking the boundary of the area containing the qualifying timber. The legislature recogni zes that there is not readily available market transaction evidence of value for eas ements of the nature required by this section, and thus establishes the methodology provided in this subsection toCh. 218 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1564 ]ascertain the value for forestry riparian easements. Values so determined may not be considered competent evidence of value for any other purpose. (b) The small forest landowner office, subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, is responsible for assessing the volume of qualifying timber. However, no more than fifty percent of the total amounts appropriated for the forestry ripari an easement program may be applied to determine the volume of qualifying timber for completed forestry riparian easement applications. Based on the volume established by the small forest landowner office and using data obtained or maintained by the department of revenue under RCW 84.33.074 and 84.33.09 1, the small forest landowner office shall attempt to determine the fair market value of the qualifying timber as of the date the complete forestry riparian easem ent application is received. Removal of any qualifying timber before the expiration of the easement must be in accordance with the forest practices rules and the terms of the easement. There shall be no reduction in compensation for reentry. (8)(a) Except as provided in subsection (9) of this section and subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the small forest landowner office shall offer compensation for qualifying timber to the qualifying small forest landowner in the amount of fifty percent of the value determined by the small forest landowner office, plus the compliance and reimbursement costs as determined in accordance with RCW 76. 13.140. However, compensation for any qualifying small forest landowner for qualifying timber located on potentially unstable slopes or landforms may not exceed a total of fifty thousand dollars during any biennial funding period. (b) If the landowner accepts the offer for qualifying timber, the department shall pay the compensation promptly upon: (i) Completion of harvest in the area within a commercially reasonable harvest unit with which the forestry riparian easement is associated under an approved forest practices application, unless an approved forest practices application for timber harvest cannot be obtained because of restrictions under the forest practices rules; (ii) Verification that the landowner has no outstanding violations under chapter 76.09 RCW or any associated rules; and (iii) Execution and delivery of the easement to the department. (c) Upon donation or payment of compensation, the department may record the easement. (9) For approved forest practices applications ((where )) for which the regulatory impact is great er than the average percen tage impact for all small forest landowners as determined by an analysis by the department ((of natural resources analysis )) under the regulatory fairness act, chapter 19.85 RCW, the compensation offered will be increased to one hundred percent for that portion of the regulatory impact that is in ex cess of the average. Regulatory impact includes all trees ((left in buffers, special management zones, and those rendered uneconomic to harvest by these rules )) identified as qualifying timber . A separate average or high impact regula tory threshold shall be established for western and eastern Washington. Criteria for these measurements and paymentsshall be established by the small forest landowner office.WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 218 [ 1565 ](((9))) (10) The forest practices board shall adopt rules under the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, to implement the forestry riparian easement program, including the following: (a) A standard version ((or versions of all )) of a forestry riparian easement application as well as all additional documents necessary or advisable to create the forestry riparian easements as provided for in this section; (b) Standards for descriptions of the easement premises with a degree of precision that is reasonable in relation to the values involved; (c) Methods and standards for cruises and valuation of forestry riparian easements for purposes of establishing the compensation. The department ((of natural resources )) shall perform the timber cruises of forestry riparian easements required under th is chapter and chapter 76.09 RCW. Timber cruises are subject to amounts appropriated for this purpose. However, no more than fifty percent of the total appropriated fu nding for the forestry riparian easement program may be applied to determine the volume of qualifying timber for completed forestry ripari an easement applications. Any rules concerning the methods and standards for valuations of forestry riparian easements shall apply only to the department ((of natural resources )), qualifying small forest landowners, and the small forest landowner office; (d) A method to determine that a forest practices application involves a commercially reasonable harvest, and adopt criteria for entering into a ((forest )) forestry riparian easement where a commerc ially reasonable harvest is not possible or a forest practices application that has been submitted cannot be approved because of restrictions under the forest practices rules; (e) A method to address blowdown of qualified timber falling outside the easement premises; (f) A formula for sharing of proceeds in relation to the acquisition of qualified timber covered by an easement through the exercise or threats of eminent domain by a federal or state agency with eminen t domain authority, based on the present value of the ((department of natural resources' )) department's and the landowner's relative interests in the qualified timber; (g) High impact regulatory thresholds; (h) A method to determine timber that is qualifying timber because it is rendered uneconomic to harvest by the rules adopted under RCW 76.09.055 and 76.09.370; ((and )) (i) A method for internal department ((of natural resources )) review of small forest landowner office compensation decisions under ((subsection (7) of )) this section; and (j) Consistent with section 5 of this act, a method to collect reimbursement from landowners who received compensa tion for a forestry riparian easement and who, within the first ten years after receipt of compensation for a forestry riparian easement, sells the land on which an easement is located to a nonqualifying landowner .

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. The legislature recognizes that federal regulations include requirements that pertain to contracts funded by federal-aid highway funds. One such requirement is that states must ensure that prime contractors pay subcontractors in full by no later than thirty days after the subcontractor's work is satisfactorily completed. One option for meeting this requirement is to decline to hold retainage from prime contractors. The legislature also recognizes that retainage is currently used to ensure that claims against the contractor are resolved in a timely manner. The legislature intends that the contract bond provided by sureties on behalf of general contractors provides adequate security for claimants under the bond. Sec. 2. RCW 60.28.011 and 2009 c 432 s 5 and 2009 c 219 s 6 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows: (1)(a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, p ublic improvement contracts shall provide, and public bodies shall reserve, a contract retainage not to exceed five percent of the moneys earned by the contractor as a trust fund for the protection and payment of: (((a) )) (i) The claims of any person arising under the contract; and (((b) )) (ii) the state with respect to taxes imposed pursuant to Titles 50, 51, and 82 RCW which may be due from such contractor. (b) Public improvement contracts i nvolving the construction, alteration, repair, or improvement of any highway, road, or street funded in whole or in part by federal transportation funds shall rely upon the contract bond as referred to in chapter 39.08 RCW for the protection and payment of: (i) The claims of any person or persons arising under the cont ract to the extent such claims are provided for in RCW 39.08.010; and (ii) the state with respect to taxes imposed pursuant to Titles 50, 51, and 82 RCW which may be due. The contract bondWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 231 [ 1603 ]must remain in full force and effect until, at a minimum, all claims filed in compliance with chapter 39.08 RCW are resolved. (2) Every person performing labor or furnishing supplies toward the completion of a public improvement contract shall have a lien upon moneys reserved by a public body under the provisions of a public improvement contract. However, the notice of the lie n of the claimant shall be given within forty-five days of completion of the contract work, and in the manner providedin RCW 39.08.030. (3) The contractor at any time may request the contract retainage be reduced to one hundred percent of the value of the work remaining on the project. (a) After completion of all contract work other than landscaping, the contractor may request that the public body release and pay in full the amountsretained during the performance of the contract, and sixty days thereafter the public body must release and pay in full the amounts retained (other than continuing retention of five percent of the moneys earned for landscaping) subject to the provisions of chapters 39.12 and 60.28 RCW. (b) Sixty days after completion of all contract work the public body must release and pay in full the amounts re tained during the performance of the contract subject to the provisions of chapters 39.12 and 60.28 RCW.

Interest on moneys reserved by a public body under the provision of a public improvement contract shall be paid to the contractor; (c) Placed in escrow with a bank or trust company by the public body. When the moneys reserved are placed in escrow, the public body shall issue a check representing the sum of the moneys reserved payable to the bank or trust company and the contractor jointly. Th is check shall be converted into bonds and securities chosen by the contractor and approved by the public body and thebonds and securities shall be held in escrow. Interest on the bonds and securities shall be paid to the contractor as the interest accrues. (5) The contractor or subcontractor may withhold payment of not more than five percent from the moneys earned by any subcontractor or sub-subcontractoror supplier contracted with by the cont ractor to provide labor, materials, or equipment to the public project. When ever the contractor or subcontractor reserves funds earned by a subcontractor or sub-subcontractor or supplier, the contractor or subcontractor shall pay interest to the subcontractor or sub- subcontractor or supplier at a rate equa l to that received by the contractor or subcontractor from reserved funds. (6) A contractor may submit a bond for all or any portion of the contract retainage in a form acceptable to the public body and from a bonding companymeeting standards established by the public body. The public body shall accept a bond meeting these requirements unless the public body can demonstrate good cause for refusing to accept it. This bond and any proceeds therefrom are subjectto all claims and liens and in the same manner and priority as set forth for retained percentages in this chapter. The public body shall release the bonded portion of the retained fund s to the contractor within thirty days of accepting theCh. 231 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1604 ]bond from the contractor.

Thecontractor shall then release the fund s retained from the subcontractor or supplier to the subcontractor or supplier within thirty days of accepting the bond from the subcontractor or supplier. (7) If the public body administering a contract, after a substantial portion of the work has been completed, finds that an unreasonable delay will occur in the completion of the remaining portion of the contract for any reason not the result of a breach thereof, it may, if the contractor agrees, delete from the contract the remaining work and accept as final the im provement at the stage of completion then attained and make payment in proportion to the amount of the workaccomplished and in this case any amounts retained and accumulated under this section shall be held for a period of sixty days following the completion. In the event that the work is terminated before final completion as provided in this section, the public body may thereafter en ter into a new contract with the same contractor to perform the remaining wo rk or improvement for an amount equal to or less than the cost of the remainin g work as was provided for in the original contract without advertisement or bid. The provisions of this chapter are exclusive and shall supersede all provisions and regulations in conflict herewith. (8) Whenever the department of transportation has contracted for the construction of two or more ferry vessels, sixty days after completion of allcontract work on each ferry vessel, the department must release and pay in full the amounts retained in connection with th e construction of the vessel subject to the provisions of RCW 60.28.021 and chapter 39.12 RCW. However, the department of transportation may at its discretion condition the release of funds retained in connection with the completed ferry upon the contractor delivering a good and sufficient bond with two or more sureties, or with a surety company, in the amount of the retained funds to be released to the contractor, conditioned that no taxes shall be certified or claims filed for work on the ferry after a period ofsixty days following completion of the ferry; and if taxes are certified or claims filed, recovery may be had on the bon d by the department of revenue, the employment security department, the department of labor and industries, and thematerial suppliers and laborers filing claims.

(10) Contracts on projects funded in whole or in part by farmers home administration and subject to farmers home administration regulations are not subject to subsections (1) through (9) of this section. (11) This subsection applies only to a p ublic body that has contracted for the construction of a facility using the general contractor/construction managerprocedure, as defined under RCW 39.10.210. If the work performed by a subcontractor on the project has been completed within the first half of the time provided in the general contractor/construction manager contract for completing the work, the public body may accept the completion of the subcontract. The public body must give public notice of th is acceptance. After a forty-five day period for giving notice of liens, and compliance with the retainage release procedures in RCW 60.28.021, the public body may release that portion of theWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 231 [ 1605 ]retained funds associated with the subcontract.

The legislature further finds and declares that the previous scheme for regulating the behavior of nonlawyers and other unauthorized persons who provide immigration-related services is inadequate to address the level of unfair and deceptive practices that exists in the marketplace and often contributes to the unauthorized practice of law . It is the intent of the legislature, through this act, to ((establish rules of practice and conduct for immigration assistants to promote honesty and fair dealing with residents and to preserve public confidence )) prohibit nonlawyers and other unauthorized persons from providing immigration-related services that constitute the practice of law .

Sec. 9. (1)(a) The legislature recognizes that immigrants in Washington need legal services to as sist them in immigration matters, and it is difficult for existing organizations to meet those needs because of high caseloads and limited resources. (b) The legislature also recognizes that the difference between offering nonlegal services and offering legal services in immigration matters is sometimes difficult to distinguish.

Early action on the part of Washington, Oregon, and California to collaboratively define and implement such planning efforts and projects will increase the states' ability to determine the course of federalplanning processes for the west coast and receive nonstate support for the planning efforts, resource preservation an d restoration projects, and projects to support ocean health and sustainable coastal communities. (5) Therefore, collaboration on ocean and coastal resource management between Washington, Oregon, and California should be continued and enhancedthrough the respective legislatures, as well as through the respective executive branches through the west coast go vernor's agreement on ocean health. Sec. 2. RCW 43.372.070 and 2010 c 145 s 10 are each amended to read as follows: (1) The marine resources stewardship trust account is created in the state treasury.

Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. (2) Expenditures from the account may only be used for the purposes of marine management planning, marine sp atial planning, research, monitoring, implementation of the marine management plan, and for the restoration orenhancement of marine habitat or resources. (3) When moneys are deposited into the marine resources stewardship trust account, the governor must provide reco mmendations on expenditures from the account to the appropriate committees of the legislature prior to the next regular legislative session. The recommended pr ojects and activities must be consistent with: (a) The allowable uses of the marine resources stewardship trust account; and (b) The priority areas identified in the west coast governor's agreement on ocean health, entered into on September 18, 2006, and recognized in section 1 of this act.

Filed in Office of Secretar y of State May 6, 2011. Note: Governor's explanation of partial veto is as follows: \"I am returning herewith, without my approval as to section 24, Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1634 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to underground utilities.\" This bill strengthens our law for preventing damages to underground pipelines and other utilities during excavation. The bill provides the Utilities and Transportation Commission with the authorityto take enforcement action for violations, to require reporting of damage to underground utilities, andto develop a stakeholder process to review violations and encourage better excavation practices. Thebill provides a comprehensive damage prevention program for underground utilities. Pursuant to the House floor colloquy on this bill, section 24 was intended to ensure that the bill would not result in regulation by the Utilities and Transportation Commission of consumer-ownedutilities such as electric cooperatives, municipal utilities and public utility districts, except when sucha utility damages an underground facility subject to this bill, in which case the Commission would have the authority to enforce the provisions of this act. While the House floor colloquy clarifies legislative intent, the language in Section 24 could be read to exempt consumer-owned utilities from enforcement under the bill, and thereby prevent theCommission from taking enforcement action on underground utility damage caused by consumer- owner utilities. Since the language in this section does not change the statutory independence of consumer-owned utilities in setting their rates and determining their services, the section is notnecessary. For these reasons, I have vetoed section 24 of Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1634. With the exception of section 24, Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1634 is approved.\" 263____________________________________ CHAPTER 264 [Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1636] SPORTS OFFICIALS\u2014AMATEUR 264 AN ACT Relating to amateur sports officials; amending RCW 50.04.245; and adding a new section to chapter 50.04 RCW.

The administrator shall encourage enrollees who have been continually enrolled on basic health for a period of one year or more to complete a health risk assessment and participate in programs approved by the administrator that may include wellness, smoking cessation, and chronic disease management programs. In approving programs, the administrator shall considerevidence that any such programs are prove n to improve enrollee health status.

The administrator will consider the impact ofeligibility determination by the appropriate federal agency designated by the Trade Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-210) as well as the premium collection and remittance activities by the United States internal revenue service when determining the administrative cost charged for health coverage tax credit eligible enrollees. (e) An employer or other financial sponsor may, with the prior approval of the administrator, pay the premium, rate, or any other amount on behalf of a subsidized or nonsubsidized enrollee, by arrangement with the enrollee and through a mechanism acceptable to the admi nistrator. The administrator shall establish a mechanism for receiving pr emium payments from the United States internal revenue service for health co verage tax credit eligible enrollees.

(6) To limit enrollment of persons who qualify for subsidies so as to prevent an overexpenditure of appropriations for such purposes. Whenever the administrator finds that there is da nger of such an overexpenditure, the administrator shall close enrollment until the administrator finds the danger nolonger exists. Such a closure does no t apply to health coverage tax credit eligible enrollees who recei ve a premium subsidy from the United States internal revenue service as long as the enrollees qualify for the health coverage tax credit program. To prevent the risk of overexpenditure, the administrator maydisenroll persons receiving subsidies from the program based on criteria adopted by the administrator. The criteria may in clude: Length of continual enrollment on the program, income level, or eligibility for other coverage. The administrator shall ((first attempt to )) identify enrollees who are eligible for other coverage, and, working with the depa rtment of social and health service as provided in RCW 70.47.010(5)(d), transition enrollees currently eligible for ((medical assistance )) federally financed categori cally needy or medically needy programs administered under chapter 74.09 RCW to that coverage.

The administrato r shall endeavor to assure that covered basic health care services are available to any enrollee of the plan from among a selection of two or more participating ma naged health care systems. In adopting any rules or procedures applicable to managed health care systems and in its dealings with such systems, the administrator shall consider and make suitable allowance for the need for health care services and the differences in local availability of health care resources, al ong with other resources, within and among the several areas of the state. Contracts with participating managed health care systems shall en sure that basic health plan enrollees who become eligible for medical assistance may, at th eir option, continue to receive services from their existing providers within the managed health care system if such providers have entered into provider agreements with the department of social and health services. (10) To receive periodic premiums from or on behalf of subsidized, nonsubsidized, and health coverage tax cr edit eligible enrollees, deposit them in the basic health plan operating account, keep records of enrollee status, and authorize periodic payments to managed health care systems on the basis of the number of enrollees participating in the respective managed health care systems.

Th e application is also considered an application for medical assistance unde r chapter 74.09 RCW and must include a social security number, if availabl e, for each family member requesting coverage. Funds received by a family as pa rt of participatio n in the adoption support program authorized under RCW 26.33.320 and ((74.13.100 through 74.13.145 )) 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 shall not be counted toward a family's current gross family income for the purposes of this chapter. When an enrollee fails to report income or inco me changes accurately, the administrator shall have the authority either to bill the enrollee for the amounts overpaid by the state or to impose civil penalties of up to two hundred percent of the amount of subsidy overpaid due to the enrollee incorrectly reporting income. TheWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 284 [ 1787 ]administrator shall adopt rules to define the appropriate application of these sanctions and the processes to implement the sanctions provided in thissubsection, within available resources. No subsidy may be paid with respect toany enrollee whose current gross family income exceeds twice the federalpoverty level or, subject to RCW 70.47.110, who is a recipient of medicalassistance or medical care services under chapter 74.09 RCW. If a number ofenrollees drop their enrollment for no apparent good cause, the administratormay establish appropriate rules or requi rements that are applicable to such individuals before they will be allowed to reenroll in the plan. (12) To accept applications from business owners on behalf of themselves and their employees, spouses, and de pendent children, as subsidized or nonsubsidized enrollees, who reside in an area served by the plan.

The administrator may require that a businessowner pay at least an amount equal to what the employee pays after the statepays its portion of the subsidized premium cost of the plan on behalf of eachemployee enrolled in the plan. Enrollment is limited to those not eligible formedicare who wish to enroll in the plan and choose to obtain the basic health care coverage and services from a managed care system participating in the plan.The administrator shall adjust the amount determined to be due on behalf of orfrom all such enrollees wh enever the amount negotiated by the administrator with the participating managed health care system or systems is modified or theadministrative cost of providing th e plan to such enrollees changes. (13) To determine the rate to be pa id to each participating managed health care system in return for the provision of covered basic health care services toenrollees in the system. Although the schedule of covered basic health careservices will be the same or actuarially equivalent for similar enrollees, the ratesnegotiated with participating managed h ealth care systems may vary among the systems. In negotiating rates with participating systems, the administrator shallconsider the characteristics of the populat ions served by the respective systems, economic circumstances of the local area, the need to conserve the resources of the basic health plan trust account, and other factors the administrator finds relevant. (14) To monitor the provision of covered services to enrollees by participating managed health care system s in order to assure enrollee access to good quality basic health care, to require periodic data reports concerning theutilization of health care services rende red to enrollees in order to provide adequate information for evaluation, an d to inspect the books and records of participating managed health care syst ems to assure compliance with the purposes of this chapter. In requiring reports from participating managed healthcare systems, including data on services rendered enrollees, the administrator shall endeavor to minimize costs, both to the managed health care systems and to the plan.

((To the extent authorized in the operating budget, )) Enrollment in medical care services may not result in expenditures that exceed th e amount that has been appropriated in the operating budget. If it appears that continued enrollment will result in expenditures exceeding the appropriated leve l for a particular fiscal year, the department may freeze new enrollment and establish a waiting list of eligible persons who may receive benefits only when sufficient funds are available. Upon implementation of a federal medi caid 1115 waiver providing federal matching funds for medical care services, ((these services also may be provided to persons who have been terminated from disability lifeline benefits under RCW 74.04.005(5)(h) )) persons subject to termination of disability lifeline benefits under RCW 74.04.005(5)(h) remain enrolled in medical care services and persons subject to denial of disability lifeline benefits under RCW 74.04.005(5)(h) remain eligible for medical care services .

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: *NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. (1) The legislature finds that: (a) Providing students with the opportunity to graduate from high school with the knowledge and skills to be successful in today's world is now clearly part of Washington's definition of a basic education. Some students will only achieve this objective with supplemental interventions, support, and counseling; (b) Dropout prevention is a fundamental strategy for strengthening society, building the economy, reducing crime, reducing government spending,and increasing individual freedom and opportunity; (c) There are known and proven strategies to reduce the dropout rate, including ones that are successful for high-risk and troubl ed students. For example, the opportunity internship program, the jobs for America'sgraduates program, the building bridges program, and individualized student support services provided by the college success foundation have all had a measurable impact on helping at-risk students be successful in school. In addition, the Everett school district successfully increased its extended graduation rate from fifty-three percent in 2003 to ninety percent in 2010 by tracking the progress toward graduation of each student and assigning success coordinators to ensure students pursued all possible avenues to complete and make up credits. The Renton school district, through a combination of leadership, community partnerships and resources, and high expectations for all students, has increased its graduation rate to ninety percent, with ninety-six percent of graduating seniors in 2010 meeting proficiency on the state high school assessments. However, these types of models have never been brought to scale; and (d) For every dropout prevented, the ch ances of that person committing a crime are reduced by twenty percent, and that person stands to increase his or her lifetime earnings by three hundred thousand dollars in today's dollars. In addition, for every dropout prevented, taxpayers save an estimated tenWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 288 [ 1799 ]thousand five hundred dollars per year fo r each year of the individual's life between the ages of twenty and sixty-five. (2) Therefore, the state should use a dual strategy of making front-end investments in proven programs in orde r to expand them into an effective dropout prevention and intervention system, while simultaneously recognizing and rewarding actual success in reduci ng the dropout rate by investing a portion of the savings generated from each prevented dropout in the public schools. (3) The legislature recognizes that the current fiscal climate in the state is a likely contributing factor to an increase in dropout rates. Reductions in statefunding for schools are often felt first in student support services, counseling, supplemental instruction and tutoring, and increased class size, all of which affect struggling students. A poor economy negatively affects families through unemployment, uncertainty, and reduced public services, and students bring these stresses with them to school. If allowed to go unaddressed, these economic and fiscal circumstances are li kely to slow or reverse progress on improving high school completion rates. Therefore, a concentrated effort at improvement is required at this time. *Sec. 1 was vetoed. See message at end of chapter. NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 28A.175 RCW to read as follows: (1) The pay for actual student success (PASS) program is created under this section and sections 3 through 8 of this act to invest in proven dropout prevention and intervention programs as provided in section 3 of this act and provide a financial award for high schools that demonstrate improvement in the dropout prevention indicators established under section 4 of this act. The legislature finds that increased accu mulation of credits and reductions in incidents of student discipline lead to improved graduation rates. (2) The office of the superintendent of public instruction, the workforce training and education coordinating board, the building bridges working group,the higher education coordinating board, and the college scholarship organization under section 3(4) of this act shall collaborate to assure that the programs under section 3 of this act operate systematically and are expanded to include as many additional students and schools as possible. NEW SECTION. Sec. 3. A new section is added to chapter 28A.175 RCW to read as follows: Subject to funds appropriated for this purpose, funds shall be allocated as specified in the omnibus appropriatio ns act to support the PASS program through the following programs: (1) The opportunity internship program under RCW 28C.18.160 through 28C.18.168; (2) The jobs for America's graduates program administered through the office of the superintendent of public instruction; (3) The building bridges program under RCW 28A.175.025, to be used to expand programs that have been implemented by building bridges partnershipsand determined by the building bridges work group to be successful in reducing dropout rates, or to replicate such programs in new partnerships; and (4) Individualized student support services provided by a college scholarship organization with expertise in managing scholarships for low-Ch. 288 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1800 ]income, high potential students and foster care youth under contract with the higher education coordinating board, including but not limited to college and career advising, counseling, tutoring, community mentor programs, and leadership development. NEW SECTION. Sec. 4. A new section is added to chapter 28A.175 RCW to read as follows: (1) The office of the superintendent of public instruction, in consultation with the state board of education, must: (a) Calculate the annual extended graduation rate for each high school, which is the rate at which a class of students enters high school as freshmen andgraduates with a high school diploma, including students who receive a high school diploma after the year they were expected to graduate. The office may statistically adjust the rate for student demographics in the high school, including the number of students elig ible for free and reduced price meals, special education and English language l earner students, students of various racial and ethnic backgrounds, and student mobility; (b) Annually calculate the proportion of students at grade level for each high school, which shall be measured by the number of credits a student hasaccumulated at the end of each school year compared to the total number required for graduation. For the purposes of this subsection (1)(b), the officeshall adopt a standard definition of \"a t grade level\" for each high school grade; (c) Annually calculate the proportion of students in each high school who are suspended or expelled from school, as reported by the high school. In-school suspensions shall not be included in the calculation. Improvement on the indicator under this subsection (1)(c) shall be measured by a reduction in the number of students suspended or expelled from school; and (d) Beginning with the 2012-13 school year, annually measure student attendance in each high school as provided under section 10 of this act. (2) The office of the superintendent of public instruction may add dropout prevention indicators to the list of indicators under subsection (1) of this section, such as student grades, state assessment mastery, or student retention. (3) To the maximum extent possible, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall rely on data collected through the comprehensiveeducation data and research system to calculate the dropout prevention indicators under this section and shall minimize additional data collection from schools and school districts unless necessary to meet the requirements of this section.

However, if the director waives in whole or in part any such payments due a self- insurer, the self-insurer shall be reimbursed the amount waived from the self- insured employer overpayment reimbursement fund. (b) The department shall collect info rmation regarding self-insured claim overpayments resulting from final decisions of the board and the courts, and recoup such overpayments on behalf of the self-insurer from any open, new, or reopened state fund or self-insured clai ms. The department shall forward the amounts collected to the self-insurer to whom the payment is owed. The department may provide information as needed to any self-insurers from whom payments may be collected on behalf of the department or another self-insurer. Notwithstanding RCW 51.32.040, any self-insurer requested by the department to forward payments to the department pursuant to this subsection shall pay theCh. 290 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1816 ]department directly. The department shall credit the amounts recovered to the appropriate fund, or forward amounts coll ected to the appropriate self-insurer, as the case may be.

To this end, the department or self-insurers shall utilize the services of individuals and organizations, public or private, whose experience, training, and interests in vocational rehabilitation and retraining qualify them to lend expert assistance to the supervisor of industrialinsurance in such programs of vocational rehabilitation as may be reasonable to make the worker employable consistent with his or her physical and mental status. Where, after evaluation and recommendation by such individuals or organizations and prior to final evaluation of the worker's permanent disability and in the sole opinion of the supervisor or supervisor's designee, whether or not medical treatment has been concluded, vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to en able the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment, the supervisor or supervisor's designee may, in his or hersole discretion, pay or, if the employer is a self-insurer, direct the self-insurer to pay the cost as provided in subsection (((3) )) (4) of this section or RCW 51.32.099, as appropriate. An injured worker may not participate in vocationalrehabilitation under this section or RCW 51.32.099 if such participation would result in a payment of benefits as described in RCW 51.32.240(5), and any benefits so paid shall be recovered according to the terms of that section.

RCW 51.32.099 and 2009 c 353 s 5 are each amended to read as follows: (1)(a) The legislature intends to create improved vocational outcomes for Washington state injured workers and employers through legislative and regulatory change under a pilot program for the period of January 1, 2008, through June 30, 2013. This pilot vocational system is intended to allow opportunities for eligible workers to participate in meaningful retraining in high- demand occupations, improve successful return to work and achieve positive outcomes for workers, reduce the inci dence of repeat vocational services, increase accountability and responsibility, and improve cost predictability. Tofacilitate the study and evaluation of the results of the proposed changes, the department shall establish the temporary funding of certain state fund vocational costs through the medical aid account to ensure the appropriate assessments toemployers for the costs of their claims for vocational services in accordance with RCW 51.32.0991.

The department may adopt rules, in collaboration with thesubcommittee created under (c)(iii) of this subsection, to further define the scope and elements of the required study. Reports of the independent researcher aredue on December 1, 2010, December 1, 2011, and December 1, 2012. (c) In implementing the pilot program, the department shall: (i) Establish a vocational initiative project that includes participation by the department as a partner with WorkSource, the established state system that administers the federal workforce investment act of 1998. As a partner, the department shall place vocational professional full-time employees at pilot WorkSource locations; refer some workers for vocational services to these vocational professionals; and work with employers in work source pilot areas to market the benefits of on-the-job training programs and with communitycolleges to reserve slots in high employer demand programs of study as defined in RCW 28B.50.030. These on-the-job training programs and community college slots may be considered by both department and private sector vocational professionals for vocational pl an development. The department will also assist stakeholders in developing additional vocational training programs invarious industries, including but not limited to agriculture and construction. These programs will expand the choices available to injured workers inWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 291 [ 1825 ]developing their vocational training pl ans with the assistance of vocational professionals. (ii) Develop and maintain a register of state fund and self-insured workers who have been retrained or have selected any of the vocational options described in this section for at least the duration of the pilot program. (iii) Create a vocational rehabilitation subcommittee made up of members appointed by the director for at least the duration of the pilot program.

(b) When the supervisor or supervisor's designee has decided that vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to make the worker employable atgainful employment, he or she shall be provided with services necessary to develop a vocational plan that, if completed, would render the workeremployable. The vocational professional assigned to the claim shall, at the initial meeting with the worker, fully inform the worker of the return-to-workpriorities set forth in RCW 51.32.095(2) and of his or her rights and responsibilities under the workers' compensation vocational system. The department shall provide tools to the vocational professional for communicating this and other information required by RCW 51.32.095 and this section to the worker.

The additional days may be allowed by the department with or without a request from the employer. The extension may only be granted if the employer made a return-to-work offer to the worker within fifteen days of the date the worker commenced vocational plan developm ent that met some but not all of the requirements in this section. To be valid, the offer must be for bona fide employment with the employer of injury, consistent with the worker's documented physical and mental restrictio ns as provided by the worker's health care provider.

(d) Following the time period described in (c) of this subsection, the employer may still provide, and the worker may accept, any valid return-to-work offer. The worker's acceptance of such an offer shall result in the termination of vocational plan development or implementation services and temporary total disability compensation effective the day the employment begins. (3)(a) All vocational plans must contain an accountability agreement signed by the worker detailing expectations regarding progress, attendance, and other factors influencing successful participation in the plan. Failure to abide by the agreed expectations shall result in suspension of vocational benefits pursuant toRCW 51.32.110. (b) Any formal education included as part of the vocational plan must be for an accredited or licensed program or othe r program approved by the department. The department shall develop rules that provide criteria for the approval ofnonaccredited or unlicensed programs. (c) The vocational plan for an indivi dual worker must be completed and submitted to the department within ninety days of the day the workercommences vocational plan development. The department may extend the ninety days for good cause. Criteria for good cause shall be provided in rule. The frequency and reasons for good cause extensions shall be reported to the subcommittee created under subsecti on (1)(c)(iii) of this section. (d) Costs for the vocational plan may include books, tuition, fees, supplies, equipment, child or dependent care, training fees for on -the-job training, the cost of furnishing tools and other equipment necessary for self-employment or reemployment, and other necessary expenses in an amount not to exceed twelve thousand dollars.

The worker shall receive temporary total disability compensation under RCW 51.32.090 and the cost of transportation while he or she is actively and successful ly participating in a vocational plan. (f) If the worker is required to reside away from his or her customary residence, the reasonable cost of board and lodging shall also be paid. (4) V ocational plan development servi ces shall be completed within ninety days of commencing. Except as provided in RCW 51.32.095(3), d uring vocational plan development the worker sh all, with the assistance of a vocational professional, participate in vocational counseling and occupational exploration to include, but not be limited to, identifying possible job goals, training needs, resources, and expenses, consistent with th e worker's physical and mental status. A vocational rehabilitation plan shall be developed by the worker and the vocational professional and submitted to the department or self-insurer. Following this submission, the worker shall elect one of the following options: (a) Option 1: The department or self-insurer implements and the worker participates in the vocational plan developed by the vocational professional and approved by the worker and the depart ment or self-insurer. For state fund claims, the department must review and approve the vocational plan before implementation may begin. If the department takes no action within fifteen days, the plan is deemed approved. The worker may, within fifteen days of the department's approval of the plan ((by the department )) or of a determination that the plan is valid following a dispute , elect option 2. However, in the sole discretion of the supervisor or supervisor's designee, the department may approve an election for option 2 benefits that was submitted in writing within twenty-five days of the department's approval of the plan or of a determination that the plan is valid following a dispute if the worker provides a written explanation establishing that he or she was unable to submit his or her election of option 2 benefits within fifteen days. In no circumstance may the department approve of an election for option 2 benefits that was submitted more than twenty-five days after the department's approval of a retraining plan or of a determination that a plan is valid following a dispute. (i) Following successful completion of the vocational plan, any subsequent assessment of whether vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely toenable the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment under RCW 51.32.095(1) shall include consideration of transferable skills obtained inthe vocational plan. (ii) If a vocational plan is successfully completed on a claim which is thereafter reopened as provided in RCW 51.32.160, the cost and duration available for any subsequent vocational plan is limited to that in subsection (3)(d) and (e) of this section, less that previously expended. (b) Option 2: The worker declines further vocational services under the claim and receives an amount equal to six months of temporary total disability compensation under RCW 51.32.090. The award is payable in biweekly payments in accordance with the schedule of temporary total disability payments, until such award is paid in full. These payments shall not include interest on the unpaid balance. Howeve r, upon application by the worker, and at the discretion of the department, the compensation may be converted to a lumpsum payment. The vocational costs defined in subsection (3)(d) of this sectionCh. 291 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1828 ]shall remain available to the worker, upon application to the department or self-insurer, for a period of five years. The vocational costs shall, if expended, be available for programs or courses at any accredited or licensed institution or program from a list of those approved by the department for tuition, books, fees, supplies, equipment, and tools, without department or self-insurer oversight. The department shall issue an order as provided in RCW 51.52.050 confirming the option 2 election, setting a payment schedule, and terminating temporary total disability benefits effective the date of the order confirming that election . The department shall thereafter close th e claim. A worker who elects option 2 benefits shall not be entitled to further temporary total, or to permanent total, disability benefits except upon a showing of a worsening in the condition or conditions accepted under the claim such that claim closure is not appropriate, in which case the option 2 selection will be rescinded and the amount paid to the worker will be assessed as an overpayment. A claim that was closed based on the worker's election of option 2 benefits may be reopened as provided in RCW 51.32.160, but cannot be reopened for the sole purpose of allowing the worker to seek vocational assistance. (i) If within five years from the date the option 2 order becomes final, the worker is subsequently injured or suffer s an occupational disease or reopens the claim as provided in RCW 51.32.160, and vocational rehabilitation is found both necessary and likely to enable the in jured worker to become employable at gainful employment under RCW 51.32.095(1), the duration of any vocationalplan under subsection (3)(e) of this section shall not exceed eighteen months. (ii) If the available vocational co sts are utilized by the worker, any subsequent assessment of whether vocational rehabilitation is both necessaryand likely to enable the injured work er to become employable at gainful employment under RCW 51.32.095(1) shall include consideration of the transferable skills obtained. (iii) If the available vocational costs are utilized by the worker and the claim is thereafter reopened as provided in RCW 51.32.160, the cost available for any vocational plan is limited to that in subsection (3)(d) of this section less that previously expended. (iv) Option 2 may only be elected once per worker. (c) The director, in his or her sole discretion, may provide the worker vocational assistance not to exceed that in subsection (3) of this section, without regard to the worker's prior option selection or benefits expended, where vocational assistance would prevent permanent total disability under RCW 51.32.060. (5)(a) As used in this section, \"v ocational plan interruption\" means an occurrence which disrupts the plan to th e extent the employability goal is no longer attainable. \"Vocational plan interruption\" does not include institutionally scheduled breaks in educational programs, occasional absence due to illness, or modifications to the plan which will allow it to be completed within the cost and time provisions of subsection (3)(d) and (e) of this section. (b) When a vocational plan interruption is beyond the control of the worker, the department or self-insurer shall recommence plan development. If necessary to complete vocational services, the cost and duration of the plan may include credit for that expended prior to the interruption. A vocational plan interruption is considered outside the control of the worker when it is due to the closure ofWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 291 [ 1829 ]the accredited institution, when it is due to a death in the worker's immediate family, or when documented change s in the worker's accepted medical conditions prevent further participation in the vocational plan. (c) When a vocational plan interruption is the result of the worker's actions, the worker's entitlement to benefits shall be suspended in accordance with RCW 51.32.110. If plan development or im plementation is recommenced, the cost and duration of the plan shall not include credit for that expended prior to the interruption. A vocational plan interruption is considered a result of the worker's actions when it is due to the failure to meet attendance expectations set by the training or educational institution, failure to achieve passing grades or acceptable performance review, unaccepted or postinjury conditions that prevent further participation in the vocational plan, or the worker's failure to abide by the accountability agreement per subsection (3)(a) of this section.

(3) A child seeking to petition under this section shall be provided counsel at no cost to the child. (4) The petition must be signed by the child in the absence of a showing of good cause as to why the child could not do so. (5) If, after a threshold hearing to cons ider the parent's apparent fitness and interest in reinstatement of parental rights, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the best in terests of the child may be served by reinstatement of parental rights, the juvenile court shall order that a hearing on the merits of thepetition be held. (6) The court shall give prior notice fo r any proceeding under this section, or cause prior notice to be given, to the de partment or the supervising agency, the child's attorney, and the child. The co urt shall also order the department or supervising agency to give prior noti ce of any hearing to the child's former parent whose parental rights are the subject of the petition, any parent whose rights have not been terminated, the child's current foster parent, relative caregiver, guardian or custodian, an d the child's tribe, if applicable. (7) The juvenile court shall conditionally grant the petition if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that th e child has not achieved his or her permanency plan and is not likely to i mminently achieve his or her permanency plan and that reinstatement of parental ri ghts is in the child's best interest. In determining whether reinstatement is in the child's best interest the court shallconsider, but is not limited to, the following: (a) Whether the parent whose rights are to be reinstated is a fit parent and has remedied his or her deficits as provided in the record of the prior termination proceedings and prior termination order; (b) The age and maturity of the child, an d the ability of the child to express his or her preference;WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 292 [ 1833 ](c) Whether the reinstatement of parental rights will present a risk to the child's health, welfare, or safety; and (d) Other material changes in circumstances, if any, that may have occurred which warrant the granting of the petition. (8) In determining whether the child has or has not achieved his or her permanency plan or whethe r the child is likely to achieve his or her permanency plan, the department or supervising agency shall provide the court, and the court shall review, information related to any efforts to achieve the permanency plan including efforts to achieve adop tion or a permanent guardianship. (9)(a) If the court conditionally grants the petition under subsection (7) of this section, the case will be continued for six months and a temporary order of reinstatement entered. During this pe riod, the child shall be placed in the custody of the parent. The department or supervising agency shall develop apermanency plan for the ch ild reflecting the plan to be reunification and shall provide transition services to the family as appropriate. (b) If the child must be removed from the parent due to abuse or neglect allegations prior to the expiration of the conditional six-month period, the court shall dismiss the petition for reinstatement of parental rights if the court finds the allegations have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. (c) If the child has been successfully placed with the parent for six months, the court order reinstating parental rights remains in effect and the court shalldismiss the dependency. (10) After the child has b een placed with the parent for six months, the court shall hold a hearing. If the placement with the parent has been successful, the court shall enter a final order of reinst atement of parental rights, which shall restore all rights, powers, privileges, im munities, duties, and obligations of the parent as to the child, including those re lating to custody, control, and support of the child. The court shall dismiss the de pendency and direct the clerk's office to provide a certified copy of the final orde r of reinstatement of parental rights to the parent at no cost. (11) The granting of the petition under this section does not vacate or otherwise affect the validity of the original termination order.

(13) A proceeding to reinstate parental rights is a separate action from the termination of parental rights proceed ing and does not vacate the original termination of parental rights. An order granted under this section reinstates the parental rights to the child. This reinstatement is a recognition that the situation of the parent and child have changed sin ce the time of the termination of parental rights and reunification is now appropriate. (14) This section is retroactive and applies to any child who is under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court at the time of the hearing regardless of the dateparental rights were terminated. (15) The state, the department, the supervising agency, and its employees are not liable for civil damages resulting from any act or omission in theprovision of services under this section, unless the act or omission constitutesCh. 292 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1834 ]gross negligence. This section does not create any duty and shall not be construed to create a duty where none ex ists. This section does not create a cause of action against the state, the de partment, the supervising agency, or its employees concerning th e original termination. Sec. 3.

This chapter shall be known and cited as the \"Washington stat e Indian child welfare act.\" NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. APPLICATION. This chapter shall apply in all child custody proceedings as that term is defined in this chapter. Whenever there is a conflict between chapter 13.32A, 13.34, 13.36, 26.10, or 26.33 RCW, the provisions of this chapter shall apply.WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 309 [ 1957 ]NEW SECTION. Sec. 3. INTENT. The legislature finds that the state is committed to protecting the essential tribal relations and best interests of Indian children by promoting practices desi gned to prevent out-of-home placement of Indian children that is inconsistent with the rights of the parents, the health,safety, or welfare of the children, or the interests of their tribe. Whenever out-of- home placement of an Indian child is ne cessary in a proceeding subject to the terms of the federal Indian child welfare act and in this chapter, the best interests of the Indian child may be served by placing the Indian ch ild in accordance with the placement priorities expressed in this chapter. The legislature further findsthat where placement away from the parent or Indian custodian is necessary for the child's safety, the state is committed to a placement that reflects and honorsthe unique values of the child's tribal culture and is best able to assist the Indian child in establishing, developing, and maintaining a political, cultural, social, and spiritual relationship with the child's tribe and tribal community. It is the intent of the legislature that this chapter is a step in clarifying existing laws and codifying existing polic ies and practices. This chapter shall not be construed to reject or eliminate current policies and practices that are not included in its provisions. The legislature further intends that nothing in this chapter is intended to interfere with policies and procedures th at are derived from agreements entered into between the department and a tribe or tribes, as authorized by section 109 of the federal Indian child welfare act. Th e legislature finds that this chapter specifies the minimum requi rements that must be applied in a child custody proceeding and does not prevent the department from providing a higher standard of protection to the right of any Indian child, parent, Indian custodian, or Indian child's tribe. It is also the legislature's intent that the department's policy manual on Indian child welfare, the tribal-state agreement, and releva nt local agreements between individual federally recognized tribes and the department should serve as persuasive guides in the interpretation and implementation of the federalIndian child welfare act, this chapter, and other relevant state laws.

(f) Uncertainty by a parent, guardian, legal custodian, relative, or other suitable person that the alleged abuser has in fact abused the child shall not,alone, be the basis upon which a child is removed from the care of a parent, guardian, or legal custodian under (a) of this subsection, nor shall it be a basis, alone, to preclude placement with a relative or other suitable person under (b) of this subsection. (6)(a) A shelter care order issued pursuant to this section shall include the requirement for a case conference as provided in RCW 13.34.067. However, ifthe parent is not present at the shelter care hearing, or does not agree to the case conference, the court shall not include the requirement for the case conference in the shelter care order.

(1) The court shall order one of the following dispositions of the case: (a) Order a disposition other than removal of the child from his or her home, which shall provide a program designed to alleviate the immediate danger to the child, to mitigate or cure any damage the child has already suffered, and to aid the parents so that the child will not be endangered in the future. In determining the disposition, the court should choose services to assist the parents in maintaining the child in the home, includ ing housing assistance, if appropriate, that least interfere with family autonomy and are adequate to protect the child. (b)(i) Order the child to be removed from his or her home and into the custody, control, and care of a relative or other suitable person, the department,or a supervising agency for supervision of the child's placement. The court may not order an Indian child, as defined in ((25 U.S.C. Sec. 1903 )) section 4 of this act, to be removed from his or her home unless the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that thecontinued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. (ii) The department or supervising agency has the auth ority to place the child, subject to review and approval by the court (A) with a relative as defined in RCW 74.15.020(2)(a), (B) in the home of another suitable person if the childor family has a preexisting relationship with that person, and the person has completed all required criminal hist ory background checks and otherwise appears to the department or supervising agency to be suitable and competent toprovide care for the child, or (C) in a foster family home or group care facility licensed pursuant to chapter 74.15 RCW.

The department or supervising agency may only place a child with a person not related to the childas defined in RCW 74.15.020(2)(a) when the court finds that such placement is in the best interest of the child. Unless there is reasonable cause to believe that the health, safety, or welfare of the child would be jeopardized or that efforts to reunite the parent and child will be hi ndered, the child sha ll be placed with a person who is willing, appropriate, and available to care for the child, and who is: (I) Related to the child as defined in RCW 74.15.020(2)(a) with whom the child has a relationship and is comfortable; or (II) a suitable person as described in this subsection (1)(b). The cour t shall consider the child's existing relationships and attachments when determining placement. (2) When placing an Indian child in out-of-home care, the department or supervising agency shall follow the placement preference characteristics in ((RCW 13.34.250 and in 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1915 )) section 18 of this act . (3) Placement of the child with a relative or other suitable person as described in subsection (1)(b) of this section shall be given preference by the court.

(4) If the court has ordered a child removed from his or her home pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section, the court shall consider whether it is in achild's best interest to be placed with, have contact with, or have visits with siblings. (a) There shall be a presumption that such placement, contact, or visits are in the best interests of the child provided that: (i) The court has jurisdiction over all siblings subject to the order of placement, contact, or visitation pursuant to petitions filed under this chapter orthe parents of a child for whom there is no jurisdiction are willing to agree; and (ii) There is no reasonable cause to believe that the health, safety, or welfare of any child subject to the order of pl acement, contact, or visitation would be jeopardized or that efforts to reunite th e parent and child would be hindered by such placement, contact, or visitation. In no event shall parental visitation time be reduced in order to provide sibling visitation. (b) The court may also order placement, contact, or visitation of a child with a step-brother or step-sister provided that in addition to the factors in (a) of thissubsection, the child has a relationship and is comfortable with the step-sibling. (5) If the court has ordered a child removed from his or her home pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section an d placed into nonparental or nonrelative care, the court shall order a placement that allows the child to remain in the same school he or she attended prior to th e initiation of the dependency proceeding when such a placement is practical and in the child's best interest. (6) If the court has ordered a child removed from his or her home pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section, the court may order that a petition seeking termination of the parent and child relationship be filed if the requirements of RCW 13.34.132 are met.

However, if such relative or other person appears otherwise suitable and competent to provide care and treatment, the criminal history background check need not be completed before placement, but as soon as possible after placement. Anyplacements with relatives or other suitable persons, pursuant to this section, shall be contingent upon cooperation by the re lative or other suitable person with the agency case plan and compliance with court orders related to the care and supervision of the child including, bu t not limited to, court orders regarding parent-child contacts, sibling contacts, and any other conditions imposed by theWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 309 [ 1979 ]court. Noncompliance with the case plan or court order shall be grounds for removal of the child from the relative's or other suitable person's home, subject to review by the court. Sec. 28. RCW 13.34.132 and 2000 c 122 s 16 are each amended to read as follows: A court may order that a petition seekin g termination of the parent and child relationship be filed if the following requirements are met: (1) The court has removed the child from his or her home pursuant to RCW 13.34.130; (2) Termination is recommended by the department or the supervising agency; (3) Termination is in the best interests of the child; and (4) Because of the existence of aggrav ated circumstances, reasonable efforts to unify the family are not required .

Sec. 1903) )) section 4 of this act , the court shall also consid er tribal efforts to assist the parent in completing treatment and make it possible for the child to returnhome; (h) An infant under three year s of age has been abandoned; (i) Conviction of the parent, when a child has been born of the offense, of: (A) A sex offense under chapter 9A.44 RCW; or (B) incest under RCW9A.64.020. Sec. 29. RCW 13.34.136 and 2009 c 520 s 28 and 2009 c 234 s 5 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows: (1) Whenever a child is ordered removed from the home, a permanency plan shall be developed no later than sixty days from the time the supervising agencyCh. 309 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1980 ]assumes responsibility for providing services, including placing the child, or at the time of a hearing under RCW 13.34.130, whichever occurs first. The permanency planning process continues until a permanency planning goal is achieved or dependency is dismissed. The planning process shall include reasonable efforts to return the child to the parent's home. (2) The agency supervising the de pendency shall submit a written permanency plan to all parties and the co urt not less than fourteen days prior to the scheduled hearing. Responsive reports of parties not in agreement with thedepartment's or supervising agency's proposed permanency plan must be provided to the department or supervising agency, all other parties, and the court at least seven days prior to the hearing. The permanency plan shall include: (a) A permanency plan of care that shall identify one of the following outcomes as a primary goal and may identify additional outcomes as alternative goals: Return of the child to the home of the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian; adoption, including a tribal customary adoption as defined in section 4 of this act ; guardianship; permanent legal custody; long-term relative or foster care, until the child is age eighteen, with a written agreement between the parties and the care provider; successful comp letion of a responsible living skills program; or independent living, if approp riate and if the child is age sixteen or older. The department or supervising agency shall not discharge a child to anindependent living situation before the ch ild is eighteen years of age unless the child becomes emancipated pur suant to chapter 13.64 RCW; (b) Unless the court has ordered, pursuant to RCW 13.34.130(((5) )) (6) , that a termination petition be filed, a specific plan as to where the child will beplaced, what steps will be taken to return the child home, what steps the supervising agency or the department will take to promote existing appropriate sibling relationships and/or facilitate placement together or contact in accordance with the best interests of each child, and what actions the department or supervising agency will take to maintain parent-child ties. All aspects of theplan shall include the goal of achieving permanen ce for the child. (i) The department's or supervising agen cy's plan shall specify what services the parents will be offered to enable them to resume custody, what requirements the parents must meet to resume cust ody, and a time limit for each service plan and parental requirement. (ii) Visitation is the right of the family, including the child and the parent, in cases in which visitation is in the best interest of the child. Early, consistent, andfrequent visitation is crucial for maintaining parent-child relationships and making it possible for parents and children to safely reunify. The supervising agency or department shall encourage th e maximum parent and child and sibling contact possible, when it is in the best interest of the child, including regularvisitation and participation by the parents in the care of the child while the child is in placement. Visitation shall not be limited as a sanction for a parent's failure to comply with court orders or services where the health, safety, or welfare of the child is not at risk as a result of the visitation. Visitation may be limited or denied only if the court determines that such limitation or denial is necessary to protect the child's health, safety, or welfare. The court and the department orsupervising agency should rely upon community resources, relatives, foster parents, and other appropriate persons to provide transportation and supervisionWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 309 [ 1981 ]for visitation to the extent that such reso urces are available, and appropriate, and the child's safety would not be compromised. (iii) A child shall be placed as close to the child's home as possible, preferably in the child's own neighborho od, unless the court finds that placement at a greater distance is necessary to pr omote the child's or parents' well-being.

(v) Unless it is not in the best interests of the child, whenever practical, the plan should ensure the child remain s enrolled in the school the child was attending at the time the child entered foster care. (vi) The supervising agency or department shall provide all reasonable services that are available within the de partment or supervising agency, or within the community, or those services which the department has existing contracts to purchase. It shall report to the court if it is unable to provide such services; and (c) If the court has ordered, pursuant to RCW 13.34.130(((5) )) (6) , that a termination petition be filed, a specific plan as to where the child will be placed, what steps will be taken to achieve pe rmanency for the child, services to be offered or provided to the child, and, if visitation would be in the best interests ofthe child, a recommendation to the court regarding visitation between parent and child pending a fact-finding hearing on the termination petition. The departmentor supervising agency shall not be required to develop a plan of services for the parents or provide services to the parents if the court orders a terminationpetition be filed. However, reasonable efforts to ensure visitation and contact between siblings shall be made unless there is reasonable cause to believe the best interests of the child or siblings would be jeopardized. (3) Permanency planning goals should be achieved at the earliest possible date. If the child has been in out-of -home care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months, the court shall requir e the department or supervising agency to file a petition seeking termination of parental rights in accordance with RCW 13.34.145(3)(b)(vi). In cases where parental rights have been terminated, the child is legally free for adoption, and adoption has been identified as the primary permanency planning goal, it shall be a go al to complete the adoption within six months following entry of the termination order. (4) If the court determines that the continuation of reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the n eed to remove the child from his or her home or to safely return the child home should not be part of the permanency plan of care for the child, reasonable efforts shall be made to place the child in a timely manner and to complete whatever steps are necessary to fi nalize the permanent placement of the child. (5) The identified outcomes and goals of the permanency plan may change over time based upon the circumstances of the particular case. (6) The court shall consider the child's relationships with the child's siblings in accordance with RCW 13.34.130(((3) )) (4) . Whenever the permanency plan for a child is adoption, the court sh all encourage the prospective adoptive parents, birth parents, foster parents, kinship caregivers, and the department orother supervising agency to seriously cons ider the long-term benefits to the child adoptee and his or her siblings of providing for and facilitating continuingpostadoption contact between the siblings. To the extent that it is feasible, andCh. 309 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1982 ]when it is in the best interests of the ch ild adoptee and his or her siblings, contact between the siblings should be frequent and of a similar nature as that which existed prior to the adoption. If the child adoptee or his or her siblings are represented by an attorney or guardian ad litem in a proceeding under this chapter or in any other child custody pr oceeding, the court shall inquire of each attorney and guardian ad litem regarding the potential benefits of continuingcontact between the siblings and the potential detriments of severing contact. This section does not require the depart ment of social and health services or other supervising agency to agree to any specific provisions in an open adoption agreement and does not create a new obligation for the department to provide supervision or transportation for visits between siblings separated by adoption from foster care.

(b) \"Permanent custody order\" means a custody order entered pursuant to chapter 26.10 RCW. (c) \"Permanent legal custody\" means legal custody pursuant to chapter 26.10 RCW or equivalent laws of anothe r state or a federally recognized Indian tribe. Sec. 30.

RCW 74.13.350 and 2004 c 183 s 4 are each amended to read as follows: It is the intent of the legislature that parents are responsible for the care and support of children with developmental disabilities. The legislature recognizes that, because of the intense suppor t required to care for a child with developmental disabilities, the help of an out-of-home placement may be needed. It is the intent of the legislat ure that, when the sole reason for the out- of-home placement is the child's developmental disability, such services beoffered by the department to these children and their families through a voluntary placement agreement. In thes e cases, the parents shall retain legal custody of the child. As used in this section, \"voluntary placement agreement\" means a written agreement between the department and a child's parent or legal guardian authorizing the department to place the child in a licensed facility. Under theterms of this agreement, the parent or legal guardian shall retain legal custodyand the department shall be responsible for the child's placement and care. Theagreement shall at a minimum specify the legal status of the child and the rightsand obligations of the parent or legal guardian, the child, and the department while the child is in placement. The agreement must be signed by the child's parent or legal guardian and the depart ment to be in effect, except that an agreement regarding an In dian child shall not be valid unless executed ((in writing before the court and filed with the court as provided in RCW 13.34.245 )) in accordance with section 15 of this act . Any party to a voluntary placement agreement may terminate the agreement at any time. Upon termination of the agreement, the child shall be returned to the care of the child's parent or legal guardian unless the child has been taken into custody pursuant to RCW 13.34.050 or 26.44.050, placed in shelter care pursuant to RCW 13.34.060, orplaced in foster care pursuant to RCW 13.34.130. in this section, \"out-o f-home placement\" and \"out-of-home care\" mean the placement of a child in a foster family home or group care facilitylicensed under chapter 74.15 RCW. Whenever the department places a child in out-of-home care under a voluntary placement pursuant to this section, the department shall have theresponsibility for the child's placement and care. The department shall develop apermanency plan of care for the child no later than sixty days from the date that the department assumes responsibility for the child's placement and care. Withinthe first one hundred eighty days of the placement, the department shall obtain a judicial determination pursuant to RCW 13.04.030(1)(j) and 13.34.270 that theplacement is in the best interests of the child. If the child's out-of-home placement ends before one hundred eigh ty days have elapsed, no judicial determination under RCW 13.04.030(1)(b) is required. The permanencyplanning hearings shall review whether the child's best interests are served bycontinued out-of-home placement and determ ine the future legal status of the child. The department shall provide for periodic administrative reviews as required by federal law. A review may be called at any time by either thedepartment, the parent, or the legal guardian.Ch. 309 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 1986 ]Nothing in this section shall prevent the department from filing a dependency petition if there is reason to believe that the child is a dependent child as defined in RCW 13.34.030. The department shall adopt rules providing for the implementation of chapter 386, Laws of 1997 and the transfer of responsibility for out-of-homeplacements from the dependency proces s under chapter 13.34 RCW to the process under this chapter. It is the intent of the legislature that the department undertake voluntary out- of-home placement in cases where the child's developmental disability is such that the parent, guardian, or legal custodian is unable to provide the necessary care for the child, and the parent, guar dian, or legal custodian has determined that the child would benefit from pl acement outside of the home. If the department does not accept a voluntary placement agreement signed by the parent, a petition may be filed and an action pursued under chapter 13.34 RCW.The department shall inform the parent, guardian, or legal custodian in writing of their right to civil action under chapter 13.34 RCW. Nothing in this section prohibits th e department from seeking support from parents of a child, including a child with a developmental disability if the childhas been placed into care as a result of an action under chapter 13.34 RCW, when state or federal funds are expended for the care and maintenance of that child or when the department receives an application for services from the physical custodian of the child, unless the department finds that there is goodcause not to pursue collection of child support against the parent or parents.

The current economic development system's data-gathering and evaluation methods are inconsistent and unable to provide adequate information for determining how well the system is performing on a regular basis so th e system may be held accountable for its outcomes. The legislature also finds that developing a comprehensive economic development strategic plan to guide the operation of effective economic development programs, including workforce training, infrastructure development, small business assistance, technology transfer, and export assistance, is vital to the state's efforts to increase the competitiveness of state businesses, encourage employment gr owth, increase state revenues, and generate economic well-being.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. (1) The legislature finds that: (a) Efforts are needed across the health care system to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of health care services provided in Washington state and to improve care outcomes for patients. (b) Some health care services currently provided in Washington state present significant safety, efficacy, or co st-effectiveness concerns. Substantial variation in practice patterns or high utilization trends can be indicators of poor quality and potential waste in the health care system, without producing better care outcomes for patients. (c) State purchased health care programs should partner with private health carriers, third-party purchasers, and health care providers in shared efforts to improve quality, health outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of care. (2) The legislature declares that collaboration among state purchased health care programs, private health carriers, third-party purchasers, and health careproviders to identify appropriate strategies that will increase the effectiveness of health care delivered in Washington state is in the best interest of the public. The legislature therefore intends to exempt from state antitrust laws, and to provideimmunity from federal antitrust laws through the state action doctrine, for activities undertaken pursuant to efforts designed and implemented under this act that might otherwise be constrained by such laws. The legislature does not intend and does not authorize any person or entity to engage in activities or toconspire to engage in activities that would constitute per se violations of state and federal antitrust laws including, but not limited to, agreements among competing health care providers or health carriers as to the price or specific level of reimbursement for health care services. (3) The legislature intends that the Robert Bree collaborative established in section 3 of this act provide a mechanism through which public and private health care purchasers, health carriers, and providers can work together to identify effective means to improv e quality health outcomes and cost- effectiveness of care. It is not the inte nt of the legislature to mandate payment or coverage decisions by private health care purchasers or carriers. Sec. 2. RCW 70.250.010 and 2009 c 258 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: The definitions in this section appl y throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise. (1) \"Advanced diagnostic imaging services\" means magnetic resonance imaging services, computed tomogr aphy services, positron emission tomography services, cardiac nuclear medicine services, and similar new imaging services. (2) \"Authority\" means the Washin gton state health care authority.Ch. 313 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 2000 ](3) \"Collaborative\" means the Robert Bree collaborative established in section 3 of this act. (4) \"Payor\" means ((public purchasers and )) carriers licensed under RCW. (((4) \"Public purchaser\" means the depart ment of social and health services, the department of health, the department of labor and industries, the authority, and the Washington state health insurance pool )) (5) \"Self-funded health plan\" means an employer-sponsored health plan or Taft-Hartley plan that is not provided through a fully insured health carrier .

The collaborative shall identify hea lth care services for which there are substantial variation in practice patterns or high utilization trends in Washingtonstate, without producing better care outcomes for patients, that are indicators of poor quality and potential waste in the h ealth care system. On an annual basis, the collaborative shall iden tify up to three health care services it will address. (2) For each health care service id entified, the collaborative shall: (a) Analyze and identify evidence- based best practice approaches to improve quality and reduce variation in use of the service, including identification of guidelines or protocols a pplicable to the hea lth care service. In evaluating guidelines, the collaborative should identify the highest quality guidelines based upon the most rigorous and transparent methods foridentification, rating, and translation of evidence into practice recommendations. (b) Identify data collection and reporting necessary to develop baseline health service utilization rates and to measure the impact of strategies adoptedunder this section. Methods for data collection and reporting should strive to minimize cost and administrative effort related to data collection and reportingwherever possible, including the use of existing data resources and nonfee-based tools for reporting. (c) Identify strategies to increase use of the evidence-based best practice approaches identified under (a) of this subsection in both state purchased and privately purchased health care plans. St rategies considered should include, but are not limited to: Identifying goals for appropriate utilization rates and reduction in practice variation among providers; peer-to-peer consultation or second opinions; provider feedback reports; use of patient decision aids; incentives for appropriate use of health care services; centers of excellence or other provider qualification standards; quality improvement systems; and service utilization and outcomes reporting, including public reporting. In developing strategies, the collaborative should strongly consider related efforts of organizations such as the Puget Sound health alliance, the Washington state hospital association, the national quality forum, the joint commission on accreditation of health care organizatio ns, the national committee for quality assurance, the foundation for health care quality, and, where appropriate, more focused quality improvement efforts, such as the Washington state perinatal advisory committee and the Washington state surgical care and outcomesWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 313 [ 2001 ]assessment program. The collaborative shall provide an opportunity for public comment on the strategies chosen be fore finalizing their recommendations. (3) If the collaborative chooses a h ealth care service for which there is substantial variation in practice patterns or a high or low utilization trend inWashington state, and a lack of evidence-based best practice approaches, it should consider strategies that will promote improved care outcomes, such as patient decision aids, provider feedback reports, centers of excellence or other provider qualification standards, and research to improve care quality andoutcomes. (4) The governor shall appoint twenty members of the collaborative, who must include: (a) Two members, selected from health carriers or third-party administrators that have the most fully insured and self-funded covered lives in Washington state.

Each clinical committee shall include at least two members of the specialty or subspecialty society most experienced with the health service identified for review. (7) Permanent and ad hoc members of the collaborative or any of its committees may not have personal financial conflicts of interest that could substantially influence or bias their participation. If a collaborative or committee member has a personal financial conflict of interest with respect to a particular health care service being addressed by the collaborative, he or she shall disclose such an interest. The collaborative must determine whether the member should be recused from any delib erations or decisions related to that service.

(10) The collaborative shall actively solicit federal or private funds and in- kind contributions necessary to complete its work in a timely fashion. The collaborative shall not accept private funds if receipt of such funding could present a potential conflict of interest or bias in the collaborative's deliberations.Available state funds may be used to support the work of the collaborative when the collaborative has selected a health care service that is a high utilization or high-cost service in state purchased health care programs or the health care service is undergoing evaluation in one or more state purchased health care programs and coordination will reduce dupli cation of efforts. The collaborative shall not begin the work described in th is section unless sufficient funds are received from private or federal resources, or available state funds.

Sections 5 and 6 of this act are necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public in stitutions, and take effect immediately. Passed by the Senate April 18, 2011. Passed by the House April 7, 2011. Approved by the Governor May 11, 2011. Filed in Office of Secretary of State May 11, 2011. 315____________________________________Ch. 316 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 2036 ]CHAPTER 316 [Substitute Senate Bill 5394] PRIMARY CARE HEALTH HOMES\u2014CHRONIC CARE MANAGEMENT 316AN ACT Relating to primary care health homes and chronic care management; amending RCW 43.70.533 and 70.47.100; reenacting and amending RCW adding a new section to chapter 74.09 RCW; and adding new sections to chapter 41.05 RCW. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. A new section is added to chapter 74.09 RCW to read as follows: The legislature finds that: (1) Health care costs are growing rapidly, exceeding the consumer price index year after year. Consequently, state health programs are capturing a growing share of the state budget, even as state revenues have declined. Sustaining these critical health programs will require actions to effectively contain health care cost in creases in the future; and (2) The primary care health home model has been demonstrated to successfully constrain costs, while improving quality of care. Chronic care management, occurring within a primar y care health home, has been shown to be especially effective at reducing costs and improving quality. However, broad adoption of these models has been impeded by a fee-for-service system that reimburses volume of services and does not adequately support important primary care health home services, such as case management and patient outreach. Furthermore, successful impl ementation will require a broad adoption effort by private and public payers, in coordination with providers. Therefore the legislature intends to promote the adoption of primary care health homes for children and adults a nd, within them, advance the practice of chronic care management to improve health outcomes and reduce unnecessary costs. To facilitate the best coordina tion and patient care, primary care health homes are encouraged to collaborate with other providers currently outside the medical insurance model. Successful chronic care management for persons receiving long-term care services in addition to medical care will require close coordination between primary care provid ers, long-term care workers, and other long-term care service providers, includin g area agencies on aging.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: PART I FINDINGS NEW SECTION. Sec. 101. FINDINGS. (1) Recognizing that uncoordinated and poorly pl anned growth poses a threat to the environment, sustainable economic development, and the health, safety, and high quality of life enjoyed by residents of this state, the legislature passed the growth management act, chapter 36.70A RCW. The planning goals adopted through the growth management act encourage deve lopment in urban areas where public facilities and services exist or can be provided efficiently, conservation of productive forest and agricultural lands, and a reduction of sprawl.WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 318 [ 2051 ](2) Under RCW 36.70A.090 and 43.362.005 the legislature has encouraged: (a) The use of innovative land use management techniques, including the transfer of development rights, to meet growth management goals; and (b) The creation of a regional transfer of development rights marketplace in the central Puget Sound to assist in c onserving agricultural and forest land, as well as other lands of state or regional priority. (3) The legislature finds that:(a) Local governments are in need of additional resources to provide public infrastructure to meet the needs of a growing population, and that public infrastructure is fundamental to community health, safety, and economic vitality. Investment in public infrastructure in growing urban areas supports growth management goals, encourages the redevelopment of underutilized or blighted urban areas, stimulates business activity an d helps create jobs, lowers the cost of housing, promotes efficient land use, and improves residents' quality of life; (b) Transferring development rights fr om agricultural and forest lands to urban areas where public facilities and services exist or can be provided efficiently and cost-effectively will ensure vibrant, economically viable communities. Directing growth to communities where people can live close to where they work or have access to transportation choices will also advance state goals regarding climate change by re ducing vehicle miles traveled and by reducing fuel consumption and emissions that contribute to climate change.Directing growth to these communities will further help avoid the impacts of storm water runoff to Puget Sound by a voiding impervious surfaces associated with development in watershed uplands; (c) A transfer of development rights ma rketplace is particularly appropriate for conserving agricultural and forest land of long-term commercial significance. Transferring the developm ent rights from these lands of statewide importance to cities will help achieve a specific goal of the growth managementact by keeping them in farming and fore stry, thereby helping ensure these remain viable industries in counties experienci ng population growth. Transferring growth from agricultural and forest land of long-term commercial significance will also reduce costs to the counties that otherwise would be responsible for the provision of infrastructure and services for development on these lands, which are generally further from existing infrastructure and services; and (d) The state and its residents benefit from investment in public infrastructure that is associated with ur ban growth facilitated by the transfer of development from agricultural and fo rest lands of long-term commercial significance. These activi ties advance multiple state growth management goals and benefit the state and local economies. It is in the public interest to enable local governments to finance such infrastructure investments and to incentivize development right transfers in the centr al Puget Sound thro ugh this chapter.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. A new section is added to chapter 28B.30 RCW to read as follows: (1) The legislature finds that access to baccalaureate and graduate degree programs continues to be limited for re sidents of north Snohomish, Island, and Skagit counties. Studies conducted by the state board for community and technical colleges, the higher education coordinating board, and the council of presidents confirm that enrollment in higher education compared to demand in this geographic region lags behind enrollment in other parts of the state, particularly for upper-division courses leading to advanced degrees. (2) The legislature also finds that acce ss to high employer demand programs of study is imperative for the state's global competitiveness and economic prosperity, particularly those degrees in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields that align with the workforce skill demands of the regional economy, that support the aerospace industry, and provide skilled undergraduate and graduate-degree engineers required by the largest employers in the aerospace industry cluster. (3) The legislature finds that meeting the long-range goal of greatly expanded access for the population of the region to the widest array of baccalaureate and graduate programs can best be accomplished by assigning responsibility to a research university with multiple experiences in similar settings.Ch. 321 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 2078 ](4) Management and leadership of the University Center of North Puget Sound is assigned to Washington State University to meet the needs of the Everett metropolitan area and the north Snohomish, Island, and Skagit county region and the state of Washington for baccalaureate and graduate degrees offered by a state university. The chief executive officer of the University Center of North Puget Sound is the director who reports to the president of Washington State University. The director shall manage the activities and logistics of operating the center, make policy and planning recommendations to the council in subsection (5) of this section, and implement decisions of the council. (5)(a) Washington State University and Everett Community College must collaborate with community leaders, and other four-year institutions of highereducation that offer programs at the Univ ersity Center of North Puget Sound to serve the varied interests of students in the region. To this end, a coordinatingand planning council must be established to be responsible for long-range and strategic planning, interinstitutional collaboration, collaboration with the community served, and dispute resolution for the center.

(b) The coordinating and planning council may appoint other groups, as appropriate, to advise on administration and operatio ns, and may alter its own composition by agreement of all the members. (6)(a) Washington State University shall assume leadership of the center upon completion and approval by the legislature as provided under (d) of this subsection of a strategic plan for meeti ng the academic needs of the region and successful establishment of an engineering degree program. The strategic planmust build on the strengths of the institutions, reflecting each institution's mission, in order to provide the region with the highest standard of educational programs, research, and service to the community. The strategic plan mustinclude a multibiennium budget that addresses both operating and capital expenses required to effectively implemen t the plan. The strategic plan shall be developed with the collaboration of the University Center at Everett Community College and all the institutions of higher education that provide baccalaureate degrees at the University Center, and community leaders. (b) Center partners must implement the strategic plan with careful attention to the academic and professional standards established and maintained by each institution and by the appropriate accrediti ng bodies, and to the historic role of each institution's governing board in setting policy.WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 321 [ 2079 ](c) The strategic plan must address expansion of the range and depth of educational opportunities in the region and include strategies that: (i) Build upon baccalaureate and graduate degree offerings at the center; (ii) Meet projected student enrollment demands for baccalaureate, graduate, and certificate programs in the region; (iii) Meet employers' needs for skilled workers by expanding high employer demand programs of study as defined in RCW 28B.50.030, with an initial and ongoing emphasis by Washington State University on undergraduate and graduate science, technology, mathematics, and engineering degree programs, including a variety of engineering disc iplines such as ci vil, mechanical, aeronautical, and aerospace manufacturing; (iv) Coordinate delivery of lower and upper division courses to maximize student opportunities and resources; and (v) Transfer budget support and resources for the center from Everett Community College to Washington State University. (d) The strategic plan must be completed by December 1, 2012, and submitted to the legislature for review. The strategic plan shall be considered approved if the legislature does not take further action on the strategic plan during the 2013 legislative session. The transfer of the responsibility for the management and operation of the University Center of North Puget Sound to Washington State University must occur by July 1, 2014. (7)(a) Academic programming and deliver y at the center must be developed in accordance with the missions of Wa shington State University, Everett Community College, and other institutions of higher education that have a presence at the center. (b) Each institution shall abide by the guidelines for university centers adopted by the higher education coordinating board. (c) Each institution shall award all degrees and certificates granted in the programs it delivers at the center.

(b) Washington State University shall design, construct, and manage any facility developed at the center. Any facility developed at the center with EverettCommunity College capital funding must be designed by Everett Community College in consultation with Washington State University. Building construction may be managed by Washington State University via an interagency agreement which details responsibility and associated costs. Building operations and management for all facilities at the center must be governed by the infrastructure and operating cost allocation method described in subsection (9) of this section.Ch. 321 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 2080 ](9) Washington State University has responsibility for infrastructure development and maintenance for the cente r. All infrastructure operating and maintenance costs are to be shared in what is deemed to be an equitable and fair manner based on space allocation, special cost, and other relevant considerations. Washington State University may make infrastructure development and maintenance decisions in consultation with the councildescribed in subsection (5) of this section. (10) In the event that conflict cannot be resolved through the coordinating council described in subsection (5) of this section the higher education coordinating board dispute resolution must be employed. Sec. 2. RCW 28B.50.795 and 2010 1st sp.s. c 25 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: (1) ((RCW 28B.50.901 assigns responsibility for the north Snohomish, Island, and Skagit counties' higher ed ucation consortium to Everett Community College. In April of 2009, Everett Community College opened Gray Wolf Hall, the new home of the University Center of North Puget Sound. The University Center currently offers over twenty b achelor's and master's degrees from six partner universities. (2))) Although Everett Community College offers an associate degree nursing program that graduates approximately seventy to ninety students per year, the University Center does not offer a bachelor of science in nursing. Some graduates of the Everett Community College program are able to articulate to the bachelor of science in nursing program offered by the University ofWashington-Bothell at its Bothell campus or in Mt. Vernon but current capacity is not sufficient for all of the graduates who are both interested and qualified. (((3) )) (2) Despite recent growth in nursing education capacity, shortages still persist for registered nurses. According to a June 2007 study by the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho center for health workforce studies, the average age of Washington's registered nurses was forty-eight years. More than a third were fifty-five years of age or older. Consequently, the high rate of registered nurses retiring from nursing practice over the next two decadeswill significantly reduce the supply. This reduction comes at the same time as the state's population grows and ages. The registered nurse education capacity in Washington has a large impact on the supply of registered nurses in the state. If the rate of graduation in registered nursing does not increase, projections show that supply in Washington will begin to decline by 2015. In contrast, if graduation rates increased by four hundred per year, the supply of registered nurses would meet estimated demand by the year 2021. (((4) )) (3) Subject to specific funding to support up to fifty full-time equivalent students in a bachelor of nur sing program, the University Center ((at Everett Community College )) of North Puget Sound , in partnership with the University of Washington-Bothell, shall offer a bachelor of science in nursingprogram with capacity for up to fifty full-time students. NEW SECTION. Sec. 3. (1) This act takes effect only after the higher education coordinating board determin es whether a needs assessment and analysis is required and, if so, conducts a needs assessment and viabilitydetermination under RCW 28B.76.230 and recommends that the provisions in section 1 of this act occur.WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 321 [ 2081 ](2) The higher education coordinating board must make a recommendation under subsection (1) of this section by July 1, 2012. (3) The higher education coordinating board shall notify the office of financial management, the legislature, and the code reviser's office of the board's recommendations regarding the provisions in section 1 of this act. NEW SECTION. Sec. 4. RCW 28B.50.901 (Regional higher education consortium management and leadership\u2014Everett Community College\u2014 Educational plan) and 2005 c 258 s 13 are each repealed.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. The legislature intends to clarify existing law that the basis for determining the business and occupation tax for real estate firms is the commission amount received by each r eal estate firm involved in a real estate transaction. In clarifying existing law, the legislature intends to preservethe historic method of calculating business and occupation tax for real estate firms. Sec. 2. RCW 82.04.255 and 1997 c 7 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: (1) Upon every person engaging within the state ((as a real estate broker )) in the business of providing real estate brokerage services ; as to such persons, the amount of the tax with respect to such business ((shall be )) is equal to the gross income of the business, multiplied by the rate of 1.5 percent. (2) The measure of the tax on real estate commissions earned by the real estate ((broker shall be )) firm is the gross commission earned by the particular real estate ((brokerage office )) firm including that portion of the commission paid to ((salesmen or associate )) brokers, including designated and managing brokers, in the same ((office )) firm on a particular transaction((: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That where )). However, when a real estate commission on a particular transaction is divided ((between an originating brokerage office and a cooperating brokerage office on a particular transaction, each brokerage office shall )) among real estate firms at the closi ng of the transaction, including a firm located out of state, each firm must pay the tax only upon ((their )) its respective shares of said commission((: AND PROVIDED FURTHER, That where the brokerage office )). Moreover, when the real estate firm has paid the tax as provided herein, ((salesmen or associate )) brokers, including designated and managing brokers, within the same ((brokerage office shall )) real estate firm may not be required to pay a similar tax upon the same transaction. If any firmCh. 322 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 2082 ]located out of state receives a share of commission on a particular transaction, that company or broker must pay the tax based on the requirements of this section and RCW 82.04.067.

This act applies both prospectively and retroactively. *Sec. 3 was vetoed. See message at end of chapter. Passed by the Senate March 2, 2011. Passed by the House April 8, 2011. Approved by the Governor May 12, 2011, with the exception of certain items that were vetoed. Filed in Office of Secretary of State May 13, 2011. Note: Governor's explanation of partial veto is as follows: \"I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 3, Senate Bill 5083 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to clarifying that the basis for business and occupation tax for real estate firms is the commission amount received by each real estate firm involved in a transaction.\" Senate Bill 5083 provides that when a real estate commission on a particular transaction is divided among real estate firms at the closing of the transaction, each firm must pay the tax only upon itsrespective share. Section 3 would apply this act both prospectively and retroactively. The retroactive application of the bill would reward delinquent taxpayers while those who paid on time would not receive a refund under the prohibition on the gift of state funds in Article VIII, Section 5 of the WashingtonConstitution, as interpreted by the Washington Supreme Court. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 3 of Senate Bill 5083. With the exception of Section 3, Senate Bill 5083 is approved.\" 322____________________________________ CHAPTER 323 [Substitute Senate Bill 5451] SHORELINE MASTER PROGRAMS 323AN ACT Relating to shoreline structures in a master program adopted under the shoreline management act; adding a new section to chapter 90.58 RCW; and creating a new section.

It is in the public interest to clarify the legal status of these structures that will apply after shoreline regulations are updated.WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 323 [ 2083 ](3) Updated shoreline master programs must include provisions to ensure that expansion, redevelopment, and repl acement of existing structures will result in no net loss of the ecological function of the shoreline. Classifying existing structures as legally conforming will not create a risk of degrading shoreline natural resources. NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 90.58 RCW to read as follows: (1) New or amended master programs approved by the department on or after September 1, 2011, may include provisions authorizing: (a) Residential structures and appurtenant structures that were legally established and are used for a conforming use, but that do not meet standards for the following to be considered a confor ming structure: Setbacks, buffers, or yards; area; bulk; height; or density; and (b) Redevelopment, expansion, change with the class of occupancy, or replacement of the residential structure if it is consistent with the master program, including requirements for no net loss of shoreline ecologicalfunctions. (2) For purposes of this section, \"appurtenant structures\" means garages, sheds, and other legally established structures. \"Appurtenant structures\" doesnot include bulkheads and other shor eline modifications or over-water structures. (3) Nothing in this section: (a) Restricts the ability of a master program to limit redevelopment, expansion, or repl acement of over-water structures located in hazardous areas, such as floodplains an d geologically hazardous areas; or (b) affects the application of other federal, state, or local government requirements to residential structures.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. The legislature finds and declares the following: (1) The practice of shark finning, where a shark is caught, its fins are sliced off while it is still alive, and the animal returned to the sea severely and almost always fatally wounded, constitutes a serious threat to Washington's coastal ecosystem and biodiversity. Sharks are particularly susceptible to overfishing because they only reach sexual maturity between seven to twelve years of age and hatch or birth small litters. The destruction of the population of sharks, which reside at the top of the marine food chain, is an urgent problem that upsets the balance of species in the ocean ecosystem.Ch. 324 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 2084 ](2) Shark finning condemns millions of sharks every year to slow, painful deaths. Returned to the wa ter without their fins, the maimed sharks are attacked by other predators or drown, because most shark species must swim in order to push water through their gills. Shark finning is therefore a cruel practice contrary to the good morals of the citizens of the state of Washington. (3) The market for shark fins drives the brutal practice of shark finning. Shark finning and trade in shark fins and shark fin derivative products areoccurring all along the Pacific Coast, including the state of Washington. (4) The consumption of shark fins and shark fin derivative products by humans may cause serious health risks, including risks from mercury. NEW SECTION. Sec. 2.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person is guilty of unlawful trade in shark fins in the first degree if: (a) The person commits the act described by subsection (1) of this section and the violation involves shark fins or a shark fin derivative product with a total market value of two hundred fifty dollars or more; (b) The person commits the act described by subsection (1) of this section and acted with knowledge that the shark fin or shark fin derivative product originated from a shark that was harveste d in an area or at a time where or when the harvest was not legally allowed or by a person not licensed to harvest theshark; or (c) The person commits the act described by subsection (1) of this section and the violation occurs within five years of entry of a prior conviction underthis section or a prior conviction for any other gross misdemeanor or felony under this title involving fish, other than a recreational fishing violation. (3)(a) Unlawful trade in shark fins in the second degree is a gross misdemeanor. Upon conviction, the department shall suspend any commercialfishing privileges for the person that requires a license under this title for a period of one year. (b) Unlawful trade in shark fins in the first degree is a class C felony. Upon conviction, the department shall suspend any commercial fishing privileges forthe person that requires a license under this title for a period of one year. (4) Any person who obtains a license or permit issued by the department to take or possess sharks or shark parts for bona fide research or educationalpurposes, and who sells, offers for sale, purchases, offers to purchase, or otherwise trades a shark fin or shark fin derivative product, exclusively for bona fide research or educational purposes, may not be held liable under or subject to the penalties of this section. (5) Nothing in this section prohibits the sale, offer for sale, purchase, offer to purchase, or other exchange of shark fins or shark fin derivative products forcommercial purposes, or preparation or processing of shark fins or shark finWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 324 [ 2085 ]derivative products for purposes of human or animal consumption for commercial purposes, if the shark fins or shark fin derivative products were lawfully harvested or lawfully acquired prio r to the effective date of this section.

If a person otherwise entitled to notice under this section is a charitable organization, and the charitable organization's only interest in the trust is a future interest that may be revoked, then such notice shall instead be given to the attorney general. A trustee who gives notice pursuant to this section satisfies the duty to inform the beneficiaries of the existence of the trust. The notice required under this subsection (2) applies only to irrevocable trusts creat ed after December 31, 2011, and revocable trusts that become irrevocable after December 31, 2011, provided that allWASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 Ch. 327 [ 2115 ]common law duties of a trustee to notify beneficiaries applicable to trusts created or that became irrevocable be fore such date are not affected. (3) A trustee shall keep all persons interested in the trust, as defined in RCW 11.96A.030, and who would be entitled to notice under RCW 11.96A.110 and 11.96A.120 if they were a party to j udicial proceedings regarding the trust, reasonably informed about the administration of the trust and of the material facts necessary for them to protect their interests. A report that contains the following is presumed to satisfy the trustee's duty to keep such persons reasonably informed for the relevant period of trust administration: (a) A statement of receipts and disbur sements of principal and income that have occurred during the accounting period; (b) A statement of the assets and liabilities of the trust and their values at the beginning and end of the period; (c) The trustee's compensation for the period; (d) The agents hired by the trustee, their relationship to the trustee, if any, and their compensation, for the period; (e) Disclosure of any pledge, mortgage, option, or lease of trust property, or other agreement affecting trust property binding for a period of five years or more that was granted or entered into during the accounting period; (f) Disclosure of all transactions during the period that are equivalent to one of the types of transactions described in section 32 of this act or otherwise could have been affected by a conflict betw een the trustee's fiduciary and personal interests; (g) A statement that the recipient of the account information may petition the superior court pursuant to chapter 11.106 RCW to obtain review of the statement and of acts of the trust ee disclosed in the statement; and (h) A statement that claims against the trustee for breach of trust may not be made after the expiration of three years from the date the beneficiary receives the statement. (4) Unless unreasonable under the circumstances, a trustee shall promptly respond to any beneficiary's request for information related to the administration of the trust. (5) If a person entitled to notice under this section requests information reasonably necessary to enable the noti fied person to enforce his or her rights under the trust, then the trustee must provide such information within sixty days of receipt of such request. Delivery of the entire trust instrument to the persons entitled to notice under this section who request information concerning the terms of the trust reasonably necessary to enable the notified person to enforce his or her rights under the trust is deemed to satisfy the trustee's obligations under this subsection .

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. The Washington state legislature has consistently provided national leadership on safe housing and support to foster youth transitioning out of foster care. Since 2006, the legislature has addressed the needs of foster youth aging out of care with medicaid to twenty-one (2007), foster care to twenty-one (2006), the independent youth housing program (2007), and Washington's alignment with the federal fostering connections act (2009). As a result of this national leadership to provide safe and basic housing to youth aging out of foster care, the pr ograms have demonstrated the significant cost benefit to providing safe housing to our youth exiting foster care. The United States congress passed the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 in order to give states another financial tool tocontinue to provide foster care services to dependent youth who turn eighteen years old while in foster care. However, substantially declining revenues have resulted in markedly decreased funds fo r states to use to meet the federal requirements necessary to help these youth. Current fiscal realities require thatthe scope of programs must be narrowed. The Washington state legislature intends to serve, within the resources available, the maximum number of foster youth who are legally dependent onthe state and who reach the age of eight een while still in foster care. The legislature intends to provide these y outh continued foster care services to support basic and healthy transition into adulthood. The legislature recognizes the extremely poor outcomes of unsupported foster youth aging out of the foster care system and is committed to ensuring that those foster youth who engage in positive, age-appropriate activities receive support. It is the intent of thelegislature to fully engage in the fostering connections act by providing support, including extended court supervision to foster youth pursuing a high school diploma or GED to age twenty-one with the goal of increasing support to all children up to age twenty-one who ar e eligible under the federal fostering connections to success act as resources become available. Sec. 2. RCW 13.04.011 and 2010 c 150 s 4 are each amended to read as follows:Ch. 330 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 2160 ]For purposes of this title: (1) \"Adjudication\" has the same meaning as \"conviction\" in RCW 9.94A.030, but only for the purposes of sentencing under chapter 9.94A RCW; (2) Except as specifically provide d in chapters 13.24 and 13.34 RCW, \"juvenile,\" \"youth,\" and \"child\" mean any individual who is under the chronological age of eighteen years; (3) \"Juvenile offender\" and \"juvenile offense\" have the meaning ascribed in RCW 13.40.020; (4) \"Court\" when used without further qualification means the juvenile court judge(s) or commissioner(s); (5) \"Parent\" or \"parents,\" except as used in chapter 13.34 RCW, means that parent or parents who have the right of legal custody of the child. \"Parent\" or \"parents\" as used in chapter 13.34 RCW, means the biological or adoptive parents of a child unless the legal rights of that person have been terminated by judicial proceedings; (6) \"Custodian\" means that person who has the legal right to custody of the child. Sec. 3. RCW 13.34.030 and 2010 1st sp.s. c 8 s 13, 2010 c 272 s 10, and 2010 c 94 s 6 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows: For purposes of this chapter: (1) \"Abandoned\" means when the child's parent, guardian, or other custodian has expressed, either by statement or conduct, an intent to forego, for an extended period, parental rights or responsibilities despite an ability to exercise such rights and responsibilities. If the court finds that the petitioner has exercised due diligence in attempting to locate the parent, no contact between the child and the child's parent, guardian, or other custodian for a period of threemonths creates a rebuttable presumption of abandonment, even if there is no expressed intent to abandon.

RCW 43.136.011 and 2006 c 197 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: The legislature recognizes that tax preferences are enacted to meet objectives which are determined to be in the public interest. However, some tax preferences may not be efficient or equita ble tools for the achievement of current public policy objectives. Given the changing nature of the economy and taxstructures of other states, the legislature finds that periodic performance audits of tax preferences are needed to determine if their continued existence will serve the public interest. The legislature furt her finds that tax preferences that are enacted for economic development purposes must demonstrate growth in full- time family wage jobs with health and retirement benefits. Given that an opportunity cost exists with each econom ic choice, it is the intent of the legislature that the overall impact of economic development-focused tax preferences benefit the state's economy. Sec. 2. RCW 43.136.045 and 2006 c 197 s 4 are each amended to read as follows: (1) The citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences ((shall )) must develop a schedule to accomplish an orderly review of tax preferences at least once every ten years. ((The commission shall schedule tax preferences for review in )) In determining the schedule, the commission must consider the order the tax preferences were enacted into law, ((except that )) in addition to other factors including but not limited to grouping preferences for review by type of industry, economic sector, or policy area. T he commission may elect to include, anywhere in the schedule, a tax preference that has a statutory expiration date. The commission ((shall )) must omit from the schedule tax preferences that are required by constitutional law, sales and use taxexemptions for machinery and equipmen t for manufacturing, research and development, or testing, the small business credit for the business andoccupation tax, sales and use tax exemptions for food and prescription drugs, property tax relief for retired persons, and property tax valuations based on current use, and may omit any tax prefer ence that the commission determines is a critical part of the structure of the tax system. As an alternative to the process under RCW 43.136.055, the commission may recommend to the joint legislative audit and review committee an expedite d review process for any tax preference ((that has an estimated biennial fiscal impact of ten million dollars or less )). (2) The commission ((shall )) must revise the schedule as needed each year, taking into account newly enacted or terminated tax preferences. The commission ((shall )) must deliver the schedule to the joint legislative audit and review committee by September 1st of each year. (3) The commission ((shall )) must provide a process for effective citizen input during its deliberations. Sec. 3. RCW 43.136.055 and 2006 c 197 s 5 are each amended to read as follows: (1) The joint legislative aud it and review committee ((shall )) must review tax preferences according to the schedule developed under RCW 43.136.045. The committee ((shall )) must consider, but not be limited to, the following factors in the review as relevant to each particular tax preference :Ch. 335 WASHINGTON LAWS, 2011 [ 2186 ](a) The classes of individuals, types of organizations, or types of industries whose state tax liabilities are directly affected by the tax preference; (b) Public policy objectives that might provide a justification for the tax preference, including but not limited to th e legislative history, any legislative intent, or the extent to which the tax preference encourages business growth or relocation into this state, promotes growth or retention of high wage jobs, or helps stabilize communities; (c) Evidence that the exis tence of the tax preference has contributed to the achievement of any of the public policy objectives; (d) The extent to which continuation of the tax preference might contribute to any of the public policy objectives; (e) The extent to which the tax pref erence may provide unintended benefits to an individual, organization, or industry other than those the legislatureintended; (f) The extent to which terminating the tax preference may have negative effects on the category of taxpayers that currently benefit from the tax preference, and the extent to which resulting higher taxes may have negative effects on employment and the economy; (g) The feasibility of modifying the tax preference to provide for adjustment or recapture of the tax benefits of the tax preference if the objectives are notfulfilled; (h) Fiscal impacts of the tax preferen ce, including past impacts and expected future impacts if it is continued. Fo r the purposes of this subsection, \"fiscal impact\" includes an analysis of the gene ral effects of the tax preference on the overall state economy, including, but not limited to, the effects of the tax preference on the consumption and expenditures of persons and businesses within the state; (i) The extent to which termination of the tax preference would affect the distribution of liability for payment of state taxes; (j) The economic impact of the tax preference compared to the economic impact of government activities funded by the tax for which the tax preference is taken at the same level of expenditure as the tax preference. For purposes of this subsection the economic impact shall be determined using the Washington input- output model as published by the office of financial management; (k) Consideration of similar tax prefer ences adopted in other states, and potential public policy benefits that might be gained by incorporatingcorresponding provisions in Washington. (2) For each tax preference, the committee ((shall )) must provide a recommendation as to whether the tax pr eference should be continued without modification, modified, scheduled for sunset review at a future date, or terminated immediately. The committee may recommend accountability standards for the future review of a tax preference. Passed by the Senate April 21, 2011.
