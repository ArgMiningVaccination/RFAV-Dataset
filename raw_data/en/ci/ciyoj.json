Glycans also modulate the immune response, playing an essential role in both innate and adaptive immunity. The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to stimulate and foster multi-disciplinary investigator-initiated collaborative research to: 1) investigate structural and conformational features of HIV glycosylation that may lead to novel HIV vaccine design approaches; and 2) elucidate the impact of differential glycosylation on the quality of the immune response to HIV. Ultimately, the discovery of a safe, effective, prophylactic vaccine that provides long-term protection from HIV infection may depend on novel approaches that incorporate new knowledge of the key role glycans play in the elicitation and maturation of broadly neutralizing antibodies and effector immune responses. | | Posted Date | | May 9, 2013 | | Open Date (Earliest Submission Date) | | November 2, 2013 | | Letter of Intent Due Date(s) | | November 2, 2013 | | Application Due Date(s) | | December 2, 2013, by 5:00 PM local time of applicant organization.

Application Review Information](#_Section_V._Application) [Section VII. Agency Contacts](#_Section_VII._Agency) [Section VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) Halting the spread of HIV infection remains one of the highest research priorities of NIAID. Success in this effort will depend primarily on the identification and development of a safe and effective vaccine that prevents HIV transmission, as well as development of an HIV cure. Several vaccine candidates have been tested in human clinical studies, with one Phase IIb trial, RV144, showing modest efficacy in a community-based, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Thailand. Additional analysis of this study identified six primary immune response variables. One variable, immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody binding levels to the HIV envelope (Env) glycoprotein first and second variable regions (V1V2), inversely correlated with HIV infection risk. Evidence suggests that the RV144-induced immune responses may have selectively blocked certain HIV viruses, or may have driven the accumulation of viral escape mutants. While the RV144 trial is encouraging, the need to identify new vaccine candidates with responses of greater breadth, durability, and efficacy remains a critical priority. Approximately half of the molecular mass of HIV gp120 is comprised of N-linked glycans that shield the protein backbone. Several of these carbohydrate structures appear to be critical for envelope folding, antigenicity, and immunogenicity. Determination of the identity and heterogeneity of glycans expressed on native gp120 trimers may be crucial for the development of new HIV vaccine candidates, as glycan heterogeneity may influence immune recognition and viral escape. How HIV envelope (Env) is glycosylated in vivo and how engineered cell lines modulate HIV envelope glycosylation, are open research questions. Moreover, significant knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of broadly neutralizing antibody epitopes on the envelope spike that may serve as new targets for vaccination, as well as features that initiate broadly neutralizing antibody responses against the virus envelope glycoprotein. In the past few years, new developments in our understanding of the key roles glycans play in the elicitation, breadth, and maturation of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV have galvanized the HIV vaccine research field. Also, development of new tools and novel approaches has presented opportunities for teams of multi-disciplinary investigators to advance our understanding of the diverse role of glycans in regulating protective immune responses to HIV. These advances have led to new collaborations among glycobiologists, immunologists, virologists, and carbohydrate chemists. These multi-disciplinary approaches have revealed important information on the structure of the HIV-1 gp120 trimer, identified new paradigms of antibody recognition of highly glycosylated antigens, and propelled our understanding of the role of glycosylation in viral evasion, as well as potential HIV-1 vulnerabilities. Finally, although the antibody responses elicited in RV144 appear to be non-neutralizing, new studies have suggested that RV144 induced antibody responses may be qualitatively and functionally distinct. Evidence is accumulating on the role of glycans in modulating the immune response. Immunological studies analyzing regulation of immunoglobulin G and complement activity have suggested that terminal IgG glycans, such as alpha 2,6 linked-sialic acids, modulate antibody activity, influencing pro-and anti-inflammatory immune responses through their interaction with Fc receptors (FcRs) and lectins such as DC-SIGN. By modulating immune responses, glycosylation of antibodies may influence immune activation, driving inflammation cascades that viruses like HIV exploit, possibly potentiating immune activation of targets to promote transmission. The objective of this FOA is to stimulate novel areas of research on the role of glycosylation in HIV-1 envelope protein immunogenicity and modulation of the immune response to HIV viral infection. Cross-disciplinary research is needed among HIV vaccinologists, glycobiologists, virologists, immunologists, biochemists, clinical scientists, carbohydrate chemists, and other relevant specialists to conduct the proposed research. Therefore, collaborations among such groups are strongly encouraged to provide the required expertise to tackle this research area. The biosynthesis of glycans in cells is a non-template process, with the capability of generating a large variety of complex carbohydrate structures. As a consequence, technical challenges in analyzing these complex structures have limited progress in the past. Recent advances in glycomic technologies have resulted in more tools at our disposal, and past investment in the development of these tools can now be leveraged with biological expertise to focus the use of these new technologies for HIV vaccine research that is scalable and manufacturable. Applications describing research projects in the areas of glycosylation and HIV vaccine discovery research would be considered appropriate to this FOA.

For this particular announcement, note the following: The purpose of this FOA is to stimulate and foster multi-disciplinary investigator- initiated collaborative research. Since the discovery of a safe, effective, prophylactic vaccine that provides long-term protection from HIV infection may depend on novel approaches that incorporate new knowledge of the key role glycans play in the elicitation and maturation of broadly neutralizing antibodies and effector immune responses, this FOA seeks to bring investigators with no previous expertise in HIV research into this area. The intention is for these investigators to partner/collaborate with investigators with HIV expertise to make significant progress in these research areas. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Significance Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Investigator(s) Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or New Investigators, or in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? Innovation Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? Approach Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? If the project involves clinical research, are the plans for 1) protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion of minorities and members of both sexes/genders, as well as the inclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Environment Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. Protections for Human Subjects For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Human Subjects Protection and Inclusion Guidelines](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11172). Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children When the proposed project involves clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for inclusion of minorities and members of both genders, as well as the inclusion of children. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Human Subjects Protection and Inclusion Guidelines](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11172). Vertebrate Animals The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following five points: 1) proposed use of the animals, and species, strains, ages, sex, and numbers to be used; 2) justifications for the use of animals and for the appropriateness of the species and numbers proposed; 3) adequacy of veterinary care; 4) procedures for limiting discomfort, distress, pain and injury to that which is unavoidable in the conduct of scientifically sound research including the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs and/or comfortable restraining devices; and 5) methods of euthanasia and reason for selection if not consistent with the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Biohazards Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. Resubmissions Not Applicable Renewals Not Applicable Revisions Not Applicable As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score. Applications from Foreign Organizations Reviewers will assess whether the project presents special opportunities for furthering research programs through the use of unusual talent, resources, populations, or environmental conditions that exist in other countries and either are not readily available in the United States or augment existing U.S. resources. Select Agent Research Reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the Select Agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where Select Agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of Select Agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the Select Agent(s). Resource Sharing Plans Reviewers will comment on whether the following Resource Sharing Plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: 1) [Data Sharing Plan](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11151); 2) [Sharing Model Organisms](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11152); and 3) [Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11153).
