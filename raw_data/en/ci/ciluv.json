He claims to have had in-depth spiritual experiences with this being. Ballard dubbed the figure an \"ascended master.\" He claims that ascended masters have mastered the physical plane, not experiencing birth and death. Guy Ballard and his wife, Edna, started The [I AM Activity movement](https://www.iamschool.org/i-am-activity). It is a mixture of Christianity and theosophy.
