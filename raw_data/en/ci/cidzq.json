New Delhi , January 23, 2021 : The makers of two ayurvedic Coviid-19 remedies have said that the treatments have been found to work better than the standard medicines in a comparative trial. \"A clinical trial was conducted in India to monitor the outcome of a combination treatment for Covid.

Remarkable results!\" Dr Vijaykumar Kamat, Medical Director, Biogetica said, \"It seems to us that too much expectation and emphasis is being placed on a vaccine even though the virus is rapidly mutating.

With the entire world watching, we have shown how nature is essential in medicine. That nature has the answer when all else fails. We, therefore, hope this opens eyes and minds, and that doctors, countries and patients who truly care about their health accept these remedies.\" \"We also hope that the government lists these remedies as part of the standard of care for Covid, as they truly bear the potential of saving lives, freeing up hospital space and helping people return to normal,\" they concluded. \"A clinical trial was conducted in India to monitor the outcome of a combination treatment for Covid.
