In the Chinese art and science of Feng Shui we call energy qi. The Egyptians call it Ka, the Hebrew have Ruach, the Japanese have Ki, and the Indians call it Prana. Qi is condensed and dispersed in alternative cycles of positive (sheng qi) and negative (sha qi) energy, and it manifests in various forms. Qi can not be destroyed; however, it can be transformed. Energy can be blocked and build up negatively, or it can flow freely, which is what we want in our homes. Feng Shui supports the energy flow in your environment, which directly impacts the energy flow in your body and thus can unleash more of your energy and vitality. As you read this post, realize that the image is comprised of particles of energy; the computer or tablet you're reading this on is exactly the same. The grass, the sun: it's all energy. Feng Shui translates to wind and water. When we consider the qi of water, we know we drink it, wash with it, we cannot survive without it and we see this as positive energy. However a tsunami can destroy an entire town. Wind is similar. It can feel amazing and caressing on a warm day. It can be harnessed to create electricity. Yet too much wind can destroy cities. The key is balance. Now you can take the online Silver-Level Feng Shui Master Program at your own pace, with Amanda Collins! In Feng Shui we differentiate three kinds of qi. First we have heavenly qi, our destiny energy. This is the energy we are born with, the soul agreements we have decided to have before we come into human form. Soul agreements are made with your children, your lover, your mother and so on. When we bring Feng Shui into our lives it does not change these pre-destined forces and experiences, but it makes what we would perceive as a bad experiences less painful, more graceful. Then there is human qi. This is your physical, emotional and mental qi. Feng Shui really supports balance and alignment in your body, feelings and mind. Imagine living in a home that is off-balance. You try self care, perhaps by seeing an acupunturist who brings your body into balance. But when you return home to a cluttered and imbalanced environment you will likely throw your body, mind and spirit out of alignment again. Lastly we have earth qi. Earth qi includes mountains, water, the climate, and where we are located in this earthly energy. Each of us is unique and has different needs; some people do well in hot weather as others in cool. Feng Shui absolutely supports by connecting us with nature. We spend 80% of our time inside our home or car or office and back again. Many of us have lost that deep connection to Nature and the natural rhythms of the earth. Hundreds of years ago people did not have clocks and calenders to tell them when to do things; they would just look up to the sun and the moon and know when to plant their crops. They would speak to the land and intuitively know what herbs would heal various ailments. Feng Shui invites us to connect with Mother Earth, to commune with her, bring her elements inside with plants, water fountains and crystals that harmonize our bodies and ground our enegy. We are spiritual beings having human experiences and Feng Shui invites us to create a space that connects the inside and the outside, bringing the colors of nature inside, soft browns, healing greens and blues that remind us of nature's abundant gifts.
