These molecular assemblies have applications in nerve regeneration, wound healing, and both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination. They can also be useful tools for proliferation assays, sustained culture of difficult cell lines, or activation of cell lines for immunoassays. This protocol will describe the basic peptide synthesis and purification of model self-assembling peptide immunogen and methods for vaccinating mice, collecting lymph nodes, and stimulating cells ex vivo. |Original language||English| |Title of host publication||Methods Keywords - Nanofiber - Self-assembling peptides - Vaccine "}
