This butterfly-shaped gland controls almost every function of our body and interacts with all the other hormones. It manages metabolism of food and regulates our sleep pattern. It also plays an important role in managing our weight, mood swings, depression and anxiety. Sadly, for over 10 million women across the globe, this regulator is on the fritz. Thyroid can cause multiple problems if it does not function properly. It definitely needs an appropriate treatment to get your thyroid function normally again. However, diet is also an extremely crucial part of thyroid management. Also, people with thyroid disorders run the risk of developing diabetes and heart disease. For controlling both these ailments nutrition plays a big role. So, wouldn't it help you to know what diet and lifestyle changes you need to make for better thyroid functioning? What to eat and what not to eat? Iodine is crucial for the production of thyroid hormones. Even a small quantity of iodine is sufficient for normal production of thyroid hormones, and iodized salt is usually enough for providing the amount required. Seaweeds are the numero uno food for iodine deficiency. Also, remember that excess iodine can cause goiter. So, prevent iodine deficiency by choosing to eat the right amounts of iodine rich foods such as seaweeds, iodised salt and seafood. Protein transports the thyroid hormone to all your tissues and thus helps your thyroid function effectively. Include eggs, nuts, seeds, fish and legumes in your diet. Did you know that 20 per cent of thyroid function depends on a good gut ecology? It is therefore recommended to take probiotics or home-made dahi or yoghurt regularly. You should also eat lots of garlic, which kills yeast. There are foods that block iodine uptake (goitrogens) and can nullify the benefits of iodized salt. Thus, we need to know the categories of food products that might block our iodine intake. Dietary vegetable oils, polyunsaturated oils and hydrogenated fats above a certain quantity are believed to be the cause behind the increased incidence of thyroid. Peanuts, peanut butter and soy products can also be the reason behind abnormal thyroid. According to some research estimates, nearly one third of teenagers with autoimmune thyroid problem were more likely to have been fed on soy formula as infants. The most common source of hydrogenated fats and polyunsaturated oils are soybeans. Cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli can also inhibit production of thyroid hormones. Strong tea, coffee and tobacco should be avoided when suffering from [hyperthyroidism](https://www.drbatras.com/hyperthyroidism). Cigarette smoke has various toxins (thiocyanate in particular) that are especially dangerous to the thyroid, and can trigger thyroid disease in susceptible people. Cigarette smokers also are more likely to develop thyroid eye complications of Graves' disease, and treatments for those eye problems are less effective in smokers. So, in addition to all the other health problems related to smoking, you can add increased risk and worsening of thyroid disease. Vitamin D deficiency is linked to thyroid as well. Experts suggest that adequate bone-building nutrients, such as vitamin D, are particularly important during and after treatment. Foods that contain some Vitamin D include fatty fish, milk, dairy, eggs, and mushrooms. Sunlight also is a potential source, but the amount of vitamin production depends on the season and latitude. Supplements having vitamins and nutrients such as riboflavin, lecithin and thiamin may help. Lifestyle changes Healthy nutritious food and low stress levels can minimise the chance of developing thyroid problems. A low glycaemic index diet (a diet based on controlling blood sugar) helps in controlling thyroid. Cut down on foods with high sugar and fat. Regular exercise is crucial. Exercise not only enables weight-loss but also releases 'happy hormones' in the body reducing stress and helping you cope with low moods and depression. An under-active thyroid can respond to natural remedies such as yoga. You can also benefit from taking flaxseed oil, zinc and multi-vitamins. Homeopathy is a best way to treat thyroid without any side-effects and also it is a painless procedure to cure and get relief from it permanently. Homeopathy treatment for thyroid stimulates better functioning of the thyroid gland so that it can produce the hormones on its own. In Homeopathy treatment for thyroid, we provide constitutional treatment, which focuses on improving the function of the thyroid gland by natural means. The constitutional remedies will stimulate the body to reactivate thyroid secretions. In our thyroid treatment we will help to boost energy, improve circulation and thereby help balancing hypo as well as hyperthyroid functions. It may be also used as a supportive help for regulating both hypo and hyper thyroid functions. [Homeopathy treatment for thyroid](https://www.drbatras.com/treat-thyroid-homeopathy) can also reduce the dependency on external supplementation of the hormones and ensure good health in general. The bottom line is that a sensible diet and lifestyle can help prevent or control thyroid malfunction. So club it with homeopathic treatment for better thyroid management. "}
