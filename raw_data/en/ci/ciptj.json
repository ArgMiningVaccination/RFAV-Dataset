This is fine, but is not necessarily the goal. The goal is that you intend to repeat the word. Whether or not that happens is secondary. | | You might fall asleep. If you do, great. Enjoy it! You will probably have one of the deepest sleeps you have had in a while. Falling asleep while meditating is usually an indication that you need more sleep. You are giving yourself a perfect opportunity to catch up. When you do awaken from sleeping while meditating, be sure to spend a few more minutes going back to the mantra. Otherwise it will feel similar to the way that you feel when you are dreaming and you are abruptly awakened to a phone ringing or some other very jarring sound. | | Another thing that will happen is your mind will fly all over the place with thoughts. Don't be dismayed when this happens. Simply gently return to repeating the mantra. If the thoughts continue ceaselessly, simply intend to slip the mantra gently underneath the thoughts. | | Occasionally, but not very often, your mind will become very still. In that stillness, ideas, insights, perhaps we could call it inspiration or intuition will flood into your mind. Be sure to have a pen and paper ready to write down the interesting thoughts that come to you. Out of that silence sometimes comes exactly what we need to know or do as we progress on our path. Remember, the quality of a good meditation is not what happens during the meditation. The important issue is how you feel after meditating. If you have more energy, more alertness, if your mind is calmer, more peaceful and you feel happier, this is feedback that your mind/body like the meditation.
