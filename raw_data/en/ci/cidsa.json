It is not your imagination. It is very easy to get caught up in the distraught surge of everyday life and to drown ourselves in busy schedules, some might even attach their self-esteem to the length of their to-do list. As globalization and modernity become more installed in our societies, it seems that we have less control of our lives. This prevents us from living happily, since the obligations and inconveniences of everyday life absorb us in such a way that makes it impossible for us to find ourselves and connect with our inner peace. Perhaps the city will remain the same and there are things without solution, but perhaps we can make modifications for a better lifestyle. If you could step outside of your very busy schedules and constant exhaustion of everyday tasks, your life can be quite peaceful and you can have a better understanding of yourself. To stop your mind from going into a state of overload, you need to engage it in an activity that only strengthens it, gives it clarity and helps it gain stability. You should incorporate the habit of meditation. A common mistake is to believe that meditation is simply a technique to reduce stress, calm emotions and be calmer, done with your eyes closed, in certain positions either sitting or lying down or even levitating (rolls eyes). But meditation is much more than that, it is a broader form of consciousness and its benefits are much deeper. To meditate is to look inward and observe yourself, observe your breathing, your sensations and not let yourself be trapped by your thoughts - simply observe and let them pass, that is, try to be aware of what you are thinking and how it affects you so that your thoughts do not control you, but you them. We should not confuse the act of meditating with leaving the mind blank, since both things are not the same. When meditating, thoughts may continue to arise, the difference is that we do not identify with them, we do not follow them. But let them go like clouds that pass in the sky and leave. There are countless meditation benefits you could be enjoying right now but there are so many distractions hindering you from starting a meditation routine. We are at a time when more and more people decide to start in this practice due to the frantic pace of life we lead and numerous studies have already been able to report the benefits of meditating daily with just a few minutes of dedication. To name just a few: - Improved self awareness - Relief of anxiety and depression symptoms - Stress reduction - Improved attention span and concentration - Blood pressure improvement - Increased gray matter in the brain - Productivity Improvement - Improved decision making Meditation only requires 15 minutes. Meditating for 15 minutes a day can improve your mental health and make you an emotionally stable being. If you benefit from meditation, you can also extend your time. A wide range of meditation types exist but for the sake of simplicity, we divided them into three main categories according to the focus of each. Concentration-based meditation Although concentration is the basis of all meditation, in some techniques the focus is on developing mindfulness in some object or in nothingness itself. With practice you can stay focused for a longer time. Meditation based on Reflection The idea is to choose a question or a deep topic and reflect on it. It requires having a trained mind because at the beginning other thoughts will appear that have nothing to do with the chosen theme. As an example we can ask ourselves the following questions: Who I am? What are my main goals? Mindfulness based meditation It bases its attention on an action or object and makes us more perceptive of our present moment. A lot of people live their lives with only their bodies in the present but their minds are worried about the past or future. With mindfulness meditation you will learn to focus on the \"here and now\", and that will give you peace of mind and make you a happier person. It is a great meditation for anxiety. Your next question should be how do I create the right environment for meditating.... Oh well... Ideally, you would meditate on top of a mountain surrounded by clouds of incense, candles, and the sound of tingsha chimes. If the environment around us is regulated, it will create discipline in the mind too - A disturbed environment has a bad effect on the mind. Avoid all distractions, turn off the television, turn off the mobile phone and if there are more people in the house, ask them not to bother you during the exercise of meditation. Creating an ideal space for meditation is not so complicated, you will simply need some details that help create that magical and special atmosphere - warm colored lights, removing furniture to create more space, fluffy carpet, mirrors, scented candles and background meditation music. 'Music is Food for the Soul' You can improve your mediation with music, it can help to create a calm environment. If you are finding it hard to focus, essential oils for meditation can help.
