However, fully integrated records have proven to be very expensive and difficult to establish. Currently. EHR's have been developed largely to accommodate Western medicine events. These barriers impact on the introduction of EHR's in Sri Lanka, where health budgets are already stretched and Ayurvedic medicine is routinely practiced alongside Allopathic medicine. This article identifies requirements for EHR in the Sri Lankan context and advances a model for the introduction of EHR's that suits that context. The model is justified by drawing on insights and experiences with EHR in Western nations.", "sitename": "ieeexplore.ieee.org", "date": "2023-06-10", "cleaned_text": "A not-for-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.\u00a9 Copyright 2023 IEEE - All rights reserved.
