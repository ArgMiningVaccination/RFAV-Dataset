Herbal medicinals are often a part of this alternative natural therapy. And surely natural means safe, doesn't it? Some holistic methods, like providing optimal nutrition, result in real benefits for your pet. And acupuncture, another form of holistic therapy, has helped many animals with chronic pain. But in other cases, just because something is natural doesn't guarantee that it's harmless. Just look at the natural compounds garlic and onion, which can be toxic to pets. The same is true of herbal medicinals, which, if used incorrectly or with some other medicines, may make your pet sick. So as with any medical treatment, ask your veterinarian about holistic therapy before using it on your pet. That way you can see the whole picture. "}
