Clinical Establishments Act Standards for Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre CEA orICTC Appendix 1 Norms for Setting up an ICTC 1. Government health sector An ICTC can be set up in any government health facility such as a medical college, district hospital, sub -district hospital, community health centre (CHC) or a 24 -hour primary health centre (PHC) which caters to a population of 30,000 - 40,000 and has: a) a minimum of 30 beds, b) >50 deliveries in a month, or c) a TB microscopy centre. 2. Private ornot-for-profit sector ICTCs can be set up in the private ornot-for-profit sector in a facility which meets any of the criteria given below: a) Maternity homes orhospitals with >50 deliveries in a month in \"A\" and \"B\" category b) Districts and > 100 deliveries in a month in \"C\" and \"D\" category districts; c) Hospitals orclinics which treat >100 TB patients in a month; d) Hospitals orclinics which have a case load of >100 sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in a month; e) Diagnostic laboratories which perform >150 diagnostic HIV tests in a month; f) Industrial zones that employ a large number of people, particularly migrants orcasual g) Labour on an informal orcontractual basis. 3. Public sector orother government departments ICTCs can be set up by public sector organizations orother government departments. Clinical Establishments Act Standards for Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre CEA orICTC Some suggested locations are: a) Railway stations and bus terminals located at major junctions on trunk routes and b) handle a large volume of passengers every day; c) Central prisons with a large number of inmates; d) Health facilities run by State orCentral Police Organizations orArmed Forces; e) Health facilities run by public sector organizations catering to large volumes of a. migrant workers; f) Health facilities run by public sector organizations which handle >100 deliveries in amonth or have a TB microscopy centre; g) Public sector organizations such as those in the mining industry which employ large number of persons, particularly migrants orcasual labour; h) University campuses. 4. NGO sector 4.1 ICTCs can be set up in the NGO sector in a) Hot spots such as dhabas, halting points on highways, markets, fairs, etc. where there is a congregation of high -risk groups and their clients; b) TB microscopy centres orReproductive and Child Health (RCH) centres run by NGOs. An ICTC may be located in health facilities owned by the government, in the private ornot for - profit sector, in public sector organizations orother government departments such as the Railways, Employees' State Insurance Department (ESID), etc. and in sectors where nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have a presence. In the health facility, the ICTC should be well coordinated with the Department of Medicine, Microbiology, Obstetrics and Gynaecol ogy, Paediatrics, Psychiatry, Dermatology, Preventive and Social Medicine, etc. As the HIV test is a relatively low - cost test and since the risk perception is generally low, travelling a long distance to get tested could be a strong disincentive. Therefore , it is important to ensure that facilities for counselling and testing be located as close to the people as possible. ICTCs should ideally be located such that they provide maximum access to at - riskorvulnerable populations. Clinical Establishments Act Standards for Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre CEA orICTC Appendix 2 Furniture and Fixtures The minimum requirement of furniture for a counselling room in an ICTC is : a) Desk for the counselor. b) 10-15 chairs for one -on-one and group counselling sessions as well as for the waiting area. c) Lockable filing cabinet for keeping records. d) Computer with printer and UPS. e) Computer table, preferably with a chair. f) Waste basket. g) TV and DVD player in a lockable stand for provision of information on HIV orAIDS, non -communicable disease, etc. to clients. h) Posters and information materials on the walls. i) Communication aids such as flip charts. j) Condom use demonstration models. k) Leaflets orpamphlets as take -home material for clients.

The decision to pursue testing for HIV must be made by the client who seeks counselling and testing services. Client A person seeking health -care services, including in an ICTC, is a client and not a patient. Patients are considered passive recipients of treatment orcare orhospitalization, whereas clients are \"consumers \" who make a choice whether or not to avail of a certain service. \"Self -referred \"Self-referred clients \" or direct walk -in clients are clients who clients \" present themselves at the ICTC of their own volition and free will. The motivation to visit and avail of ICTC services could be based on individual risk behaviour or information and advice received, for example, from a newspaper advertisement, a friend, sexual partner or NGO. \"Provider - \"Provider -referred clients \" are clients who are referred by health - referred clients \" care providers to the ICTC for HIV counselling and testing based on clinical symptoms suggestive of an HIV infection. An HIV test as part of the medical investigation can be beneficial for their ongoing medical care and treatment. The decision to undergo an HIV test is voluntary but should be encouraged in view of the clinical benefits. Not undergoing an HIV test should not lead to withholding required medical investigations or operations. Confidential Information gathered during counselling must not be shared with others. The HIV test result must be reported only to the client unless the client states the desire to share the test result with a family member, partner or close friend. Confidentiality is defined as the state of being \"private \". Maintaining the client's privacy by restricting access to personal and confidential information, especially HIV test results, demonstrates sensitivity towards and respect for the basic rights of the client. Informed The client agrees to HIV testing through giving his orher informed consent for HIV consent. Informed consent is a deliberate and autonomous testing permission given by a client to a health -care provider to proceed with the proposed HIV test procedure. This permission is based on an adequate understanding of the advantages, risks, potential consequences and implications of an HIV test result, Clinical Establishments Act Standards for Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre CEA orICTC which could be both positive and negative. This permission is entirely the choice of the client and can never be implied or presumed. Informed The law gives paramount importance to the best interests of the consent for HIV child. In the context of HIV orAIDS, the best interests of the child testing of are served by promoting access to information and services minors including counselling and testing services. Whenever possible, minors areencouraged to involve their parents orguardians in supervising their health care. However, unwillingness to inform parents orguardians should not interfere with the minor's access to information and services. Access to ICTC services should be available to children and young people under the age of 18 years based on an assessment of their evolving capacities and their ability to comprehend the nature and implications of HIVorAIDS and an HIV test result. It is the role of the trained counsellor to assess these abilities. However, the informed consent of parents orguardians is required prior to testing minors for HIV.

One of the mandate for the council is to develop minimum standards of clinical establishments for achieving the objectives of the act. Defining minimum standards for different types of clinical establishments would facilitate implementation of Clinical Establishments, Act 2010. The regis tration and regulation of clinical establishments will ensure the delivery of assured quality in health services. The enforcement of regulation measure for clinical establishments raises the level of confidence and faith in Siddha Medicine. There has been misleading advertisements by fake establishments which needs to be curbed by introducing the transparent system of control over them. It would also help other related service agencies like health Insurance and CGHS for empanelment and enlisting their servi ce through them. The standards thus framed will provide clear, unambiguous minimum requirement for different category of clinical establishments. There are no exclusions. They are dependent on the basic functions of the clinic/hospital/provider. All sect ions mentioned are Yes and include both structure and basic processes. A.1.1. Aim To develop minimum standards for clinical establishments of Siddha Medicine for Clinics, Dispensaries, Therapy Centres, Hospitals and Teaching Hospitals A.1.2. Methodology Department of AYUSH letter vide F.No.Z.25023/12/2013 -DCC (AYUSH) dated 10 -10-13 has directed to develop a draft standard for each category of AYUSH establishments. Accordingly, a meeting was convened with participation of all faculty members to appraise t he background and need for preparing minimum standards. Director has apprised about the notification issued for registration of clinical establishments and need for development of minimum standards of clinical establishments of various categories. Then, t he survey report of Indian Medical Association has been examined through LCD projector to understand the prevail ing standards of clinical establishments. The draft minimum standard of clinical establishments sent by Department of AYUSH was also examined to learn about the template and structure of the guidelines. The faculty members were sensitized regarding the process of clinical establishments of Siddha Medicines. A.1.3. Formation of Core Committee 1. A core committee comprising 3 to 4 members for various sections of the report were formed. The identified sections were Introduction, Functions, Physical facilities, Equipments, Manpower, Drugs, Consumables, Licences, Basic Process and Bibliography. A member was given the responsibility of co -ordinating with a ll committee members 2. All the committee were given the copy of draft minimum standards prepared for Ayurveda and IMA report and directed to study the report for understanding the template and contents of report 105 3. After 2 days, the committee for \"Introduction\" section presented their views on different categories of Clinical establishments. After the deliberation and decided to list - Clinic, Minimum 10 Beds, 11 -25, 26 -50, 51 -100, 101 -200 > 200 and above considering the NABH. 4. The committee meant for \"Functions\" was asked to prepare the section B -Function within a week time and present in the next meeting considering the different categories of clinical establishments 5. The committee meant for \"Functions\" presented their report on B.1. Core functions (Clinical serv ices) for OPD and IPD followed by Auxiliary functions 6. All the faculty members deliberated in detail about the identified speciality areas under 'B.1.Core Functions\" referring speciality education (Doctor of Medicine / Post Graduate Diploma) courses offere d under CCIM regulations 7. With inputs from faculty members, the core functions were modified and a copy of draft was given to all members. All the committee members were directed to refer the functions and prepare the standards for each sections assigned to them for submission after a week time. 8. Then, a meeting held to deliberate on the draft report prepared by the respective committee. Each committee has presented their sections and discussed A.1.4. Meeting in Department of AYUSH 1. Finally the draft report ha s been compiled and presented at the meeting convened by Dr.D.C.Katoch, Convenor on 13 -11-2013 in Department of AYUSH 2. The outcome of the meeting was, categorisation of clinical establishments 1) Unambiguous understanding and intent for development of standards 2) Categorisation of Hospitals 3) Conceptualisation of different sections of minimum standards 3. In the light of outcome of the meeting in Department of AYUSH, a draft standard prepared 4. Review comments obtained from selected private Siddha practitioners A letter vide No.K.25023/12/2013 -DCC (AYUSH) dated 7 -2-2014 from Department of AYUSH conveyed the classification of AYUSH Clinical Establishments with approval of Secretary (AYUSH) and directed to revise the standards of AYUSH clinical esta blishments. Then a meeting of selected faculty members under the Chairmanship of Director conducted on 13 -2-2014 for preparing the documents. A.2 Scope This includes the services being provided by the facility to which the standards will be applicable (For example common minimum standards framed for a Dispensary are applicable to a Dispensary only and not to a single speciality hospital). 106 CLINICS DISPENSARIES THERAPY CENTRES B.1.
