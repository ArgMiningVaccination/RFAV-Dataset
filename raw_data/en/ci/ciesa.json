Turns out we were wrong. Becoming increasingly more mainstream and popping up in trendy boutiques around the country, crystals are said to legitimately benefit overall spiritual and physical health. Ever since the Egyptians, various cultures have claimed that crystals have healing properties and emotional effects, such as boosting moods and releasing negative energy. Authentic crystals may just be the holistic health product you're missing. In honor of the upcoming full moon (February 19), we sat down with the owner of Hampden shop [Crystals, Candles, & Cauldrons](http://www.wiccancrystal.com/), Shelley Klimm, to find out more about the specific benefits of crystals, which ones are most popular, and how to use them in your daily life. Why do you think crystals have become such a huge trend? We are seeing a sudden emphasis on people's spiritual paths, especially with everything going on in the world today. We've got a lot of negative energy out there and people are realizing these things really do vibrate\u2014they help you feel better. Spiritual vibration is really elevating, which is a good thing. I don't think it's going to be just a trend. People are going stick with it. What are some benefits of crystal healing? There are some crystals out there that work really well for depression and anxiety. Just holding them helps you. I've known people who are able to get off of anti-anxiety drugs just by pulling out their crystal out and holding it. I personally think the mental benefits really outweigh the physical healing. That's just me. I've just seen so many cases where people have had a lot of emotional issues and these crystals have brought them back from the brink. What would you say to someone who is skeptical about crystal healing? I get a lot of, \"Well, god wouldn't approve of these things.\" To those people I say, \"Well if god created the earth, god created those crystals.\" And his or her energy is put into them. Scientific fact: they vibrate. They're alive. But you can't twist somebody's arm. Sometimes, I'll have somebody like that come in here and I'll gift them with a crystal and I'll tell them to work with it for two weeks and see how they feel. How do you use crystals in your day-to-day life? I am one of those people at home I have really large pieces. So I have them under the bed, at the top of the bed, where I do my meditation. I wear crystal jewelry depending on how I feel that day. So like today I have on moonstone and appetite. They are two stones that work your intuitiveness. They're also just very good \"feel good\" stones. They keep me grounded. When I got up this morning, that's what I needed for today. Occasionally, I will have something in my pocket. If I know I'm going to be dealing with a lot of negative energy that day or as the day progresses, I will go grab a piece of black tourmaline and stick it in my left pocket. Why do you think crystals have become more mainstream? We are getting more open\u2014that's the whole thing. Be aware that there is this market where they're scamming people. There are also a lot of crystal practitioners that are scamming people. We know where all our crystals come from since daughter and I hand-pick everything. I think that's why people come to us because we can tell them the story about the crystal. As long as there are places like this, you are just going to see an increase. Do different crystals have different traits and effects? You can go through the books and it will list rose quartz for your heart chakra, crystal quartz as your master crystal, and most of the black stones tend to be grounding stones or protecting stones. I am a firm believer that, if you are drawn to a particular crystal, there's a reason for it. That crystal is calling out to you for a certain reason. I don't tend to get too hung up in what the books say\u2014and I will tell my customers that. You can't tell something that is hundreds and thousands of years old: \"Hey you are going to do this for me.\" I let that crystal tell me how it wants to work on my body. My customers that listen to that and follow that are very happy and pleased with the outcome. What are a few basic fundamentals to crystals and crystal healing? I usually tell people to start with the basic crystals: crystal quartz, amethyst, rose quartz, citrine, and labradorite. From those five crystals, you can pretty much do anything and then you can build your collection around them. Everybody wants rose quartz because everybody really thinks it is a crystal to attract love. It's really a crystal about self-love and self-esteem. If you don't love yourself and you don't have good feelings about yourself, you can't love someone else properly. So that's usually the crystal we get the most requests for. How do you cleanse crystals and why is it necessary? A lot of people will use them three days before a full moon, during a full moon, and three days after. So you've got a seven-day period that you can put your stones on the window sill and have them cleansed and charged up by full moon. I have so many that it's just not feasible for me to put everything out on the window sill. I use a stone that is called selenite, which cleanses and charges your crystals. It grabs hold of negative energy and transmutes it to positive energy. Crystals pick up energy. Selenite will pick up and release it. Everything else picks it up and holds on to it. It's really good once a month to go ahead do a cleansing to get rid of all of that negative energy around you. "}
