Many people wonder if crystals have healing powers, and while there are many anecdotes describing the curative effects of crystals and healing stones, crystal energy works differently on everyone depending on how receptive you are. While the Energy Muse healing crystal chart includes helpful insights, it is equally as important that you make a conscious effort to open your heart and mind to the power of crystal healing when working with these stones.

Use this form to download our healing crystals guide for beginners, including the best healing stones to add to your collection! What can crystals do for me? Think of your crystal as an ally on your journey, helping you to reach your goals and make positive changes in all areas of your life. Use the Energy Muse crystal guide with healing stones for manifesting your intentions and what you want to create in your life. These powerfully charged stones connect us to the energies we want to embody because they are tangible, physical forms that have powerful vibrations. This energy continues to connect with you when you wear these intention crystals close to the skin or place them in your environment. With every thought and intention, these crystals pick up on your unique vibrational energy and amplify the positive vibes that you're cultivating. In this magical world of vibrations, crystal energy helps you on your spiritual journey because it works to hold your intention and send it out into the universe. A thoughtful and meaningful intention is the starting point for working with healing crystals because the intention acts as the \"job\" you give to your crystal, allowing its energy to work for you. How do crystals work? At its core, the power of crystal healing is that each crystal carries a unique vibration. As Albert Einstein is reported to have said, everything in life is vibration. The vibrations that these energy crystals hold can realign and re-calibrate your energy with theirs, helping you to raise your vibration and reach a higher state of being. One of the first pieces of scientific evidence relating to the power of crystals is the work done by IBM scientist Marcel Vogel. While watching crystals grow under a microscope, he noticed that their shape took the form of whatever he was thinking about. He hypothesized that these vibrations are the result of the constant assembling and disassembling of bonds between molecules. He also tested the metaphysical power of Clear Quartz and proved that rocks can store thoughts similar to how tapes use magnetic energy to record sound. Due to their structure and composition, crystals emit vibrations at a constant frequency, meaning that their vibrations do not change. This is especially powerful because when a crystal comes into contact with a lower vibration, it raises the vibration of that person or thing to match its own. When a crystal comes into contact with your body or your energy, it attunes you to its higher frequency, which allows you to move past mental, physical and spiritual blockages. This boost of positive and uplifting energy can be the difference between darkness and light. The crystal works with your intentions in a similar way. Holding strong and positive energy, the crystal amplifies and magnifies the energy of your intention so you can manifest faster and more effectively. At every moment, we have the ability to choose our thoughts and as we continue our journey, each day presents us with new challenges and wonderful beginnings. Healing crystals remind us to quiet the chatter of the mind and reconnect to the universally healing vibrations of the Earth. An important lesson to learn from crystals is patience, because just like the eons of time it took for these semi-precious stones to evolve and transform, working with the healing power of crystals also takes time. As you learn, grow, and evolve, use crystals as a reminder to be grateful for the abundance of Mother Nature and the great mysteries of the universe. What are crystals used for? Whether you are looking to enhance a specific area of your life, like your love life or professional life, or you are looking to let go of something that's holding you back like fear or stress, crystals can be your support system and your tangible connection to that goal. They provide you with a touchpoint: something to come back to whenever you need a reminder or want to reconnect with your goal. No matter what you are working on, crystals can be used as an ally or a tool to help you get there faster. If you have difficulty letting go of old ideas that are no longer serving you, Black Tourmaline is a powerful gemstone for releasing unwanted patterns that may have turned into bad habits. It helps release all the negative energy in your body and within your energy field. This stone also serves as a talisman for protection, which is essential if you're the type of person that easily picks up on other people's energy. Hematite is great for deflecting the negative moods of others by grounding you and reconnecting your spirit to the energy of the Earth. If you're seeking more tranquility and calm in your life, Amethyst is one of the best intention crystals for relieving stress and bringing balance back into your life. Another gemstone that helps balance out emotions is Moonstone, which gives you support when you're feeling overly emotional or out of touch with your feelings. Rose quartz is also helpful for emotional well-being because it opens and realigns the heart chakra, which magnifies feelings of self-love and the unconditional love of others. Whether you're seeking out crystals for their physical healing or to bring peace and tranquility into your life, they all work to increase your vibrational frequency. If you feel good when you hold the crystal in your hand or have it touching your skin, or even if you don't feel the immediate effects of your stone, know that the crystals are emitting positive vibrations to help you up-level and grow.
