Inquiries will be welcome that focus on prot otype development, and which detail plans for future commercialization possibilities. About the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives. In developing countries, it focuses on improving people's health and giving them the chance to lift themselv es out of hunger and extreme poverty. In the United States, it seeks to ensure that all people\u2014especially those with the fewest resources\u2014have access to the opportunities they need to succeed in school and life. Based in Seattle, the Foundation is led by CEO Je ff Raikes and co-chair William H. Gates Sr., under the direction of Bill and Melinda Gates, and Warren Buffett. Project Background The Foundation is focused on ensuring that all children in the developing world receive a full complement of available vaccines, protecting them against a range of vaccine-preventable diseases. The Foundation endorses and st rives for the goal outlined by the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS), of at least 90% vaccination coverage in every country, and at least 80% coverage in every district. Regular measurement of vaccination coverage across the developing world is important to measure progress against coverage goals, and to identify areas of weakness in delivery systems so that corrective action can be take n. Current tools and processes to measure vaccination coverage have significant limitatio ns, leading to estimates of coverage with questionable precision. This RFLOI will solicit proposals from orga nizations to develop a prototype and detail a commercialization plan for an imm unity assessment tool that can help more accurately measure vaccination coverage in the developing world. Existing Tools/Processes and Basis for Contract: We have summarized some of the main tools and processes currently utilized for assessing vaccination coverage in the developing wo rld along with key limitations of each: Administrative coverage reports. These are reports which are generated by each country, and which are aggregated from administ rative data reported at the district level and below. The data are based on a tally of vaccinations given in a defined \"catchment\" 3 area. Coverage estimates derived from th ese data are usually inaccurate (at times grossly inaccurate) because of inflation of numbers and the uncertainty in denominator estimates (i.e. the estimated population of surviving infants.) Household surveys. Periodically, surveys are conducted of households to determine if children in a target age group in the hous ehold received the appropriate vaccines. These surveys utilize sampling techniques such as cluster surveys, or lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS). These techniques try to ensure sub-populations are captured in estimates and results may be le ss affected by inaccurate census data. However, in many low-income countries re gions may be inaccessible to survey teams due to political insecurity and/or geograph ic constraints. Another challenge is that surveys rely on parental re call of the vaccines administered (which are frequently inaccurate) and/or home-based vaccination ca rds (which are not universally distributed or retained, may not be brought to each imm unization visit to be updated, and may not be correctly filled in). Serosurveys. These surveys consist of collecting blood samples from children in the target age group and testing for the presence of antigen-specific antibodies. This involves transporting the samples using a re verse cold chain to a central laboratory where serum is separated and assayed for the pr esence of antigen-specific antibodies. For infections such as tetanus and measles, there are data on the antibody concentration which correlates with protection against infection or disease. These tests can determine protection against disease, wh ich can uncover additional information on the performance of a vaccination system (e.g., poor handling of vaccines if seroprevalence is low in areas where cove rage is known to be high). However, serosurveys have significant limitations. For infections other than tetanus (for which there is no natural immunity) and hepatitis B (a subunit vaccine), current assays are not able to distinguish between antibodies resu lting from vaccination and those resulting from infection, thus the use of antibody assays to validate coverage in areas where infection is prevalent is challenging. The need to collect blood samples can also lead to low participation rates in surveys, and the process to collect the samples and analyze them in a specialized lab is time-consuming and sometimes complex. The goal of this RFLOI is to significantly im prove on these tools and processes in terms of accuracy of results and/or ease of use in the field. Objective of RFLOI: The purpose of this RFLOI is to solicit inquirie s toward the development of a prototype and the detailing of a commercialization plan for a tool that rapidly assesses the immune status of children against selected vaccine- preventabl e diseases (e.g. teta nus,measles, etc.) . The ideal tool would be low cost,easy to use in the fiel d, and on a large scale, by those working in national immunization programs. This tool woul d be used as an adjunct to current vaccination coverage surveys - to help more accurately determine/validate coverage levels and assess 4 population-level immunity. Letters of inquiry sh ould address how the potential recipient would develop a prototype tool and create a plan for commercialization. The target parameters are as follows: The Foundation expects to invest up to $6 mi llion US toward this project over a three- year period. It is likely that the total amount awarded will be split between a number of grant recipients, with varying award amou nts based on project scopes and timing. Ideally, prototype development will be complete by the end of 2013. The commercialization plan should detail how the product could be produced at scale by 2015. Key desired characteristics are summarized below. It is important to note that these are ideal characteristics of an immunity assessment tool. Potential recipients will not be excluded if one or more of the characteristics cannot be achieved. In fact, all organizations are encouraged to apply, even if several characteristics cannot be met. o Test should sample oral fluid An acceptable alternative would be a test utilizing samples of very small volumes (<100 microliters) of whol e blood (obtainable from a quick finger/heel stick sample) to measure antibody levels o Sample collection should be rapid (< 1 minute per child) o Sample collection should be feasible in young children aged 6 months and above o Test collection should be as simple as possible, assuming use by minimally trained personnel o Immediate point of care (POC) results are ideal An acceptable alternative would requir e the transport of samples without a cold chain to a central laboratory within the same country, where assays would be conducted (\"sample and send\") o Sample collection must be feasible in low income countries in a variety of climates, ranging from sub-zero to tropical temperatures o As with test collection, the reading and in terpretation of results should be simple to understand and not rely on subtle visu al cues (e.g. minimal color change) that can be misinterpreted o If a device is required along with collec tion instrument, it should be inexpensive small, durable, and simple to use o Test should be safe (i.e., easy to avoid contamination) Designed so additional safety wear is minimal or not required A used kit should be easily identifiable A used test should have clear route for safe disposal o Test should assess IgG antibody levels against, at a minimum, tetanus toxoid. Ideally, polio and measles should also be included. The potential to add other antigens, such as Haemophilus infuenzae type b and hepatitis B, to this platform should be described in the proposal. All assays should be done from a single sample andutilize one collection device. 5 o Test results should indicate if IgG levels measured are above or below currently accepted standards for protection against infection and disease o If the test is done on oral fluid, resu lts should be validated against concurrent antibody measurements from serum (to en sure against a false negative result due to insufficient IgG in the oral fluid sample). o Cost of test should be inexpensive, allowing for procurement and introduction into developing country immunization programs. Applicants should provide estimates of productions costs at different volumes. The Foundation will invite select applicants to submit full proposals based on a scored review of the letters of inquiry. Proposals will be assesse d by a panel of internal and external reviewers according to the criteria laid out in the sect ion entitled \"Assessment of Letters of Inquiry\" below. Execution of Agreement and Related Issues: Funding Modes: Generally, the Foundation funds projects such as this one through grants. In some circumstances, the Foundation may dete rmine that an alternat ive funding mechanism such as Program Related Investment (PRI) is appropriate. The funding mode and terms will be determined by the Foundation taking into account various factors including the final partnership model an d Foundation/Recipient requirements such as charitable intent, legal requirements and tax requirements. Data Sharing: Depending on the final funding ag reements, we may require confidential access to details of technologies employed as well as prod uction costs, at the time of funding and/or at a future date as a condition of funding. Assessment of Letters of Inquiry: Proposals will be evaluated by a panel of Foundation and non-Foundation staff using the criteria described below: 1. Potential of the technology a. Potential of proposed technology to deliver on target product profile as outlined above and to be utilized within structures and conditions of the developing world 1. Organizational capability and technical capabilities of the proposed team a. Experience in developing and using antibody assays b. Project team experience with an tibody detection technologies 2. Application Quality a. Overall quality of application, including recommended approach, insight and recommendations on how to tackle complex issues, including Global Access 6 requirements. Identification of key cha llenges and their impact on deliverables and results (e.g., feasibility in developing world, regulatory, and manufacturing) Global Access and Intellectual Property Since the output of this program may lead to inno vative technologies and/or products that will result in improved diagnostics for those that n eed of them most in the developing world, the successful development of these high priority pr oducts may require substantial involvement and support of private-sector industries as sub-co ntractors, and may also involve collaborations with multiple organizations, including academic and/or non-profit research institutions. It is the intent of this program to support the formation of appropriate public-private partnerships that are essential to meet these urgent global health needs. Intellectual property (IP) rights and the management of IP rights are likely to play an important role in achieving the goals of this program. To this end, the foundation requires that, even at the LOI stage, all applicants seriously consider their willingness to submit a fu ll proposal in compliance with the foundation's proposal guidelines, a portion of which asks for certain information and intentions regarding intellectual property and global access concerns. Specifically, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation requires that you agree to use good faith efforts to conduct and manage the research, technologies, information and innovations involved in the Project in a manner that enables (a) the knowledge gained during the Project to be promptly and broadly disseminated, and (b) the intended product(s) to be made avai lable and accessible at reasonable cost to the developing countries of the world. The Found ation refers to this as \"Global Access.\" As part of the foundation's review and evaluation of each full proposal, due diligence will be conducted with respect to each participant's ability and commitment to manage intellectual property in a manner consistent with the stated scientific and charitable goals of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Due diligence activities may include inquiry into an applicant's: 1) Freedom to operate and ability to freely use and acquire needed background technology; 2) Commitment to share data and technology with other participants to facilitate the development of a common set of technical and business standards regarding tools that rapidly asses the immune status of child ren against selected vaccine-preventable diseases; 3) Commitment to promote the utilization, commercialization and availability of inventions for public benefit in developing countries; and 4) Business plan for the development and sustainable commercialization of the rapid immune assessment tools developed as part of this program. In order to facilitate this due diligence process applicants are encouraged to provide information with respect to items 1-4 above in their submission materials. Applicants and their collaborators will be requir ed to participate in th e creation of a Global Access Strategy in an effort to codify their commitment to achieving the stated scientific and 7 charitable goals of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to promote the utilization, commercialization, and availability of inventions for public benefit in developing countries. The Global Access Strategy will include provisions for the management and use of intellectual property, know-how and technologies to facilitate collaboration with other participants in this program with the goal of developing and delivering viable tools that rapidly asses the immune status of children against selected vaccine-preventable diseases. Applicants are also expected to make new info rmation and materials know n to the research and medical communities in a time ly manner through publications, web announcements, progress reports to the foundation, and other approp riate mechanisms. These concepts may be discussed at some length with the applicants that are invited to submit full proposals, and will be addressed (to the extent appropriate) within each final grant agreement.
