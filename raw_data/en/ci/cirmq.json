Early Pain Theories and Remedies Since ancient times, humans have sought to conquer pain using a variety of treatments ranging from the sublime to the bizarre. Although the Greeks and Romans first advanced a theory of sensation\u2014the idea that the brain and nervous system have a role in producing the perception of pain\u2014it was not until the Middle Ages and well into the Renaissance that evidence began to accumulate in support of these theories. Advertisement for curing morphine addictions from Overland Monthly , January 1900. The nineteenth century saw the development of morphine, codeine, and heroin\u2014potent pain medications derived from opium. In the early 1800s morphine was marketed as a pain medication as well as treatment for opium and alcohol addiction. Soon thereafter , cocaine was successfully isolated from coca leaves by a German chemist.A 1923 advertisement for aspirin. Source Wikimedia Commons.

Until the late 1800s laudanum, a popular tincture containing opium and alcohol and other ingredients such as honey, saffron, or cinnamon, was widely used\u2014and completely legal. It was commonly used for pain, menstrual cramps, sleep aid, and a wide variety of other ailments both in children and adults. At the turn of the nineteenth century, \"pure\" aspirin was isolated from salicylate-rich plants. This discovery represented a major breakthrough in the history of pain medications. To this day aspirin is the most commonly used pain reliever worldwide. The Experience of Pain The Institute of Medicine (IOM) estimates that treatment and management of pain costs about $635 billion annually in the United States in direct medical costs and lost productivity (IOM, 2011). Despite these costs\u2014approaching two- thirds of a trillion dollars a year\u2014our failure to enact policies on pain treatment, education, management, and palliative care, along with the failure to put in place functioning drug supply systems, has hampered the development of consistent pain policies throughout the United States.Although v ast amounts of money are spent each y ear on the treatment and management of pain, it is inadequately treated in vulner able populations. This includes women, children, older adults, ethnic minorities, patients with cognitiv e impairment, cancer patients, nursing home residents, and those with activ e addiction or a history of substance abuse. Untreated pain has a profound impact on qualit y of life and can ha ve physical, psychological, social, and economic consequences (King & Fr aser, 2013). Among African Americans, lower r ates of clinician assessment and higher r ates of undertreatment ha ve been found in all settings and across all t ypes of pain (IOM, 2011). Similar results ha ve been found among Hispanics, Asian Americans, and Nativ e Americans. These disparities among r acial and ethnic minorities are related to lack of pro vider education, system-lev el lack of access to pain medications, and cultur al beliefs about pain (Makris et al. , 2015). Surprisingly , undertreatment of pain can be an issue ev en for those with diseases and conditions known to cause pain, such as cancer , HIV, and tr auma. Conserv ative estimates by the W orld Health Organization (WHO) suggest that 1 million terminal HIV/AIDS patients, 5.5 million cancer patients, and 800,000 tr auma patients ha ve little or no access to treatment for moder ate to sev ere pain (King & Fr aser, 2013). Regulatory Issues r e Pain Management Patients, pro viders, communities, and healthcare systems ha ve struggled to achiev e balance in their pain policies. This is particularly evident when weighing the benefits and harms associated with opioid treatment for chronic pain and potential harmful consequences of long-term opioid ther apy\u2014especially misuse, addiction, and o verdose. The Pain and P olicies Study Group , the Joint Commission, and go vernment guidelines all provide guidance to healthcare pro viders and organizations in volved in the treatment and management of pain. The Central Principle of Balance For sev eral years, the Univ ersity of Wisconsin P ain and P olicies Study Group has been grading state pain policies. A state' s grade represents the qualit y of its policies affecting pain treatment, based on the Central Principle of Balance ; higher gr ades mean more balanced state pain management policies, including the medical use of opioids. Oregon receiv ed an \" A\" in 2013, and joins 15 other states as ha ving the most balanced pain policies in the country (PPSG, 2014a).The Centr al Principle of Balance represents a state' s obligation to establish a system of drug controls that prev ent abuse, tr afficking, and div ersion of narcotic drugs while ensuring the adequate medical a vailabilit y of needed medications. It encour ages go vernments to ensure the adequate a vailabilit y of opioids for medical and scientific purposes. This includes empowering medical professionals to pro vide opioids in the course of professional pr actice; allowing them to prescribe, dispense, and administer according to the individual medical needs of the patient; and ensuring that a sufficient supply of opioids is a vailable to meet medical demand (PPSG, 2014b). The Joint Commission The Joint Commission, in collabor ation with the Univ ersity of Wisconsin, has dev eloped pain management standards for accredited ambulatory care facilities, beha vioral healthcare organizations, critical access hospitals, home care pro viders, hospitals, office-based surgery pr actices, and long-term care pro viders. The standards require organizations to: The Joint Commission' s pain guidelines further state that: The Joint Commission does not require healthcare organizations to assess pain as a fifth vital sign (Joint Commission, 2016), although the Commission does require that patients be screened for pain during the initial assessment. Some large organizations, including the Veteran's Administr ation (V A), decided to describe pain as the fifth vital sign , to be assessed along with temper ature, pulse, respir ation, and blood pressure. Acknowledging that assessing pain as a fifth vital sign ma y have contributed to the o verprescribing of opioids, in June 2016 the American Medical Association recommended that pain be removed as one of the vital signs for which patients are assessed. Intractable Pain Treatment ActsRecogniz e the right of patients to appropriate assessment and management of pain1. Screen patients for pain during their initial assessment and, when clinically required, during ongoing periodic re- assessments2. Educate patients suffering from pain and their families about pain management as a part of care (Joint Commission, 2013)3. Clinicians must be competent in the assessment and management of pain.1. Pain should not interfere with optimal lev el of function or rehabilitation. 2. Pain and symptom management must be included in discharge planning. (Joint Commission, 2013)3.Intractable pain is commonly defined as \"a pain state . . . which in the gener ally accepted course of medical pr actice no relief or cure of the cause of the pain is possible. . . . \" (PPSG, 2014b). Intractable pain treatment acts (IPT A) are statutes originally intended to impro ve access to pain management b y providing ph ysicians immunit y from regulatory sanctions for prescribing opioids to patients with intr actable pain. The first IPT A was adopted b y Texas in 1989 (PPSG, 2014b). In 1995 the Oregon Legislativ e Assembly passed its own Intr actable P ain Act. This act allowed a ph ysician to prescribe or administer controlled substances to a patient diagnosed with a condition causing intr actable pain without fear of sanction from the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners, so long as that ph ysician complied with the pro visions of the statute. IPTAs were probably not intended to formaliz e the use of opioids for pain as being within medical pr actice only when meeting the IPT A standards. The IPT A language w as often ambiguous and w as not consistent with the recognition that pain management, including the use of opioid medications, is part of gener al medicine and is a legitimate professional practice (PPSG, 2014b). In 2008 Oregon repealed the definition of intractable pain from its IPT A. The resulting la ws now go vern the treatment of all t ypes of pain. Instead of statutes, man y states, including Oregon, ha ve chosen to dev elop guidelines or regulations containing language aimed at enhancing pain management (PPSG, 2014b). Oregon Pain Management Programs The Oregon legislature has tak en a number of positions on the treatment of pain, including establishing the Oregon P ain Management Commission, the Oregon Prescription Drug Monitoring Progr am, the Oregon Medical Marijuana Act, the Oregon P ain Guidance Group , and further medical and nursing policy statements. Oregon Pain Management Commission The Oregon P ain Management Commission (OPMC) w as established to impro ve pain management in Oregon through education, pain management recommendations, research, policy analysis, and model projects. The Commission relates the concerns of patients in Oregon on issues of pain management to the Go vernor and the Legislativ e Assembly (OHA, 2015).Most licensed healthcare professionals pr acticing in Oregon are required to tak e a comprehensiv e course on pain management. The pain management continuing-education requirement, which went into effect on January 1, 2006, includes six hours of coursework on a v ariety of pain topics and an additional one-hour requirement pro vided b y the Oregon Pain Management Commission. Currently , physicians who continually treat patients in chronic or terminal pain must complete a pain management education progr am for relicensure. In addition, ph ysician chologists, ph ysical ther apists licensed in Oregon must complete a pain management continuing-education course (OHA, 2015). Oregon Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) The Oregon Prescription Drug Monitoring Progr am (PDMP) is a state-run, electronic database used to tr ack the prescribing and dispensing of controlled prescription drugs to patients. It is designed to monitor suspected abuse or diversion (the channeling of the drug into an illegal use) b y providing a prescriber or pharmacist with critical information regarding a patient 's prescription history . This information helps identif y high-risk patients who would benefit from early interv entions (CDC, 2016a). Oregon' s prescription drug monitoring progr am (PDMP) w as established in July 2009. In 2015 Senate Bill 71 w as signed into la w, which requires pharmacies to report data electronically no later than 72 hours after dispensing a prescription drug that is subject to the prescription monitoring progr am (OPDMP , 2016). Pharmacies are required to submit prescription data to the PDMP system for all Schedules II, III and IV controlled substances dispensed to Oregon residents. The protected health information is collected and stored securely . Only Oregon-licensed healthcare pro viders and pharmacists are authoriz ed to access information from the PDMP system. By la w their access is limited to patients under their care. During 2015 more than 7.5 million controlled-substance prescriptions were reported to the Oregon PDMP . The top 12 prescribed In Oregon v oters appro ved Measure 67, which remo ved state-lev el criminal penalties on the use, possession, and cultiv ation of marijuana b y patients who possess a signed recommendation from their ph ysician stating that marijuana \"ma y mitigate\" debilitating symptoms. The Oregon Medical Marijuana Progr am oversees the medical marijuana cardholder registry for patients and regulates medical marijuana and grow sites. Cannabis Sativa Source: Wi kipedia Commons. Originally from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser vice. Alprazolam (4.7%) established state-run registries for patients and caregiv ers to document their eligibilit y to engage in medical marijuana use, which requires ph ysician documentation of a person' s debilitating condition. A ph ysician must state in writing annually that the patient has a qualif ying medical condition and that medical marijuana ma y lessen or reliev e the symptoms or effects of that condition. The allowed medical conditions include: Cancer Glaucoma stress disorder (PT SD) Medical marijuana can also be used for an y other medical condition or treatment that produces one or more of the following: Cachexia (a weight loss disease that can be caused b y HIV or cancer) Severe pain Severe nausea Seizures, including but not limited to seizures caused b y epilepsy Persistent muscle spasms, including but not limited to those caused b y multiple sclerosis (OMMP , 2016) More than 72,000 people are registered as medical marijuana users in Oregon as of April 25, 2016. More than 66,000 reported they used marijuana for sev ere pain, about 21,000 reported its use for muscle spasms, including for multiple sclerosis, and about 9,800 reported its use for nausea (OMMP , 2016). Did you know . . . It is now legal in Oregon for adults 21 and older to possess and use recreational marijuana from appro ved medical marijuana dispensaries within limits. Adults 21 and older can share or giv e away recreational marijuana, receiv e it as a gift, grow their own (four plants per residence), or purchase it from appro ved medical marijuana dispensaries (Oregon.go v, 2016). Oregon Pain Guidance Group (OPG)The OPG group is a group of sev enty healthcare professionals from Jackson and Josephine Counties. The group w as formed in response to the growing number of prescription opioid overdose deaths in their communit y. The goal of OPG is to decrease the morbidit y and mortalit y associated with the inappropriate use of opiates and to shift the focus to non- opiate treatments for complex chronic pain, so that patients experience an o verall impro vement in well-being (OPG, 2015). In 2016 the OPG published Pain Treatment Guidelines , a comprehensiv e resource that includes recommendations on the treatment of acute and chronic pain, pain in adolescents and children, pain control in older adults and those with dementia, tr auma-informed pain care, and pain control for cancer and palliativ e care. The guidelines also discuss the use of opioids during pregnancy , managing pain in the emergency department, and recommended opioid policies for dentists. The guidelines are a vailable online here available online here . Oregon Medical and Nursing Policy Statements The Oregon Medical Board (OMB) urges the skillful use of effectiv e pain control for all patients. Pro viders are encour aged to treat pain within the scope of their pr actice and refer patients to the appropriate specialists when indicated. In all cases of pain management, practitioners should maintain records to tr ack prescriptions and coordinate care with other treating pr actitioners. Healthcare pro viders are encour aged to use the Oregon Prescription Drug Monitoring Progr am (PDMP) (OMB , 2016). The Oregon State Board of Nursing maintains an interpretiv e statement on pain management. The statement promotes patient access to the appropriate, ther apeutic, and effectiv e assessment, diagnosis, and management of acute and chronic pain. The management of pain must be a priorit y for nurses and all others who pro vide care to individuals in pain. The interpretativ e statement: Promotes a balanced approach to pain management. Promotes the optimal lev el of nursing pr actice in pain management using pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and multimodal approaches. Establishes a fr amework leading to sound clinical judgment in managing acute, chronic, and end-of -life pain (OSBN, 2015) The Physiology of PainThe thalamus is the destination of spinothalamic tract\u2014the sensory pathway responsible for processing pain, temperature, and crude touch. The brainstem reticular formation, which forms a diffuse, central core within the brainstem is the destination of the spinoreticular tract. Source: Illustration provided by 3DScience.com. Used by permission.Pain occurs when sensory nerv e endings called nociceptors (also referred to as pain receptors) come into contact with a painful or no xious stimulus. The resulting painful impulse tr avels from the sensory nerv e ending, enters the dorsal spinal cord, and tr avels to diverse parts the br ain via nerv e tracts in the spinal cord and br ainstem. The br ain processes the pain sensation and quickly mak es a motor response in an attempt to cease the action causing the pain. Sensory Nerves Entering the Spinal Cord A section of a lumbar vertebra showing the sensory nerves (in yellow, with bulge) entering the dorsal part of the spinal cord. Illustration provided by 3DScience.com. Used by permission. There are two major classes of nerv e fibers associated with the tr ansmission of pain: The unm yelinated C fibers respond to thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli and produce the sensation of dull, diffuse, aching, burning, and dela yed pain. The m yelinated A-delta fibers respond to mechanical (pressure) stimulus and produce the sensation of sharp , localiz ed, fast pain. One of the most important centr al pain path ways is the spinothalamic tr act, which originates in the spinal cord and extends to the thalamus. This spinal tr act tr ansmits sensory information related to pain, temper ature, and crude touch. Another prominent path way is the spinoreticular tr act, which is involved in nociceptiv e processing. The spinoreticular tr act is similar to the spinothalamic tr act in that it is ex cited b y similar sensory fibers. R ather than ascending to the thalamus howev er, spinoreticular neurons terminate within the br ainstem reticular formation.Unmyelinated C fibers (small and slow) 1. Myelinated A -delta fibers (m yelinated and fast) 2.Sensitization Sensitization is a neuroph ysiologic response in which the pain path ways become more sensitiv e. This can include a drop in the threshold for activ ating nociceptors and an increase in the frequency of firing for all stimuli (IA SP, 2012). Hyperalgesia (exagger ated responses to stimuli) and allodynia (in which a stimulus not normally painful is perceiv ed as painful) are clinical mark ers used to detect the presence of sensitization (Z ouikr et al. , 2016). There are two t ypes of sensitization: peripher al and centr al. Peripheral sensitization occurs in response to the release of inflammatory molecules such as histamine, prostaglandins, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These substances sensitiz e nociceptors y creating an \"inflammatory soup\" that enhances pain sensitivit y by reducing the threshold of nociceptor activ ation (Z ouikr et al. , 2016). Under normal circumstances, peripher al hypersensitivit y returns to normal when inflammation subsides or the source of the injury is remo ved (K yranou & Puntillo , nociceptiv neurons progressiv ely increase their response to repeated non-painful stimuli, dev elop spontaneous activit y, and increase the area of the body that is in volved with the pain. The h yperalgesia of centr al sensitization usually dev elops as part of ongoing pathology , such as damage to peripher al or centr al nerve fibers, cancer , or rheumatoid arthritis, and is considered maladaptiv e (Kyranou & Puntillo , 2012). Using Neuroimaging dev elopment of computed tomogr aphy (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has allowed researchers to look into the living br ain and gain some understanding of the parts of the br ain affected b y pain. The subsequent dev elopment of positron emission tomogr aphy (PET) has allowed researchers, for the first time, to in vestigate neuronal activit y throughout the entire br ain (Casey , 2015). Imaging techniques are helping us understand that pain is more complex than previously thought and in volves div erse regions of the br ain (ie, the am ygdala, insula, and the anterior cingulate cortex). W e are also learning that pain in volves complex inter actions between the immune, nerv ous, and endocrine systems (Z ouikr et al. , 2016). In a study of patients with chronic low back pain, neuroimaging showed differences in br ain function when compared to health y controls. Chronic low back pain patients showed activation in pain-related br ain regions during administr ation of experimental pain, differences in activ ation during emotional decision-making tasks, and changes in specific brain regions during a simple visual attention task (K ong et al. , 2013).Neuroimaging has also shown structural changes in the br ain for patients with chronic low back pain. One study indicated that chronic low back pain patients showed 5% to 11% less neocortical gr ay matter v olume than control subjects and that the decreased v olume w as related to pain dur ation. This indicates that chronic low back pain is associated with structur al pathologic changes in the br ain (K ong et al. , 2013). In patients with chronic pain, a number of research groups ha ve reported significant changes in pain processing including alter ations in basic processes in the br ain and brainstem, changes in functional plasticit y, and the dev elopment of allodynia* in which a stimulus not normally painful is perceiv ed as painful. Imaging techniques using magnetic resonance spectroscop y have shown alter ations in neurotr ansmitters in chronic pain patients. Such approaches ha ve been applied to migr aine, back pain, and spinal cord injury (Borsook et al. , 2007). *Allodynia is a clinical feature of neuropathies, complex regional pain syndrome, post-herpetic neuralgia, migraine, and fibromyalgia. A number of studies ha ve shown changes in v olume in br ain regions in patients with chronic neuropathic pain, complex regional pain syndrome, and fibrom yalgia. This insight has begun to tr ansform our thinking on chronic pain, since these changes indicate the potential that chronic pain is a neurodegener ative disease (Borsook et al. , 2007). Physiologic Effects of Unrelieved Pain Unreliev ed pain can lead to ph ysiologic changes and negativ e effects on multiple systems. The endocrine system reacts b y releasing an ex cessiv e amount of hormones, ultimately resulting in carboh ydrate, protein, and fat catabolism, poor glucose utilization, and other harmful effects. This reaction combined with inflammatory processes can produce weight loss, tach ycardia, increased respir atory r ate, fev er, shock, and death. The cardio vascular system responds to the stress of unreliev ed pain b y activ ating the sympathetic nerv ous system. F ollowing a surgical procedure, this can include hypercoagulation and increased heart r ate, blood pressure, cardiac workload, and o xygen demand. Since the stress response causes an increase in sympathetic nerv ous system activit y, intestinal secretions and smooth muscle sphincter tone increase, and gastric emptying and intestinal motilit y decrease. This response can cause tempor ary impairment of gastrointestinal function and increase the risk of ileus (intestinal obstruction). Aggressiv e pain control ma y be needed to reduce these effects and prev ent thromboembolic complications.Unreliev ed pain ma y be especially harmful for patients with metastatic cancers. Stress and pain can suppress immune function, including the natur al killer cells that pla y a role in preventing tumor growth and controlling metastasis. Defining and Categorizing Pain The International Association for the Study of P ain (IA SP) describes pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. \" Pain can be acute or chronic and if left untreated chronic pain can dev elop into what is referred to as a chronic pain syndrome . Acute Pain Acute pain comes on quickly and, although it can be sev ere, lasts a relativ ely short time (IOM, 2011). Its location is usually well-defined and there is usually an identifiable painful stimulus related to an injury , brief disease process, surgical procedure, or dysfunction of muscle or viscer a. Acute pain is often successfully treated with patient education, mild pain medications, en vironmental changes, and stress reduction. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has targeted impro ved treatment of acute pain as an area of significant healthcare sa vings. Better treatment of acute pain, through education about self-management and better clinical treatment, can a void its progression to chronic pain, which is more difficult and more expensiv e to treat (IOM, 2011). Chronic Pain Chronic pain refers to pain that exists for three or more months and does not resolv e with treatment. The three-month time fr ame is not absolute and some conditions ma y become chronic in as little as a month. When pain becomes chronic, sensory path ways continue to tr ansmit the sensation of pain ev en though the underlying condition or injury that originally caused the pain has healed. In such situations, the pain itself ma y need to be managed separ ately from the underlying condition. Chronic pain is a symptom of man y diseases. Up to 70% of cancer patients suffer from chronic pain and, among individuals living with HIV/AIDS , pain has been reported at all stages of infection (Lohman et al. , 2010). Chronic pain is a silent epidemic that reduces qualit y of life, negativ ely impacts relationships and jobs, and increases r ates of depression (Sessle, 2012).Chronic pain affects 1 in 5 adults, is more prev alent among women and older adults, and is associated with ph ysically demanding work and lower lev el of education (King & Fr aser, 2013). A 2011 report from IOM places this cost at more than $500 billion per y ear in the United States, creating an economic burden that is higher than the healthcare costs for heart disease, cancer , and diabetes combined (Sessle, 2012). Chronic pain can be difficult to distinguish from acute pain and can be difficult to treat. Chronic pain does not resolv e quickly and opioids or sedativ es are often needed for treatment. Because medical pr actitioners frequently approach chronic pain management from a medication perspectiv e, other modalities are sometimes o verlook ed. Prevention, assessment, and treatment of chronic pain are challenges for health pro viders and systems. P ain might go unrecogniz ed, and patients\u2014particularly members of r acial and ethnic minorit y groups, women, elders, people with cognitiv e impairment, and those with cancer and at the end of life\u2014can be at risk for inadequate pain treatment. P atients can experience persistent pain that is not well controlled (CDC, 2016a). There are clinical, psy chological, and social consequences associated with chronic pain including activit y limitations, lost work productivit y, reduced qualit y of life, and stigma, emphasizing the importance of appropriate and compassionate patient care. P atients should receiv e appropriate pain treatment based on a careful consider ation of the benefits and risks of treatment options (CDC, 2016a). Musculosk eletal pain, especially joint and back pain, is the most common t ype of chronic pain (IOM, 2011). Although musculosk eletal pain ma y not correspond exactly to the area of injury , it is nev ertheless commonly classified according to pain location. Howev er, most people with chronic pain ha ve pain at multiple sites (Lillie et al. , 2013). Classifying Chronic Pain According to Pathophysiology When classified according to pathoph ysiology , three t ypes of chronic pain ha ve been described b y the International Association for the Study of P ain (IA SP): Nociceptive pain: caused b y stimulation or sensitization of peripher al nociceptors. Nociceptors ha ve a high threshold for activation and increase their output as the stimulus increases.1. Neuropathic pain: \"pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system\" (IA SP, 2012).2. Centr al neuropathic pain: originates from damage to the br ain or spinal cord.a.*The term psychogenic pain is no longer considered an official diagnostic term. A m ore correct diagnostic term is persistent somatoform pain disorder (PSPD), which is defined in the ICD-10 Version 2016 as persistent, severe, and distressing pain, which cannot be explained fully by a physiological process or a physical disorder, and which occurs in association with emotional conflict or psychosocial problems that are sufficient to allow the conclusion that they are the main causative influences. The result is usually a marked increase in support and attention, either personal or medical (ICD-10, Version 2016). Chronic Pain Syndromes A chronic pain syndrome differs from chronic pain in that o ver time people with a syndrome dev elop a number of related life problems bey ond the sensation of pain itself . Most individuals with chronic pain do not dev elop the more complicated and distressful chronic pain syndrome. Although they ma y experience the pain for the remainder of their lives, little change occurs in their daily activities, family relationships, work, or other life components. Man y of these individuals nev er seek treatment for pain and those who do often require less intensiv e, single-modalit y interv entions (VHA, 2015). Those who dev elop chronic pain syndromes tend to experience increasing ph ysical, emotional, and social deterior ation o ver time. They ma y abuse pain medications and typically require more intensiv e, multimodal treatment to stop the cy cle of increasing dysfunction (VHA, 2015). Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) describes a chronic neuropathic pain condition that, in the past, w as referred to b y sev eral other names including causalgia and reflex sympathetic dystrophy . The IA SP has endorsed the term complex regional pain syndrome , intended to be descriptiv e, gener al, and not imply etiology . The term has been divided into \"CRPS 1\" and \"CRPS 2\" (Dutton & Littlejohn, 2015). CRPS I is char acteriz ed by intractable pain that is out of proportion to the tr auma, while CRPS II is char acteriz ed by unrelenting pain that occurs subsequent to a nerv e injury . The pain in CRPS is regional, not in a specific nerv e territory or dermatome, and it usually affects the hands or feet, with pain that is disproportionate in sev erity to an y known trauma or underlying injury . It in volves a v ariety of sensory and motor symptoms including swelling and edema, discolor ation, joint stiffness, weakness, tremor , dystonia, sensory disturbances, abnormal patterns of sweating, and changes to the skin (O'Connell et al. , 2013). Peripher al neuropathic pain: originates from damage to peripher al nerves or nerv e plexuses, dorsal root nerv e roots (IA SP, 2012).b. Psychogenic pain*: pain that persists despite the lack of an y identified underlying ph ysical cause.3.Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) in Hand and Wrist Source: Wi kimedia Commons. Used by permission. It has been common to explain the etiology of complex regional pain syndrome using the psychogenic model. Now howev er, neurocognitiv e deficits, neuroanatomic abnormalities, and distortions in cognitiv e mapping are known to be features of CRPS pathology (Hill et al., 2012). What is Chronic Pain?

The self -management model\u2014especially for chronic pain\u2014is supported b y strong evidence and has the benefit of in volving patients in their own care (NIH, 2013). Stanfor d's Sean Mack ey, MD , PhD on \"What is Chr onic P d's , PhD on \"What is Chr onic P ......The pain medicine model (which includes primary and specialt y care) is supported b y relativ ely weak evidence, particularly in chronic pain care, and often fails to in volve the recipient as an activ e participant. Although the pain medicine model has weak er demonstr ated efficacy , it is widely used because of a strong business model, industry support, and focus of tr aining in healthcare professionals (NIH, 2013). Increasingly , these two models are being combined with complementary approaches into what is referred to as integrative medicine (discussed in a later part of this class). In this model, the strengths of the two models are combined: pain is viewed holistically and assessed and treated in conjunction with psy chological, medical, social, spiritual, and environmental influences. Currently , an integr ative approach to pain care is encour aged for all patients (PPSG, 2014b). Self-Management of Pain Self-management is defined as a str ategy used b y the patient to manage or minimiz e the impact of a chronic condition on ev eryday life. The basic tenets of self -management include: Active participation b y the patient Treatment of the whole person, not just the disease Empowerment of the patient (NIH, 2013) Although some people seek professional help immediately , most try to self -manage their pain. This can include talking to friends, searching the internet, or attending group classes or progr ams intended to educate a person about pain management. Self -management also includes ex ercise, ice, heat, positioning, limiting activit y, over-the-counter (O TC) medications, and education. In man y cases, self -management is highly successful. Pain Medicine Model The pain medicine model is widely accepted and widely used. It is based upon the idea that pain is an acute, treatable disease. This approach usually begins with the primary care physician followed b y a referr al to a pain specialist or pain clinic. Primary care pr actitioners are an early step in the pain care journey , treating 52% of chronic pain patients in the United States (IOM, 2011). Primary care clinicians pro vide the initial assessment or diagnosis and serv e as a starting point for specialt y services, including prescription medications and referr als to imaging, ph ysical and occupational therapy, or other integr ative practitioners (IOM, 2011).Primary care clinicians assist patients in making decisions about specialt y services and electiv e procedures. They are also responsible for the majorit y of pain medicine prescriptions. In 2008 analgesics constituted 10.1% of all drugs prescribed for adults (IOM, 2011). The dev elopment of a comprehensiv e treatment plan is important, utilizing appropriate pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interv entions. T reatments should be regularly re- evaluated for effectiv eness, adjusted as needed, with side effects quickly addressed. The treatment plan should include a complete assessment and a clearly written plan of care (PPSG, 2014b). Many hospitals ha ve acute pain services (APS) that pro vide consistent pain management throughout the course of a patient 's stay hospital sta y. Hospitals with formally organiz ed acute pain services are more lik ely to follow a formal written post oper ative pain protocol than hospitals without acute pain services (Nasir et al. , 2011). The personnel comprising the t ypical acute pain service included: Anesthesiologists (95%) Advanced pr actice (45%), registered nurses (32.5%), pharmacists (11.3%) Physician assistants (8.8%) Physical medicine and rehabilitation ph ysicians (6.3%) Surgeons (5%) Neurologists (3.8%) Others (oncologists, social work ers, and psy chologists) (Nasir et al. , 2011) Common Pain Conditions Certain pain syndromes are perv asive. Low back pain, migr aine headaches, post oper ative pain, cancer pain, and pain associated with arthritis are some of the most common reasons patients seek medical care for pain. Low Back Pain Low back pain affects appro ximately 80% of people at some stage in their liv es. If low back pain becomes chronic it often results in lost w ages and additional medical expenses and can increase the risk of incurring other medical conditions (Chou et al. , 2016).In the United States, the total indirect and direct costs due to low back pain are estimated to be greater than $100 billion annually (W ang et al. , 2012). It is the fifth most common reason for all ph ysician visits. Appro ximately one-quarter of U .S. adults reported ha ving low back pain lasting at least 1 da y in the past 3 months, and more than 7% reported at least one episode of sev ere low back pain in the previous y ear. Clinically , the natur al course of low back pain is usually fa vorable; acute low back pain frequently disappears within 1 to 2 weeks. An y of the spinal structures, including interv ertebr al discs, facet joints, v ertebr al bodies, ligaments, or muscles could be an origin of back pain, which is, unfortunately , difficult to determine. In those cases in which the origin of back pain cannot be determined, the diagnosis giv en is nonspecific low back pain (Aoki et al. , 2012). Assessing Low Back Pain The v ast majorit y of low back pain patients who present to primary care ha ve pain that cannot be reliably attributed to a specific disease or spinal abnormalit y. Spinal imaging abnormalities such as degener ative disc disease, facet joint arthropath y, and bulging or herniated interv ertebr al discs are extremely common in patients with or without low back pain, particularly in older adults, and such findings are poor predictors for the presence or severity of low back pain (Chou et al. , 2016). Low back pain symptoms can arise from man y anatomic sources, such as nerv e roots, muscle, fascia, bones, joints, interv ertebr al discs, and organs within the abdominal ca vity. Symptoms can also be caused b y aberr ant neurologic pain processing, a condition called neuropathic low back pain. The diagnostic ev aluation of patients with low back pain can be challenging and requires complex clinical decision-making. Nev ertheless, the identification of the source of the pain is of fundamental importance in determining the ther apeutic approach (Allegri et al. , 2016). The location of pain, frequency of symptoms, dur ation of pain, history of previous symptoms, previous treatments, and response to treatment should be assessed. The possibilit y of low back pain due to pancreatitis, nephrolithiasis, or aortic aneurysm, or systemic illnesses such as endocarditis or vir al syndromes, should also be considered. Low back pain can be influenced b y psy chological factors, such as stress, depression, or anxiet y. History should include substance use exposure, detailed health history , work habits, and psy chosocial factors (Allegri et al. , 2016). Back pain can be referred or felt at a site distant from the source of the pain. P ain can be local or referred from a painful stimulus occurring in and internal organ. An example of referred pain is when a heart attack occurs and pain in felt in the ja w, shoulder , or arm.Pain ma y also be felt in the area or region within the territory of a dermatome , an area of skin supplied b y a single sensory nerv e. This is referred to as r adiating pain and can be quite confusing for patients. If the nerv e root is irritated or inflamed, pain can be ev oked by any motion that stretches or compresses the root of the nerv e; this is referred to as radicular pain , which can occur in patients with serious or progressiv e neurologic deficits or underlying conditions requiring prompt ev aluation, as well as patients with other conditions that ma y respond to specific treatments. Patients with back and leg pain ha ve a fairly high sensitivit y for herniated disc, with more than 90% of symptomatic lumbar disc herniation occurring at the L4/L5 and L5/S1 lev els. A focused examination that includes str aight leg-r aise testing and a neurologic examination that includes ev aluation of knee strength and reflex es (L4 nerv e root), great toe and nerv e foot reflex es (S1 nerv e root), and distribution of sensory symptoms should be done to assess the presence and sev erity of nerv e root dysfunction. Imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be considered only in the presence of clinical elements that are not completely clear or in the presence of neurologic deficits or other medical conditions. The recommendation of the American College of Radiology is not to do imaging for low back pain within the first 6 weeks unless red flags are present. R ed flags include recent significant tr auma or milder tr auma at age older than 50 years, unexplained weight loss, unexplained fev er, immunosuppression, history of cancer , intravenous drug use, prolonged use of corticosteroids, osteoporosis, age older than 70 y ears, and focal neurologic deficits with progressiv e or disabling symptoms (Allegri et al., 2016). Treating Low Back Pain In Oregon changes to the Oregon Health Plan/Prioritiz ed List of Health Services, effectiv e July 1, 2016, ha ve expanded co verage for the assessment and conserv ative treatment of uncomplicated back pain and conditions. Previously , the OHP has limited treatment to patients with muscle weakness or other signs of nerv e damage. Beginning in 2016, treatments will be a vailable for all back conditions. Before treatment begins, pro viders will assess patients to determine their lev el of risk for chronic back pain, and whether they meet criteria for a surgical consultation (OHA, 2016). Based on the results, one or more of the following co vered treatments ma y be appropriate: Acupuncture Chiropr actic manipulation Cognitiv e beha vioral ther apy (a form of talk ther apy) Steroids are injected into the cerebrospinal fluid in the canal surrounding the spine.

Medications (including short -term opiate drugs, but not long-term prescriptions) Office visits Osteopathic manipulation Physical and occupational ther apy Surgery (only for a limited number of conditions where evidence shows surgery is more effectiv e than other treatment options) (OHA, 2016) In addition, y oga, intensiv e rehabilitation, massage, or supervised ex ercise ther apy are now recommended to be included in the comprehensiv e treatment plans. These services, which also ha ve evidence of effectiv eness, will be pro vided where a vailable as determined by each Coordinated Care Organization (CCO) (OHA, 2016). Interventional Pain Management Techniques Interv entional techniques are minimally in vasive procedures that place drugs in targeted areas or ablate target nerv es. This category includes epidur al injections as well as some surgical techniques such as laser or endoscopic discectom y, intrathecal infusion pumps, and spinal cord stimulators, used for the diagnosis and management of chronic, persistent, or intr actable pain (Manchikanti et al. , 2010). Epidur al injections, in which steroids and anti- inflammatories are injected directly into the epidur al space of the spinal cord, are the most commonly performed procedures in interv entional pain management, comprising 46% of all interv entional techniques. The most commonly performed procedures are lumbosacr al interlaminar or caudal epidur al injections. Facet joint interv entions are the second most commonly performed procedures, constituting 38% of all interv entional techniques in 2011 (Manchikanti et al. , 2010). Analysis of v arious spinal interv entional techniques indicates that there has been an o verall increase in interv entions of 177% per 100,000 in the Medicare fee- for-service population, with the highest increases seen for sacroiliac joint injections at 331%, facet joint interv entions at and epidur als at 130% (Manchikanti A systematic review of interv entional ther apies interv entional ther apies for back pain ha ve been shown to be effectiv e in randomiz ed, placebo-controlled trials\" (IOM, 2011). Although interv entional techniques are often considered to be surgical procedures, more invasive procedures such as joint replacement, spinal fusion, and disc replacement are also commonly and successfully used to reliev e pain. These t ypes of surgeries often occur after other conserv ative treatments ha ve failed to reliev e the pain. Migraine Headaches A migr aine is a painful headache thought to result from v asodilation of blood v essels in the brain. Migr aines cause intense, pulsing or throbbing pain on one or possibly both sides of the head. P eople with migr aine headaches often describe pain in the temples or behind one eye or ear . Migr aine sufferers ma y have symptoms of nausea, v omiting, and sensitivit y to light and sound. Some people see spots or flashing lights or ha ve a tempor ary loss of vision that forew arn of an impending headache. If a migr aine occurs more than 15 da ys each month for 3 months, it is considered chronic. Numerous imaging studies of migr aine patients ha ve described multiple changes in br ain functions as a result of migr aine attacks; these include enhanced cortical ex citabilit y, increased gr ay matter v olume in some regions and decreased in others, enhanced br ain blood flow , and altered pain modulatory systems (Maleki et al. , 2011). Migraine has no current cure. Drug ther apies are broadly divided into two groups: (1) those designed to treat acute occurrences, and (2) those that are proph ylactic (prev entive) in nature. Man y people who ha ve migr aines use both forms of treatment. The goal is to treat migr aine symptoms as soon as possible and to minimiz e the number of migr aine occurrences b y avoiding triggers. Post Operative Pain In the United States, nearly 100 million surgeries tak e place annually \u2014about 46 million inpatient and about 53 million outpatient procedures. P ost oper ative pain is often underestimated and undertreated, leading to increased morbidit y and mortalit y, mostly due to respir atory and thromboembolic complications, increased hospital sta y, and impaired qualit y of life (EA U, 2013).Post oper ative pain is common and can be caused b y tissue damage, the presence of drains and tubes, post oper ative complications, prolonged time in an a wkward position, or a combination of these factors. Good post oper ative pain management requires good pain assessment and measurement in all post oper ative patients. Assessment should focus on the patient 's response to surgery as well as respir atory and cardiac complications. It should occur at scheduled interv als, in response to new pain, and prior to discharge (EA U, 2013). Although much of the focus on post oper ative pain management is in hospitals, about 60% of surgical procedures in communit y hospitals are performed on an outpatient basis, and persistent problems exist with pain management after discharge (IOM, 2011). This ma y be because there is not enough time to assess post surgical pain prior to discharge or to establish a pain management progr am at home. Psychological factors such as anxiet y and depression can be important predictors in the development of post oper ative pain. Age has also been found as a predictor , with y ounger individuals being at higher risk for moder ate to intense pain. P atients at high risk for severe post oper ative pain should be pro vided with special attention. P atients with good analgesia are more cooper ative, reco ver more r apidly , and lea ve the hospital sooner . They also ha ve a lower risk for prolonged pain after surgery (Ene et al. , 2008). Post oper ative pain that continues for more than 2 months and cannot be explained b y other causes is referred to as persistent post surgical pain (Kehlet & R athmell, 2010). About 10% to 50% of post oper ative patients dev elop persistent pain following common surgical procedures such as groin hernia repair , breast and thor acic surgery , leg amputation, and coronary artery b ypass surgery , often due to nerv e damage during the procedure (IOM, 2011). Persistent post oper ative pain is a serious clinical problem. The factors that seem to affect its incidence include the extent of preoper ative pain, tr auma during surgery , and anxiet y and depression. Cancer patients are particularly susceptible. Comorbidit y of pain and depression pro vokes worsening of both conditions (Ghoneim & O'Har a, 2016). To identif y the scope of a person' s pain following surgery , especially pain persisting more than 2 to 3 months, a careful clinical ev aluation is needed. This includes history , physical examination, and appropriate special tests in order to identif y or ex clude rev ersible underlying conditions (Gilron & K ehlet, 2014). Be a ware of risk of persistent pain following surgery in the following instances: If the patient w as previously pain free but has now dev eloped a new chronic pain syndrome If previous pain at the site of surgery still remainsIf the patient previously suffered from a chronic pain syndrome\u2014unrelated to the surgery \u2014and the pain persists (Gilron & K ehlet, 2014) In the ICU , most, if not all, patients will experience pain at some point during their ICU stay. Pain can be related to injury , surgery , burns, or comorbidities such as cancer , or from procedures performed for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Some patients ma y even experience substantial pain at rest. Despite increased attention to assessment and pain management, pain remains a significant problem for ICU patients (K yranou & Puntillo , 2012). Unreliev ed pain in adult ICU patients is far from benign. Medical and surgical ICU patients who recalled pain and other tr aumatic situations while in the ICU had a higher incidence of chronic pain and post tr aumatic stress disorder symptoms than did a compar ative group of ICU patients. Concurrent or past pain ma y be the greatest risk factor for dev elopment of chronic pain (K yranou & Puntillo , 2012). Pain Associated with Cancer Pain occurs in 20% to 50% of patients with cancer (NCI, 2016). It is one of the most feared and common symptoms of a v ariety of cancers and is a primary determinant of the poor qualit y of life in cancer patients (Bali et al. , 2013). Cancer -associated pain\u2014 particularly neuropathic pain\u2014is often resistant to con ventional ther apeutics whose application ma y be sev erely limited due to side effects (Bali et al. , 2013). In the adv anced stage, moder ate to sev ere pain affects roughly 80% of cancer patients. Y ounger patients are more lik ely to experience cancer pain and pain flares than are older patients (NCI, 2016). Research from Europe, Asia, A ustralia, and the United States indicates that cancer patients are repeatedly undertreated for pain, both as inpatients and outpatients\u2014sometimes receiving no analgesia at all. R egardless of what stage the cancer has reached, it is necessary to determine the prev alence of pain in specific cancer t ypes, both to r aise awareness among clinicians and to impro ve patient management (K uo et al. , 2011). Breakthrough pain is common in cancer patients. It is a tempor ary increase or flare of pain that occurs in the setting of relativ ely well-controlled acute or chronic pain (NCI, 2016). Incident pain is a t ype of breakthrough pain related to certain activities or factors such as vertebr al body pain from metastatic disease. Breakthrough and incident pain are often difficult to treat effectiv ely because of their episodic nature. In one study , 75% of patients experienced breakthrough pain; 30% of this pain w as incidental, 26% w as non-incidental, 16% w as caused b y end-of -dose failure, and the rest had mix ed etiologies (NCI, 2016).Pain can be a side-effect of ther apies used to treat cancer . Pain is reported b y 59% of patients receiving anti-cancer treatment and 33% of patients after cur ative treatments (NCI, 2016). P ain syndromes caused b y cancer ther apies include: Clinical management of cancer pain is complex, driv en by patient 's response, and the need to have both shorter and longer acting prepar ations and equi- analgesic dose r atios. The process of combining or switching opioids is complex for the clinician, who must understand the different half -life, receptors, and con version r atios of these opioids, which can v ary greatly among individuals, opioids, and ev en by opioid dose (Gao et al. , 2014). The P ain Ladder w as dev eloped b y the W orld Health Organization (WHO) in the context of cancer care. The WHO three-step analgesic ladder presents a stepped approach based on pain sev erity. If the pain is mild, begin with Step 1. If pain persists or worsens, a change to a Step 2 or Step 3 analgesic is indicated. A t each step , an adjuv ant drug* or modalit y such as radiation ther apy may be considered in selected patients (WHO , 2016). *Adjuvant drugs: can enhance the analgesic effect of opioid drugs in patients with cancer. Concurrent use of adjuvants is recommended by the WH O and has been recognized as an effec tive strategy in improving the balance between analgesia and side effects. However, consistent evidence suggests an under-utilization of adjuvants in cancer pain management, which may contribute to unnecessary opioid switching or rotation (Gao et al., 2014).

Used with permission. In gener al, analgesics should be giv en \"by mouth, by the clock, by the ladder, and for the individual \" and should include regular scheduling of the analgesic, not just on an as- needed basis. In addition, rescue doses for breakthrough pain should be added. Each analgesic regimen should be adjusted for the patient 's individual circumstances and physical condition (NCI, 2013). Pain Associated with Arthritis Arthritis and other rheumatic conditions are a leading cause of disabilit y in adults in the United States. Negativ e consequences, including pain, reduced ph ysical abilit y, depression, and reduced qualit y of life, can impact the ph ysical functioning and psy chological well- being of those living with these conditions (Schoffman et al. , 2013). Treatment of arthritis and other rheumatic conditions is costly , and giv en the growing number of people in the United States o ver the age of 65, these conditions are expected to be a large burden on the healthcare system in the coming y ears. The number of Americans with arthritis and other rheumatic conditions is expected to reach about 67 million b y 2030 (25% of Americans) (Schoffman et al. , 2013). OsteoarthritisOsteoarthritis in Joints Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint disorder char acteriz ed by degener ation of joint cartilage. Spurs grow out from the edge of the bone, and syno vial fluid increases, causing stiffness and pain (NIAMS , 2015). With OA, joint pain and stiffness worsens o ver time. OA is the most common form of arthritis and affects close to 27 million Americans. After the age of 65, 60% of men and 70% of women experience OA (V an Liew et al. , 2013). Hip Joint Showing Osteoarthritis Progression Left: Normal hip joint. Right: Hip joint with osteoarthritis. Source: Wi kimedia Commons. Although the prev alence of osteoarthritis increases with age, younger people can also dev elop it, usually as the result of a joint injury , a joint malformation, or a genetic defect in joint cartilage. Before age 45, more men than women ha ve osteoarthritis; after age 45, it is more common in women. OA is more lik ely to occur in people who are o verweight and in those with jobs that stress particular joints. The joints most commonly affected b y OA are those at the ends of the fingers, thumbs, neck, lower back, knees, and hips (NIAMS , 2015). Best pr actice guidelines focus on self -management: weight control, physical activit y, and pharmacologic support for inflammation and pain. Although low -grade inflammation underlies chronic osteoarthritis, it has not been a focus of best pr actice guidelines. Obesit y is an independent risk factor for osteoarthritis and there is an inter active relationship among osteoarthritis, obesit y, and physical inactivit y (Dean & Hansen, 2012).Osteoarthritis most often occurs in the hands (at the ends of the fingers and thumbs), spine (neck and lower back), knees, and hips. Source: NIAMS, 2015.Physical exercise is widely recommended for individuals with OA. A meta-analysis on treatments for OA found that exercise programs reduced pain, improved physical functioning, and enhanced quality of life among individuals with OA (Van Liew et al., 2013). Despite this, close to 44% of adults with arthritis report not engaging in exercise. Pain associated with osteoarthritis can lead to decreased physical activity, which is an independent risk factor for inflammation, likely due to the reduced expression of anti- inflammatory mediators. Physical inactivity also reduces daily energy expenditure and promotes weight gain (Dean & Hansen, 2012). Psychological distress can adversely affect people with OA. Evidence suggests that anxiety and depression lead to reduced functioning and to lower levels of physical activity. Although depression may pose barriers to activity engagement, physical activity has been shown to improve its symptoms and is a common focus of behavioral therapies. Conversely, improvements in depression are also likely to lead to increases in activity levels and quality of life (Van Liew et al., 2013). Rheumatoid Arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is among the most disabling forms of arthritis and it affects about 1% of the U.S. adult population (about 2 million people). RA is an autoimmune disease that involves inflammation of the synovium, a thin layer of tissue lining the joint space. As the disease worsens, there is a progressive erosion of bone, leading to misalignment of the affected joint, loss of function, and disabilit y. Rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect the small joints of the hands and feet in a symmetric pattern, but other joint patterns are often seen. Because of its systemic pro-inflammatory state, RA can damage virtually an y extra- articular tissue. Cardiovascular disease is considered an extra-articular manifestation and a major predictor of poor prognosis. Traditional risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, physical inactivity, advanced age, male gender, family history of cardiovascular disease, hyperhomocysteinemia, and tobacco use have been associated with cardiovascular disease in RA patients. In fact, seropositive RA may, like diabetes, act as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (Sarmiento-Monroy et al., 2012).Joint Affected by Rheumatoid Arthritis In rheumatoid arthritis, the synovium becomes inflamed, causing warmth, redness, swelling, and pain. As the disease progresses, the inflamed synovium invades and damages the cartilage and bone of the joint. Surrounding muscles, ligaments, and tendons become weakened. Rheumatoid arthritis can also cause more generalized bone loss that may lead to osteoporosis (fragile bones that are prone to fracture). Source: NIAMS, 2016. Women are nearly three times more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis\u2014it can start at any age (mean age at the onset is 40 to 60 years). The precise cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown; like other autoimmune diseases it arises from a variable combination of genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and the inappropriate activation of the immune responses. Multiple genes are associated with disease susceptibility, with the HLA locus accounting for 30% to 50% of the overall genetic risk (Fattahi & Mirshafiey, 2012). Studies that explore the role of pain as a predictor of functional disabilit y typically focus on concurrent pain, or treat pain as a variable when examining predictors of future function. Since factors other than pain are the main predictors of interest, these studies fail to fully characterize the association of pain with future function and, more important, do not explore how different measures of pain and the time periods they reference ma y impact results (Santiago et al., 2016). Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory joint disease characterized by stiffness, pain, swelling, and tenderness of the joints, as well as the surrounding ligaments and tendons. It affects men and women equally, typically presents at the age of 30 to 50 years, and is associated with psoriasis in approximately 25% of patients. Cutaneous disease usually precedes the onset of psoriatic arthritis by an average of 10 years in the majority of patients but 14% to 21% of patients with psoriatic arthritis develop symptoms of arthritis prior to the development of skin disease. The presentation is variable and can range from a mild, nondestructive arthritis to a severe, debilitating, erosive joint disease (Lloyd et al., 2012).Psoriatic arthritis affects fewer people in the United States than rheumatoid arthritis. It has a highly v ariable presentation, which gener ally in volves pain and inflammation in joints and progressiv e joint in volvement and damage. There are multiple clinical subsets of psoriatic arthritis, including: Monoarthritis of the large joints interphalangeal arthritis Spondyloarthritis, or a symmetrical deforming poly arthropath y similar to that of rheumatoid arthritis (Llo yd et al. , 2012) Left untreated, a proportion of patients ma y dev elop persistent inflammation with deforming progressiv e joint damage which leads to sev ere ph ysical limitation and disabilit y (Lloyd et al. , 2012). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help with symptomatic relief , but they do not alter the disease course or prev ent disease progression. Intr a-articular steroid injections can be used for symptomatic relief . Physical or occupational ther apy may also be helpful in symptomatic relief (Llo yd et al. , 2012). Disease-modif ying anti-rheumatic drugs are the mainsta y of treatment for patients suffering from psoriatic arthritis. Currently , the most effectiv e class of ther apeutic agents for treating psoriatic arthritis is the TNF- inhibitors; howev er, these drugs show a 30% to 40% primary failure r ate in both r andomiz ed clinical trials and registry -based longitudinal studies (Llo yd et al. , 2012). Pain in Sp ecial Populations The extremes of age, as well as specific diseases such as cancer , provide special challenges to pain care. Infants and children, older adults, people with dementia, and cancer patients have little in common ph ysiologically , but they share a propensit y tow ard under -medication for pain. There is some evidence that the under -treatment of pain in these patient populations is impro ving, but acute care clinicians should pa y particular attention to pain assessment and care in these patients (Thomas, 2013). Pain in Infants, Children, and Adolescents Although sk epticism tow ards infant pain char acteriz ed much of the twentieth century , it is now well understood that an infant 's pain tr ansmission path ways are fully dev eloped b y 22 to 24 weeks of gestation. In addition, pain inhibitory path ways are not fully dev eloped in infants, suggesting that infants ma y feel ev en more pain than older children (W axman et al., 2016).In spite of its frequency, pain in infants, children, and adolescents is often underestimated and undertreated. It has been shown that infants and children who experience pain in early life show long-term changes in terms of pain perception and related beha viors (Srouji et al., 2010). In infants, improper management of acute pain has been associated with negativ e short- and long-term consequences. Increased metabolic rate during painful experiences has been associated with increased potential for chronic pain, delayed wound healing, increased risk of infection, and alterations in pain sensitivity. Long-lasting consequences include delays in motor and brain development, as well as deficits in cognition and emotional regulation (Waxman et al., 2016). In adolescents, headaches, stomachaches, or backaches are common complaints. These pain conditions commonly coexist and are more prevalent in girls and older adolescents. In an international survey involving 28 countries, although there was some variation in pain prevalence, there were no countries where these three pains were uncommon (Swain et al., 2014). A Danish twins study found adolescents with persistent low back pain were 3.5 times more likely to have low back pain in adulthood. Co-occurrence of low back pain and headache in adolescence further increases the risk of developing future pain (Swain et al., 2014). Barriers to pain management in children are numerous and include inaccur acies regarding pathophysiologic mechanisms of pain, fears regarding the use of pharmacologic agents, and deficits in knowledge of pain assessment. Personal values and beliefs also prevent adequate identification and alleviation of pain for all children (Srouji et al. , 2010). Did You Know . . . Pain management in infants and children is an example of the influence of tradition, personal bias, persistence myths, and resistance to change. There is a substantial gap between evidence and practice, and some authors suggest that pediatric nursing, rooted deeply in tr adition and ritual, is particularly resistant to evidence-based practice changes (Susan Lacey, 2008). A significant percentage of children and adolescents (25%-33%) experience chronic pain, with prevalence increasing with age and occurring slightly more commonly in girls than boys. The most commonly reported locations of pain in children and adolescents are: Head StomachArms Legs (Carter & Threlk eld, 2012) The most common chronic pain conditions in children include: Migraine Recurrent abdominal pain Gener al musculosk eletal pain (Carter & Threlk eld, 2012) Chronic pain can interfere with dev elopmental functioning, increase lev els of emotional distress, and disrupt school attendance. P arents are also adv ersely affected and must negotiate appointments with multiple pro viders, including both primary and secondary providers. This can lead to missed school for the child, missed work for parents, and depletion of emotional and financial resources (Gorodzinsky et al. , 2012). Families faced with addressing their child' s chronic pain often report a loss of trust in providers when treatment fails to address the high lev els of pain their child is experiencing. Parents express frustr ation with inconclusiv e medical tests, decreasing their hopes that an y provider will be able to do an ything for their child. With failure to reduce their child' s pain, parents ma y experience reduced expectations for treatment (Gorodzinsky et al. , 2012). A multidisciplinary approach using a biopsy chosocial perspectiv e to assess and treat chronic pain in children is effectiv e in reducing the pain experiences and consequences of pain. F amilies note that pro viders in multidisciplinary settings displa yed an interest in understanding the pain and increasing the comfort of the families during the appointment. Including the family' s perspectiv e during treatment is an example of collabor ative healthcare, which impro ves communication and more effectiv ely implements the plan of care (Gorodzinsky et al. , 2012). Pain in Older Adults Older adults ha ve a high risk of experiencing daily pain and 20% report taking a painkiller regularly (Lillie et al. , 2013). In older adults pain can produce un wanted consequences such as reduced qualit y of life, reduced engagement in social and recreational activities, and an increased risk of falls. Older adults with chronic pain conditions, such as back pain, are significantly less ph ysically activ e compared with their counterparts who do not experience back pain (Ho et al. , 2016).Aging is associated with clinically important changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Drug absorption is gener ally unchanged, but studies of drug distribution rev eal increased plasma concentr ation of w ater-soluble drugs and increased half-life of fat -soluble drugs in older adults. F or all opioids, half -life of the activ e drug and metabolites is increased in elders (Dalacorte et al. , 2011). Other issues that affect management of pain in older adults include: Decline in the cognitiv e function Low income Co-morbid conditions and polypharmacy Sedation, dizziness Managing pain medications Adhering to the prescribed schedule Pain in People with Dementia Pain is a v ery common problem in people with dementia: about 50% of people with dementia regularly experience pain. P ain in people with dementia pain can lead to neuropsy chiatric symptoms and declines in cognitiv e functioning, as well as declines in the performance of activities of daily living. Next to neuropsy chiatric symptoms, pain is the most cited reason for a decrease in qualit y of life in dementia. Therefore, recognition and adequate treatment of pain in people with dementia should ha ve high priorit y (van Kooten et al., 2015). There is evidence that people with adv anced cognitiv e decline receiv e pain treatment, notably opioids, less frequently or in lower , insufficient doses as compared to their cognitiv ely fit counterparts. Unable to properly communicate their pain, changes in behavior are often misinterpreted as beha vioral symptoms, pro voking inappropriate prescription of antipsy chotics which, in turn, ha ve been associated with compromised cognition, falls and fr actures, and increased risk of death. The failure to accur ately identif y pain in cognitiv ely impaired individuals is the primary cause of sub-optimal management of pain (Bauer et al. , 2016).While individuals with mild to moder ate cognitiv e impairment are often able to report pain either v erbally or b y use of r ating scales, these options are not a vailable for those with advanced cognitiv e impairment, when the abilit y to communicate is sev erely impaired. As a result, self -reported pain ma y not alw ays be reliable in people with adv anced cognitiv e impairment and pain must be indirectly r ated using a v alidated observ ational instrument. Various numerical and visual scales lack soundness in persons with cognitiv e impairment, due to their reliance on memory , abstr act thinking, and speech comprehension (Bauer et al., 2016). Among residents of nursing homes, it is estimated that 45% to 80% of residents ha ve substantial pain that is undertreated. This suggests that when nursing home residents have moder ate to sev ere pain, they ha ve only about a 50% chance of obtaining adequate pain relief . Because cognitiv e impairment is common in man y nursing home residents, assessing and managing pain can be particularly demanding. This often leads to both the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of pain (Bauer et al. , 2016). Pain at the End of Life When a person is living with an adv anced illness or coming to the end of life, prev enting and relieving pain is often a high priorit y. Pain is among the most debilitating and feared symptoms faced b y patients and their families. Despite this understanding, man y sev erely ill patients spend the last da ys of their liv es in moder ate to sev ere pain. Consistent assessment of pain is critical, as is in volving the patient and family in establishing goals for palliativ e pain management. P atients and family members should be educated about dosing, compliance, addiction, toler ance, and side effects. Good pain management at the end of life in volves listening to the patient 's subjectiv e measure of pain, properly assessing patients with cognitiv e impairment, and o vercoming m yths about opioid ther apy related to fear of causing addiction or hastening death. Palliative Care Palliative care is an approach that aims to impro ve the qualit y of life of patients and their families who are facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness. This is accomplished through the prev ention and relief of suffering b y means of early identification, assessment, and treatment of pain and other symptoms.In 2014 the National Consensus Project (NCS) released updated guidelines for palliativ e care. The new guidelines are organiz ed according to the following domains: structure and processes of care; ph ysical, psy chological, and psy chiatric aspects of care; spiritual, religious, existential, and cultur al aspects of care; care of patients at the end of life; and ethical and legal aspects of care. Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care (4th edition, 2014) is available at the National Consensus Project . Cancer Pain at the End of Life Undertreatment and inequitable access to pain treatment ha ve been described among many cancer patients presenting with pain. The reported prev alence of moder ate to sev ere pain in adv anced cancer is appro ximately 64%, with a sharp increase to as high as 80% to 90% at the end of life (Gao et al. , 2014). A study ev aluating the char acteristics of patients with adv anced cancer presenting to a palliativ e care service found the primary tumor as the chief cause of pain in 68% of patients. Most pain w as somatic, and pain w as as lik ely to be continuous as intermittent (NCI, 2016). Musculoskeletal Pain at the End of Life Although palliativ e care has in the past focused on cancer , it has recently expanded to include other conditions, including musculosk eletal pain at the end of life. P opulation-based studies indicate that musculosk eletal pain is such a common and significant issue at the end of life that musculoskeletal disease may have as much, if not more, effect on whether a person dies in pain than the condition that is the cause of death (Lillie et al., 2013). Assessing and Documenting Pain The most critical aspect of pain assessment is that it be done on a regular basis using a standard format. P ain should be re- assessed after each interv ention to ev aluate its effect and determine whether an interv ention should be modified. The time fr ame for re- assessment should be directed b y the needs of the patient and the hospital or unit policies and procedures. A self -report b y the patient has tr aditionally been the mainsta y of pain assessment, although family caregiv ers can be used as pro xies for patient reports, especially in situations in which communication barriers exist, such as cognitiv e impairment or language barriers. F amily members who act as pro xies t ypically report higher lev els of pain than patient self -reports.Both ph ysiologic and beha vioral responses can indicate the presence of pain and should be noted as part of a comprehensiv e assessment, particularly following surgery . Physiologic responses include tach ycardia, responses include splinting, grimacing, moaning or grunting, distorted posture, and reluctance to mo ve. A lack of ph ysiologic responses or an absence of beha viors indicating pain ma y not mean there is an absence of pain. Good documentation impro ves communication among clinicians about the current status of the patient 's pain and responses to the plan of care. Documentation is also used as a means of monitoring the qualit y of pain management within the institution. In the absence of an objectiv e measure, pain is a subjectiv e individual experience. How we respond to pain is related to genetic features as well as cognitiv e, motiv ational, emotional, and psy chological states. P ain response is also related to gender , experiences and memories of pain, cultur al and social influences, and gener al health (Sessle, 2012). Pain Assessment Tools Selecting a pain assessment tool should be, when possible, a collabor ative decision between patient and pro vider to ensure that the patient is familiar with the tool. If the clinician selects the tool, consider ation should be giv en to the patient 's age; ph ysical, emotional, and cognitiv e status; and personal preferences. P atients who are alert but unable to talk ma y be able to point to a number or a face to report their pain (AHRQ , 2008). Pain Scales Many pain intensit y measures ha ve been dev eloped and v alidated. Most measure only one aspect of pain (ie, pain intensit y) and most use a numeric r ating. Some tools measure both pain intensit y and pain unpleasantness and use a sliding scale that allows the patient to identif y small differences in intensit y. The following illustr ations show some commonly used pain scales. Visual Analog Scale The Visual Analog Scale. The left endpoint corresponds to \"no pain\" and the right endpoint (100) is defined as \"pain as intense as it can be.\" A 10-cm baseline is recommended for VAS scales.

Indicated for adults and children (>9 years old) in all patient care settings in which patients are able to use numbers to rate the intensity of their pain. The NRS consists of a straight horizontal line numbered at equal intervals from 0 to 10 with anchor words of \"no pain,\" \"moderate pain,\" and \"worst pain.\" Source: Adapted from Acute Pain Management Guideline Panel, 1992 (AHCPR, 1994).

The patient slides the middle part of the device to the right and left and views the amount of red as a measure of pain sensation. The arrow at the left means \"no pain sensation\" and the arrow at the right indicates the \"most intense pain sensation imaginable.\" The sliding part of the device is moved on a different axis for the unpleasantness scale. The arrow at the left means \"not at all unpleasant\" and the arrow at the right represents pain that is the \"most unpleasant imaginable.\" Source: The Risk Communication Institute.

Some studies indicate that older adults prefer to char acteriz e their pain using the VRS. The description can be tr anslated to a number for charting (see following table) and works particularly well if ev eryone on the unit uses the same scale. Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) Description Points Assigned No pain 0 Mild pain 2 Moderate 5 Severe 10 For patients with limited cognitiv e abilit y, scales with dr awings or pictures, such as the Wong-Bak er FACES scale, are useful. Patients with adv anced dementia ma y require behavioral observ ation to determine the presence of pain. Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale The Wong-Baker FACES s cale is especially useful for those who cannot read English and for pediatric patients.

Pain Questionnaires Pain questionnaires t ypically contain v erbal descriptors that help patients distinguish different kinds of pain. One example, the McGill P ain Questionnaire asks patients to describe subjectiv e psy chological feelings of pain. P ain descriptors such as pulsing, shooting, stabbing, burning, grueling, r adiating, and agonizing (and more than sev enty other descriptors) are grouped together to con vey a patient 's pain response (Srouji et al. , 2010). The questionnaire combines a list of questions about the nature and frequency of pain with a body -map diagr am to pinpoint its location. It uses word lists separ ated into four classes (sensory , affectiv e, evaluativ e, and miscellaneous) to assess the total pain experience. After patients are finished r ating their pain words, a numerical score is calculated, called the \"P ain Rating Index. \" Scores v ary from 0 to 78, with the higher score indicating greater pain (Srouji et al. , 2010).The Brief P ain In ventory (BPI), dev eloped b y the W orld Health Organization, also uses the questionnaire format to measure pain. The abilit y to resume activit y, maintain a positiv e affect or mood, and sleep are relev ant functions for patients. The BPI uses a numeric r ating scale to assess difficulties with w alking, gener al activit y, mood, and sleep . Assessing Pain in Children Despite decades of research and the a vailabilit y of effectiv e analgesic approaches, man y children continue to experience moder ate to sev ere pain, especially after hospitalization. Overall, the factors affecting children' s pain management are influenced b y cooper ation (nurses, doctors, parents, children), child (beha vior, diagnosis, age), organization (lack of routine instructions for pain relief , lack of time, lack of pain clinics), and nurses (experience, knowledge, attitude) (Aziznejadroshan et al. , 2016). Pain ev aluation in small children can be difficult. Previous experiences, fear , anxiet y, and discomfort ma y alter pain perception; thus, poor agreement between instruments and raters is often the norm. In children y ounger than 7 y ears of age and in cognitiv ely impaired children, ev aluation of pain intensit y through self -report instruments can be inaccur ate due to poor understanding of the instrument and poor capacit y to tr anslate the painful experience into v erbal language; therefore, complementary observ ational pain measurements should be used to assess pain intensit y (Kolosovas-Machuca et al. , 2016). Three methods are commonly used to measure a child' s pain intensit y: Children' s capabilit y to describe pain increases with age and experience, and changes throughout their dev elopmental stages. Although observ ed reports of pain and distress provide helpful information, particularly for y ounger children, they are reliant on the individuals completing the report (Srouji et al. , 2010). Assessing Pain in Cognitively Intact AdultsSelf-reporting : what a child is sa ying. 1. Behavioral measures : what a child is doing (motor response, beha vioral responses, facial expression, crying, sleep patterns, decreased activit y or eating, body postures, and mo vements).2. Physiologic measures : how the body is reacting (changes in heartr ate, blood pressure, o xygen satur al. , 2010).3.For the cognitiv ely intact adult, assessment of pain intensit y is most often done b y using the 0 to 10 numeric r ating scale or the 0 to 5 W ong-Bak er FACES scale, or the VRS . Once patients know how to use a pain intensit y scale, they should establish \"comfort -function\" goals. With the clinician' s input, patients can determine the pain intensit y at which they are easily able to perform necessary activities with the fewest side effects. In cognitiv ely intact older adults, management of pain begins with an accur ate assessment and includes the impact of pain on the patient 's daily activities. When analgesic treatment and pain-modulating drugs are used, co-morbidities and other risk factors must be carefully considered. The least in vasive method of administr ation should be used\u2014in most cases the or al route is preferred (Age and Ageing, 2013). Assessing Pain in Cognitively Impaired Adults The assessment of pain in patients with cognitiv e impairment is a significant challenge. Cognitiv ely impaired patients tend to v oice fewer pain complaints but ma y become agitated or manifest unusual or sudden changes in beha vior when they are in pain. Caregiv ers ma y have difficult y knowing when these patients are in pain and when they are experiencing pain relief . This mak es the patient vulner able to both undertreatment and o vertreatment. In the absence of accur ate self -report, observ ational tools based on beha vioral cues ha ve been dev eloped. The most structured observ ational tools are based on guidance published by the American Geriatrics Societ y, which describe six domains for pain assessment in cognitiv ely impaired: The interpretation of these beha viors can be complex, due to o verlap with other common symptoms such as boredom, hunger , anxiet y, depression, or disorientation. This increases the complexit y of accur ately identif ying of pain in patients with dementia and r aises questions about the v alidity of existing instruments. As a result, there is no clear guidance for clinicians and staff on the effectiv e assessment of pain, nor how this should inform treatment and care decision-making (Lichtner et al. , 2014).Facial expression 1. Negativ e vocalization 2. Body language3. Changes in activit y patterns 4. Changes in interpersonal inter actions 5. Mental status changes (Lichtner et al. , 2014) 6.A large number of systematic reviews ha ve analyz ed the relativ e value and strength of evidence of existing pain tools. In a review of reliabilit y, validity, feasibilit y, and clinical utility of 28 pain assessment tools used with older adults with dementia, no one tool appeared to be more reliable and v alid than the others (Lichtner et al. , 2014). Patient self -report remains the gold standard for pain assessment but in non verbal older adults the next best option, from a user -centered perspectiv e, becomes the assessment of a person who is most familiar with the patient in ev eryday life in a hospital or other care setting; this is sometimes referred to as a \"silv er standard\" (Lichtner et al. , 2014). A thorough review of pain assessment tools for non verbal older adults b y Herr , Bursch, and Black of The Univ ersity of Iow a is a vailable here. Keeping these challenges in mind, three commonly used beha vioral assessment tools serv e as examples of those used in assessing pain and ev aluating interv entions in cognitiv ely impaired adults: vioral Pain Scale, the P ain Assessment Checklist, and the Advanced Dementia Scale. Behavioral Pain Scale The Beha vioral Pain Scale (BPS) w as dev eloped for use with critically ill patients in the ICU . It evaluates and scores three categories of beha vior on a 1 to 4 scale: A cumulativ e score abo ve 3 ma y indicate pain is present; the score can be used to ev aluate interv ention, but cannot be interpreted to mean pain intensit y. The patient must be able to respond in all categories of beha vior\u2014for example, the BPS should not be used in a patient who is receiving a neuromuscular blocking agent. Pain Assessm ent differ from pain vior scales in that they do not ev aluate the degree of an observ ed beha vior and do not require a patient to demonstr ate all of the behaviors specified, although the patient must be responsiv e enough to demonstr ate some of the beha viors. These checklists are useful in identif ying a patient 's \"pain signature\"\u2014the pain beha viors unique to that individual. The Pain Assessment Checklist for Seniors with Limited Ability to Communicate (PACSLAC) is a caregiv er-administered tool that into four subscales:Facial expression: 1 for relax ed to 4 for grimacing 1. Upper -limb mo vement: 1 for no mo vement to 4 for permanently retr acted 2. Ventilator compliance: 1 for toler ating v entilator to 4 for unable to control ventilation3.A checkmark is made next to an y beha vior the patient exhibits. The total number of behaviors ma y be scored but cannot be equated with a pain intensit y score. It is unknown if a high score represents more pain than a low score. In other words, a patient who scores 10 out of 60 beha viors does not necessarily ha ve less pain than a patient who scores 20. Howev er, in an individual patient, a change in the total pain score ma y suggest more or less pain. Advanced Dem entia Scale (PAINAD) The Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale (PAINAD) w as dev eloped to pro vide a clinically relev ant and easy -to-use observ ational pain assessment tool for individuals with advanced dementia. The aim of the tool dev elopers w as to \"dev elop a tool for measuring pain in non-communicativ e individuals that would be simple to administer and had a score from 0 to 10\" (Herr , et al. , 2008). This tool is used when sev ere dementia is present. This tool in volves the assessment of breathing, negativ e vocalization, facial expression, body language, and consolabilit y. Facial expressions (13 items) 1. Activit y/body mo vements (20 items) 2. Social/personalit viors (15 items) Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) 0 1 2 Score* Breathing Normal Occasional labored breathing Short period of hyperventilationNoisy labored breathing Long period of hyperventilation Cheyne-Stokes respirations Negative vocalizationNone Occasional moan/groan Low level speech with a negative or disapproving qualityRepeated, troubled calling out Loud moaning or groaning Crying Facial expressionSmiling or inexpressiveSad Frightened FrownFacial grimacing Body languageRelaxed Tense Distressed Pacing FidgetingRigid Fists clenched Knees pulled up Pulling/pushing away Striking out ConsolabilityNo need to consoleDistracted or reassured by voice or touchUnable to console, distract, or reassure PAINAD Scoring: 1-3 = Mild; 4-6 = Moderate; 7-10 = Severe * Some institutions have developed policies in which a PAINAD score of four or greater must be addressed in the nursing care plan. Public domain.Total: Assessment of Cancer PainPain assessment in patients with pain secondary to cancer begins with a thorough discussion of the patient 's goals and expectations for pain management, including balancing pain lev els and other patient goals, such as mental alertness. Comprehensiv e pain assessment also includes pain history , pain intensit y, qualit y of pain, and location of pain. F or each pain location, the pattern of pain r adiation should be assessed (NCI, 2016). A review of the patient 's current pain management plan and how he or she has responded to treatment is important. This includes how well the current treatment plan addresses breakthrough or episodic pain. A full assessment also reviews previously attempted pain therapies and reasons for discontinuation; other associated symptoms such as sleep difficulties, fatigue, depression, and anxiet y; functional impairment; and an y relev ant laboratory data and diagnostic imaging. A focused ph ysical examination includes clinical observ ation of pain beha viors, pain location, and functional limitations (NCI, 2016). Psychosocial and existential factors that can affect pain must also be assessed and treated. Depression and anxiet y in particular can strongly influence the pain experience. Across many different t ypes of pain, research has shown the importance of considering a patient 's sense of self -efficacy o ver their pain: low self -efficacy , or focus on solely pharmacologic solutions, is lik ely to increase the use of pain medication (NCI, 2016). Patients who catastrophiz e pain (eg, patient reports pain higher than 10 on a 10-point scale) are more lik ely to require higher doses of pain medication than are patients who do not catastrophiz e. Catastrophizing is strongly associated with low self -efficacy and reliance on chemical coping str ategies (NCI, 2016). A high baseline pain intensit y, neuropathic pain, and incident pain are often more difficult to manage. Certain patient char acteristics, such as a personal or family history of illicit drug use, alcoholism, smoking, somatization, mental health issues such as depression or anxiet y, and cognitiv e dysfunction are associated with higher pain expression, higher opioid doses, and longer time to achiev e pain control (NCI, 2016). Several risk -assessment tools ha ve been dev eloped to assist clinicians, such as the Edmonton Classification S ystem for Cancer P ain (ECS-CP) and the Cancer P ain Prognostic Scale (CPPS) (NCI, 2016). Assessing Gender Differences in Pain Sensitivity Men and women experience and report pain differently . Specifically , women ha ve been shown to ha ve a lower pain threshold and pain toler ance and stronger responses to analgesics than do men. These differences are present in communit y-dwelling and clinical samples (Ho et al. , 2016).Differing biologic and psy chosocial factors ma y account for gender differences in pain sensitivit y. One commonly studied psy chosocial factor is pain-related fear , which includes fear of the sensation of pain, fear of mo vement or re-injury , and fear of ph ysical activities that are assumed to cause pain. P ain-related fear ma y contribute to the shift from acute low back pain to chronic low back pain, and numerous studies ha ve demonstr ated the association of pain-related fear with disabilit y in patients with chronic and acute low back pain, hip and knee osteoarthritis, and foot and ankle dysfunction (Horn et al. , 2014). An experimental pain study using electrical stimuli found the increased pain experienced b y women during a mo vement task w as accounted for b y higher reports of fear among women compared to men. In addition to pain-related fear , Robinson and colleagues found women to be more willing to report pain and consider themselv es to be more sensitiv e to pain compared to males. Con versely , some males believ e that they ha ve higher pain endur ance than women and as compared to the t ypical male (Horn et al. , 2014). Clinically , gender differences are relev ant because a greater percentage of chronic pain sufferers are women. W omen also gener ally report more areas of bodily pain and more pain-related disabilit y compared to men (Horn et al. , 2014). Gender bias (an unintended and systematic neglect of one gender) ma y play a role in a patient 's access to pain rehabilitation services. S wedish researchers found that men more often than women were referred to ph ysiother apy and x -ray independent of self -reported pain intensit y, pain activit y, and pain localization. Higher scores on self -reported pain did not trigger referr al to rehabilitation. In fact, a negativ e trend w as found among women. The higher the scores of pain, the less lik ely that women were referred to rehabilitation (Hammarstr\u00f6m et al. , 2015). Psychosocial Aspects of Pain Management Pain perception \u2014the conscious recognition and a wareness of a painful stimulus\u2014is modulated and modified b y man y psy chological and personalit y-related factors. These can include previous pain experiences, emotions and cognition, somatization and catastrophizing, the presence of acute and chronic stressful life ev ents, fatigue, anxiet y, fear, boredom, and anticipation of more pain. P ain perception is also influenced b y socioeconomic factors such as social support, acceptance, incentiv es, education, occupation, and qualit y of life. In addition, pain perception differs among genders and ethnicities, and v aries with age (Belfer , 2013).Chronic pain in particular carries with it personal and economic costs and psy chological distress, and psy chological factors pla y a significant role in chronic pain. Pre-existing depression, anxiet y, and stress ma y predispose some individuals to progress to a chronic pain condition, while chronic pain in turn leads to anxiet y and depression, creating a vicious cy cle (Rice et al. , 2016). Because of the cognitiv e, emotional, and psy chological effects that ma y be associated with pain, a biopsy chosocial concept of pain has emerged o ver the past two to three decades, along with consider able evidence supporting management approaches that address the psychosocial aspects of a patient with chronic pain (Sessle, 2012). Within the biopsy chosocial model, negativ e pain beliefs ha ve a detrimental impact on patients' o verall health, self -efficacy , and function. Thoughts can positively influence beliefs about the pain experience if there is control in managing pain, confidence that harm and disabilit y will not occur , and expectations of reco very. Thoughts can negatively influence beliefs about pain if control is lacking and reco very is not possible. The consequence can be emotional distress and catastrophizing, as well as ex cessiv ely negativ e and pessimistic beliefs and thoughts about pain (P ons et al. , 2012). Chronic Pain and Depression It has been estimated that 35% of the chronic pain population has associated depression (Bromley Milton et al. , 2013). P ain can be a symptom, a cause, or a consequence of depression. Studies in vestigating the association between pain and depression suggest that the stress of living with chronic pain can cause depression, but there is also evidence that pain dev elops secondary to depression, manifesting as increased pain sensitivit y, and that high depression scores are associated with greater risk of dev eloping chronic pain (Schneider et al. , 2011). The association between depression and pain appears to increase with the sev erity of each condition (Bromley Milton et al. , 2013). In studies looking at the psy chological factors associated with knee pain, researchers found strong evidence for a positiv e association between depression and knee pain in adults. Emerging evidence on the pathogenesis of depression suggests that ph ysiologic similarities exist between depression and chronic pain. Depression and knee pain ma y also be related to reduced ph ysical activit y, which could be due to fear of pain or a consequence of depression (Ph yomaung et al. , 2014).Extensiv e data support the v alue of tricy clic antidepressants for the alleviation of pain in chronic pain patients, and serotonin and nor adrenaline reuptak e inhibitors (SNRIs)\u2014 duloxetine, v enlafaxine, and milnacipr an\u2014ha ve shown to be useful in the treatment of pain and depression. Dulo xetine is a SNRI with pro ven efficacy for painful ph ysical symptoms of depression. Analyses from short -term trials demonstr ated that a greater reduction in pain was associated with a higher probabilit y of remission. The efficacy of dulo xetine has also been pro ven for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropath y (Schneider et al. , 2011). Anxiety and Stress Anxiet y is common in chronic pain patients and anxious patients ma y interpret pain as being more intense than non- anxious patients. The presence of chronic pain mak es it difficult to recogniz e and treat potential psy chiatric disorders, and this dela y may worsen the prognosis of psy chiatric disorders (Mangerud et al. , 2013). In a cross-sectional study of Norwegian adolescents with psy chiatric disorders, two-thirds reported chronic pain. Adolescents with mood or anxiet y disorders had a significantly higher frequency of chronic pain and pain-related disabilit y than those with h yperkinetic disorders. Adolescents with h yperkinetic and mood or anxiet y disorders had a two- to three-fold increased risk of pain-related disabilit y compared to those with h yperkinetic disorders alone (Mangerud et al. , 2013). Stress is the ph ysiologic reaction that occurs in animals and people due to threatened or actual damage to the organism, and can include psy chological challenges at the limits of the individual' s coping capacit y. Stress-inducing factors are collectiv ely called stressors (Ellegaard & P eterson, 2012). In the psy chother apeutic treatment of patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain and moder ate depression, div erse psy chological stressors ha ve been identified, relating to both the past and present. When pain, stress, and depression become o verwhelming and there are few resources a vailable, stress seems to become prominent. Stressful situations can lower a person' s abilit y to cope with back pain (Ellegaard & P eterson, 2012). Non-Opioid and Adjuvant Analgesics A wide v ariety of non-opioid analgesics are a vailable for the treatment and management of pain. Each has a unique profile and differs in onset, peak action, dur ation of action, and side effects. A multimodal approach (balanced analgesia), which includes non-opioids, adjuv ant medications, and opioids, is recommended. Non-Opioid Analgesic AgentsThe appropriate use of analgesics\u2014the right drug at the right interv al\u2014pro vides good pain relief for the majorit y of patients. There are doz ens, ev en scores, of drugs that can be used depending on the clinical circumstances. F or patients needing \"broadly effectiv e analgesia, \" non-opioid approaches ma y offer o verall safet y and efficacy as compared to opioid analgesics. R ather than immediately mo ving to opioids, a clinician should consider whether non-opioid approaches ma y be appropriate (Thomas, 2013). Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatories Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NS AIDs) , analgesic, and antip yretic properties; they are among the most widely used drugs in the world. They are used to reduce short - and long-term pain, decrease stiffness, and impro ve function in patients with acute and chronic conditions such as arthritis, headache, dysmenorrhea, and post oper ative pain. Aspirin, the first NS AID, was dev eloped in 1897. NSAIDs\u2014non-selectiv e NSAIDs, cy clooxygenase 2 inhibitors (co xibs), and semi-selectiv e NSAIDs\u2014 are most commonly prescribed to reliev e pain and inflammation. They work b y inhibiting cy clooxygenase (CO X) enzymes from making prostaglandins, some of which cause pain and inflammation. Because certain prostaglandins protect the stomach lining from the stomach acid that helps to digest food, NS AIDs can cause gastrointestinal (GI) complications. A history of prior gastrointestinal symptoms or bleeding, the presence of other risk factors such as adv ancing age, higher doses of NS AID, duration of NS AID use, and the fr ailty of the patient all increase the risk for upper GI damage and consequent bleeding (Simon, 2013). NSAIDs can be classified according to their mechanism of action. Non-selective NSAIDs like ibuprofen and napro xen inhibit both CO CO such as and inhibit CO X-2 enzymes. *Rofecoxib (Vioxx) has affinit y for CO X-2 but tend to inhibit the CO X-1 path way also (Ghosh et al. , 2015). CO X selectivit y is one of the determining factors to consider when giving NS AIDs to a patient.A meta- analysis of more than 700 studies in volving the use of certain NS AIDs for pain w as conducted b y The Co xib and T raditional NS AID T rialists' (CNT) Collabor ation. R esearchers at the v ascular ev ents, major cardiac ev ents, and upper GI complications from high-dose, long-term use of certain NS AIDs. Concerns about the possible heart risks of NS AIDs, man y of which ha ve been on the mark et for sev eral decades, arose after r andomiz ed trials showed that co xibs increased the risk of heart attacks (MRC, 2013). Diclofenac (V oltaren) is the agent currently in use that is most associated with an increased risk of cardio vascular ev ents: a 40% to 60% serious cardio vascular ev ents compared to non-use of NS AIDs has been reported. This is a r ate equiv alent to or possibly higher than that of rofeco xib (Vio xx), now withdr awn from the market (McGettigan & Henry , 2013). In contr ast, another tr aditional NS AID, napro xen, has been found to be relativ ely benign, with a cardio vascular risk that w as observ ed to be neutr al or much lower than that of diclofenac (McGettigan & Henry , 2013). The CNT Collabor ation report indicated that napro xen might be safer for patients with cardio vascular risk but that it is one of the worst NSAIDs in terms of risk for a major GI complication (Simon, 2015). Regardless of their mechanism of action, prolonged exposure to an y class of NS AIDs has been shown to ha ve potential adv erse cardio vascular effects in patients with or without pre-existing cardio vascular conditions, depending on the dur ation and dosage of these drugs. P atients with pre-existing cardio vascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, and history of strok e are at the greatest risk of cardio vascular ev ents after taking NS AIDs. P atients who ha ve recently had cardio vascular b ypass surgery are advised not to tak e NSAIDs due to a high risk of heart attacks (Ghosh et al. , 2015). NSAID guidelines ha ve been established to increase ph ysician a wareness of the complications associated with NS AID use; howev er, some ph ysicians either do not recogniz e or do not adhere to such guidelines (T aylor et al. , 2012). A recent surv ey of physicians identified six major barriers that affected their use of established NS AID guidelines: Lack of familiarit y with the guidelines 1. Perceiv ed limited v alidity of the guidelines 2. Limited applicabilit y of the guidelines to specific patient populations 3. Clinical inertia4. Anecdotal experiences5.Acetaminophen Acetaminophen, the activ e ingredient in T ylenol, is also known as par acetamol and N- acetyl-p-aminophenol (AP AP), and has been mark eted in the United States as an O TC antipyretic and analgesic agent since 1953. It is widely a vailable in a v ariety of strengths and formulations for children and adults as a single-ingredient product. Acetaminophen has been in clinical use for decades, y et its mechanism of action is not fully understood. It is thought to inhibit cy clooxygenases both centr ally and peripher ally. Researchers ha ve suggested that the inhibition of cy clooxygenase in the br ain is responsible for the antip yretic effect of acetaminophen, suggesting a centr al mechanism of action. Some ha ve suggested classif ying acetaminophen as an atypical NSAID (Cha vez et al., 2015). At the same time, research has shown that acetaminophen is a prodrug,* and indicating that the analgesic effect of acetaminophen arises from the indirect activ ation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Acetaminophen also has an effect on the descending serotonergic path way, and ma y inter act with opioidergic** systems or nitric o xide pathways\u2014and also ma y act as a selectiv e COX-2 inhibitor in humans (Cha vez et al. , 2015). *Prodrug. A prodrug is a medication or compound that, after administration, is metabolized into a pharmacologically active drug (Wikipedia, 2016). **Opioidergic. An opioidergic agent is a chemical that functions to directly modulate the opioid neuropeptide systems (ie, endorphin, enkephalin, dynorphin, nociceptin) in the body or brain. In the United States, acetaminophen is a vailable as 325 mg and 500 mg prepar ations and as a 650 mg extended-release medication intended for arthritis treatment. It is a vailable in drops, capsules, and pills, as well as v arious children' s dissolv able, chew able, and liquid formulations. T o reduce the risk of accidental o verdose, in 2014 the FDA announced that medications containing a combination of acetaminophen and an opioid can no longer contain more than 325 mg of acetaminophen per tablet or capsule. Acetaminophen is used in combination with man y prescription opioid drugs (Vicodin, Percocet) to giv e more pain relief while minimizing the dose of the addictiv e narcotic component. It is gener ally considered safe at recommended doses, but if more is tak en\u2014 even just a little more\u2014it can cause serious and ev en fatal liv er damage. In fact, acetaminophen poisoning is a leading cause of liv er failure in the United States (Hodgman & Garr ard, 2012). Clinical heuristics (experience-based problem solving, learning b y trial and error rather that following a pre-established formula) (T aylor et al. , is effectiv e as an antip yretic and analgesic, its anti-inflammatory properties are much weak er than those of aspirin and other NS AIDs. It is therefore less effectiv e for chronic inflammatory pain conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Acetaminophen is, howev er, a good choice for osteoarthritis, especially in those patients where aspirin is contr aindicated. Acetaminophen lacks the antithrombotic, blood-thinning properties of aspirin and other NS AIDS and therefore does not inhibit coagulation, an important consider ation for pain ther apy following minor surgical or dental procedures. From both a GI and cardio vascular perspectiv e, acetaminophen ma y not be as safe as previously believ ed\u2014especially at doses higher than 3 g daily . Indeed, use of acetaminophen (an y dose) is associated with a small but significant risk of upper GI complications. In addition, although women from the Nurses' Health Study , who reported occasional use of acetaminophen, did not experience a significant increase in the risk of cardio vascular ev ents, those who reported a frequent use (6-14 tablets/week) had a small increased risk (Scarpignato et al. , 2015). Regular acetaminophen has also been associated with an increased risk of h ypertension both in women and men. A t doses of 3 g daily , acetaminophen induces a significant increase in ambulatory blood pressure in patients with coronary artery disease (Scarpignato et al. , 2015). Prescription Acetaminophen/Opioid Combinations: Ma ......Because the risks of acetaminophen-related liv er damage are so serious and because the public is often una ware of these risks, the Acetaminophen Best Pr actices T ask Group has published recommendations intended to mak e it easier for consumers to identif y whether a prescription pain reliev er contains acetaminophen, to compare activ e ingredients on labels, and to tak e action to a void taking two medicines with acetaminophen. The T ask Group also recommended coordinating prescription container labeling with the labeling that already exists for O TC medicines, pro viding consistency in labeling across all acetaminophen- containing medicines (FDA, 2013a). Use of NSAI Ds and Acetaminophen in Older Adults Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ha ve been a mainsta y for chronic pain management for man y years but should be used with caution in older adults (Age and Ageing, 2013). Introduction of new drugs into the mark etplace and the continual stream of new research data ha ve recently called into question the use and prescribing guidelines of NS AIDs in older adults, especially \"complex\" older patients (T aylor et al. , 2012). Adverse reactions associated with NS AIDs including GI, cardio vascular , renal, and hematologic side effects, ha ve been known for a long time (Age and Ageing, 2013). Prescribing NS AIDs to older adults requires knowledge of individual patient risk factors, benefits and risks of the NS AID, and patient education. Monitoring for effectiv eness and side effects is essential. A recent report demonstr ated that more than 50% of patients were not properly informed b y a ph ysician or pharmacist on the side effects associated with prescribed or O TC NSAIDs (T aylor et al. , 2012). Medical Cannabis In the early 1960s cannabidiol the psy et al. , 2016). Cannabinoid 1 (CB) receptors in the human br ain were first identified in 1988. In 1992 researchers in Israel disco vered an endogenous cannabinoid neurotr ansmitter , which they called anandamide. By 1993 another group of scientists found cannabinoid receptors in the immune system (CB ). To date, fiv e endocannabinoids ha ve been disco vered. By 2009 more than 525 constituents ha ve been identified, among them about a hundred different cannabinoids. THC, other cannabinoids, and non-cannabinoids, such as terpenoids,* lik ely contribute to and modulate the o verall pharmacologic effects of cannabis. Numerous recent studies ha ve proven the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotectiv e properties of THC and CBD . CBD is known to reduce the psy choactiv e effects of THC; in addition, THC , 2016).1 2*Terpenoid: a terpene is a hydrocarbon found in the essential oils of many plants, especially conifers and citrus trees. Terpenes are also found in cannabis plants; terpenoids are formed when cannabis is dried and cured. Terpenes are non-cannabinoids and are responsible for the distinctive smell of cannabis. CB receptors are found mainly on neurons in the br ain, spinal cord, and peripher al nervous system, but are also present in other organs and tissues. There are only a small number of CB receptors in the br ainstem, which ma y help explain the absence of cannabis overdoses due to the depression of respir ations. CB receptors are primarily found in immune cells, among them leuk ocytes, the spleen, and tonsils. The effectiv eness of cannabis in decreasing pain is thought to be related to the role of the CB cannabinoid receptor , which suppresses microglial cell activ ation and decreases neuro- inflammation. In addition, cannabinoid receptors ma y couple to other effectors that are critical for the tr ansmission of pain signals (Gadotti et al. , 2013). THC, which is a partial agonist* to CB receptors and to a smaller extent to CB receptors, is available in man y countries and is administered or ally to treat pain, nausea, spasticit y, and loss of appetite. It has pro ven to be effectiv e in patients suffering from cancer , multiple sclerosis, am yotrophic later al sclerosis, chronic pain, and other diseases (Lanz et al., 2016). *Partial agonist: an agonist activ ates certain receptors in the br ain. A partial agonist binds to and activ ates receptors in the br ain but not as strongly as a full agonist. A partial agonist can also compete with a full agonist for a receptor site, lessening the effectiv eness of the full agonist. Studies conducted at Univ ersity of California, San Diego ha ve shown the v alue of cannabis for some pain-related conditions. One study look ed at the effect of cannabis on HIV -related peripher al neuropath y and found that pain relief w as greater with cannabis than placebo . Additionally , mood and daily functioning impro ved among the group using cannabis for pain relief. In another study , researchers look ed at the effect of smok ed cannabis on 30 participants with spasticit y due to multiple sclerosis. R esults indicated that smok ed cannabis w as superior to placebo in symptom and pain reduction in participants with treatment -resistant spasticit y (Corey -Bloom et al. , 2012). Adjuvant Medications Adjuvant analgesics (or co- analgesics) are drugs with a primary indication other than pain that ha ve analgesic properties. Although not primarily identified as an analgesic in nature, they ha ve been found in clinical pr actice to ha ve either an independent analgesic effect or additiv e analgesic properties when used with opioids (Khan et al. , 2011).1 1 2 2 1 2This group includes drugs such as antidepressants, anticon vulsants, corticosteroids, neuroleptics, and other drugs with narrower adjuv ant functions. Adjuv ant drugs can be used to enhance the effects of pain medications, treat concurrent symptoms, and pro vide analgesia for other t ypes of pain. Adjuv ant analgesics are particularly useful when evidence of decreased opioid responsiv eness is present (Prommer , 2015). Adjuv ants commonly used to enhance the effects of pain medications include: Antidepressants Anticon vulsants Local anesthetics Corticosteroids Bisphosphonates Using Opioids to Manage Pain Despite low -qualit y evidence supporting pr actice change, use of chronic opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain increased dr amatically o ver the past two decades. Concurrently , opioid analgesic o verdose deaths, addiction, misuse, and diversion have increased mark edly. Physicians for R esponsible Opioid Prescribing, 2012 Opioids are chemicals that produce morphine-lik e effects in the body; they are commonly prescribed for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain and for pain associated with cancer . Opioids ha ve a narcotic effect , that is, they induce sedation and are effectiv e for the management of man y types of pain. An estimated 20% of patients presenting to ph ysician offices with noncancer pain symptoms or pain-related diagnoses (including acute and chronic pain) receiv e an opioid prescription. In 2012 healthcare pro viders wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid pain medication, enough for ev ery adult in the United States to ha ve a bottle of pills (CDC, 2016a). Dozens of compounds fall within this class of (Demerol). In addition to their effectiv e pain-relieving properties, some of these medications are used to reliev e sev ere diarrhea (eg, Lomotil, or dipheno xylate) or sev ere coughs (codeine).Opioids act b y attaching opioid receptors , which are found throughout the nerv ous system as well as in v ascular , gut, lung airw ay, cardiac, and some immune system cells. There are three t ypes of opioid receptors: mu, delta, and kappa . Mu opioid receptors are thought to giv e most of their analgesic effects in the CNS , as well as man y side effects including sedation, respir atory depression, euphoria, and dependence. Most analgesic opioids are agonists on mu opioid receptors. Of all the analgesics used in pain control, the most safet y issues arise with the use of mu opioids, or morphine-lik e drugs such alent for analgesia in the peripher al nerv ous system. The kappa opioid receptors contribute to analgesia in the spine and ma y cause dysphoria and sedation, but do not gener ally lead to dependence. In 2016 the CDC issued Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain . The guideline calls for a dr astic reduction in the use of opioids for the treatment of chronic, noncancer pain. Dosage recommendations for ex ercising caution are lower than older opioid prescribing guidelines and recogniz e that ev doses (20-50 morphine milligr am equiv alents per da y) increase risk (CDC, 2016b). In addition, the CDC Guideline cautions that opioids pose risk to all patients, and currently tools cannot rule out risk for abuse or other serious harm. The Guideline encour ages use of recent technological adv ances, such as state prescription drug monitoring progr ams, and provides more specific recommendations than previous guidelines on monitoring and discontinuing opioids when risks and harms outweigh benefits (CDC, 2016b). Benefits and Harms of Opioid Therapy Balance between benefits and harm is a critical factor influencing the strength of clinical recommendations. The CDC has considered what is known about benefits and harms related to specific opioids and formulations, high-dose ther apy, co-prescription with other controlled substances, dur ation of use, special populations, and risk str atification and mitigation approaches (CDC, 2016a): Serious risks ha ve been associated with the use of extended release/long- acting (ER/LA) opioid formulations.1. Serious risks ha ve been associated with time-scheduled opioid use, specifically substantially higher a verage daily than as-needed opioid use.2. Overdose risk is dose-dependent, associated with increased o verdose risk.3.Paradoxically , despite an enormous rise in spending and prescription, there is limited evidence to support the efficacy of opioids in chronic noncancer pain management. In a European surv ey on chronic pain, 15% of respondents felt that their medications were not very, or not at all, effectiv e (Xu & Johnson, 2013). A systematic review b y Chou and colleagues suggested limited efficacy of long-term opioid therapy over short -term treatment or placebo , while an evidence review b y the Institute of Medicine concluded that the effectiv eness of opioids as pain reliev ers, especially o ver the long term, is somewhat unclear (X u & Johnson, 2013). Opioid-Induced HyperalgesiaConcurrent use of benz odiazepines and opioids might put patients at greater risk for potentially fatal o verdose.4. Patients with sleep apnea, sleep-disordered breathing, renal or hepatic insufficiency , older adults, pregnant women, patients with depression or other mental health conditions, and patients with alcohol or other substance use disorders ha ve been found to ha ve an increased risk for harm from opioids.5. Reduced renal or hepatic function can lead to a greater peak effect and longer duration of action and reduce the dose at which respir atory depression and overdose occurs.6. Age-related changes in patients aged 65 y ears, such as reduced renal function and medication clear ance, ev en in the absence of renal disease, result in a smaller ther apeutic window for safe dosages.7. Opioids used during pregnancy can be associated with additional risks to both mother and fetus.8. Patients with mental health comorbidities and patients with a history of substance use disorders might be at higher risk than other patients for opioid use disorder .9. Prescription drug monitoring progr ams and urine drug testing pro vide potential benefits, including the abilit y to identif y patients who might be at higher risk for opioid o verdose or opioid use disorder .10. Dose reduction might be associated with unintended negativ e consequences, such as patients seeking heroin or other illicitly obtained opioids or interference with appropriate pain treatment.11. For the treatment of opioid use disorder , methadone and buprenorphine ha ve been found to increase retention in treatment and to decrease illicit opioid use among patients with opioid use disorder in volving heroin. (CDC, 2016a)12.Apart from potential side effects, toler ance, and addiction, opioid use can be associated with opioid-induced hyperalgesia , which is defined as a state of nociceptiv e sensitization caused b y exposure to opioids. It is char acteriz ed by a par adoxical response whereb y a patient receiving opioids for the treatment of pain actually becomes more sensitiv e to pain (Suzan et al. , 2013). Opioid-induced h yperalgesia in the post oper ative period has been reported following the administr ation of short -acting opioids during surgery . Additional evidence comes from opioid addicts on methadone maintenance ther apy, in whom decreased toler ance to cold pain has been reported. Mix ed results are found regarding h yperalgesia in patients with chronic pain who receiv e intermediate-term opioid treatment (Suzan et al. , 2013). Tolerance, Dependence, and Addiction Thirty years ago , I attended medical school in New Y ork. In the k ey lecture on pain management, the professor told us confidently that patients who receiv ed prescription narcotics for pain would not become addicted. While pain management remains an essential patient right, a gener ation of healthcare professionals, patients, and families ha ve learned the hard w ay how deeply misguided that assertion w as. Narcotics\u2014both illegal and legal\u2014 are dangerous drugs that can destro y lives and communities. Thomas Frieden, MD Director , CDC A number of terms and definitions are regularly used to define beha viors that are associated with the misuse and abuse of drugs. These terms are imprecise and at times confusing and can reflect societal attitudes and beliefs about drug abuse. T o address this issue and to clarif y the terms dependence and addiction , particularly in opioid-treated patients, new definitions for drug addiction ha ve been included in the 2013 DSM- V update. The term \"substance dependence\"\u2014used in DSM- III and DSM- IV\u2014has been replaced b y the terms \"substance use disorder \" and \"opioid use disorder \" (IASP, 2013). Opioid use disorder is a problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress. It is manifested b y specific criteria such as unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use and use resulting in social problems and a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. This diagnosis has also been referred to as \"abuse or dependence\" and \"addiction\" in the liter ature, and is different from toler ance (diminished response to a drug with repeated use) and ph ysical dependence (adaptation to a drug that produces symptoms of withdr awal when the drug is stopped), both of which can exist without a diagnosed disorder (CDC, 2016b).The Brain's Reward Circuit The limbic system\u2014the brain's reward circuit. Source: National Institute on Drug Abuse.Changes in the DSM- V state that two items (not including toler ance and withdr awal) are needed from a list of beha viors suggesting compulsiv e use to meet the criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). Tolerance and withdr awal are not counted for those taking prescribed medications under medical supervision such as analgesics, antidepressants, anti- anxiet y medications, or beta-block ers (IA SP, 2013). Tolerance Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which a drug becomes less effectiv e over time, which means a larger dose is needed to achiev e the same effect. T olerance occurs because some drugs cause the br ain to release 2 to 10 times the amount of dopamine than natur al rew ards do. In some cases, this occurs almost immediately \u2014 especially when drugs are smok ed or injected\u2014 and the effects can last much longer than those produced b y natur al means. The resulting effects on the br ain's pleasure circuit dw arfs those produced b y natur ally rewarding beha viors. The br ain adapts to these o verwhelming surges in dopamine b y producing less dopamine or b y reducing the number of dopamine receptors in the reward circuit. This reduces the user 's abilit y to enjo y not only the drugs but also other things in life that previously brought pleasure. This decrease compels the person to k eep abusing drugs in an attempt to bring the dopamine function back to normal, but now larger amounts of the drug are required to achiev e the same dopamine high (NIDA, 2016a). Dependence Dependence is a state of adaptation char acteriz ed by symptoms of withdr awal when a medication is abruptly stopped, the dose is r apidly reduced, or an antagonist is administered. The seriousness of the withdr awal symptoms depends upon the drug being used and the extent of its use. It is a term often misused as a synon ym for addiction, but the two terms are not synon ymous. F or some drugs, such as alcohol or benz odiazepines, withdr awal symptoms can be serious and life-threatening.An example of dependence is a patient who is on morphine for sev eral months for chronic back pain. If the morphine is discontinued all at once, a flu-lik e syndrome will quickly develop, accompanied b y nausea, stomach pains, and malaise. These symptoms of physical dependence will disappear if the morphine is resumed. Once a person has been on opioids for a period of time, the medication must be tapered off to a void withdr awal symptoms. Addiction It is often said that addiction is easy to recogniz e, that it r arely arises during the treatment of pain with addictiv e drugs, and that cases of addiction during pain treatment can be managed in much the same w ay as other addictions, but such gener alizations grossly oversimplif y the real situation. International Asso ciation for the Study of Pain Addiction is defined as a chronic, relapsing disease that is char acteriz ed by compulsiv e drug seeking and use, despite the known, harmful consequences. Addiction in volves a psychological cr aving and is considered a br ain disease because drugs change the br ain's structure and function. Br ain changes can be long lasting and can lead to the harmful behaviors seen in people who abuse drugs. Although taking drugs at an y age can lead to addiction, research shows that the earlier a person begins to use drugs the more lik ely they are to progress to more serious abuse (NIDA, 2014a). Addiction The term addiction may be regarded as equiv alent to a sev ere substance use disorder as defined b y the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM- 5, 2013) (NIDA, 2014a). Opioids are highly addictiv e and r ates of addiction among patients receiving opioids for the management of pain v ary from 1% to 50%, which suggests uncertaint y about what addiction really is and how often it occurs (IA SP, 2013). Sa vage and colleagues introduced the four \"Cs\" criteria for identif ying opioid addiction in chronic pain population: Impaired Control o ver drug use 1. Compulsiv e use 2. Continued use despite harm 3. Unmanageable drug Craving (Chang & Compton, 2013). 4.Opioids in Patients with a History of Substance Abuse Treating chronic pain with chronic opioid ther apy in individuals with a history of a substance use disorder (SUD), whether activ e or in remission, presents a challenge to pain clinicians. This is, in part, due to concerns about the patient relapsing to activ e substance abuse. In addition, clinicians ma y confuse \"drug-seeking\" beha viors with addictiv e disease (Chang & Compton, 2013). The goal of chronic pain treatment in patients with SUD is the same as that for patients without SUD: specifically , to maximiz e functionalit y while pro viding pain relief . Howev er, reluctance to prescribe opioids and poor understanding of the complex relationship between pain and addiction often results in undertreated pain in this population (Chang & Compton, 2013). When estimating the presence of substance use disorder in chronic pain patients, terminology is important. It is increasingly understood that SUD cannot be defined b y physical dependence and toler ance, as these are predictable ph ysiologic consequences of chronic opioid use. R eflecting this, in the DSM- V, toler ance and withdr awal are not counted as criteria for the substance use and addictiv e disorder diagnosis if a patient is taking an opioid analgesic under medical supervision (Chang & Compton, 2013). The o verall prev alence of substance use disorders in chronic pain patients r anges from 3% to 48% depending on the population sampled. It has been reported that 3% to 11% of chronic pain patients with a history of substance use disorder ma y dev elop opioid addiction or abuse, whereas only less than 1% of those without a prior or current history of SUD develop the same (Chang & Compton, 2013). When screening patients for a history of substance abuse, one of the easiest tools to use is the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Drug Use Screening T ool. It begins with a Quick Screen, which recommends that clinicians ask one question: \"In the past y ear, how often ha ve you used alcohol, tobacco products, prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, or illegal drugs?\" Patients are ask ed to respond on a 5-point continuum: nev er, once or twice, monthly , weekly , or daily/almost daily . A response of \"at least 1 time\" when ask ed about frequency of prescription or illegal drug use is considered a positiv e result. R ecent research has identified that this single-question screening test is highly sensitiv e and specific for identif ying drug use and drug use disorders (NIDA, 2014a).For those who screen positiv e for illicit or nonmedical prescription drug use, clinicians can administer the full NIDA -modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance In volvement Screening Test (NM- ASSIST). The NM- ASSIST automatically gener ates a risk lev el to indicate the level of interv ention needed and pro vides additional resources, such as scripts, on how to discuss drug use with patients, plus resources to link patients to specialt y care (NIDA, 2016b). Untreated Addiction Patients with an activ e substance use disorder should be referred to formal addiction treatment. The prescribing clinician should maintain a referr al network of substance abuse treatment pro viders willing to collabor ate on pro viding care to patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorder . After referr al, a pain clinician should continue to work closely with the SUD treatment pro vider to monitor use beha viors and pain outcomes (Chang & Compton, 2013). Addiction in Remission Exposure to psy choactiv e medications can lead to relapse in patients with a recently or poorly treated substance use disorder . Although concerns of relapse ma y contribute to clinicians' reluctance to prescribe chronic opioid ther apy for patients whose addiction is in remission, there is evidence that patients with successfully treated addiction can be effectiv ely treated with opioids for chronic pain (Chang & Compton, 2013). For individuals with addiction in remission, the goal of treatment is the same as that as for all chronic pain patients: to impro ve pain and maintain functionalit y. Indicators of successful pain management include: The abilit y to manage a relapse episode is a necessary skill of an y chronic opioid ther apy prescriber . To assess risk of relapse, a series of questions should be ask ed at each visit to allow for early identification of high-risk situations and potential coping responses to these stressors (Chang & Compton, 2013):The patient 's abilit y to comply with regimens 1. The abilit y to engage in cognitiv e-beha vioral pain management str ategies 2. Utilization of positiv e coping skills to manage stress and 3. The abilit y to establish better social support systems (Chang & Compton, 2013) 4. How long y ou been in reco very? 1. How engaged are y ou in addiction reco very efforts and treatment? 2. What t ypes of drugs ha ve you abused? 3.A relapse contr act can be dev eloped early in treatment, which is individualiz ed to the patient and specifies steps or actions that will be tak en by both the patient and clinician if relapse occurs. The patient 's beha viors with respect to the opioid analgesic regimen provide the best evidence for the presence of activ e addiction (Chang & Compton, 2013) Seeking a higher dose of a prescribed medication does not necessarily mean that the patient is drug-seeking. Howev er, losing or forging prescriptions, stealing or ha ving others steal for y ou, visiting multiple pro viders for duplicate prescriptions, and injecting or al formulations are signs that the patient is not using the medication appropriately . Management of pain requires a great degree of trust on both sides. Being consistent, open, and fair are important attributes for the pro vider. Providing positiv e feedback, reducing harm through education, and attempting to understand individual circumstances are helpful to the patient. When managing patients with complex chronic pain on long-term opioid ther apy, a multi-disciplinary team approach is recommended. In some instances, a progr am called opioid reassessment has had success in assessing, monitoring, and treating patients with complex chronic pain on long-term opioid ther apy. The Opioid R eassessment Clinic (ORC) at V A Connecticut Healthcare S ystem is an example. Located in the primary care setting, the clinic is staffed b y an addiction psy chiatrist, an internist with addiction and pain tr aining, a beha vioral health adv anced pr actice nurse, and a clinical health psy chologist. The clinic has serv ed as a learning opportunit y for management of complex chronic pain and opioids o ver the past sev eral years (Beck er et al., 2016). Using Opioids to Treat Pain in Children Thankfully , not man y children experience the t ypes of cancer pain, extensiv e trauma, or surgeries that require long-term pain management. Howev er, few pain management products ha ve specific information on their label about their safet y and effectiv eness in pediatric patients. This ev en includes sev eral new pain medications that ha ve been appro ved for use in adults. To manage pain in pediatric patients, ph ysicians often ha ve to rely on their own experience to interpret and tr anslate adult data into dosing information for pediatric patients.

With r are exceptions, opioids ha ve not been labeled for use in individuals under 18 y ears of age. There is a dearth of qualit y studies on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safet y, and clinical effectiv eness. Although acute pain problems in children ha ve man y char acteristics in common with adults, persistent, recurrent, and chronic pain in infants, children, and adolescents are often qualitativ ely different from chronic pain problems in adults (Oregon Pain Guidance, 2016). As with adults, this vulner able population also appears to be at high risk for opioid to xicity. A study of 960 r andomly selected medical records from 12 children' s hospitals in the United States identified 107 adv erse drug ev ents with more than half attributable to opioid analgesics. Deaths ha ve been reported in y oung children related to ther apeutic use of codeine and h ydrocodone in doses within or moder ately ex ceeding recommended pediatric limits (Chung et al. , 2015). Despite their potential for serious adv erse ev ents, opioids are increasingly prescribed for adolescents. Opioid prescriptions for patients between 15 and 19 y ears of age doubled from 1994 to 2007, with estimates that opioids are prescribed in nearly 6% of ambulatory and emergency department visits made b y adolescents in the United States (Chung et al. , 2015). Given the large number of pediatric patients receiving prescribed opioids, there is an urgent need for fundamental epidemiologic studies to inform the risk -benefit decisions of prescribers and families. An essential component of these studies is the identification of serious adv erse reactions related to opioids. Epidemiologic studies in adults ha ve developed procedures to identif y hospitalizations and deaths related to opioid use. Howev er, similar studies in children are lacking (Chung et al. , 2015). Clinical recommendations for chronic non-malignant pain in children and adolescents include (W alco, 2015): Prescribe opioids for acute pain in infants and children only if knowledgeable in pediatric medicine, dev elopmental elements of pain systems, and differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in y oung children.1. Opioids are indicated for a small number of persistent painful conditions, including those with clear pathoph ysiology and when an endpoint to usage ma y be defined.

Since 1999 prescription drug o verdose death r ates ha ve quadrupled (CDC, 2016b). In 2009, for the first time in U .S. history , drug o verdose deaths outnumbered motor v ehicle deaths (CDC, 2013a). Since pain w as coined \"the fifth vital sign\" in the 1990s, sales of prescription opioids in the Unites States ha ve quadrupled (see below) (Bartels et al. , 2016).Avoid opioids in the v ast majorit y of chronic nonmalignant pain problems in children and adolescents, as evidence shows no indication.2. Consult or refer to a pediatric pain specialist when chronic pain problems in children and adolescents are complicated or persistent.3.Source: CD C, 2016a.This increase in the prescription of opioids for pain management has been accompanied b y a dr amatic rise in prescription opioid- associated morbidit y and mortalit y. In 2010 more than 16,000 deaths were attributed to prescription opioids, making them a leading cause of injury death in the gener al population (Bartels et al. , 2016). There are now more deaths from opioid-related o verdoses than from all other illicit drugs combined. Emergency department visits, substance treatment admissions, and economic costs associated with opioid abuse have all soared (CDC, 2013a). Some startling statistics illustr ate the magnitude of the abuse problem. Between 1997 and 2011 the U .S. population increased only 16%, howev er the number of prescription pain medications sold b y pharmacies increased significantly more than that. Between 1997 and 2011: Oxycodone sales increased b y 1,259% Hydrocodone sales increased b y 356% Methadone sales increased b y 1,099% Fentan yl sales increased b y 711% Morphine sales increased b y 246% Buprenorphine sales increased from 17 gr ams in 2002 to 1,639 kg in 2011 (McDonald & Carlson, 2013) USA Opioid Consumption (mg/capita), 2000\u20142014 Sources: International Narcotics Control Board; World Health Organization population data By: Pain and Policy Studies Group, University of Wisconsin/WHO Collaborating Center, 2016. The increased a vailabilit y of opioid analgesics means they are being used in w ays that are unsafe or unintended. OxyContin, for example, which w as designed as a slow -release, or al medication is now being crushed, then snorted or injected, with lethal consequences. T o combat this, new formulations are being designed to deter some of these abuses. F or example, a new formulation of OxyContin releases from 21% to 48% less opioid when tampered with (milled, manually crushed, dissolv ed, and boiled) than the original v ersion (Raffa et al. , 2012). Benzodiazepines ha ve been reported frequently in deaths in volving opioid analgesics. Ov er the past decade, there has been an upw ard trend in the presence of benz odiazepines in opioid- analgesic poisoning deaths. In 1999 benz odiazepines were in volved in 13% of the opioid analgesic poisoning deaths; b y 2011, 31% of the opioid analgesic -related poisoning 2014). Age-Adjusted United States, 1999-2011 Source: NCHS, 2014. Prescription Drug Abuse Prescription drug abuse is the use of a medication without a prescription, in a w ay other than as prescribed, or for the experience or feelings elicited. According to sev eral national surveys, prescription medications, such as those used to treat pain, attention deficit disorders, and anxiet y, are being abused at a r ate second only to marijuana among illicit drug users. The consequences of this abuse ha ve been steadily worsening, reflected in increased treatment admissions, emergency room visits, and o verdose deaths (NIDA, 2014b). Prescription drug abuse can include taking a drug prescribed for someone else, taking more of the medication than w as prescribed, taking medication more frequently than w as directed, or altering the formulation (crushing, snorting) so as to obtain a greater amount of activ e agent than w as originally intended (NIDA, 2012).Prescribing r ates for opioids v ary widely across states. In 2012 healthcare pro viders in the highest -prescribing state wrote almost 3 times as man y opioid painkiller prescriptions per person as those in the lowest prescribing state. Some of the increased demand for prescription opioids is from people who use them non-medically , who sell them, or who obtain them from multiple prescribers. Man y states report problems with for -profit, high- volume pain clinics (so-called pill mills) that prescribe large quantities of painkillers to people who don' t need them medically (CDC, 2016a). Source: CD C, 2016a. Opioid pain medication abuse presents serious risks: from 1999 to 2014, more than 165,000 persons died from o verdose related to opioid pain medication in the United States (CDC, 2016b). In the past decade, while the death r ates for the top leading causes of death such as heart disease and cancer ha ve decreased substantially , the death r ate associated with opioid pain medication has increased mark edly. Sales of opioid pain medication ha ve increased in par allel with opioid-related o verdose deaths. The Drug Abuse Warning Network estimated that >420,000 ED visits were related to the misuse or abuse of narcotic pain reliev ers in 2011, the most recent y ear for which data are a vailable (CDC, 2016b). Having a history of a prescription for an opioid pain medication increases the risk for overdose and opioid use disorder , highlighting the v alue of guidance on safer prescribing practices for clinicians. A recent study of patients aged 15 to 64 y ears receiving opioids for chronic noncancer pain and followed for up to 13 y ears rev ealed that: 1 in 550 patients died from opioid-related o verdose at a median of 2.6 y ears from their first opioid prescription, and1. Did You Know . . . Enough prescription painkillers were prescribed in 2010 to medicate every American adult around-the-clock for one month (CDC, n.d.). Several factors ha ve contributed to the rise in opioid prescriptions for chronic noncancer . These include reserv ations against alternativ e apies, especially those related to adverse ev ents associated with long-term use of NS AIDs, aggressiv e and, at times, misleading product mark eting b y the manufacturers, and the widespread belief that opioid therapy carries a low risk of addiction potential (X u & Johnson, 2013). Methadone Methadone is a synthetic narcotic first dev eloped b y German scientists during W orld W ar II to address a shortage of morphine. Methadone w as introduced into the United States in 1947 as an analgesic (Dolophinel) and has emerged as a commonly prescribed medication for the management of pain. Methadone is also used for the treatment of opioid dependence, in which case it ma y be dispensed only in feder ally appro ved Opioid Treatment Progr ams. Methadone has been associated with disproportionate numbers of o verdose deaths relativ e to the frequency with which it is prescribed for pain. Methadone has been found to account for as much as one-third of opioid-related o verdose deaths in volving single or multiple drugs in states that participated in the Drug Abuse W arning Network, which w as more than any opioid other than o xycodone, despite representing <2% of opioid prescriptions outside of opioid treatment progr ams in the United States; further , methadone w as involved in twice as man y single-drug deaths as an y other prescription opioid (MMWR, 2016). 1 in 32 patients who escalated to opioid dosages >200 morphine milligr am verdose. (CDC, 2016b)2.Source: CD C, 2012. Methadone differs from most other opioids because of its long half -life, dela yed onset, narrow ther apeutic window , and inter actions with drugs such as alcohol and benzodiazepines. Methadone is less expensiv e than other opioids and is increasingly being prescribed as a cost -effectiv e alternativ e, partly due to pressure from insur ance companies. Fentanyl Drug incidents and o verdoses related to fentan yl are occurring at an alarming r ate throughout the United States and represent a significant threat to public health and safet y. Often laced in heroin, fentan yl and fentan yl analogues produced in illicit clandestine labs are up to 100 times more powerful than morphine and 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin. DEA Administr ator Michele M. Leonhart, 2015 Fentan yl is a synthetic opioid analgesic that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent. It is a schedule II prescription drug, and it is t ypically used to treat patients with sev ere pain or to manage pain after surgery . It is also sometimes used to treat patients with chronic pain who are ph ysically toler ant to other opioids. Fentan yl can be absorbed through the skin (fentan yl patch), b y IV injection, b y mouth (for breakthrough cancer pain), and intr anasally . There are two t ypes of fentan yl: Pharmaceutical fentan yl, which is primarily prescribed to manage acute and chronic pain associated with adv anced cancer .1. Non-pharmaceutical fentan yl, which is illegally made, and is often mix ed with heroin and/or cocaine\u2014 with or without the user 's knowledge\u2014in order to2.There has been a sharp increase in the number of fentan yl overdoses in recent y ears. Most of the increases in fentan yl deaths o ver the last three y ears do not in volve prescription fentan yl but are related to illicitly made fentan yl that is being mix ed with or sold as heroin \u2014with or without the users' knowledge\u2014 and increasingly as counterfeit pills. In July 2016 the Drug Enforcement Administr ation (DEA) issued a nation wide report indicating hundreds of thousands of counterfeit prescription pills ha ve been entering the U .S. drug mark et since 2014, some containing deadly amounts of fentan yl and fentan yl analogs. The current fentan yl crisis continues to expand in siz e and scope across the United States (CDC, 2016a). This graph uses data from the DEA National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS) on the number of law enforcement drug submissions that test positive for fentanyl from 2014 to 2015 as of July 1, 2016. Source: CD C. Buprenorphineincrease the drug' s effect.Buprenorphine is used in medication- assisted treatment (MA T) to help people reduce or quit their use of heroin or other opiates, such as pain reliev ers lik e morphine (S AMHS A, 2016). Buprenorphine Subo xone (a combination of buprenorphine and nalo xone) are used to treat opioid dependence. These medications work to prev ent withdr awal symptoms when someone stops taking opioid drugs b y producing similar effects to these drugs. In recent y ears, buprenorphine has surpassed methadone as a drug of div ersion and abuse (Medline Plus, 2016). Buprenorphine is the first medication to treat opioid dependency that is permitted to be prescribed or dispensed in ph ysician offices, significantly increasing treatment access. Because of buprenorphine' s opioid effects, it can be misused, particularly b y people who do not ha ve an opioid dependency . Nalo xone is added to buprenorphine to decrease the likelihood of div ersion and misuse of the combination drug product. When these products are tak en as sublingual tablets, buprenorphine' s opioid effects dominate opioid withdr awals. If the sublingual tablets are crushed and injected, howev er, the naloxone effect dominates and can bring on opioid withdr awals (S AMHS A, 2016). Analysis of la w enforcement samples b y the National F orensic Labor atory Information System indicated that, in contr ast to methadone, the number of buprenorphine reports increased from 90 in 2003 (one y ear after buprenorphine w as appro ved to treat opioid dependence) to more than 10,000 in 2010, but has increased more slowly since then, reaching a high of nearly 12,000 in 2013. The majorit y of buprenorphine reports were from the Northeast U .S. census region, while the W est had the lowest number (CES AR, 2014). Drug-Related Deaths in Oregon In 2012 Oregon had the highest r ate of non-medical use of prescription pain reliev ers in the nation. That y ear, a total of 346 individuals died due to drug o verdose (OHA, 2014). Prescription opioids accounted for about a quarter of unintentional and undetermined overdose deaths in Oregon in 2012. Methadone (prescribed for pain) accounted for 40% of the 164 prescription opioid deaths in 2012. Although methadone o verdose death r ates peaked in 2006 and ha ve declined since 2006-2008, the r ates in 2012 are nearly double the rates in 2000. More than 16,000 individuals had at least one prescription for methadone in 2012 (OHA, 2014). Percent of Unintentional and Undetermined Overdose Deaths Due to Prescribed Medications, Illicit Drug, and Alcohol Oregon, 2012 Source: Oregon Health Authority, 2014. Although drug poisoning deaths associated with illicit drugs such as heroin and cocaine have increased in recent y ears, prescription opioid analgesics are increasingly a factor in drug poisoning deaths. In Oregon, between 2000 and 2012: In Oregon, more males than females ha ve died from unintentional prescription drug overdose with a r atio of 1.5 males to 1 female. Unintentional o verdose death r ates significantly increase for males and females starting at age 25. The peak ages for deaths are ages 45-54 (OHA, 2014). 4,182 people died in Oregon due to unintentional and undetermined drug overdose (322 per y ear).1. Unintentional and undetermined drug o verdose death r ates appear to ha ve peaked in 2007 at 11.4 per 100,000 and declined to 8.9 per 100,000 in 2012. Nonetheless, the o verdose death r ate in 2012 remains 1.9 times higher than in 2000.2. The highest r ates of death due to unintentional and undetermined drug overdose occurred among Caucasian and non-Latino Oregonians for ev ery type of drug.

Oregon' s rate of death associated with methadone poisoning decreased 58% in the same time period. Key initiativ es to address the problem include the: OHA continues to promote adoption of their PDMP , and works with health systems, insurers and other partners to increase access to medication assisted treatment and non-pharmaceutical pain care for chronic non-cancer pain.

Intertwined Epidemics: Prescription Opioids and Heroin The enormous increase in the a vailabilit y of prescription pain medications is dr awing new users to these drugs and changing the geogr aphy and age-grouping of opiate-related overdoses. While man y drugs and medicines ha ve potential for o verdose, the use of both prescription opioids and heroin (often tak en in combination with other medicines and drugs) has increased since 1999. With increased use of opioids, communities ha ve seen increases in o verdose hospitalizations and deaths and need for treatment (OHA, 2014). Most of the current cases of opioid-related o verdoses can be tr aced to two fronts: (1) illegal heroin consumption, and (2) the illicit use or misuse of prescription opioids. The rise in prescription opioid-related o verdose deaths has been particularly alarming in rur al areas; between 1999 and 2004 prescription opioid-related o verdose deaths increased 52% in large urban counties and a staggering 371% in non-urban counties (Unick et al. , 2013).establishment of a PDMP to tr ack prescriptions of controlled substances; 1. implementation of prior authorization for Methadone doses >100mg/da y under Medicaid;2. education and access of la y persons to pro vide nalo xone to persons suspected of overdose; and3. physician and allied health care tr ainings about safe and effectiv e pain care. 4.Significant increases in drug o verdose death r ates were seen in the Northeast, Midwest and South census regions. In 2014 the fiv e states with the highest r ates of death due to drug overdose were W est Virginia, New Mexico , New Hampshire, K entucky , and Ohio . Fourteen other states reported statistically significant increases in the r ate from 2013 to 2014: Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico , North Dak ota, Ohio , Pennsylv ania, and Virginia (CDC, 2016b). Drug Overdose Increase, 2013-2014 Statistically significant drug overdose death rate increase from 2013 to 2014, U.S. states. There is an ev olving flux between prescription opioid use and heroin use in urban areas. Ethnogr aphic work from Montreal shows that individuals at risk for heroin use ha ve begun shifting to injecting prescription opioids. Additional evidence from Baltimore and Washington State suggests a high prev alence of prescription abuse in injection drug using populations, often preceding heroin use. Interestingly , recent changes to the formulation of OxyContin, the br and name long- acting form of o xycodone, ha ve been link ed to a self - reported rise in heroin use. What these studies suggest is that prescription opioid misuse and heroin use are intertwined (Unick et al. , 2013). Opioid Abuse Among Adolescents and Young AdultsAdolescents and y oung adults are especially vulner able to prescription drug abuse, particularly opioids and stimulants. According to the Monitoring the Future (MTF) surv ey, an ongoing study of the beha vior and attitudes of American y outh in volving nearly 45,000 8th, 10th, and 12th gr ade students, although there has been a decline in the use of certain illicit drugs, psy chother apeutic drugs now mak e up a significantly larger part of the o verall U.S. drug problem than w as true 10 to 15 y ears ago . This is in part because use increased for man y prescription drugs o ver that period, and in part because use of a number of street drugs has declined substantially since the mid to late 1990s (Johnston et al. , 2015). It seems lik ely that y oung people are less concerned about the dangers of using these prescription drugs because they are widely used for legitimate purposes. Also , prescription psychother apeutic drugs are now being adv ertised directly to the consumer , which implies that they are safe to use. F ortunately , the use of most of these drugs has either lev eled or begun to decline in the past few y ears. The proportion of 12th gr aders misusing an y of these prescription drugs (eg, amphetamines, sedativ es, tranquiliz ers, or narcotics other than heroin) in the prior y ear continued to decline in 2015 down from its high in 2005 (Johnston et al. , 2015). Amphetamine use without a doctor 's orders\u2014currently the second most widely used class of illicit drugs after marijuana\u2014continued a gr adual decline in 2015 in all gr ades, though the one- year declines did not reach statistical significance. Use of narcotics other than heroin without a doctor 's orders (measured only in 12th gr ade) also continued a gr adual decline begun after 2009 (Johnston et al. , 2015). Source: National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2015. Opioid Abuse Among Middle-Aged and Older Adults Prescription opioid-related o verdoses r ates are increasing the most in middle- aged individuals. Older adults represent another area of concern. Although older adults currently comprise just 13% of the population, they account for more than one-third of total outpatient spending on prescription medications in the United States. Older patients are more lik ely to be prescribed long-term and multiple prescriptions, which could lead to misuse or abuse (NIDA, 2014b). The high r ates of comorbid illnesses in older populations, age-related changes in drug metabolism, and the potential for drug inter actions ma y mak e any of these pr actices more dangerous than in y ounger populations. Further , a large percentage of older adults also use over-the-counter medicines and dietary supplements, which (in addition to alcohol) could compound an y adv erse health consequences resulting from prescription drug abuse (NIDA, 2014b). Gender Differences in Opioid AbuseOverall, adult men and women ha ve roughly similar r ates of nonmedical use of prescription drugs, although some studies suggest that women are more lik ely than men to be prescribed drugs, particularly narcotics and anti- anxiet y drugs. Adolescent females are more lik ely than males to use psy chother apeutic drugs nonmedically . Research has also suggested that women are at increased risk for nonmedical use of narcotic analgesics and tranquiliz ers such as benz odiazepines (CDC, 2013b). Prescription pain medication o verdoses are increasing among women. Although men are still more lik ely to die of prescription painkiller o verdoses (more than 10,000 deaths in 2010), the gap between men and women is closing. Deaths from prescription painkiller overdose among women ha ve risen more sharply than among men; since 1999 the percentage increase in deaths w as more than 400% among women compared to 265% in men. This rise relates closely to increased prescribing of these drugs during the past decade (CDC, 2013b).

Opioid Abuse in Patients with Chronic Pain Diagnosed chronic pain patients mak e up less than 1% of the insured population in the United States but consume about 45% of all prescription opioids. It has been estimated that up to 40% of pain patients on chronic opioid ther apy displa y aberrant drug-related behaviors (Raffa et al. , 2012). Chronic pain has been intertwined with substance abuse: 33% of individuals in a substance abuse progr am reported suffering from chronic pain and individuals in substance abuse treatment progr ams with chronic pain were significantly more lik ely to abuse opioids than those not reporting chronic pain. The term rational abuse has been put forth to describe chronic pain patients who abuse opioids because of undertreated pain, but v ery little is known about this population (R affa et al. , 2012). Curbing Opioid AbuseMedicine and drug use is highly regulated b y the feder al government and states to protect people from harm. R egulations require pharmaceutical companies to place w arnings on packaging of o ver-the-counter and prescribed medicines. F ederal and state regulations control who is able to prescribe medicines with a high risk for abuse. Medical tr aining institutions teach students to prescribe controlled substances and o ver the counter medicines safely . Schools of pharmacy teach pharmacists to dispense medicines safely . Pharmaceutical boards regulate the pr actice of dispensing medicines (OHA, 2014). Many states require prescriber education on pain and the use of pharmaceutical medicines to control pain. States regulate the age at which individuals can legally purchase and consume alcohol. F ederal and state la ws establish penalties to control and punish infractions of la ws and regulations b y individuals (patients, prescribers, and pharmacists), institutions, corpor ations, and criminal organizations that promote and control drug tr ade. Yet all of these la ws and regulations ha ve not prev ented misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdoses due to the use of prescribed medicines, alcohol, and illegal drugs (OHA, 2014). The increase in non-medical use of pharmaceuticals suggests that prev ention measures\u2014 such as pro vider and patient education and restrictions on the use of specific formulations \u2014have not been adequate to curb widespread abuse and misuse. Giv en the societal burden of the problem, additional interv entions are needed, such as more systematic pro vider education, univ ersal use of state prescription drug monitoring progr ams b y providers, routine monitoring of insur ance claims information for signs of inappropriate use, and efforts b y providers and insurers to interv ene when patients use drugs inappropriately (MMWR, 2010). Preventing Diversion Diversion is the use of drugs for other than medically necessary or legal purposes or for non-medical or not -medically authoriz ed purposes. Div ersion in volves, but is not limited to , physicians who sell prescriptions to drug dealers or abusers; pharmacists who falsif y records and subsequently sell the drugs; emplo yees who steal from in ventory and falsif y orders to co ver illicit sales; prescription forgers; and individuals who commit armed robbery of pharmacies and drug distributors (DEA, n.d.). Surveys rev eal that div ersion of prescription drugs is endemic in communities. Div ersion takes place in man y contexts, most often when friends and relativ es share their prescription pain reliev ers. Fift y-four percent of those surv eyed in the United States reported the source of the pain reliev ers that they used non-medically w as free from their family and friends (OHA, 2014).Source: CD C.Almost all prescription drugs in volved in o verdoses originate from prescriptions; v ery few come from pharmacy theft. Howev er, once they are prescribed and dispensed, prescription drugs are frequently diverted to people using them without prescriptions. More than 3 out of 4 people who misuse prescription painkillers use drugs prescribed to someone else. Most prescription painkillers are prescribed b y primary care and internal medicine doctors and dentists, not specialists. About 20% of prescribers prescribe 80% of all prescription painkillers (CDC, 2013a). More than half of prescription drugs are obtained from a friend or relative. Source: NIDA, 2014. A large number of new unregulated substances (designer drugs) are being abused for their psychoactiv e properties, often resulting in violent and unpredictable beha vior. This growing phenomenon is particularly challenging, first because of the speed with which rogue chemists can modif y existing drugs and mark et them and second because of the ease with which the Internet allows for the sharing of information about and purchase of products such as \"spice\" and \"bath salts\" (V olkow, 2013).

In 2014 the Harm Reduction Coalition (HRC), a national adv ocacy and capacit y-building organization, surveyed managers of organizations in the U .S. known to pro vide nalo xone kits to laypeople. Managers reported on the amount of nalo xone distributed, o verdose rev ersals by bystanders, and other progr am data for 644 sites that were pro viding nalo xone kits to laypersons as of June 2014. From 1996 through June 2014, surv eyed organizations provided nalo xone kits to 152,283 la ypeople and receiv ed reports of 26,463 o verdose reversals (Wheeler et al. , 2015). Providing nalo xone kits to la ypeople reduces o verdose deaths, is safe, and is cost -effectiv e. U.S. and international health organizations recommend pro viding nalo xone kits to laypeople who might witness an opioid o verdose; to patients in substance use treatment progr ams; to persons lea ving prison and jail; and as a component of responsible opioid prescribing (Wheeler et al. , 2015). All on the Same T eam - P atients on opioids & pr oviders All on the Same T eam - P atients on opioids & pr oviders ......Although the number of organizations pro viding nalo xone kits to la ypeople is increasing, in 2013 twent y states had no such organization, and nine had less than one la yperson per 100,000 population who had receiv ed a nalo xone kit. Among these 29 states with minimal or no access to nalo xone kits for la ypeople, 11 had age- adjusted 2013 drug o verdose death r ates higher than the national median (Wheeler et al. , 2015). At their annual meeting in June 2016, the AMA adopted new policies that encour age physicians to co-prescribe nalo xone to patients at risk of an o verdose; promote timely and appropriate access to non-opioid and non-pharmacologic treatments for pain; and support efforts to delink pa yments to healthcare facilities with patient satisfaction scores relating to the ev aluation and management of pain (AMA, 2016a). The new nalo xone policies are intended to increase access to the o verdose-rev ersing drug for friends and family members of patients at risk of o verdose. The policy also encour ages private and public pa yers to include all forms of nalo xone on their preferred drug lists and formularies with nominal or no cost sharing. The policy supports liabilit y protections for physicians and other authoriz ed health care professionals to prescribe, dispense and administer nalo xone. Delegates called for policies to enable la w enforcement agencies to carry and administer nalo xone, as man y states ha ve done (AMA, 2016a). Probuphine: Fighting Opioid Dependence Medications lik e buprenorphine and methadone ha ve revolutioniz ed the treatment of people with opioid use disorder . By controlling cr avings and withdr awal symptoms without producing a high, these medications enable the patient to engage in treatment and mak e healthier choices while balance is gr adually restored in br ain circuits in volved in rew ard and self-control. In people with sev ere disorders, these circuits are greatly disrupted (NIDA, 2016c). One of the challenges with all addiction medications, howev er, is making sure patients adhere to their prescribed regimen. F or the medication to be effectiv e, the patient must take their prescription or show up at the clinic daily . This can be challenging for an yone managing life' s responsibilities, especially in times of stress. F ailing at this challenge ma y mean relapse, which can dela y reco very (NIDA, 2016c). In Ma y of 2016 the FDA appro ved a long- acting buprenorphine implant called Probuphine. This subdermal implant deliv ers a constant low dose of buprenorphine o ver six months, the first such tool in the treatment of opioid use disorder . The implant is appro ved for individuals with opioid dependence who ha ve already been treated with, and are medically stable on, existing or ally absorbed buprenorphine formulations. It is a v aluable new therapeutic tool for this subset of patients (NIDA, 2016c).Buprenorphine, which in numerous studies has been shown to significantly impro ve outcomes for patients, has previously only been a vailable in products that must be tak en daily. The Probuphine implant, created b y marrying buprenorphine to a polymer , deliv ers the drug steadily in the body at a low dose, eliminating the need for daily dosing (NIDA, 2016c). Traditional Nondrug Approaches to Pain Management Professionals approaching pain management from a non-pharmacologic perspectiv e use diverse techniques to address the needs of their clients. Those tr ained in the W estern medical model are increasingly working in interdisciplinary teams. Within mainstream healthcare, this can include ph ysical and occupational ther apists, psy chologists, and nurses \u2014all under the direction of a ph ysician. Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation Interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation progr ams are becoming more common, especially for the treatment of chronic pain. In this model, healthcare professionals work from the same facilit y, with daily meetings about the patients' progress, sharing the same treatment vision and passing the same message to the patients (K urklinsky et al. , 2016). In one such progr am at the Ma yo Clinic Comprehensiv e Pain Rehabilitation Center in Jackson ville, Florida, the goal is to impro ve function in people with chronic pain. The progr am pro vides ph ysical ther apy, occupational ther apy, a pain psy chologist, and a nurse patient -care coordinator . The ph ysical ther apy component focuses on gener al reconditioning with gr aded exposure to activit y, gradual reduction of fear -avoidance beha viors, and incremental elimination of other pain beha viors. The occupational ther apy component focuses on the role of moder ation and balance in daily activities. The pain psy chologist leads up to three group therapy sessions each da y\u2014addressing anger , anxiet y, and fear; identif ying pain cy cles; and discussing beha vioral change, pain, and depression. A nurse manages medications and medication tapering and also communicates with primary and specialt y care pro viders outside of the pain team to assist with continuit y of care into the future (K urklinsky et al. , 2016). Physical and Occupational TherapyAs non-drug pr actitioners, ph ysical and occupational ther apists are well positioned to provide education on pain management for patients with acute and chronic pain. Education focuses on assessing and changing habits and patterns of mo vement that cause pain and dysfunction. T reatment often in volves individual or small group sessions, and can include manual ther apy, movement analysis, and supportiv e technologies and equipment. Clients are instructed to mobiliz e and strengthen muscles and impro ve patterns of mo vement, often focusing on restrictions in tendons, joints, and connectiv e tissue. Therapeutic ex ercise and proprioceptiv e training are activ e treatment techniques designed to address pain, impro ve strength and r ange of motion, increase blood flow , impro ve proprioception,* and prev ent muscle guarding, spasms, and contr actures. Ex ercise progr ams directed b y a ph ysical or occupational ther apist are tailored to the individual patient, based on assessment of impairments, patient preference, and co-morbidities. *Proprioception: Our unconscious sensory a wareness of balance and equilibrium, our body' s position in space, and the force and direction of mo vement. Proprioception allows us to control our limbs and mo ve about in the world without ha ving to consciously decide the force and direction of each mo vement. Therapeutic ex ercise is particularly effectiv e for patients with low back pain. It has been shown to decrease pain intensit y, alleviate disabilit y, and impro ve physical functions for up to 12 months following treatment (Ishak et al. , 2016). Proprioceptiv e training, in which passiv e and activ e sensory feedback ex ercises are used to impro ve motor function, ma y be more effectiv e than tr aditional ex ercise in the treatment of low back and neck pain. F or patients with musculosk eletal conditions such as chronic neck pain, knee ligament reconstruction, ankle injury , and osteoarthritis, tr aining consists of activ e multi-joint or whole body mo vement as well as whole body balance tr aining. Proprioceptiv e training pro ved most beneficial for impro ving function in knee osteoarthritis, leading to significant functional impro vement (Aman et al. , 2015). Manual Therapy Manual ther apy is a specializ ed area within man y professions, particularly ph ysical ther apy, osteopath y, and chiropr use a v ariety of non-surgical techniques directed to the patient 's spine and extremities for the purpose of assessing, diagnosing, and treating v arious symptoms and conditions. Manual ther apy techniques can be categoriz ed into four major groups: (1) manipulation, (2) mobilization, (3) static stretching, and (4) muscle energy techniques. The definition and purpose of manual therapy varies across healthcare professionals (Clar et al. , 2014).TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical kipedia.Manual ther apists mobiliz e areas of the spine or other painful joints using their hands, forearms, or elbows to apply a force with a ther apeutic intent. Spinal manipulation and mobilization are commonly used treatment modalities for back pain, particularly b y physical ther apists, osteopaths, and chiropr actors (Clar et al. , 2014). A 2010 review of scientific evidence on manual ther apies for a r ange of conditions concluded that spinal manipulation or mobilization ma y be helpful for sev eral conditions in addition to back pain, including migr aine and neck -related headaches, neck pain, upper - and lower -extremit y joint conditions, and whiplash- associated disorders. The review also identified a number of conditions for which spinal manipulation or mobilization appears not to be helpful (including asthma, h ypertension, and menstrual pain) or the evidence is inconclusiv e (fibrom yalgia, mid-back pain, premenstrual syndrome, sciatica, and temporomandibular joint disorders) (NCCIH, 2012). Other Non-Drug Techniques Other common pain management techniques used to treat and manage pain include electrical stimulation, ther apeutic ultr asound, heat/cold ther apy, and dry needling. These techniques are widely used b y physical and occupational ther apists, osteopaths, and chiropr actors. TENS Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is used to reliev e a variety of painful conditions. Controlled clinical trials ha ve demonstr ated that TENS can reliev e pain, but the mechanism remains largely unknown. F or this reason, clinicians use TENS largely b y trial and error , and the optimal setting of stimulation par ameters is still a matter of debate (Buonocore et al. , 2013). Therapeutic Ultrasound Therapeutic ultr asound is used for the treatment of soft tissue injuries and pain. It in volves the use of ultrasonic sound w aves applied directly to a patient 's skin, which causes the underlying tissue to vibr ate and mildly heat, impro ving blood flow to the affected tissue. The thermal effect is thought to cause changes in nerv e conduction velocit y, increase enzymatic activit y, in contr actile activit y of sk eletal muscles, increase collagen tissue extensibilit y, increase local blood flow , increase the pain threshold, and reduce muscle spasm (Ebadi et al. , 2012).Non-thermal, mechanical effects are achiev ed through the application of pulsed, low - intensit y ultr asound. ther apeutic ultr asound has been used with beneficial effects on cartilage repair (MacInt yre et al. , 2013). Heat/Cold Therapy The application of heat and cold to reduce pain or promote comfort is a common interv ention. Howev er, there are few studies in vestigating the impact of heat or cold on pain or function. Heat is commonly used to treat pain in combination with other treatments. Thermal agents apply heat either superficially or deeply . Superficial methods include hot packs, w arm whirlpools, and par affin. Deep heat, such as ultr asound, can increase the temper ature of the tissues 3 to 5 centimeters in depth. Heat has the advantage of inducing relaxation and decreasing joint stiffness, muscle spasm, and guarding. It assists in increasing r ange of motion and increases superficial circulation. Dry Needling Dry needling is the penetr ation of a needle through the skin without introduction of an y drug (Chou et al. , 2012). Dry needling uses a thin, flexible needle to stimulate underlying myofascial trigger points,* muscular , and connectiv e tissues for the management of neuro- musculosk eletal pain and mo vement impairments. Dry needling is used b y physical therapists to treat pain and reduce or restore impairments of body structure and function (APTA, 2013). *Trigger point: a hyperirritable nodule or knot in the fascia surrounding the muscle. Although there is strong evidence to support the use of dry needling in the treatment of various neuromuscular pain syndromes, the American Ph ysical Ther apy Association and several State Boards of Ph ysical Ther apy have narrowed their definition of dry needling to an \"intr amuscular \" procedure. These professional organizations ha ve equated dry needling with the term \"intr amuscular , 2014). Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Therapies Alternativ e practitioners mak e up an ev er larger piece of the pain management univ erse. Most are tr ained in what would be considered complementary and alternativ e techniques, increasingly referred to as integrative medicine .Complementary , alternativ e, and integr ative health approaches are used to treat or manage disorders or symptoms associated with acute and chronic pain. Common complementary health approaches include mind and body interv entions such as meditation, spinal manipulation, yoga, massage, tai chi, and acupuncture. A v ariety of natur al products, including herbs, dietary supplements, and prebiotic or probiotic products are also commonly used (NCCIM, 2016a). 10 Most Common Complementary Health Approaches Among Adults\u20142012 *Dietary supplements other than vitamins and minerals.

Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics, 2015. Integrative Pain Management \"Integr ative\" healthcare brings con ventional and complementary approaches together in a coordinated w ay. Researchers are exploring the benefits of integr ative health in a v ariety of situations, including pain management for military personnel and v eterans, relief of symptoms in cancer patients and surviv ors, and progr ams to promote health y beha (NCCIH, and integr ative medicine pro vides patient -centered care, addressing physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and en vironmental influences that affect a person' s health. It uses the most appropriate interv entions from an arr ay of disciplines to heal illness and help people regain and maintain optimum health (Abr ams et al. , 2013). Integr ative medicine is a popular approach to pain management, although for a large, structured healthcare organization, integr ating div erse pr actices can be challenging. Healthcare organizations must balance supply and demand for services as well as combine the integr ative medicine progr am into the established culture of a large hospital (Nate et al., 2015).In an effort to capture data on patient -reported outcomes in integr ative medicine, a number of leading clinics ha ve collabor ated to form the first pr actice-based research network in the field: the Br avewell Integr ative Medicine R aveNet). BraveNet's initial project in volved 4182 patients seeking care at nine clinical sites. The data confirmed the high utilization of integr ative medicine b y chronic pain patients and led to a Study on Integr ative Medicine T reatment Approaches for P ain (SIMT AP). In this study , researchers reported the impact of a six -month integr ative approach on chronic pain and a number of other related patient -reported outcome measures (Abr ams et al. , 2013). In the SIMT AP study , practitioners at each of the sites devised treatment plans for participating chronic pain patients. All Br aveNet sites include integr ative physicians, acupuncturists, mindfulness instructors, and y oga instructors; some also incorpor ate massage ther apists, manual medicine ther apists, fitness and mo vement dieticians and nutritionists, psy chologists, healing touch ther apists, and other energy practitioners. The results of this study suggest that the tailored, multimodal approach to treating chronic pain combining con ventional and complementary ther apies impro ves qualit y of life and reduces pain, stress, and depressiv e symptoms (Abr ams et al. , 2013). The National Center on Complementary and Integr ative Health (NCCIH) and the U .S. Department of V eterans Affairs are sponsoring research to see whether integr ative approaches can help activ e-dut y military personnel and v eterans experiencing chronic pain. NCCIH-funded studies are testing the effects of adding mindfulness meditation, self - hypnosis, or other complementary approaches to pain management progr ams for v eterans. The goal is to help patients feel and function better and reduce their need for pain medicines that can ha ve serious side effects (NCCIH, 2016a). Some cancer treatment centers are using integr ative healthcare progr ams such as acupuncture and meditation to help manage symptoms and side effects for patients who are receiving con ventional cancer treatment. Although research on the potential v alue of these integr ative progr ams is in its early stages, some NCCIH-funded studies ha ve had promising results: Cancer patients who receiv e integr ative ther apies while in the hospital ha ve less pain and anxiet y. Massage ther apy may lead to short -term impro vements in pain and mood in patients with adv anced cancer .

Own work, CC B Y 3.0.A growing body of evidence supports the efficacy and safet y of non-drug and complementary health approaches to reduce pain and increase patients' coping abilit y and gener al well-being. Man y of these techniques ha ve the potential to reduce the need for costly pain medications with harmful side effects. A t a minimum, pro viders should ha ve a basic understanding of the scientific evidence on complementary health approaches so that patients will not be reluctant to disclose their use. Mind and Body Practices Mind and body pr actices include a div erse group of procedures and techniques administered or taught b y a tr ained pr actitioner . A 2012 National Health Interview Surv ey showed that y oga, chiropr actic and osteopathic manipulation, meditation, and massage therapy are among the most popular mind and body pr actices used b y adults. The popularit y of y oga has grown dr amatically in recent y ears, with almost twice as man y U.S. adults pr acticing y oga in 2012 as in 2002 (NCCIH, 2016a). Yoga The v arious st yles of y oga typically combine ph ysical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation or relaxation. Hatha y oga, the most commonly pr acticed in the United States and Europe, emphasiz es postures (asanas) and breathing ex ercises (pr anayama) (NCCIH, 2016b). Yoga typically combines a series of stretching ex ercises, breathing techniques, and progressiv e, deep relaxation. A study in volving ninet y-five people aged 18 to 64 from six health centers in a low -income, predominantly minorit y area of Boston found that once- or twice- weekly yoga classes reliev ed pain, impro ved function, and reduced the need for pain medication in participants with chronic low back pain. The participants had moder ate to severe chronic low back pain and significant related impairment. Most were unemplo yed or disabled, with annual household incomes of $40,000 or less. The progr am included home pr actice, k eeping a log, meditation, and information on yoga philosoph y (Saper et al., 2013).Chiropractic ManipulationResearchers found statistically significant and clinically meaningful impro vements in pain and back -related function in both the once per week and twice per week groups. The most benefit w as experienced within the first 6 weeks. Adv erse ev ents, gener ally resolv ed on their own and were not serious (Saper et al., 2013). In another study , regular and long-term pr actice of y oga w as shown to impro ve pain tolerance. Findings showed that y oga pr actitioners ha ve more gr ay matter in multiple br ain regions compared with individually matched people who did not pr actice y oga. The study involved 14 experienced y oga pr actitioners, as well as 14 people who did not pr actice an y mind-body techniques. P articipants underwent a cold pain toler ance test b y immersing a hand in cold w ater until they could no longer toler ate the pain. R esearchers then ask ed participants about str ategies they used to toler ate the pain. The researchers also conducted br ain imaging scans to examine the structur al differences in gr ay matter and white matter between the y oga pr actitioner group and the control group (Villemure et al. , 2013). Researchers found that y oga pr actitioners toler ated cold pain more than twice as long as the controls. They found no significant difference in total gr ay matter v olume between groups, but y oga pr actitioners had greater gr ay matter v olume in br ain regions related to pain processing, pain regulation, and attention (Villemure et al. , 2013). The v olume of insular gr ay matter in y oga pr actitioners positiv ely correlated with the duration of y oga pr actice, suggesting that y oga experience contributed to these structur al differences in the br ain. In addition, y oga pr actitioners had increased white matter integrit y within the left insula. R esearchers observ ed that, to toler ate pain, y oga pr actitioners used cognitiv e strategies that are integr al parts of y oga pr actice, such as observing the sensation without reacting, accepting the sensation, using the breath, and relaxation (Villemure et al. , 2013). Other studies suggest that a carefully adapted set of y oga poses ma y reduce low -back pain and impro ve function. One NCCIH-funded study of 90 people with chronic low -back pain found that participants who pr acticed Iy engar y oga had significantly less disabilit y, pain, and depression after 6 months (NCCIH, 2016b).

Although pr actitioners ma y use a v ariety of treatment approaches, they primarily perform adjustments (manipulations) to the spine or other parts of the body with the goal of correcting alignment problems, alleviating pain, impro ving function, and supporting the body' s natur al abilit y to heal itself (NCCIH, 2012). In the United States, chiropr actic is often considered a complementary health approach. According to the 2007 National Health Interview Surv ey (NHIS), which included a comprehensiv e surv ey of the use of complementary health approaches b y Americans, about 8% of adults and nearly 3% of children had receiv ed chiropr actic or osteopathic manipulation in the past 12 months (NCCIH, 2012). Massage Therapy Massage ther apy, as one of the complementary and alternativ e treatments, is defined as a therapeutic manipulation using the hands or a mechanical device that includes numerous specific and gener al techniques often used in sequence, such as effleur age (stroking), petrissage (kneading), and percussion. It ma y be the earliest and most primitiv e tool used to impro ve pain. The most ancient references to the use of massage come from China (around 2700 B .C.). Common t ypes of massage ther apy include S wedish massage, Shiatsu, R olfing, reflex ology, myofascial release, and cr aniosacr al ther apy (Kong et al. , 2013). Massage mechanically assists in v enous and lymphatic flow, impro ves skin integrit y and mobilit y, desensitiz es tissue, and pro vides comfort and psy chological support. Massage ma y be used to stretch muscles and is usually used in combination with other treatments. Massage has pro ved effectiv e in reducing pain, anxiet y, and tension after cardio vascular surgery . In a study at Mayo Clinic, patients were r andomiz ed either to receiv e a massage or to ha ve quiet relaxation time following surgery . Those who receiv ed massage ther apy had significantly less pain, anxiet y, and tension than the control group (Br aun et al. , 2012).Monk in Meditation Phra Ajan Jerapunyo, Abbot of Watkungtaphao in Sirikit Dam, Thailand.

T urkish researchers found that massage ther apy reduced pain, itching, and anxiet y levels in adolescents in the burn unit of a large univ ersity hospital. Massage ther apy reduced all three symptoms from the first da y of the study until the last (P arlak et al. , 2010). Researchers in Spain studied the effects of massage combined with m yofascial release therapy* on patients diagnosed with fibrom yalgia. P atients were r andomiz ed to receiv e either the combination ther apy or a sham treatment during 20 weekly sessions. Immediately after treatment and 1 month later , the researchers found that anxiet y levels, qualit y of sleep , pain, and qualit y of life were impro ved in the experimental group (Castro- S\u00e1nchez et al. , 2011). *Myofascial release therapy is a type of physiotherapy requiring special training that aims to release myofascial restrictions at the sites of certain painful points called trigger points. A 2010 AHRQ evidence report, which summariz ed, critically appr aised, and compared the evidence on clinical benefits, costs, and harms associated with use of complementary and integr ative medicine and other ther apies for the treatment of adults with low back, neck, and thor acic pain, found that massage w as superior to placebo or no treatment in reducing pain and disabilit y immediately post treatment only in subjects with acute/subacute but not in subjects with chronic low back pain (AHRQ , 2014). Meditation Meditation refers to a group of techniques rooted in ancient religious and spiritual tr aditions. It is used to increase calm, promote relaxation, impro ve psy chological balance, cope with illness, or enhance o verall health and well-being. P eople also use meditation for v arious health problems, including anxiet y, pain, depression, stress, insomnia, ph ysical or emotional symptoms associated with chronic illness and their treatment.Mindfulness meditation is one of the most studied and pr acticed forms of meditation in America. In a study conducted b y researchers at W ake Forest School of Medicine and Cincinnati Children' s Hospital Medical Center , researchers recorded pain reports in 78 health y adults during meditation with a non-meditation control in response to painful heat stimuli and administr ation of the opioid blocks the tr of opioid activit y) or placebo saline. P articipants were r andomiz ed to 1 of 4 treatment groups: (1) meditation plus nalo xone, (2) control plus nalo xone, (3) meditation plus saline, or (4) control plus saline. P eople in the control groups were instructed to \"close y our ey es and relax until the end of the experiment \" (NCCIH, 2016c). Researchers found that participants who meditated during saline administr ation had significantly lower pain intensit y and unpleasantness r atings compared to those who did not meditate while receiving saline. Importantly , data from the meditation plus nalo xone group showed that nalo xone did not block meditation' s pain-relieving effects. No significant differences in reductions of pain intensit y or pain unpleasantness were seen between the meditation plus nalo xone and the meditation plus saline groups. P articipants who meditated during nalo xone administr ation also had significantly greater reductions in pain intensit y and unpleasantness than the control groups (NCCIH, 2016c). These findings demonstr ate that mindfulness meditation reduces pain independent of opioid neurotr ansmitter mechanisms. The researchers noted that because opioid and non- opioid mechanisms of pain relief inter act synergistically , the results of this study suggest that combining mindfulness-based and drug/nondrug pain-relieving approaches that rely on opioid signaling ma y be particularly effectiv e in treating pain (NCCIH, 2016c). Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine views the body as a system of channels through which energy flows. The Chinese call this energy qi or chi. Disease or illness is caused when the energy gets block ed or stagnates and doesn' t flow freely through the body . Herbs, acupuncture, qi gong, tai chi, and Chinese massage are mind-body techniques to help unblock the flow of chi through normal channels and thereb y restore health. Pr actitioners of tr aditional Chinese medicine devise individualiz ed treatment plans based on each patient 's unique diagnosis rather than following a standard interv ention based on the complaint (Abr ams et al. , 2013).Acupuncture Points Acupuncture sites. Source: NCCIH.Acupuncture TreatmentIn China, tr aditional medicine is one of the conserv ative treatments for lumbar disc herniation, and sev eral studies ha ve confirmed that it has certain effects on low back pain caused b y lumbar disc herniation. T reatments include acupuncture, or al administr ation of Chinese medicine, external application of Chinese medicine, Chinese tuina (massage), and TCM-char acteristic functional ex ercise. Clinically , these ther apeutic methods are not used alone but in combination (Y uan et al. , 2013). In the treatment of pain due to lumbar disc herniation, different tr aditional Chinese medicine ther apies ha ve different adv antages. P ain is the main symptom in the acute stage and acupuncture has good analgesic effect. Lumbar dysfunction is the main symptom in the remission stage and Chinese massage has good effect on impro ving dysfunction. Or al Chinese herbal formulae, external use of Chinese medicine, and Chinese herbal injection also showed good effect in relieving pain and impro ving dysfunction caused b y lumbar disc herniation (Y uan et al. , 2013). Acupuncture The term acupuncture describes a family of procedures in volving the stimulation of anatomic points on the body using a v ariety of techniques. The acupuncture technique most often studied scientifically in volves penetr ating the skin with hair -thin metallic needles that are inserted a few millimeters into the skin. Researchers from the Acupuncture T rialists' Collabor ation analyz ed data from r andomiz ed trials using acupuncture for chronic pain. These trials in vestigated the use of acupuncture for back and neck pain, osteoarthritis, shoulder pain, or chronic headache. F or all pain t ypes studied, the researchers found modest but statistically significant differences between acupuncture and simulated acupuncture approaches, and larger differences between acupuncture and non- acupuncture controls. The sizes of the effects were gener ally similar across all pain conditions studied (Vick ers, 2012).Basic acupuncture. Photo by Kyle Hunter, public domain.These findings suggest that the total effects of acupuncture, as experienced b y patients in clinical pr actice, are clinically relev ant. They also noted that their study pro vides the most robust evidence to date that acupuncture is more than just placebo and a reasonable referr al option for patients with chronic pain (Vick ers, 2012). How acupuncture works to reliev e pain and other symptoms is still incompletely understood, although functional MRI (fMRI) studies are beginning to pro vide some answers. Acupuncture seems to change the w ay the br ain perceiv es and processes pain. Using fMRI in 18 v olunteers, German researchers viewed pain centers in the br ain while applying an electrical pain stimulus to subjects' ankles before and after acupuncture treatment. They reported that \"activ ation of br ain areas in volved in pain perception w as significantly reduced or modulated under acupuncture\" (Theysohn et al. , 2010). Chinese T uina (Massage) Tuina is a form of bodywork or massage ther apy that is usually used in conjunction with other t ypes of tr aditional Chinese medicine. Among non-drug ther apies, Chinese tuina is widely used in China for pain management. T uina is thought to reliev e pain b y harmonizing the yin and y ang of the organs. T uina is considered gentle on the body and as such, patients often prefer tuina o ver pharmaceutical drugs (Zhang et al. , 2015). Tuina in volves a wide r ange of technical manipulations conducted b y a pr actitioner 's finger , hand, elbow , knee, or foot applied to muscle or soft tissue at specific body locations. It incorpor ates man y of the principles of acupuncture, including the use of acupoints. F or instance, tuina often uses manual techniques such as pushing, rubbing, kneading, or high- intensit y, high-frequency patting to clear energy blocks along specific meridians associated with particular conditions (Y ang et al. , 2014).Cupping in Practice A woman receiving fire cupping in Haikou, Hainan, China. Source: An na Frodesiak. Public domain.According to tr aditional Chinese medicine, pain is usually caused b y obstruction of qi, and consequently of blood circulation in the affected body region. P athogenic factors such as blood stasis, qi stagnation, phlegm, dampness, and others can be identified as causativ e factors in the blockage. The centr al ther apeutic goal of tuina is to remo ve energetic blocks which lead to qi stagnation. This leads to increased circulation and reduction of localiz ed edema, which helps to reduce associated pain (Y ang et al. , 2014). The A-Shi point in acupuncture theory is the tender , local dermal or muscular area or site on the body surface which reproduces the specific pain being treated when it is gently pressed. Its location indicates the precise place where qi and blood are block ed. Manipulation at the A-Shi point is done with the intention of remo ving the energetic block there to promote the free mo vement of qi and impro ve blood circulation in the region. Studies ha ve demonstr ated that one mechanism b y which this t ype of massage ther apy appears to be clinically beneficial is b y reducing inflammation and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis for repair of damaged sk eletal muscle (Y ang et al. , 2014). Cupping Cupping ther apy (CT) is a tr aditional Chinese medical treatment which has been pr acticed for thousands of y ears. The W orld Health Organization' s defines cupping as a ther apeutic method in volving the application of suction b y creating a v acuum. This is t ypically done using fire in a cup or jar on the dermis of the affected part of the body (Chi et al. , 2016). Cupping is used b y acupuncturists or other ther apists, utilizing a glass or bamboo cup to create suction on the skin o ver a painful area or acupuncture point. It is mostly used in Asian and Middle Eastern countries and has been claimed to reduce pain as well as a host of other symptoms. There are two t ypes of cupping. Dry cupping pulls the skin into the cup without dr awing blood. In wet cupping the skin is lacer ated so that blood is dr awn into the cup (Kim et al. , 2011).Practitioners of Tai Chi Tai chi. Source: NCCIH, public domain.Dry cupping creates a v acuum on the skin, with the ensuing negativ e pressure resulting in capillary rupture. The skin of the localiz ed area becomes flushed and ma y show petechiae and ecch ymosis or bruising, in which the dur is ther apeutically beneficial. Cupping has multiple ther apeutic functions which include (1) w arming the channels to remo ve cold, (2) promoting qi and blood circulation, (3) relieving swelling, (4) acceler ating healing, (5) adjusting body temper ature, (6) treating fibrom yalgia, (7) for strok e rehabilitation, hypertension, musculosk eletal pain, herpes z oster, (8) for the treatment of facial par alysis, acne, and cervical spondylosis, and (9) alleviating pain, including chronic neck, shoulder pain, and low back pain (Chi et al. , 2016). Movement-Based Therapies Qi Gong and Tai Chi Tai chi and qi gong are centuries old, related mind and body pr actices. They in volve certain postures and gentle mo vements with mental focus, breathing, and relaxation. The movements can be adapted or pr acticed while w alking, standing, or sitting. In contr ast to qi gong, tai chi mo vements, if pr acticed quickly , can be a form of combat or self -defense (NCCIH, 2015). Qi gong pr actice includes mo vement, body posture, mind exercises, concentr ation, relaxation, and breathing exercises. T ai chi in volves slow mo vements emphasizing balanced postures, regular breathing, and concentr ation, integr ating mind and body . Tai chi is used to help manage stress and anger; to impro ve strength, flexibilit y, and coordination; to impro ve lung function; to impro ve balance; and to reduce pain (Selfe & Innes, 2009). In a study partly funded b y the National Center for Complementary and Integr ative Health in volving patients with painful knee osteoarthritis, tai chi w as as helpful as physical ther apy in reducing pain and impro ving ph ysical functioning. In this study , 204 patients age 40 or older , who had knee pain and pro ven osteoarthritis of the knee, were randomly assigned to standardiz ed group tai chi tr aining or standard one-on-one ph ysical therapy. Both groups were then encour aged to continue their tai chi pr actice or home exercises for a total of 52 weeks. P atients in the two groups had similar decreases in pain and impro vements in ph ysical functioning after 12 weeks, and the benefits of treatment were maintained for the full 52 weeks of the study . Patients in the tai chi group had more impro vement in depression symptoms and qualit y of life than those in the ph ysical ther apy group (NCCIH, 2016d).Feldenkrais Method The F eldenkr ais Method (FM) is a t ype of ex ercise ther apy that w as dev eloped o ver a period of decades in the last century b y Moshe F eldenkr ais. F eldenkr ais put into pr actice an experiential process or set of processes, whereb y an individual or a group could be guided through a series of mo vement - and sensation-based explor ations (Hillier & W orley, 2015). The purpose of the explor ations is to learn to sense the difference between two or more movement options and discern which feels easier and is performed with less effort. This is compared with experiencing less fa vorable feedback such as pain, str ain, or discomfort. Participants are encour aged to try man y alternativ e movements to increase their awareness of distinctions and impro vements (Hillier & W orley, 2015). Because it promotes gentle mo vement within a comfortable r ange of motion, the Feldenkr ais Method is particularly effectiv e for older adults experiencing pain and stiffness from arthritis. It is taught in two par allel forms, A wareness Through Mo vement (conducted as a group ex ercise) and Functional Integr ation (one-on one approach) (W ebb et al. , 2013). Feldenkrais for Everyday Life (3:33) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCM_C0Ly0Dc&index=4&list=PLx83c- HVFBfA5quYOUCc3F0z4ox3K054- Single, r andomiz ed controlled studies of F eldenkr ais ex ercises ha ve reported statistically significant positiv e benefits compared to control interv entions and include the following impro vements: Impro ved neck flexion and less perceiv ed effort after a single F eldenkr ais lesson for neck comfort Feldenkr ais for E veryday Life Feldenkr ais for E veryday LifeReduced prev alence of neck pain and disabilit y in symptomatic women after Feldenkr ais, and Reduced perceiv ed effort in F eldenkr ais group for people with upper torso/limb discomfort (Hillier & W orley, 2015) In a small A ustralian study seeking to understand if participation in a F eldenkr ais progr am impro ved mobilit y and decreased pain in participants with osteoarthritis, feedback w as positiv e. Participants were ask ed to comment on their experience of pain and, in particular , the pain associated with their osteoarthritis after participating in the progr am. T en of the fifteen participants said their pain lev el had impro ved, three were unsure, and two said they had not noticed an y difference. Comments included \"The pain is continual, but I manage it better ,\" \"At the end of the session I w as free from pain and felt energiz ed,\" \"I can experience less pain in the knees, which is where the osteoarthritis appears for m y body,\" \"The lessons...eased the pain in m y lower back, \" \"No pain in the knees when going up stairs, \" and \"It is not a cure, howev er it is the best 'ex ercise' I ha ve experienced for managing m y osteoarthritis\" (W ebb et al. , 2013). Barriers to Effective Pain Management The [Institute of Medicine] committee [has] identified sev eral important barriers to adequate pain care in the United States. These include the magnitude of the problem, pro vider attitudes and tr aining, insur ance co verage, cultur al attitudes of patients, geogr aphic barriers, and regulatory barriers. Institute of Medicine, 2011 The complexit y of our fr agmented healthcare system creates significant barriers to effectiv e pain management in all areas of medicine and across all age groups. T reating pain in a system that is struggling to contain costs means better education and training, better interdisciplinary communication and cooper ation, and better reimbursement for pro ven treatment options are desper ately needed. According to the Institute of Medicine, treatment of pain is often disorganiz ed, ineffectiv e, and inaccessible. Man y members of the public, people with pain, and man y health professionals are not adequately prepared to tak e prev entive action, recogniz e warning signs, initiate timely and appropriate treatment, or seek specialt y consultation when needed (IOM, 2011).Costly , inappropriate, or inadequate procedures are sometimes carried out when other approaches\u2014such as counseling, prev ention, and self -management \u2014might be more appropriate. There is significant v ariabilit y among clinicians in applying new and ev en existing knowledge about pain and its management. This is reflected in the documentation of inappropriate\u2014or indeed lack of \u2014treatment for cancer patients, HIV/AIDS patients, and neonates, and post oper ative pain (Sessle, 2012). To address these barriers, the Institute of Medicine (IOM, 2011) has recommended: The inadequate education of healthcare professionals is a major and persistent barrier to effectiv e pain management. Despite the health professions' dev elopment of competencies in pain management, as well as the m yriad guidelines and position articles on pain management issued b y numerous professional bodies, core pain management competencies for pre-licensure, entry -level health professionals ha ve not y et been established. The limited pain education that is currently pro vided ma y be ineffectiv e because it focuses on tr aditional, impersonal topics such as anatom y and ph ysiology that may have little direct relev ance to the complex daily problems faced b y patients, families, and clinicians (Fishman et al. , 2013). The Institute of Medicine has stated that pain education is critically important and that the federal government is in a position to contribute to impro vements in patient and professional education about pain. The IOM recommends that the medical professionals (1) expand and redesign education progr ams, (2) impro ve curriculum and education for healthcare professionals, and (3) increase the number of health professionals with advanced expertise in pain care (IOM, 2011).Providers should promote and enable self -management of pain. 1. There should be easily accessible and cost -effectiv e educational opportunities in pain assessment and treatment in primary care.2. Collabor ation must be impro ved between pain specialists and primary care clinicians, including referr al to pain centers when appropriate.3. Reimbursement policies must be revised to foster coordinated and evidence- based pain care.4. Providers must pro vide consistent and complete pain assessments. 5.The American Academ y of P ain Medicine has echoed the IOM recommendations b y publishing a set of inter -professional core competencies for pain management, which are categoriz ed within four domains. These domains address (1) the fundamental concepts and complexit y of pain; (2) how pain is observ ed and assessed; (3) collabor ative approaches to treatment options; and (4) application of competencies across the lifespan in the context of various settings, populations, and care team models (Fishman et al. , 2013). Understanding of the phenomenon of pain, its immediate and long-term consequences, and its effectiv e management is lacking or is minimal in man y health science curricula, including those for nursing. This lack of knowledge and effectiv e translation into a usable form for pr actitioners r aises the following question: Do gr aduates ha ve sufficient knowledge and skills to be competent in giving appropriate pain management to their patients (Herr et al. , 2015)? Concluding Remarks on Pain Pain remains one of the great, unaddressed issues of modern societ y, particularly in poor countries. One of the great hopes of modern pain treatment, opioid analgesics, has led to an epidemic of o veruse and div ersion in some countries while at the same time being completely una vailable to those suffering from sev ere pain in other countries. Pain management policies ha ve been dev eloped b y a number of regulatory agencies, which provide v oluntary and mandatory guidelines about pain management in healthcare organizations. A balanced, multi-modal approach to pain and its management is a k ey concept for healthcare organizations and clinicians. Non-opioid, opioid, and adjuv ant analgesics are recommended for the treatment and management of pain. Howev er, opioid analgesics carry a high potential for misuse, abuse, and div ersion, ev en when prescribed for legitimate medical purposes, and clinicians must educate themselv es about these issues and understand that opioid analgesics ha ve the potential for misuse. Consistent assessment and documentation of pain using an individualiz ed approach is recommended b y a number of organizations. Clinicians should be familiar with a v ariety of pain assessment tools and understand the necessit y for regular assessment of pain based upon the needs of patient.In addition to analgesics, non-pharmacologic techniques are a vailable for the treatment of pain. Ph ysical and occupational ther apy, chiropr actic techniques, tr aditional medication, and complementary , alternativ e, and integr ative practices are popular and well-toler ated. Although evidence-based studies are limited, there is increasing evidence that man y of these techniques successfully decrease pain, and more research into these techniques is underw ay. The Institute of Medicine (2011) sums up the underlying principles related to effectiv e management and treatment of pain, which pro vides a fitting conclusion to this course: Pain is a mor al imper ative. Chronic pain can be a disease in itself . Comprehensiv e treatment is critical. Interdisciplinary assessment and treatment ma y yield the best results. Prevention is important. Existing knowledge must be used more widely . Opioids present a conundrum. The clinician-patient relationship is of utmost importance. Public health and communit y-based approaches are in valuable.
