Thanks for prompting me to check the local statistics, which I hadn't done for several months. Looks like in my county of a couple million people, people are dying from Covid at a rate of ~0.05 per day and are being hospitalized at a rate of ~0.2 per day. I suppose ~18 deaths per year is nothing to scoff at, but it's pretty low on my lists of concerns... People have really crap memories for day-to-day existing details. My theory for this is that we'd cause our brains to explode or die from embarrassment. Both of those are as valid as your observation, well probably more so, because the idea you have (or that you found) isn't new and has probably been responsible for some real damage to children by well meaning parents. [Is the Hygiene Hypothesis True?] No, it doesn't bode well at all. And I'd add selfishness to the list. There will be a \"next pandemic.\" And there's a high likelihood it will be more virulent than COVID. If we thought that COVID exposed weaknesses in our health care capacities, fragilities in our supply chain infrastructure, and instabilities in our sociopolitical order, then just wait until the next, significantly worse pandemic strikes. Without a swift and revolutionary change of collective consciousness and responsibility (and response-ability), we are in big trouble.Even if this is the last we see if COVID, the stunning levels of ignorance and stubbornness does not bode well for the next pandemic. I always advice nasal rinsing/douche if you are having trouble with colds/allergy turning into infections. It cleans away the pus/excess slime which also helps you sleep. It's also non intrusive and generally supported by surgeons/doctors (it's not some alternative medicine brainfart).Ever since my spouse gave us covid last december, I have struggled with complications from regular colds. They turn into ear infections. You are right in a sense. Anyone could have it without knowing. With a nearby infected passenger, no amount of super plane filtration (as claimed by airlines) will beat protecting yourself with a N95 or better respirator. The longer the flight, the sillier it'd be to just rely on the air recirculation to do a good enough job.Note to self: Whenever a person sitting in a nearby airplane seat is wearing a mask, assume they have covid, and immediately wear N95 no matter how long the flight is. Fool me once... Not a \"Covid lab.\" [A bunch of infectious agents (not just Covid) in a warehouse with some (mostly) live lab mice]. We don't know WTF it was all about. I think that's personal. I certainly know it happens, lots of people wh feel ill after a vacinne (same with flu), but nobody in our family (including our elderly mothers) had any adverse effect from vaccines (mRNA, astra and Johnson, among us we had all varieties).I've only gotten pfizer vaccines, but they tend to put you down for a day or two after you receive it. I've gotten fever and chills roughy 24 hours after each injection, going away a day later. hope you can schedule your trackside visit accordingly. and have the power to magnetically push max out of 1st place and pull a haas into a points scoring position Hard to underestimate the societal upheaval of the first waves of pox. That the majority survived does not change the lingering impact it had on our culture.Most of Europe today survived [smallpox]and [the black death]because of their genetics. And ebola is really, really hard to get. You need prolonged contact with a carrier and quite a bit of [exchange of bodily fluids]to get infected. Simple measures as social distancing, face masks and gloves and washing of hands seem to be enough to break the infection cycle. Do I hear an echo? Advertising.It's pretty weird that people confuse the flu with a cold. Except with the adenovirus vaccines, you don't want your immune system to \"latch on to\" to \"actual\" virus, which is the adenovirus, not the CVOID-19 spike protein.I was always on principle a bit more wary of mRNA. Simply because with an adenovirus vector, there is at least a real virus for the immune system to latch on to. (Of course in terms of side effects, the adenovirus vaccines turned out to be worse in the end.) I ended up getting two of one and one of the other... Unlike the mRNA vaccines, adenovirus vaccines deliver instructions by DNA. This difference means that when the DNA-based adenovirus vector is delivered to a cell, the DNA makes its way into the nucleus, where it serves as a blueprint to produce mRNA that is released into the cytoplasm. The mRNA is then used to guide production of coronavirus spike protein, which is ultimately processed by immune system cells to generate immunity... It is also important to realize that in addition to generating immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, it is likely that immunity is also developing against the adenovirus vector proteins. What this means over time if additional vaccines use the same vector remains to be seen. I was somewhat heartened to read about theNo, it doesn't bode well at all. And I'd add selfishness to the list. There will be a \"next pandemic.\" And there's a high likelihood it will be more virulent than COVID. If we thought that COVID exposed weaknesses in our health care capacities, fragilities in our supply chain infrastructure, and instabilities in our sociopolitical order, then just wait until the next, significantly worse pandemic strikes. Without a swift and revolutionary change of collective consciousness and responsibility (and response-ability), we are in big trouble. We are presented with two enormous challenges: The first is scientific--the challenge to virologists, epidemiologists, pharmacologists, and other medical professionals to predict and slow the spread of, and developing treatments for, arising threats. The second is sociopolitical--the challenge both to governments and to individuals to understand the nature of the problem and to behave responsibly. This second challenge is the one that seems insurmountable. Given the current levels of collective ignorance, stubbornness, selfishness, and divisiveness, even after the futile lessons COVID taught, the future looks bleak. I'll conclude with an anecdote. I contracted MRSA in the spring. Over a couple months' treatment and interactions with doctors, two doctors (in the course of explaining the difficulties of treating MRSA) told me of newly developing antibiotic-resistant bacteria for which there are no available treatment and for which any conceivable future treatment is unlikely before the hospitals and morgues overflow. Basically this was the message: if you think this MRSA is bad, the new germs are going to be way, way worse. So, given the lessons not learned from COVID, for those of you with the entrepreneurial spirit, if you're looking for a long-term profitable business to get into, get into the death business: mortuaries, morgues, crematoriums, refrigerated truck trailers, funeral homes, etc. People conflate a rhino virus with the Flu. I got the flu in 2018, suffice to say that after that \"fun\" experience I get my flu shots (courtesy of my employer).Flu is not the same as a cold. Regular flu is quite serious. It kills people. And in the uk, for 220,000 it was as bad as the worst possible flu. It killed them. Advertising. Here in the UK at least, pretty much every cold-mitigating substance is sold as being suitable \"for colds and 'flu\", and typically shows people who clearly have a head-cold. Over time people start to call head-colds \"flu\". Well, that's my theory anyway \"I really wish that a culture of \"wear a mask when you're sick\" had taken root in the USA. But if anything I've seen people rebel against any kind of collectivism.\"I still stay masked in enclosed public places. I really like not getting several colds per year like I used to, although working from home and more hand washing is probably contributing to that too. I really wish that a culture of \"wear a mask when you're sick\" had taken root in the USA. But if anything I've seen people rebel against any kind of collectivism. One piece of anecdotal evidence is that more people seem to be ignoring \"inconvenient\" road laws and signs compared to before the pandemic. People running red lights, using bike lanes to pass a queue of cars, taking more chances on intersections, and zooming onto roundabouts. The more shocking one I've seen is on a road that is being resurfaced and is thus is marked one way single lane. There's a large number of people ignoring that signage and weaving in and out of cones, blocking traffic with the right of way, and generally being an ass because they don't want to drive less than a mile out of their way. Pure selfishness. The thing about that is that if you have actual 'flu then you are not going to be 'getting on with your day'. You're going to be in bed, with zero possibility of getting out of it any time soon, watching the room spin around you, having fever dreams, and wondering how in God's name your hair hurts.Dayquil is one of these and from their description: \"DayQuil Cold & Flu Liquicaps temporarily relieve common cold & flu symptoms so you can get on with your day\" I don't think there's any COVID-19 vaccines that contain the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus, even in a weakened or dead state. It looks like COVID is here to stay and will periodically mutate to new variants. Hopefully the herd immunity nearly all share today will keep the virus at bay. It would also be nice if someone would develop a vaccine based on traditional technologies (i.e. weakened live virus) for those who, for whatever reason, are unwilling to take a jab of an mRNA based vaccine. As for being miserable, I'd invite you to check out the Long Covid Household Pulse Survey: [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/long-covid.htm] The actual disease was handled quickly and reasonably efficient. It didn't get close to ending society. That's not pooh-poohing the suffering, but we had a working vaccine in no time.No, it doesn't bode well at all. And I'd add selfishness to the list. There will be a \"next pandemic.\" And there's a high likelihood it will be more virulent than COVID. If we thought that COVID exposed weaknesses in our health care capacities, fragilities in our supply chain infrastructure, and instabilities in our sociopolitical order, then just wait until the next, significantly worse pandemic strikes. Without a swift and revolutionary change of collective consciousness and responsibility (and response-ability), we are in big trouble. You're aware that when you use the word 'jab' regarding vaccines you're basically telling the world your opinion is trash and should be tossed without regard directly into the closest sewer. Right? Ain't that the truth.And of course the \"Free-dumb\" vaccine refusers will not get that vaccine either, that was just an excuse for them and when that excuse went away, they found others. Think that might be your own prejudice or local customs at play there. Here in Scotland it was frequently referred to as either the 'jab' or the 'jag', without it being a pejorative. It's just what people round here say.You're aware that when you use the word 'jab' regarding vaccines you're basically telling the world your opinion is trash and should be tossed, without regard directly into the closest sewer. Right? \"Jab\" is a very common term in the UK and not different than calling it a \"shot\".You're aware that when you use the word 'jab' regarding vaccines you're basically telling the world your opinion is trash and should be tossed, without regard directly into the closest sewer. This is the logical outcome of adhering to an extremist philosophy. Communism did not work because human beings aren't computer components. We're now seeing that it's ideological opposite is just as harmful.\"I really wish that a culture of \"wear a mask when you're sick\" had taken root in the USA. But if anything I've seen people rebel against any kind of collectivism.\" Yep. And think about it. From day one--the first day out of the womb--we begin our lifelong indoctrination into egoistic exchange. Under American-style capitalism, we grow into a system in which selfishness and greed are deeply inculcated at the expense of compassion, love, and altruism. Selfishness becomes \"natural,\" while collectiveness requires an almost spiritual transformation and a laborious rejection of a lifelong indoctrination of valuing one's self extremely excessively over valuing the well-being of a community. I was not aware of that. I learned something today. In my experience in the US when I hear someone say 'jab' it's in the context of being anti-vax. I genuinely didn't know it was normal in other areas. Edited my comment because it makes me look like a dick.Think that might be your own prejudice or local customs at play there. Here in Scotland it was frequently referred to as either the 'jab' or the 'jag', without it being a pejorative. It's just what people round here say. It's all goodI was not aware of that.

Edited my comment because it makes me look like a dick. Adv vaccines may be new to the USoA, but they are more stablished in other parts of the world (as early as 2010 for japanese encephalitis) And if some USoAns did no like them, there were vaccines like protein agregates and attenuated virus outside the USoA, and the novavax protein subunit vaccine in the USoA, so, plenty of choice for those using the desire for \"more traditional vaccines\" as an excuse for not getting one.Oh lord, not this again. Adenovirus vector vaccines are not \"more traditional technologies.\" They're just as recent as mRNA. Before the Covid vaccines, the only adenovirus vector vaccine that the FDA had ever approved was one for Ebola and that was in (IIRC) 2019. Frankly it's not different in the US either. I have no idea about this supposed contextual distinction.\"Jab\" is a very common term in the UK and not different than calling it a \"shot\". You can find plenty of articles on the surge in respiratory illnesses that impacted our Healthcare system last fall, but all of the ones I found seemed to include one disease that does affect kids and has been shown to impact respiratory function more profoundly (its Covid, you forgot covid).I know you guys think you're all very smart, but isn't 2022 the year that our health care system was pushed to buckling by the flu and RSV? But please, go ahead and yammer on some more about the hygiene hypothesis or whatever. I already unmasked, as mask mandates in my country were withdrawn, and since I am 50, and given life expentancy in my country, i'll reach 26 vaccines (counting the initial 3 shoots + yearly boosters) by the time I die. Is the same for influenza (which I get yearly since I was 40) same with hep A (every 10 years) hep b (every 7) tetanus (every 10)... so... what was your point again?I hope you guys get your 26th booster and stay masked and locked down in your basement. It absolutely has to do with viruses, the article with the expert I posted went into detail about this.The Hygiene Hypothesis as such is more about allergies and auto-immune diseases than serious viral infections. That's not to say that there may not be other complex factors that impact our relationship with microorganisms. It could be, for example, that one is better off being exposed to small quantities of some virus often than to a large quantity occasionally. Or that catching a cold may sometimes engender some cross-immunity to Covid (see for example [https://www.bbc.com/news/health-59911257]). All in all, there may be reasons why many people think - and always have thought - that living under glass is not a good idea. Yes actual flu is no joke, not as you get a bit older. When you're young it's nothing, maybe a day or two of feeling \"under the weather\". After 40-50, it's painful, rough and takes a while afterwards to get back up to speed. I used to think annual flu shots were a bit silly and mostly employers trying to avoid paying for sick days - but now as my hair is going from grey to white (at 50 damn it) I really appreciate the good odds of getting through winter without flu...Yep. I've had actual 'flu a couple of times in my life and it's not even remotely like a cold, not even a bad cold. Now that I'm in my mid-50's I'm almost certainly going to start having annual 'flu shots. "}
