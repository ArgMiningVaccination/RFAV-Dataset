Providing the highest-quality healthcare throughout the communities we serve, regardless of socioeconomic status, geographic barriers, or health conditions, is our utmost priority. We are deeply committed to providing excellent, world-class patient care to the broad and diverse population we serve, in the neighborhoods where they live and work. NYU Langone takes great pride in improving and strengthening the health and quality of life of the underserved in New Y ork. We believe that all New Y orkers deserve equal healthcare, and it is our goal to provide one standard of care for all patients, no matter where they live. Our success is measured by the positive difference we make in people's lives, whether through innovative healthcare provided at one of our 350+ facilities across the New Y ork metropolitan area, science that underpins new treatments for disease, educating tomorrow's medical leaders, or intervening at the community level through outreach, education, and expanded access to the highest-quality care. 04Dear Friends, Message from the Dean and CEONYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn represents one of the best examples of how we improved healthcare for the underserved by transforming a community hospital into an excellent healthcare provider with the expertise to treat complex illnesses, and a vibrant component of a larger academic medical center. We pledged in 2016, when we merged, that \"we would bring the same level of care to southwest Brooklyn that patients receive at NYU Langone's top-ranked hospitals in Manhattan. \" Our goal was to achieve one standard of care for all patients within the NYU Langone system regardless of the location of care. By all measures, NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn is succeeding, and the emerging numbers tell a remarkable story. We track over 800 quality and safety measures as part of a continual effort to evaluate and improve performance. T oday, the hospital maintains one of the lowest mortality rates not just in Brooklyn, but in the nation. Its rate of hospital-acquired infections have plummeted 60% in the past three years, making it one of the safest hospitals in all of New Y ork City. Patients in its Emergency Department now receive care twice as quickly as they do at other Brooklyn hospitals. Inpatients not only go home faster than they do at nearly every other hospital in New Y ork City, but are also less likely to wind up back in the hospital within 30 days. We have invested millions in the Sunset Park, Brooklyn, campus, directing a significant percentage of those funds to human capital. Full-time faculty have replaced a predominantly voluntary physician workforce. Board- certified critical-care specialists now cover all of its intensive units 24/7 . A fully reimagined hospitalist program ensures that every medical unit in the 450- bed hospital is covered around the clock by one of 21 hospitalists, attending physicians who are dedicated solely to caring for hospitalized patients. The turnaround at NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn is all the more striking considering that it is located in a zip code and serves a community with more residents per capita on Medicaid than any other in the United States. We have successfully implemented our one standard of care for all patients goal in Brooklyn. From our research lab benches to our operating rooms, to public schools and community centers, NYU Langone is on the front lines of creating a healthier New Y ork. Our focus in the neighborhoods we serve is to identify and implement programs that result in better access to care and improved health literacy, and to initiate other interventions aimed at improving our neighbors' health and overall quality of life. In these communities, and in locations throughout the New Y ork metropolitan area, we are educating families to help prevent obesity; supporting mothers-to-be with prenatal care; organizing boot camps for new fathers; providing primary, dental, and eye care in New Y ork City public schools; designing Stop the Bleed programs to educate about basic lifesaving interventions; organizing food pantries; responding to health and viral epidemics through education and vaccinations; leveraging faith- based organizations to boost screenings for cancer and heart disease; and much, much more. Everyone at NYU Langone takes great pride in partnering with the communities our patients and staff call home. This report highlights the transformative community- focused efforts our organization has taken in the past year to further our commitment to achieve better health outcomes for all New Y orkers. Sincerely, Robert I.

NYU Langone has made unprecedented and transformative capital and resource investments toward improving the health of underserved communities. Focus on Brooklyn Living in the fourth-largest \"city\" in the country, bigger than Houston and on the heels of Chicago, Brooklyn's residents deserve healthcare that rivals or exceeds cities of comparable size, yet remains in touch with the roots and diversity of the community. NYU Langone's focus on expanding the footprint and access to services has transformed the landscape of healthcare in the borough. Of note, we have brought world-class faculty to Brooklyn, adding 100+ talented physicians, physician leaders, and researchers to the organization. All inpatient and outpatient sites are now live on one integrated electronic medical record. In June 2019, we opened the Perlmutter Cancer Center-Sunset Park, a state-of-the-art infusion and radiation oncology facility that provides Brooklyn patients with local, comprehensive cancer treatment. We have also opened a freestanding emergency department in Cobble Hill, with plans to open NYU Langone Cobble Hill in 2023, which will comprise a 160,000-square-foot freestanding emergency care center, outpatient ambulatory operation rooms, satellite Perlmutter Cancer Center, and much more. Patients have access to our Family Health Centers at NYU Langone, Faculty Group Practice locations throughout the borough, offering primary and specialty care and a Certified Home Health Agency. 08SERVING ALL NEW YORKERS Opened in June 2019, NYU Langone's Perlmutter Cancer Center-Sunset Park, is a state-of-the-art facility that offers comprehensive care and the most advanced forms of radiation therapy and infusion treatments, including chemotherapy, for all types of cancer and blood disorders. The center's convenient location makes it possible for residents of Brooklyn and Staten Island to have access to lifesaving screening programs and clinical trials.

Our program is the top performer in New Y ork State in terms of preventable readmissions for Medicaid beneficiaries (18% year-over-year reduction), and is the second-best-performing program in preventable ER visits (41% year-over-year reduction). These results underscore our commitment to serving the high-risk, high-need, and medically underserved patient population. Workforce Diversity We believe that promoting a diverse workforce allows us to best serve the communities of New Y ork City and beyond. Our commitment was recognized when, at the 2019 DiversityInc awards, NYU Langone Health was named a T op Hospital and Health System for our commitment to cultivating a diverse workforce.

In its initial year of operation, New Y ork's first school-based vision center at PS 188 provided prescription eyeglasses to nearly half ofthe 314 children who received routine eye exams\u2014with no out-of-pocket cost to their families. The school-based comprehensive vision center\u2014 the first of its kind in New Y ork State\u2014has prescribed eyeglasses to more than 140 students. The program was established in partnership with OneSight, a global nonprofit dedicated to removing barriers to vision care; the United Federation of T eachers; and New Y ork City's Department of Education and Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Vision services have recently expanded to nearby PS 329 and will be offered to additional schools in Brooklyn in the coming year.In a school-based health center, optometrist Mary Botelho, OD, evaluates the complete physical structure of the eye of a student, from the front to the retina at the back of the eye, using a slit lamp test which enables her to spot a variety of conditions that may require treatment or additional tests. Providing Care for All Patients in the Neighborhoods Where They Live and WorkSchool-Based Health Centers Family Health Centers at NYU Langone operate 41 school-based health centers in preschool, elementary, middle, and secondary schools\u2014one of the largest networks of its kind in the state\u2014for more than 20,000 children and adolescents. School-based health centers provide much needed primary and preventive physical and mental health services in preschool, elementary, middle, and secondary schools in high-risk areas. Having school-based medical resources means parents do not have to miss work and children do not have to miss school to access care. The majority\u201432 sites\u2014are in Brooklyn schools. Additionally, NYU Langone oversees six in Manhattan, one in the Bronx, and two on Staten Island. Combined, the clinics provide more than 42,000 medical visits, 19,000 behavioral health visits, and 25,000 dental visits annually.11Supporting Early Literacy at Home Over the next three years, ParentChild+ will support 120 families . Participating families will receiveParentChild+ is a national, evidence-based early literacy, parenting, and school-readiness program that supports families facing significant obstacles to school and life success, including poverty, low literacy, limited education, and language barriers. ParentChild+ was launched in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, to provide at-home education and literacy programming for low-income immigrant families with children between the ages of two and four years old. The two critical aspects of young children's early literacy\u2014social-emotional development and language development\u2014are challenged when a child lives in a home environment that is stressful, unpredictable, or unstimulating. ParentChild+ gives families tools to build positive parent-child verbal and nonverbal interaction and develop early literacy skills that are essential for school readiness. The ParentChild+ program provides intensive home visiting to participating families. A trained home visitor conducts two 30-minute home visits per week over a two-year period, in a family's home language. During the visit, the family receives books, toys, and other educational materials to support a language-rich home environment. NYU Langone Health in the Community2,160 Books8,280 Home visits 1,980 Educational toys Preschool children and their parents participate in the Sunset Park ParentChild+ program, an early literacy, at- home education program that encourages parents to talk, play with educational toys, and read aloud to their young children to support school readiness.12Reaching Veterans with Telemedicine for Mental Health The Steven A. Cohen Military Family Center (MFC) at NYU Langone was established in 2012 to help fill the gap in mental health services available to veterans and their families. The mission of MFC at NYU Langone is to provide free, accessible, and integrative evidence-based mental health care to veterans, reservists, and members of the National Guard, regardless of discharge status. In addition, the MFC offers treatment to military family members, including those of service members on active duty. In order to help overcome barriers to care throughout New Y ork State, the MFC offers mental health services via telemedicine to reach veterans where they are. T reatment is delivered via confidential and secure video directly to the veteran's or military family member's home. The T elemental Health Program provides care to military families who otherwise would not have access due to barriers such as psychiatric symptoms that deter people from leaving their home, distance from a local medical center, work schedules, and child care responsibilities. The program currently employs licensed psychologists in New Y ork, New Jersey, and Connecticut to provide individual therapy via telehealth. Employee veterans and family members proudly display a banner to celebrate the Steven A. Cohen Military Family Center at NYU Langone Health. The center provides confidential in-person or T elemental Health Program services for veterans and military families who are experiencing the long-term effects of all phases of military service and other life stressors. Providing Care for All Patients in the Neighborhoods Where They Live and WorkEffective Care for an Underserverd Population Approximately 20% of veterans returning home from deployment, especially those who served multiple tours of duty, experience some form of mental health issue, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, addiction, or a combination of these conditions. Since opening in 2012, the Military Family Center has provided mental health treatment to close to 2,400 veterans and family members. Data collected in this center show that patients have significantly lower symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression following treatment and report a significantly improved quality of life. 13Improving Cardiovascular Health in Mosques South Asian Americans and Arab Americans experience a high incidence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes due to various risk factors. Faith-based organizations and community-based organizations have played a critical role in improving the health of immigrant and minority communities. Health Insurance In addition to workshops on physical activity and chronic condition prevention and management, REACH FAR provided South Asian and Arab American communities in Brooklyn with direct health insurance enrollment to encourage the use of preventive care. Keep on Track A blood pressure screening and counseling program currently in four Brooklyn mosques. During the initial program, approximately 500 community members received blood pressure screening and counseling, and 25 mosque volunteers received training on how to continue the program at their respective mosques. As of today, the program continues to be sustained at all four locations where it was originally implemented.The NYU Center for the Study of Asian American Health coordinates REACH FAR (Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health for Asian Americans) Brooklyn, which aims to prevent cardiovascular disease among Asian Americans. REACH FAR partnered with mosques, social service agencies, and primary care practices in Brooklyn neighborhoods with large South Asian and Arab American communities to improve cardiovascular risk factors and promote healthy eating. T o date, REACH FAR has partnered with 10 mosques and several community-based organizations, with the goal to help community members manage risk factors such as obesity and hypertension. A community member gets a blood pressure screening and counseling on nutrition and physical activity through the REACH FAR Brooklyn Program, which aims to prevent cardiovascular disease in Asian American communities. REACH FAR works with a multisector partner coalition that includes community and faith-based organizations, clinical providers and pharmacists, and local businesses to increase access to healthy foods and culturally tailored health information. Nutrition Strategy A program to promote healthy eating at mosques. The program has inspired increased availability of nutritious food options during communal meals. NYU Langone Health in the CommunitySupporting New Parents The Center for Perinatal Education and Lactation at NYU Langone is proud to expand its comprehensive program of pre/postnatal childbirth education and breast-feeding support at the Tisch campus to the Brooklyn campus. In order to better serve the Spanish-speaking community, the Center launched prenatal breast-feeding classes, prepared childbirth education, and infant and child CPR classes in Spanish, utilizing native Latin American instructors. Online childbirth education options are now available in both Spanish and English. In addition, Ready, Set, Baby!\u2014our hospital information sessions on preparing for childbirth\u2014are offered in Chinese, Arabic, and Spanish, as well as in English. Breast-Feeding Caf\u00e9 \u2014Free support group at the Brooklyn campus in the heart of Sunset Park.

Emerging evidence indicates that e-cigarette use leads to cigarette smoking initiation and increased smoking intensity. T o prevent youth from initiating e-cigarette use, it is important to combat low-risk perceptions by raising awareness about the dangers of e-cigarettes. The NYU Ronald O. Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine's Prevention and Education Partnership (PEP) T alks provide education for youth in school settings, including a workshop in which doctors engage youth about e-cigarettes and share the latest evidence on the potential harmful and addictive nature of e-cigarette use. The PEP T alks curriculum is provided citywide.Focusing on Asian American Health This year, the Center for the Study of Asian American Health created the Asian American Community Education (ACE) Project to respond to the need for culturally adapted and linguistically relevant health education programs addressing health disparities in underserved, low-income Chinese American communities. The ACE team works with community-based organizations and senior centers in Manhattan's Lower East Side and Chinatown and in Brooklyn's Sunset Park. Because cancer is the leading cause of death among Chinese New Y orkers, the initial health education sessions focused on stomach cancer prevention, nutrition, physical activity, and healthy lifestyles, and incorporated adult and group learning strategies, such as demonstrations, games, role playing, and quizzes. Session topics have expanded to include oral health, fall risk, and sleep health. 15Larissa Laskowski, DO, from the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine's Prevention and Education Partnership (PEP) conducts an in- school workshop on the risks of vaping. PEP reaches out to kids to educate them and create innovative and inspiring programs so they can learn from their behavior and make healthy and safe choices. Staff at the Center for the Study of Asian American Health and NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn provide stomach cancer prevention and other health education sessions for at-risk Chinese Americans. The sessions are tailored to the needs of the community and are presented by bilingual community health workers in a culturally relevant manner. NYU Langone Health in the CommunityImproving Care for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder Through an ongoing partnership with the Department of Education, the New Y ork City Regional Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders (RCASD) trained more than 1,000 paraprofessionals on how to support children with autism spectrum disorder in community schools. The Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry brings research and practice together in community settings, providing evidence-based training and support for parents, caregivers, school personnel, and community healthcare providers at the Child Study Center, part of Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at NYU Langone. The Autism Spectrum Disorder Program in the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry's Child Study Center is a leader in clinical service delivery and community training in autism spectrum disorder. The providers, trainees, and staff deliver gold-standard care and have received recognition for programs that continue to expand and disseminate expert knowledge to the community. NYU Langone's Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry is proud to serve as the New Y ork City RCASD, part of a statewide network of university-affiliated programs to improve access to services and outcomes for youth with autism spectrum disorder. Through a grant from the New Y ork State Department of Education, the RCASD offers workshops, trainings, and technical assistance on autism spectrum disorder to all five boroughs of New Y ork City. Over the past year, the RCASD provided 32 workshops for parents, educators, and community service providers. 16 Expanding Access to Care through Education and Screening Samantha Busa, PsyD, at the Child Study Center works with children who have difficulty with social interaction and communication. The Autism Spectrum Disorder Program also connects children with other pediatric care, including speech- language pathology, neurology, physical and occupational therapy, and a wide range of other specialties.17 Approximately 100 NYU Langone Health employees engaged in a full-scale exercise for a mass casualty incident. The exercise included setting up decontamination zones and practicing procedures for decontamination. NYU Langone Health in the CommunityPreventing Falls through Fitness At NYU Winthrop, nurses and community health coordinators lead classes and conduct balance assessments to help older adults and vulnerable individuals prevent falls. T ai chi, recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as an effective approach for preventing falls, is offered to the community at NYU Winthrop. The program aims to reduce the risk of falls by improving balance, confidence, and muscular strength. Other benefits include increased calmness and an improved sense of well-being. Rebuilding Balance, a four-week fitness and strength- training class for senior adults, focuses on decreasing the risk of falls. Participants gain knowledge on risk factors inside and outside the home, body mechanics, and healthy lifestyle tips. Rebuilding Balance is a great resource to gain physical activity, increase personal safety, and engage with peers.Educating to Prepare for and Prevent Injuries Stop the Bleed Participants: NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn: 682 participants NYU Winthrop Hospital: 1,017 participants Stop the Bleed is a program designed to educate the community about basic lifesaving interventions. Participants in the program learn how to control bleeding with a tourniquet, gauze pack, or hemostatic agent. The information and skills will help save lives in catastrophic situations such as car accidents, mass casualty events, and active shooter events, because members of the community are usually present on the scene before first responders arrive. The Level 1 T rauma Centers at NYU Langone Health on Long Island and in Brooklyn provide this valuable program to community members and go out into the community to educate schools, community organizations, and government organizations. In addition to community education events to prevent injury such as Stop the Bleed, NYU Langone Health engages in extensive emergency preparedness activities. These activities span from developing response plans to practicing in tabletop drills to full-scale exercises to prepare employees to respond effectively in any type of emergency. In an enterprise-wide mass casualty incident exercise, a single day training exercise helped prepare employees across the health system to respond to a potential mass casualty incident.NYU Winthrop reached over 250 PARTICIPANTS with falls prevention assessments and education in the last year.A Different Approach to Primary Care The Family Health Centers (FHCs) at NYU Langone take an approach to primary care that addresses social and environmental factors affecting patient health. A patient's health is influenced by factors at the individual, interpersonal, community, organizational, and environmental levels. These social determinants of health must be addressed to provide patients with a full spectrum of care. For more than 50 years, the FHCs at NYU Langone have recognized the impact socioeconomic factors have in the overall health of the communities they serve. Screening for, addressing, and documenting social determinants of health within the context of the clinical care environment have the potential to improve patient and population health, decrease healthcare costs, and contribute to a growing body of evidence that may achieve policy goals of reducing disparities in access, quality, and health outcomes. 18CARING FOR THE WHOLE PERSON At its Family Support Center, the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone address food insecurity through screenings and referrals. The total amount leveraged for Sunset Park families from 2018-2019 was $2,250,320 IN BENEFITS with 832 FAMILIES enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). On average, households received an additional $225 PER MONTH for a total of $2,704 PER YEAR to address food insecurity. Clients of the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone receive emergency food resources from the grocery store-like food pantry called The Table, which provides nonperishable foods, fresh produce, and dairy products. Participants are also connected to a continuum of wraparound services and other benefits that will improve long-term food security, support family health and stability. Caring for the Whole PersonCreating a Single Stop for Support Through a partnership with Single Stop USA and the Robin Hood Foundation, FHCs' Family Support Center screens community members to determine eligibility for SNAP; Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); and Earned Income T ax Credit (EITC), and assists them in applying for these important benefits. The SNAP initiative is central to the FHCs' and NYU Langone's work to reduce barriers to care and address social determinants of health. Although the Family Support Center serves as the hub for this initiative, screening and/or enrollment is also being conducted across the organization. Providing Food at The Table Since its inception in April 2019 through June 2020, The T able has distributed 10,095 food packages totaling an estimated $443,435 worth of food to community households. The T able food pantry program was launched in the spring of 2019 at the FHCs' Family Support Center to provide additional emergency food resources to individuals and families in Sunset Park. Access to nutritious food was identified through screenings at primary care visits as a key social determinant of health affecting our patients. The T able was created in response to this need. The pantry works with the New Y ork City Food Assistance Collaborative, which selected the Family Support Center as an ideal partner based on our diverse, low-income client base with identified emergency food needs. The T able utilizes a \"client choice\" model, which allows clients to participate in choosing which foods they will take home. Conceptually similar to a grocery store, a full array of available goods are displayed and clients browse for what they want and need. Client choice pantries have been found to improve food security, self-sufficiency, and diet-quality outcomes, particularly when coupled with family support services such as counseling and referrals to other community resources. This model is designed to improve self-sufficiency\u2014as opposed to simply providing short-term assistance\u2014by addressing underlying causes of poverty. The T able is partnering with local businesses for food donations, including most recently the Brooklyn Grange, an urban farm located on the industrial waterfront in Sunset Park. 19The Family Health Centers at NYU Langone opened The Table to help address the problem of food insecurity among residents of Sunset Park, Brooklyn. The grocery-like pantry was created as part of a comprehensive initiative to improve overall community health. NYU Langone Health in the CommunityResponding to Health Epidemics Impacting Our Community Providing Vaccinations and Community Education: Measles Outbreak in NYC The year 2019 saw a historic outbreak of measles in the US, with more than 1,000 confirmed cases by midyear\u2014surpassing the total number in the last 25 years combined. This is especially shocking for a disease declared \"eliminated\" in the year 2000 by public health officials in the US, and one whose dangers are often underestimated. Measles can lead to hospitalization or even death, and it continues to weaken the immune system against other illnesses for two years postinfection. NYU Langone played a frontline role responding to the measles outbreak. Over the summer, NYU Langone 20ON THE FRONT LINES On the Front Lines Paulo Pina, MD, MPH, administers a no-cost vaccination for measles in a high- risk neighborhood. The MMR vaccine protects adults and children from this highly contagious virus, which can quickly spread through communities. partnered with a New Y ork City Council member and the New Y ork City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to provide measles vaccinations at no cost in nontraditional settings, such as churches and soccer fields, in high-risk neighborhoods. The successful vaccination pop-up events targeted individuals who might be vulnerable to the disease and are under- or uninsured. Hundreds of vaccines were provided. The 2018-19 measles outbreak was caused in part by a misinformation campaign touting the dangers of vaccines\u2014dangers that have been disproven by numerous scientific studies. The campaign was waged by national antivaccine advocates, who targeted groups thought to be vulnerable to these messages. They persuaded parents that the risks associated with the measles vaccine are greater than the benefits. In response to this, NYU Langone worked not only to provide vaccines and care, but also to educate the medical community and public more broadly. T o address misinformation among the public, expert physicians from NYU Langone engaged in a variety of media opportunities to share their expertise and debunk the cause of the epidemic. NYU Langone also hosted a forum on measles that was open to the public and featured city and state health commissioners and other leading experts. On September 3, 2019, the New Y ork City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene officially declared an end to the 2018-19 measles outbreak, which accounted for more than 650 cases in the five boroughs\u2014the most in New Y ork City in more than three decades.21 NYU Langone Health adapted to the emergence and surge of COVID-19 by developing testing centers geared toward addressing the disease. At various testing centers in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island, health professionals were available to administer diagnostic and antibody testing for patients. NYU Langone Health in the CommunityResponding to the Unknown: The Novel Coronavirus Before the news of the novel coronavirus was announced, NYU Langone was already working closely with city, state, and federal agencies to plan for all kinds of new health threats. NYU Langone staff regularly carry out drills to prepare for emergencies such as health epidemics and natural disasters. Once news of the coronavirus emerged, enterprise-wide drills specific to the disease and daily site-specific preparations began in earnest. As our system started to see an influx of patients with COVID-19, interdisciplinary teams launched plans to expand surge capacity, from converting space to add inpatient beds to redeploying staff to critical areas, and to develop infection-control procedures aligned with federal and state guidance. During the COVID-19 pandemic, NYU Langone Health focused its mission toward responding to the emerging health needs of our community. There are numerous areas across the institution where our staff's care and commitment to our patients allowed us to provide the highest levels of safe and appropriate care.From Zero to Thousands\u2014Testing On-Site T o meet the challenges of the novel coronavirus, NYU Langone determined that it was necessary to test patients on-site for the COVID-19 virus. Once testing capability was approved for COVID-19, our campus ramped up testing from zero to thousands within weeks. T esting sites were opened across our campuses, and laboratory capabilities and work flow were scaled up to meet the need to provide safe patient care and protect our employees. In addition to patients and employees, NYU Langone also offered testing to New Y ork City police sergeants and New Y ork City firefighters on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. In Brooklyn, the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone partnered with New Y ork State to open a community- based testing site for all community members beyond our patient population. Outreach was conducted in multiple languages and with community-based organizations to ensure that testing was made available to high-risk populations.22 On the Front LinesTelehealth Video Visits Offer Alternative to Office Visits T o help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus and support social-distancing measures, NYU Langone Health ramped up support for telehealth for a variety of clinical conditions. The rapid expansion of telehealth video visits proved to be especially valuable for elderly patients, who are at high risk for COVID-19. Investing in this infrastructure throughout the spread of COVID-19 across the New Y ork metropolitan area allowed NYU Langone to provide our patients with both urgent and routine care that might normally require an in-person visit. Connecting Patients and Families With no visitors allowed at the bedside, clinical and support staff are the only sources of human contact for many patients with COVID-19. T o provide further comfort to patients and their families, NYU Langone Family Connect launched to keep the lines of communication open between patients and family members. By leveraging clinical staff and medical students as family liaisons, the program was able to make daily calls to provide detailed clinical updates to the family members of COVID-19 patients, who could not be at the bedsides of their loved ones. These efforts improved patient care as well by lightening the load for care teams on the floors. Early Graduation Allows Medical Students to Join the Front Lines In April 2020, 52 students at NYU Grossman School of Medicine graduated more than a month early to join the front lines of patient care in the hospital. NYU Grossman School of Medicine was the first medical school in the nation to offer early graduation to fourth-year medical students to help treat people with COVID-19. The remarkable group of students, who have all completed their graduation requirements, answered the call to join the workforce early, as interns in NYU Langone's Departments of Internal Medicine or Emergency Medicine.Exploring New Ways to Prevent and Treat COVID-19 While the COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges to our health system and society, it also brings scientific challenges and opportunities. NYU Langone clinical research teams are dedicated to providing innovative ways to prevent and treat COVID-19 as quickly as possible. Researchers have looked to develop and adapt interventions to improve patient care and to rapidly assess and communicate early benefits. One notable clinical trial will examine whether blood plasma from recovered patients, including many NYU Langone Health employees, contains immune cells that can boost helpful immune defenses in patients with severe disease. Another trial is investigating whether the antiviral compound remdesivir can be effective in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Further, NYU Grossman School of Medicine has been selected by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to join the network of Vaccine T reatment and Evaluation Units (VTEUs). Through the VTEUs, NYU Langone has collaborated with major pharmaceutical companies to launch two COVID-19-related clinical trials, one for the development of a vaccine and one to test an antibody therapy. A primary focus of clinical research has been on keeping participants safe while also advancing patient care through testing new therapies.Resourceful medical students fired up their own PPE factory. T o augment critical supplies of personal protective equipment, NYU Grossman School of Medicine students transformed a conference room into a minifactory to assemble thousands of face shields. For students who were not ready to graduate early, this was a valuable way to contribute to the needs of the front line.23 NYU Langone Health in the CommunityTracking the Spread of a Pandemic Researchers at NYU Langone have traced the start and spread of the novel coronavirus locally in New Y ork City, as well as in cities across the US and globally. Research on the spread of the disease can help public health officials provide real-time recommendations to slow the spread of the virus and to determine which measures have the best chances of stopping the spread. Developed by researchers in the Department of Population Health, the City Health Dashboard, an online resource with community-level health, social, and economic data for 750 cities across the US, has created a tool that can anticipate which communities could be most susceptible to the pandemic. Additionally, researchers are exploring the myriad ways that COVID-19 is affecting diverse and vulnerable populations, from those impacted by homelessness, substance use, and the criminal justice system, to those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and other noncommunicable diseases. Researchers are also investigating disparities in risk and outcome by race, ethnicity, age, gender, and income, and ways that resources and responses can be tailored effectively to serve high-risk populations. Addressing Food Security during a Pandemic The T able food pantry, a new initiative of the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone, remained open throughout the crisis when many other pantries closed their doors. The T able responded to higher community need by increasing the number of volunteers and fundraising efforts, and further modified service to ensure safe pickup and delivery of groceries. In a unique collaboration, The T able also partnered with the hospital to provide groceries to recently discharged COVID-19 patients in Brooklyn. Overall, The T able experienced an 853.6% increase in food packages distributed from February 2020 (pre-COVID) to June 2020. Additionally, the Department of Population Health's Community Health Workers (CHWs) served an important role in supporting vulnerable individuals and families with access to food, among other types of assistance. CHWs are embedded in diverse communities throughout New Y ork City and serve as a bridge between healthcare and other systems and the communities. During COVID-19, CHWs across various programs enhanced their roles to focus on navigating community members through complex systems and new barriers to accessing food, child care, medication refills, health insurance, and unemployment benefits. Fundraising for Employee Relief COVID-19 has presented unprecedented challenges, including the financial burden experienced by many individuals. NYU Langone's Employee Relief Fund was established to benefit employees, students, and trainees who, as a result of COVID-19, are experiencing financial hardship. Our board chairman, Kenneth G. Langone, launched this fund with the backing of our Board of T rustees in order to support those with unforeseen financial hardship. NYU Langone Health professionals assembled a panel of experts, and in early March 2020 held a T own Hall for faculty and staff, as the COVID-19 pandemic was emerging and little was known about the deadly novel coronavirus. Faculty shared information about infection control practices to protect staff and patients.Investing in Our Community's Future NYU Langone's main campus in Manhattan is the first in the world to achieve both PEER and LEED Platinum certification. NYU Langone Health is doubling down on our existing commitment to quality care through environmental leadership.
