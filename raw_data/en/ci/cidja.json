Of course, it can always be a challenge to make sure the latest thing in nutrition and health is all that the trends make them out to be. Wellness shots are definitely worth your attention. These are not simple fad drinks. Wellness shots are based on sound nutrition and research. But what exactly are wellness shots? What is in wellness shots? What are the real health benefits of wellness shots? And can wellness shots really boost your immune system? This guide will provide you with answers and explain the elements of wellness shots. And we will provide emphasis on how wellness shots can boost your immune system. What is a wellness shot? Wellness shots are simply condensed and concentrated cold-pressed juices. All the nutrients and health benefits of cold-pressed juices are concentrated in a small quantity, so they can be consumed easily and quickly. Wellness shots are specifically designed to increase your immune response and boost the natural processes that provide you with the immune response. Since wellness shots are concentrated, they do not present the risk of bloating that can come with drinking full glasses of cold-pressed juices. Simple ingredients like apple cider vinegar and tart cherry juice create a powerful nutrition lift, and this is what makes wellness shots so different from other health supplements. Wheatgrass, ginger, and simple cayenne pepper provide tremendous benefits in a simple and easy-to-consume wellness shot. Many of us have found pre-made wellness shots in health food stores or even in the supermarket. You can make your own wellness shots if you have a juicer, but real wellness shots are concentrated forms of the juices you make at home. These provide intense levels of nutrients and natural immune-supporting chemical compounds in the small quantity of juice. What does a wellness shot do? Wellness shots provide a concentrated dose of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. By giving your body what amounts to a high-dose multivitamin in a natural form, you provide a natural boost to your entire metabolism and your immune system. Wellness shots will do various things depending on what type of wellness shot you take. Some of the most common wellness shots include: Turmeric Turmeric has been a powerful ingredient in smoothies for a long time.

Used as a medicinal herb around the world for centuries, recent medical research on the active ingredient in turmeric, curcumin, has shown that turmeric provides tremendous anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects which help the immune system. Lemon, Ginger, and Cayenne All three of these ingredients are time-tested remedies for common ailments. Cayenne contains capsaicin, which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. The vitamin C in lemon boosts immunity, and ginger is a powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. The combination of these three ingredients can fight disease, boost immunity, and reduce the uncomfortable and even painful symptoms of a number of common illnesses. Wheatgrass Wheatgrass sounded strange when it first began to catch on, but it has become a staple in many juice bars. Wheatgrass shots can be found almost anywhere these days. It also contains large quantities of vitamins A, C, and E. This combination provides a jolt for the immune system, and it operates as a powerful antioxidant.

Apple cider vinegar can also work as an antimicrobial agent, thus working with your immune system to fight illness. Apple cider vinegar is extremely acidic and can damage your teeth. It is best to mix the apple cider vinegar with other things to dilute its acidity. Tart Cherry Juice Tart cherry juices contain high quantities of vitamins A, C, and K. Together, things provide a powerful lift to the immune system by decreasing inflammation and boosting your nutrient levels. Tart cherry juice also naturally contains melatonin, which is a natural sleep aid. Healthy and restful sleep is actually an important part of immune system maintenance. Wellness shots health benefits Antioxidants Antioxidants are naturally occurring chemical compounds that neutralize and eliminate free radicals in your system. Free radicals are chemical compounds that effectively break natural chemical bonds at the cellular level. This leads to a variety of health problems like chronic inflammation and even cancer. By giving your body a healthy dose of antioxidants in the form of a wellness shot, you can interrupt the damage done by free radicals before you suffer the health consequences. Nutrition Boost Many people have taken to drinking natural cold-pressed juices for breakfast over more conventional breakfast options. This is because fresh juices provide tremendous levels of nutrients without things like cholesterol, unhealthy fats, and excess salt. Fresh juices are loaded with nutritional content. But sometimes people simply want the nutrition without the filling effect of a fresh juice. Wellness shots essentially provide the same levels of nutrition in a concentrated form.
