I worked at a large psychiatric hospital in Amersfoort, the intake department. We did not remain only at the level of a functional meeting. Karel immediately distinguished himself by his versatility, inexhaustible scientific interest and personal interest in the other person. Fairly quickly he saw opportunities to use information from our intake department for his life-event research (1986). We then went our ways. I followed Karel from a distance; I had meanwhile become an Inspector Mental Health Care. But our contact remained. We shared our mutual interest in the profession and our personal interest in each other. Karel's palette of skills and abilities increased all the time. When after my retirement in 2004 I started working as a freelancer in forensic psychiatry for reporting, we met again more frequently. He had developed into a prominent forensic psychiatrist in the Netherlands, with a chair at Tilburg and a wide range of circuits for the distribution of knowledge, of which also this book of miniatures -which Karel calls 'snippets'- is evidence. Once more it is an image of warm affection and concern, as we have come to know him. Karel, I hope that you, together with your wife, will be able to look back on your richly checkered career for many years in good health. We all know that you will remain active for the time being, albeit in a slightly different way, and fortunately for us we will still meet and continue our never-ending dialogue. 1 Guus Gerssen, MD, psychiatrist, Former Director of Treatment Psychiatric Centre Nijmegen, Former Inspector Mental Health Care Gelderland.3FOREWORD Erik Bulten1 Snippets, that is the term Karel Oei uses for some of his many contributions to psychiatry in general and forensic psychiatry in particular. Snippets, also called cuttings, chips, bits, fragments or tiny pieces. The fact that Karel published his contributions to the professional and scientific debate as 'snippets' strikingly characterizes his modesty. And that whereas these short texts are often literary gems with interesting (forensic) psychiatric reflections. All these 'snippets' also represent Karel's versatility as a forensic psychiatrist. These snippets provoke the urge to piece these tiny bits together, to link them. In that sense, the challenge that these snippets pose does Karel justice. His ability and his need to connect are after all great. Of course, Karel is a fine psychiatrist, and it goes without saying that he is an expert in the field of forensic psychiatry. Certainly, Karel has 'fatherly' supervised many PhD students towards the academic apotheosis of defending their theses. It is indisputable that Karel, as a true and experienced psycho- analyst, has produced splendid visions of patients and social processes. No one can deny that Karel is an amiable man and a fine colleague. All this is true, but first and foremost Karel is a connector, an all-rounder, building bridges between people, colleagues, between science and practice, between student and teacher, between head and heart, between empiricism and subjectivity, between disorder and offence. Thus you have brought quality to your chair. The 'Oei-snippets' are fine and tangible results of Karel's professional and scientific work. The other results, intangible, of Karel's liaison work are, if possible, even more impressive expressions of his 'provisional' heritage. Karel continue his work, albeit in a slightly different form. Karel, many thanks for your professional and academic input, the interesting and thought-provoking conversations and your incentives to build bridges. 1 B.H. Bulten, PhD is Head of Diagnostics, Research and Training of the Pompe Foundation, Nijmegen and senior researcher of the Academic Centre Social Sciences (ACSW, Academic Centre of Social Sciences ) of Radboud University Nijmegen. 5FOREWORD Jaap Ubbels1 Karel Oei is one of the last, if not the last, in a relatively long line of psychoanalysts who became professors in one of the branches of psychiatry or clinical psychology. His retirement marks once more the gradual disappearance of psychoanalysis from academia. In the 1960s Karel and I were both fascinated by the psychiatry classes of Professor P.C. Kuiper of the Municipal University of Amsterdam. We were not the only ones: at the time, Piet Kuiper had a tremendous influence on medical students, psychiatric assistants, and a wide range of other interested parties. His 'neurosis theory' of 1966 resonated not only with the professional psychiatrists and psychologists but also expressly with those who provided spiritual care. In his valedictory address, Karel gave Piet Kuiper the attention he deserves. Among ourselves we sometimes speak, somewhat jokingly but also seriously, about us being 'the Kuiper generation'. Various more or less obvious factors gradually reduced Kuiper's aura which we so overpoweringly felt in the 1960s. In the 1970s and in the 1980s it resulted in a counter flow, certainly where psychiatry was concerned. Internationally, the standing and influence of psychoanalysis has decreased, but in most countries around us, psychoanalysis has not been so fundamentally eradicated from the academic world as in the Netherlands. The spirit of the times has changed; people make higher demands on the empiricism of scientific research. Perhaps it is better to ask why the ideas that were so dominant in a specific period survive the spirit of the times than why they are replaced by others. Nevertheless, the question of what went so wrong between psychoanalysis and the university continues to nag us. The psychoanalytical situation is after all a unique domain of experience. Although it is far from easy to account for the uncertainty, ambiguity, and diversity of this domain, it remains a unique source of ideas. That is why there is wide social interest in psychoanalysis, even if it often has a slightly negative image. It becomes clear why in his valedictory address Karel touched upon one of the most important causes of the alienation between psychoanalysis and the university: the psychoanalyst is a philosophically-minded clinician. By its nature, psychoanalysis is hard to fit into the experimental and evidence-based paradigm of responsible medical actions, preferably laid down in a protocol or guideline. Psychoanalysis on the other hand pre-eminently confronts us with philosophical questions. 1 Jaap Ubbels, MD, Training analyst and supervisor (of psychoanalysis of children and adults), and former Chairman of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society.PERSONAL SNIPPETS6It is regrettable that psychoanalysis is occupying such a minor place within the life sciences. In philosophy, there is still considerable interest in psychoanalysis, for instance by psychoanalytical authors like Cavell, Green, Lacan, and Kristeva. Conversely psychoanalysis has perhaps profited little from what philosophy has to offer. However, the tide is turning: more and more psychoanalysts are looking for the answers to unresolved clinical questions in philosophy, which brings us back to our master Piet Kuiper, who had philosophical schooling. Eighteen months ago, Karel contacted me to find out whether at Tilburg University research could be done into the clinical importance of the change processes in psychoanalytical ideas. There is no denying that, for nearly a century, psychoanalysis - with ups and downs - has been directional in the practical work of mental health care. Moreover, the exact conceptual world of the Dutch psychoanalysts of the 1950s, 60s and 70s has never been described. Internationally they were highly regarded, and they exercised enormous influence on the psychoanalysts they trained - like Piet Kuiper enormously influenced his students. That influence was so strong (and the dominance of this group retained the authoritarian characteristics that large groups had rebelled against, even after the students' revolt of 1968) that it produced a strong counter flow. Today the frenzy seems past, but the aversion of this dominance not entirely gone. Generation changes are always difficult, but in the world of psychoanalysis with its strong mutual dependence, intertwined projections and laborious changes in positions of power, the natural life cycle must sometimes gave way to destructive rigidity, in which tensions can only be released explosively. Karel and I have both been witness to this. Explosive releases lead to revolutionary rifts, but perhaps the feeling of continuity can be recovered. In one conversation we had on this subject Karel pointed out that the retention of the identity of the professional group is linked with the understanding of the Leitmotiv in the many changes. The Leitmotiv which brings the realization that one has been occupied with the same thing under changing circumstances and in a changing society. What would be the basic points of departure if the effects of that Leitmotiv could be traced in the course of time? The first point of departure which, for want of a better term, I will call 'Dutch psychoanalysis' is a good understanding of Freud's essentially new, and in its time revolutionary urge theory, and of Van der Leeuw's meta psychology. A second point of departure is giving meaning clinically to the development of the emotional life of young children (Lampl-de Groot, Frijling-Schreuder, Van der Leeuw, Treurniet). The third point, elaborated by a group more or less opposed to the psychoanalysts mentioned above, is the meaning of the Ego split in clinical manifestations like depersonalisation and narcissism (Le Coultre, Spanjaard). Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell7In formulating these points of departure, I did not mention Kuiper. The direction in which he developed was that of phenomenological hermeneutics, a topic of international importance in the 1970s and 80s, but which appears to have lost most of its appeal since then, and which never found a large following in the Netherlands apart from Antoine Mooij, who wrote his PhD under Kuiper's supervision. Those trained by Piet Kuiper often retain vivid memories of how he advocated listening carefully to the patient's story, and to the hidden meanings and the psychic reality that are expressed in that story. Dear Karel, in your 'snippets' you show how close to your heart psycho- analysis is and how the questions raised by psychoanalysis occupy you. I wish you many healthy, creative, and fruitful retirement years. Let us not miss the chance to record something that has meaning and value.9TESTIMONIAL David N. Weisstub1 The career of Prof. Karel Oei should be properly placed within the history of the illustrious accomplishments of Dutch forensic psychiatry. This specialization has had a particular history in Holland and distinguished itself over a period of decades in providing a unique circumference among varied approaches to the difficult population located in forensic institutions. In Holland, in the post-war years, there was a pronounced humanistic and liberal impulse which created the most progressive forensic institutions in Europe and outstanding in the world community at large. If one could depict, in a nutshell, the distinctive Dutch reality, it could be described as humanism tempered with science. In the history of the International Academy of Law and Mental Health (IALMH), the Dutch professors of forensic psychiatry as a group who were founders of this Academy, Profs. Zeegers, Beijaert and De Smit, were all sympathetic to psychoanalysis but not at the expense of utilizing available tools in group or family models for specific issues. As a community, they were notably tolerant and empathetic in a way that was not demonstrable in the attitudes found among forensic directors and professors in less progressive environments. Forensic expertise achieved a very high level of competence in the world renowned institutions for which Holland has been noted, such as the Pompe Kliniek and the Pieter Baan Centrum. Equally, certain treatment centers such as the Dr. H. van der Hoeven Hospital and the Dr. S. van Mesdag Kliniek had far reaching impacts on forensic centers elsewhere. Prof. Oei has had close relations with all of the aforementioned. Prof. Oei has been a beacon in his generation of combining important clinical work and forensic research. During the past 20 years, through his chair in forensic psychiatry at Tilburg University, it should be said that Karel Oei has had a leading role in research within the Netherlands. He has been present for the last decades at all the major gatherings in forensic psychiatry 1 David N. Weisstub is the Philippe Pinel professor of legal psychiatry and biomedical ethics at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al . He is the honorary life president of the International Academy of Law and Mental Health , and the editor-in-chief both of its International Journal of Law and Psychiatry and of Springer 's International Library on Ethics, Law and the New Medicine . He sits on the editorial board of the Journal of Ethics in Mental Health . He has been made a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in France, a Knight of the Order of the Dutch Lion , and Grande Ufficiale in Italy. PERSONAL SNIPPETS10internationally and, along with his co-researchers since the early 90s, has been central to the IALMH Congresses. What is especially interesting about Prof. Oei, has been his intimate connection to his PhD students who have pursued a large array of topics which were revealed in presentations and subsequent publications on psychopathy, psychotrauma, responsibility in criminal law, incest, sexual criminality, child murder, impulsive aggression, empathy in criminality, profiling of child personality traits, penitentiary care, the history of the health care inspectorate, psychotherapy in prison, TBS and personality disorders, and the nature of expertise presented to tribunals in the Netherlands. At the personal level, Karel Oei has emulated a subtle combination in the harmonization of values between Buddhism and the Judeo-Christian tradition. He is deeply aware that, without self-exploration, forensic treatment is a doomed enterprise. As a chief-duty doctor at the van der Hoeven Kliniek for 25 years, we can be assured that he was an integral part of how that institution fought against the odds to redeem the untreatable. I cannot help to think of Dr. Oei in the matter of a congregation which I helped to organize with the relevant Dutch Ministries in the late 1980s. Three dozen odd medical directors were brought from the Eastern-European countries in the early stages of emancipation from the forensic Soviet yolk to view Dutch institutions at close hand. We came from the Foreign Ministry in The Hague to visit the van der Hoeven Kliniek. The head of the Bulgarian delegation was alarmed at the expenditures made by the government on behalf of the comfort of the patients and, along with colleagues from other centers from the east, confronted me with the idea that liberalism in that institution had reached a level of indulgence that bordered on the perverse. In responding, I said forthrightly that there is an expression in English that one has to take the good with the bad. I added that what I had seen in certain institutions in the then Soviet Union for me amounted to taking the bad with the bad. Here, I said, we have the extraordinary burden of taking the good with the good, with all that that entails. In my view, Prof. Oei's contributions symbolize the commitments made in the heyday of the van der Hoeven Kliniek. I do not regard Prof. Oei as a luxury item. He remains the justification for the profession of forensic psychiatry. Working and researching for a 40 year long career, Prof. Oei is obviously not ready to give-up on improving our knowledge about mental disorder and how it is created by a multitude of forces. Unlike many other forensic experts, he is not prepared to hide behind legal jargon and to become a passive transmitter of legal causation concepts to pass over what he knows to be true from a clinical point of view. On the contrary, he is the kind of clinician who asks of himself and co-workers to participate in living through the life-cycle of human suffering and trauma that give rise to social deviancy. In this way, Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell11he is a model within the Dutch humanistic tradition. Furthermore, in the areas of empirical research, he has been reluctant to bend in the direction of the persuasion of the pharmaceutical industry on the one-hand and on the other, the tunnel-vision of intimidating empirical research that turns-out to be insensitive to clinical awareness of where the real problems lie. There are many pressures currently to turn clinicians away from patients. The political mood, in most of the industrialized countries, has been committed to finding economic efficiency as the arbiter of what is appropriate for forensic interventions. Undoubtedly, Prof. Oei has inspired a generation of his students to resist these tendencies and to seek every means possible to consolidate their voices to become effective in looking after a population of handicapped, traumatized, depressed, and socially isolated individuals. Prof. Oei, in his legacy, asks of us that we should thoroughly investigate on an ongoing basis the motivational factors that influence the structure and nature of scientific research and the political dimensions that are attached to these pursuits. In his valedictory address, as the outgoing Tilburg professor in forensic psychiatry, he emphasizes the need for us to be in touch with the subconscious, indeed not to abandon it in the name of a positivistic science. He treats, in this address, the infliction of the psychopathology of power. In fact, forensic psychiatry carries with it a great deal of power and its intoxication feeds a similar dynamic to the dissociative and narcissistic patterns that are part of political life. By analogy, the politics of forensic psychiatry demand of mental health workers that they investigate in an unceasing dialogue among themselves and, in their interaction with patients, their capacity for empathy and belief that is possible to reveal psychological truths, both for treaters and patients, in our journeys towards human improvement. Prof. Oei asks of us not to lose sight of the rehabilitative ideal. In this way, he is a nobleman among his predecessors whose mentorship he has passed to the next generation of his students and colleagues. For this, Tilburg University and Holland can be justly proud. 13JUSTIFICATION FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY IN A NUTSHELL In this collection, the reader will find, more or less in chronological order, articles addressed to members of the profession. They are a kaleidoscope of ideas, opinions, suppositions, and outpourings such as a psychoanalyst and professor of Forensic Psychiatry may have. I wrote them to communicate with friends and colleagues and as teaching material. They were published in a bulletin ( Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society) , a regional newspaper ( Brabants Dagblad ), a paper about euthanasia in Holland with Ardaan P. de Boer, MD PhD in The Journal ( Tijdschrift voor Psychiatrie, (Forensisch Psychiatrische Snippers) (lately of 2011), and two papers about forensic causality, and psychoanalytic treatment respectively. The remaining texts were simply messages 'among ourselves'. That is why they are personal snippets. Now that I have reached the end of my academic career at Tilburg University I am pleased to distribute them, as a token of appreciation for the support I received from various people. Most colleagues are post-docs, PhD students, researchers, clinicians, and friends. In particular I want to mention Dick Dondorp with whom I served for well over eight years on the Supervisory Board of FPC Oldenkotte (TBS Clinic), and with whom it is always a pleasure to compare notes. Finally a thank you to my publisher Ren\u00e9 van der Wolf of Wolf Legal Publishers , with whom it has been my pleasure to cooperate since 2000, and Guus Gerssen, MD, psychiatrist, Erik Bulten, PhD, psychologist and last but not least Jaap Ubbels, MD, child and youth psychiatrist and psychoanalyst (to children and adults) each for their forewords, to Wim C.M. Gelens, MA and Carel V. de Bl\u00e9court, MD PhD for their editorial support, to Gert Mulder for the Tilburg University15ART, LIFE, AND HAPPINESS1 T.I. Oei An artist must in his work be like God in his creation: invisible and omnipotent - he must be sensed everywhere and seen nowhere. Gustave Flaubert, 1852 Not a single artist is ahead of his time. He is his time - others are behind. Martha Graham, 1979 (famous choreographer). I had to think of these statements when I read two very instructive interviews with Fran\u00e7oise Hardy and Alex Klaasen, 31 October 2009 , NRC/Handelsblad and Volkskrant Magazine . Two completely different artists. One a well-known singer/songwriter in the 1960s, the other a modern actor/cabaret performer. I quote some answers from both interviews (FH 65 yrs old, AK 33 yrs old) You take life seriously. FH: 'That is spirituality: life is an initiation. We are on this earth to learn. By trial and error. In the incarnation that I am now finishing, I am on this earth to learn things about passion, which is a first step towards universal Love. I suffered a lot in that respect. And suffering leads to reflection, analysis. About love I have come to understand a thing or two.' What? 'Your subconscious always makes you feel attracted to a person whose problems complement your own. I read somewhere that a relationship is a network of neuroses. That is correct, absolutely.' Have you learnt to manage this? 'Hard to tell. Not long ago, it happened to me that someone released something in me. It struck me then that this unrest still releases the same painful inhibitions in me, in spite of everything I have come to understand about love.' Love is never peaceful? 'It depends on which love you mean. When I felt attracted to a man I never knew whether it was desire or love. To me the two are inextricably linked. Desire comes from distance. It took me a long time to understand that. I have never been confident that mutual feelings will persist. Most people feel that everything is settled as soon as it is mutual. The fear that everything passes keeps the desire alive. Very complex. You want desire without torment. But without torment the desire will fade.' You never mentioned it all those years? AK: 'No, for it had given me a bad feeling for a long time. I did fall in love with boys, but I always saw to it that 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society , 2009, 24, 10, pp. 228-229.PERSONAL SNIPPETS16I became such a boy's best friend. I never got further than that. They always were non-mutual, unrequited loves. Still, in a certain way, I had the feeling that I had some kind of relationship with such a boy; I was in love after all. I developed something then that caused me a lot of trouble in my later love life.' Always impossible loves. 'For a long time, I fell for straight guys as well. And later for gays, with whom it was not mutual, but I carried on for a long time because I thought: \"But it's what I feel, isn't it?\" I thought it was enough to be in love on my own. Which is sad, of course. That you feel it is enough if you can cycle along with a person going home. Once I kept this up for four years.' Have you got a boy friend now? 'No.' Have you ever had a partner? 'No, not for long. The longest was a couple of months, I think. I am not very good at it. As soon as someone gives me the feeling that he is starting to like me, I am gone. It scares me when someone really wants me. I don't know, I find it oppressive. I am always looking for ways of escape ... It is not so much unattainable loves, I rather think I do not have a good picture of loves that are attainable. There have been a few, boys who thought the world of me, of whom - in hindsight - I think: I should have just gone for it. It would have been nice and good for me. I regret that. But I was scared.' What stopped you? What were you afraid of? 'I think it has to do with being fundamentally unable to believe that I am nice enough for someone.' These interviews I submitted to my niece Bodil de la Parra because I think of her as an artist. Considerations of Bodil de la Parra, actress, scriptwriter, and cabaret performer. 2 November 2009 I myself cannot be an artist, cannot produce art if I did not have a happy life. You cannot buy happiness, but you can try to count your blessings and be as happy as possible. Having and maintaining a relationship is one of them. You can learn a lot within a relationship, also about life and about yourself. It is important that you open yourself to the other, whom you might complement. But you must also allow that other person to be himself and you must not try to essentially change that person, that won't work. You cannot force success. When an artist starts aiming for success it goes wrong. An artist must never be occupied with success. With creating, yes. If creating is at the expense of private life or a happy private life that is regrettable, but for many artists that is a pre-condition. Their miserable lives allow them to make fine art. However, some artists manage to be happy: an example is writer and sculptor Jan Wolkers, who had a happy family life. Don't forget: his wife was also his Muse. On the other hand, unfulfilled desire is often the basis for the layering in art. Art can be life or the only thing people live for.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell17My personal experience is that unhappiness in life only paralyses me. Am I still a real artist? It is not for me to judge. These two interviewees both have difficulties with relationships and learning to handle them is a task for life. The woman also needs torment to keep desire intact. That is by no means the case for everyone. Alex Klaasen I know personally. He is extremely gifted, but he could certainly use psychoanalysis; you can conclude that from the interview. He cannot start a relationship, possibly on account of his experiences with homosexuality, etcetera. The question is: if he were to fully develop himself as a human being, would he be able to have a good relationship and still feel the necessity to express himself artistically? You never can tell. Finally: success is never a guarantee for happiness. And artists are just like 'ordinary' people, with all their diversity and complexity. Success is only a part of life. Life lives itself and we have the opportunity to give it an interpretation that is as rich as possible. That in itself is a gift. Most people just live and that's it. Circumstances make them so: poverty, war, etcetera ... ' When reading these two interviews, the thought came to me that if, as an artist, you find life very difficult, this is especially to do with the idea of: thus arranged, thus oppressed, and thus organized. But at the same time, these interviewees provide insight into why life seems so scary to them: Without desire and without a sense of freedom, Life is not a human life. The comments of B. de la Parra also show, however, that practicing art need not be something exceptional. There does not have to be an aura of sacrosanctity or differentness. I am often asked what psychoanalysis can mean to people. These interviews more or less show that if people, however brilliant in their art, feel so chained in their daily life, psychoanalysts have got a lot to do. Success and happiness, I have said it before, seldom make a happy combination. It is expressed in the Russian proverb: 'It is impossible to be lucky both in love and in games.' Psychoanalysis teaches people to handle everyday misery, to learn something from it, either in behaviour or in their way of thinking.2 There are examples of artists who emanate this. 2 What Freud refers to as Funktionslust is what Wanda Landowska (1952) so aptly says: \"I practise, I always play.\" 'Wanda Landowska (05-07-1879 - 16-08-1959) was a Polish (later a naturalized French citizen) harpsichordist whose performances, teaching, recordings, and writings played a large role in reviving the popularity of the harpsichord in the early 20th century. She was the first person to record Bach 's Goldberg Variations on the harpsichord (1931)' (Source Wikipedia)19THE GREATNESS OF LANCE ARMSTRONG T.I. Oei The 'greatness' of a person has nothing to do with his physique or his performance level.1 However, recognition of the things he can accomplish combined with the appreciation of what another person can achieve in the present or may well achieve in the future makes for a special gift. This is what Lance Armstrong shows us in his interview, some typical answers from which are quoted below. Lance Armstrong, Questions and answers, 21 July 2009, De Telegraaf Last Sunday in Verbier you had to bow to Contador. How much did that hurt? 'To tell you the truth, I had been reckoning with it. Already in the team discussion our tactics were focused on properly placing Alberto before the climb. It was not that my life was over when Alberto rode away from us in that impressive fashion. That I bowed to him on television afterwards shocked some people. When I arrived at the hotel, some people were afraid that I would tear the place apart, that I would curse and sit moping in a corner. None of that. I found it easy to accept my defeat. A few years ago it would have been different. Now I am much more relaxed. I used to be 'the winner'. Only the victory could inspire me. Now my age is my inspiration.' Would you have been able to keep up with Contador in that ascent in the good years? 'I don't honestly think so. When I consider the number of meters an hour that Alberto did in the steep part, that was 1850 meters. That is incredible. Then you are not a champion, you are a super champion. In all the years that I won the Tour I never climbed that fast. My record in the climbing time trial to l'Alpe d'Huez is at 1790 meters. Now in Verbier I stuck at 1700 meters. That is the same distance that Carlos Sastre achieved on l'Alpe d'Huez last year when he won the Tour there. So my performance is not so bad.' How bad was your relationship with Contador? 'Our relationship was not that bad at all. I just don't know him so well. The language and the culture were our barriers. But at mealtimes I regularly sat next to him. Alberto is a tough guy. He is extremely focused and he knows exactly what he wants. I like that. I must honestly admit that in my early years I would have looked askance if Miguel Indurain had joined my team and 1 Or his possible criminal life.PERSONAL SNIPPETS20proclaimed that he wanted to win the Tour. Of course Indurain is a legend and he deserves the leadership, but I think I would have a problem with that.' In order to be able to test such a statement ('recognition of the things he can accomplish combined with the appreciation of what another person can achieve in the present or may well achieve in the future makes for a special gift.'), it is worthwhile to find out if leaders can decide who will be their successors in a way that leads to effective results. Are good leaders by definition able to find and appoint their successors? Why is it that, in the majority of cases, there is no simple success? These questions, interesting though they may be, often cannot be answered. When I limit myself to my field of psychiatry, some prominent names spring to mind of post-war years, when the core teaching commitment of psychiatry was combined over many years, in some cases decades, with psychoanalytical expertise (ordinary membership of a psychoanalytical association).2 In their day, Professors Bastiaans (Nijmegen) and were lions in their fields of psychotraumatology; general psychopathology; psychiatry as pathology; clinical psychiatry; (administrative) psychiatry, psychiatry and child- and youth psychiatry; and psychiatry in and because of organic suffering, respectively. However, only in one of these cases, 'greatness' of leadership can be found. This has to do with the success of the successors, trained or proposed by them, who independently further developed the work and profession of their admired predecessors. When the names of Jan Bastiaans, Piet Kuiper, Kuno van Dijk, George Ladee, Goos Zwanikken, Jan Buitelaar, and Willem van Tilburg pass in review, then to my mind the last-mentioned person has the biggest chance of bringing home these coveted laurels. 2 I absolutely do not want to detract from the creditable contributions of the non- psychoanalysts/core professors of psychiatry perhaps H.C. R\u00fcmke was the best known (also internationally) psychiatry professor of pre- and post-war times, and also a member of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society, he was not a practising psychoanalyst.21'OVERESTIMATION OF EFFECTS OF PSYCHO - THERAPY OF DEPRESSION'1 T.I. Oei The effects of psychotherapy in the treatment of depression are over- estimated. This is because research that demonstrates positive results of the treatment has a far greater chance of being published than research that reports no difference or even negative results (Source: VU Amsterdam). This is the conclusion of researchers of the VU Amsterdam together with colleagues from Sweden and the United States after studying more than 1000 scientific articles. The above-mentioned phenomenon is called 'publication bias': it may distort the evaluation of the effect of a treatment, which is of great importance for the clinical practice. Recently researchers have identified this publication bias with respect to anti-depressants. They came to the conclusion that there is little scientific evidence for prescribing anti-depressants to patients with mild depression. This conclusion caused a great deal of controversy and resulted in a revised guideline now recommending to more frequently offer psychotherapy as a treatment option to this group of patients. Research conducted by P. Cuijpers of VU Amsterdam also shows, however, that the effects of psychotherapy may be smaller than previously assumed. This would mean that not only the effect of anti-depressants, but also that of psychotherapy have been overestimated for years. As with psychopharmacologic therapy, there is also a tendency in psychotherapy to emphasize the fact that the person who provides the treatment is right. The term publication bias I find an impossible concept; it is nothing but a euphemism for tendentious work under the guise of a serious product. Just as with athletes (like Sven Kramer) who want to be best, practitioners like to see results! People are inclined to make their own correctness succeed and this is an inclination that must be carefully scrutinized. The question is then whether bias as a scientific pitfall to bend correctness to your will should not always be carefully examined, just as in any form of scientific business where an intended victory is involved. Here not only all data which support a 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society , 2010, 25, 4, p. 82. PERSONAL SNIPPETS22proposition or a working hypothesis should be mentioned, but also findings that show the opposite. That is a challenge for meta-analyses in which it is necessary to show that a specific research method is more successful than any other. As long as no causal relationships have been found within psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatment options, as in the exceptional case of the end stage of neurolues (dementia paralytica caused by treponema pallidum), we as doctors and therapists must practise humility when we research treatments and publish the results. This also means that there is no valid reason to want to get (financial) gain from the practice of science. Fortunately, in the past few years, people have paid close attention which interests (commercial or otherwise) are involved when researchers publish their research. Perhaps such an insight leads to less subjectivity in scientific research, even though complete objectivity is impossible.2 In psychoanalysis, the n=1 study, individual in character as it is, is of essential importance. It is of great importance both as a treatment option and as a study, as long as the practitioner does not lose sight of his own feelings and other phenomena of countertransference (by means of supervision or intervision). Real science needs no (commercial) bush. 2 Theo Ingenhoven et al. (Effectiveness of Pharmacotherapy for Severe Personality Disorders: Meta-Analyses of Randomized Controlled Trials , J Clin Psychiatry 71:1, 2010) recently published a fine piece of research, which shows that medication has a differentiated effect, which means an effect on some specific or non-specific phenomena. When we say that the depression has passed, then it is always some symptoms of the depression that have improved. We would love to see the most telling manifestations of depression disappear, such as anhedonia, suicidality, motor retardation, rumination, etc., but from a communicative point of view by and large we mean the improved mood when we say that the depression is behind us.23AW ARENESS OF ONE'S OWN WORTH IS INSUFFICIENT FOR ASKING HELP* T.I. Oei The case of Juli\u00ebn C. On 1 December 2006 in the Brabant village of Hoogerheide an eight-year- old boy is killed by the then 22-year-old suspect Juli\u00ebn C. The case brings forth much public indignation, because the murder or manslaughter is committed in a classroom of an elementary school, a location that one hopes to be a secure one. Juli\u00ebn C. has always denied the accusation and has refused to cooperate with a psychiatric examination. In first instance the Public Prosecutor sued for 20 years imprisonment and detention in a hospital with compulsory psychiatric treatment. The court sentenced the defendant for manslaughter, because it did not find premeditation proven. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison and detention in a hospital with compulsory treatment. In the first instance a barrister acted for the defendant. Both the Public Prosecutor and the defendant appealed. In the appeal the solicitor-general sued for the same punishment as the public prosecutor in first instance. The defendant, who did not want to be represented by counsel in the appeal, once more sued for acquittal. The court at Den Bosch sentenced Juli\u00ebn C. to life imprisonment for murder. Against this sentence Juli\u00ebn C. appealed to the Supreme Court. On 17 November 2009 the Supreme Court quashed the decree of the court and referred the case to the court at Arnhem for retrial on appeal. Legal aid The reason for the Supreme Court to quash the decree of the court at Den Bosch is found in the fact that the Court did not show having taken the reasons behind the defendant's waiving his right to legal aid. In the appeal the defendant wanted to conduct his own defence. The European Convention on Human Rights in article 6 subsection 3 under c grants the defendant the right to defend himself or to have a barrister's representation. Our own Penal Code also grants the defendant this right, namely in article 28 subsection 1. The law indicates that the suspect is entitled PERSONAL SNIPPETS24to be represented by one or more counsel. In some cases the assignment of counsel is compulsory, for instance when the defendant is in provisional detention (Penal Code article 41) Compulsory assignment does not imply that counsel in fact appears when the defendant chooses to conduct his own defence. An defendant therefore has the right to cede his right to legal aid. A barrister cannot appear for the defendant against his will. In some cases, however, it is impossible to cede the right to legal aid. In r.o. 3.3.3. of its decree of 17 November 2009 the Supreme Court cites a few examples where the barrister is qualified and compelled to represent the defendant, even if the defendant himself indicates that he does not want legal aid or that he disagrees with the way in which counsel interprets his legal aid. Penal Code article 503, subsection 1 makes clear that counsel for an defendant under the age of sixteen is due all those powers that are also due to the defendant. It also holds good in trials with an defendant that is presumed to have such a defective development or such a pathological disorder of the mental faculties that as a result he will not be able to properly represent his interests (Penal Code article 509 a jo. article 509d subsection 3) Neither can the defendant waive his right to legal representation in that case. Cession of legal representation by Juli\u00ebn C. The Supreme Court finds that, by including such articles in the law, the aim is to ensure that those defendant persons who are deemed unable to determine their position in the criminal trial have effective defence. The Supreme Court subsequently considers that these special arrangements do not mean that in all other cases the defence required by article 6 ECHR can be left every time and without further ado to the defendant. Therefore, also in those cases that there is not by definition a presumption of a defective development or pathological disorder of the mental faculties, the court must see to it that the right to a fair trial is not harmed when the right to legal aid is waived. The Supreme Court considers in 3.4: 'In such a case the court will have to ascertain that the waiver is unequivocal, voluntary and was made with full consciousness.' And exactly this last condition was ignored in the case against Juli\u00ebn C. According to the Supreme Court the Court should have checked first and foremost whether the defendant ceded his right to legal representation fully consciously. In the criminal case against Juli\u00ebn C. many complex legal issues would come up and there was a lot at stake for the defendant. Therefore legal representation during the trial involved big interests. The Court recognized this, for repeatedly the defendant was told that he could confer with the counsel present at his trial if he felt the need to do so. However, the Court should have done more. It should not merely have informed the defendant Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell25that he could confer with counsel if he felt the need. The Court should first have checked if Juli\u00ebn C. had arrived at his decision to conduct his defence without counsel after careful consideration. It appears not to be the case. The records of the appeal show that the Court accepted Juli\u00ebn C.'s decision without further ado. The defendant's motives to waive legal representation were not examined, whereas the reason given by the defendant (his conviction would be certain were he represented by a barrister) is indicative of his not realizing the full implications of his choice. Moreover the Court's decree does not show that the defendant had been told about the importance of legal representation in this case and what the possible consequences of waiving his right to legal representation. Under the circumstances of this case it implies defective motivation and the contested verdict is quashed. A different court, namely the Court of Justice at Arnhem dealt with the case again with due regard to the decree of the Supreme Court discussed above. In this trial, as in the appeal to the Supreme Court, Juli\u00ebn C. did have legal representation. The question about effective defence is no longer involved. Yet the this court's verdict, which we will discuss below, is interesting for forensic psychiatry. Establishing a defective development or pathological disorder when denying expert examination After remission the Court at Arnhem once more ordered experts (of the Pieter Baan Centrum) to conduct a personality examination of Juli\u00ebn C. Once more Juli\u00ebn C. refused all cooperation. In the appeal defence counsel argued that it was not possible to impose detention in a hospital with compulsory psychiatric treatment. Defence counsel argued that it was not determined by a medical expert that at the time of the criminal act Juli\u00ebn C. was suffering from a defective development or a pathological disorder of his mental faculties. The Court does not accept defence counsel's argument. The Court lucidly explains in a nicely motivated decree why -despite the fact that behavioural experts are unable to answer the question whether there was a psychic disorder in Juli\u00ebn C. at the time of the manslaughter- the Court finds it sufficiently plausible that there was a psychic disorder in the defendant at the time of the offence. The establishment of the mental disorder results from indications from his criminal file (the testimony of witnesses and records made by police officials, the pronouncements of the defendant and his behaviour immediately preceding the facts, his behaviour after his arrest etc.), from the PERSONAL SNIPPETS26limited findings of behavioural experts in this case, and from the findings of a behavioural examination from 2004 that had been done because of another criminal offence. These lead to Court to taking its responsibility. Its considerations are: 'If the defendant, as in this case, has refused (full) cooperation with an examination by behavioural experts, the requirement of a (full) multi- disciplinary examination as meant in Penal Code article 37 subsection 2 no longer applies for the imposition of detention in a hospital. But what is still required is the determination of a mental defect or defective development of the mental faculties at the time the crime was committed. Without that determination the imposition of detention in a hospital is impossible. It is the task of the court, which judges the fact, to do this determination. The Court will have to be strongly guided by the findings and the conclusions of behavioural experts, but when the experts reach the limits of what they can account for scientifically, the Court will have to take its own responsibility within the confines of the law.' The Court further indicates that neither the law, nor jurisprudence requires that the disorder is fully identified and that determination must be done by a behavioural expert. This means that the Court itself can arrive at the determination of a disorder, albeit only in extreme cases. The Court does state that extreme caution must be applied. In determining the disorder the court must find sufficient support in what behavioural experts did find concerning the examinee and also in what became apparent to the court of the facts and circumstances concerning the person of the defendant. The court at Arnhem assumes diminished responsibility in Juli\u00ebn C. at the moment he took the eight-year-old's life. The court sentences him to twelve years imprisonment and detention in a hospital with compulsory psychiatric treatment. This verdict is identical to the verdict of the court at Breda in first instance. The defendant has already informed the authorities that he will appeal to the court of cassation. Assistance Defendants have the right to waive a barrister's assistance, the Supreme Court rules, but the Court is obliged to examine whether the defendant fully comprehends the consequences. The court at Den Bosch did not fully comply with this, the Supreme Court finds, whereas, according to the Supreme Court, there were 'indications' that C. could not fully comprehend the consequences. 'In the (...) case, which involved complex legal questions and in which there was a great deal at stake for the defendant, the court should have done a probing examination whether the defendant consciously Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell27waived legal assistance.' Another court, that at Arnhem, will have to retry the case in compliance with the decree of the Supreme Court. Juli\u00ebn C. himself has always denied having killed the boy. He did enter the school, but had nothing to do with the murder, he said. On his clothes blood from the victim was found. Premeditation C. was sentenced to life imprisonment, because the court at Den Bosch considered it proved that he had stabbed the boy to death with premeditation. This appeared among other things from the fact that C. had taken a meat knife along to the school, and that it had taken him eight minutes to walk to the school, during which time he could have changed his mind. The court earlier found that it was not proved that Juli\u00ebn C. had actually intended to kill the boy. The public prosecutor had sued in both instances for twenty years in prison and detention in a hospital with compulsory psychiatric treatment. Psychiatric examination C. refused to cooperate in psychiatric examination. Immediately after his appeal he announced that he would appeal to the Supreme Court to have the verdict squashed. C. remains in custody while awaiting the retrial at Arnhem. This shows that the defendant's insight into what -and the why and wherefore of what- he is charged with, and in the why of the prosecution is of extreme importance. The additional insight into the procedure of the judicial prosecution, and whether adequate information was given about legal aid. Especially less intelligent, or addicted or cognitively deficient persons (such as people who are growing demented or people with other psychic disorders) are more than others entitled to legal aid such as the assistance of a barrister, judicially forensic healthcare and judicially forensic psychiatrists. Refusing defendants often have psychic problems when they waive assistance in second instance. Then the counsel's advice or the court's decision in first instance have not been in accordance with the defendant's expectations. From my Mesdag time (in the nineties) I remember a detainee in my care to whom the following had happened. He was guilty of a so-called 'crime passionel', and jealousy pathology appeared to play an important part in this. In first instance he was sentenced to a prison term of four years. On the advice of his lawyer he appealed to the court. This court ultimately sentenced him to four years and detention in a psychiatric hospital. The man was so enraged that he lost all faith in judges, lawyers and doctors. For six months he refused to talk with me about his offence. At most I was tolerated in his room for a weekly cup of coffee. It was not until about six or seven months PERSONAL SNIPPETS28later that his confidence in me, his psychiatrist, grew. He started to talk about a few more details of his offence. Ultimately after further discussions and specific examination he agreed to psychoanalytical treatment. Awareness, however securely embedded, of one's own worth, in the sense that someone finds himself worth it, is insufficient to ask for help. What is essential is that aid or advice is offered in manageable portions. So that also in the case of C. it should have been made clear, in a way that was accessible to him, that a lawyer was there to be of service to him. And also that it should be clear whether he fully realizes what he does1, by refusing all aid.2 Only then can be determined whether the consequences of a decision 1 Is the defendant compos mentis? 2 D. Dondorp: 'A first reading made clear to me that for a good understanding I had to outline the judicial process. Court plus lawyer, sentence twelve years and hospitalization. Court Den Bosch minus lawyer: premeditated murder, life. Denying defendant without counsel further appeals. Supreme Court refers back to another court: Arnhem. Was defendant sufficiently conscious to waive legal assistance? His reasons to do so the Supreme Court found insufficiently scrutinized by the court at Den Bosch. That is how your elucidation of the heading begins. An elucidation that ends with Juli\u00ebn C.'s refusal to cooperate with psychiatric examination. (Nowadays, and in a wider context, again a topical issue) It was not clear to me at which moment(s) he did this. I thought it was at the trial by the court at Den Bosch. The question, under your heading in bold type, to be answered at Arnhem, has to do therefore with whether or not adequately conscious. The above shows that not only the defendant's insight into what he is charged with is of extreme importance But also insight into ... prosecution. By means of casuistry you arrive at the essence of your argument: sufficient awareness of the need for help can be missing or blocked in or because of the Legal process. As with (or in the case exactly by) legal aid. Leaving the defendant aggrieved, to such an extent even, that he starts the hospitalization course to which he was sentenced without the request for assistance, in contrast in rebellion. You show how much time and patience it takes to restore the relationship. And skill as your note illustrates. It hints at the task the Court at Arnhem was faced with. You establish that to the awareness of self worth (in the case of patient) was done insufficient justice to (be able to?) request help. I read here that the person's own worth was short changed in the trial. Patient was not given his proper value. And you (being a part of the system that he initially considered you to be) had to redress that before therapy could begin. Ergo: as far as C. is concerned hospitalization could only be part of the sentence if during the legal process it had been sufficiently impressed on him that legal and possible forensic assistance was in his own interest. And if they had exhaustively tried to do so.' E. Groenewoud-Van Nielen: 'In the note Dondorp refers to the fact that a defendant must understand the tenor of the prosecution. However, that is quite a different matter than what is the issue in the case of Juli\u00ebn C. The question for suspension of prosecution is a formal question of article 348, which must be answered without looking at the content of the case. Think of very psychotic defendants, who have no idea why they are/have been arrested by the police, who do not know why they are in custody, who sometimes don't even seem to realize that they are in a house of detention. In brief, Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell29make consulting a psychotherapist/psychoanalyst necessary or desirable. Subsequently cooperation and treatment may come about. In brief, here as well the motivation to depth in one's own possibilities and needs is of extreme importance, as in any psychotherapeutic and psychoanalytical treatment.3 * With thanks to Mrs Elisabet Groenewoud-Van Nielen LLM who have completely lost all contact with the here and now. That is out of the question with Juli\u00ebn C. He is well aware of the charges. He also knows why he is in front of the judge. He merely states that he did not commit the crime... thinks that therefore the fact cannot be proved. That is a material question of article 350.D.' 3 As the pioneering research of Smith and Glass made clear, namely that in psychotherapy/psychoanalysis the key issue is to see how the patient can best be helped instead of being concerned with the method itself. Cf. M.L. Smith & G.V. Glass, Meta-analysis of psychotherapy outcome studies. American Psychologist , 1977, 32, p. 752-760.31MADAME BOV ARY*1 T.I. Oei Even if Gustave Flaubert2 all his life rated his writing talent above all, whereas in fact he put his own life at the service of his writing goals, the success of the novel Madame Bovary was not a matter of course. The romantic attitude to life of the main character in fact violates the possibilities of reality. By means of the technique of realism Flaubert lent so much drama to his novel, that as a reader you have to draw on your own emotions to be able to follow such a tragic life. The book was written over the course of five years, and also took some six years of preparation. He had to stand trial after its publication, because he would flaunt sexual taboos like adultery, marital infidelity, squandering and otherwise recklessly handling money and goods, lack of respect for the morals of the time. He managed to win the case eventually. His acquittal exonerated him fully. The case had caused him lots of stress. To a friend he said that he was sorry having written the book.3 The reason was that it was not worth all the social bother it got him.4 Without a doubt it was his intention to expose the moral of his 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society, 2009, 24, 8, pp. 186-188. 2 Gustave Flaubert (12-12-1821 - 8-05-1880) ranks among the greatest writers of the western world. Famous because of Madame Bovary considered the second best novel ever written (after Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina) He is well-known for his scrupulous devotion to his art and style. It would go too far in this discussion to go deeper into the qualities of this extraordinary author. There are numerous publications about him and his work, perhaps more numerous than his own writings. 3 For reasons of good taste 'I am in a gloomy state. I have that Bovary is up to here. How I regret ever publishing it! Everyone offers the advice to make a few small changes, out of caution, for reasons of good taste and so on. Let me tell you such an act would strike me as exceedingly cowardly, for on my honour there is nothing reprehensible in my book (and that from the most strict morality)... And further? The future! Is it possible to write anything more innocent than this novel? People are offended by an impartial description. What is to be done? Be evasive, make jokes? No! A thousand times no! In other words I feel very much like withdrawing to my province and my silence, for good, to continue writing there, for myself and myself alone. I will write truthful and spicy books, I can assure you! [...] This winter set me back quite a bit, a year ago I was worth more. I feel like a prostitute.' In a letter to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Baudry, 1857. Flaubert was a romantic, travelled a lot, but also know that his health -he suffered from epileptic fits- put restrictions on him. This led to a solitary existence. 4 The quoted letter to Baudry can also be read differently, if the part in italics in note 3 is emphasized. Flaubert continued ridiculing the bourgeoisie. L'Education sentimentale and 'Bouvard en of this. Information W.C.M. Gelens, September 2009.PERSONAL SNIPPETS32time and everything connected wit hit, such as the indolent bourgeoisie, the narrow-minded customs and traditions, the politically unstable situation in France of the first half of the 19th century.5 Flaubert was a perfectionist through and through. A couple of sentences might occupy him for days. He struggled for the right word, however long it took to find it.6 Flaubert was not satisfied before he saw on paper, what had been in his mind for so long. The protagonist of his (first) novel was a similar conscientious character. She had imaginations about this, that and the other, she could not vent her everyday frustrations, not to her husband, not to anyone else. Oppressed by the daily monotonous pace of things, she could only find comfort in imaginative experiences and thoughts which she thought she could have in her inner world. The relationships she had with two lovers, ultimately were but illustrations of that sombre, but also so restless, attitude to life. She was unable to bring her daily actions under another heading than that of the failed housewife, lover, partner. She needs must have all sorts of things, if it cost her a fortune and she could no longer redeem the material debts she caused. Her feelings of guilt and shame finally led to a tragedy in which her life became too much to bear. She chose death, although she could not avoid death with painful agony.7 That her husband would follow her into death not long after, was something she could not have surmised given her hopeless struggle for life. Death as the solution to everything that makes life unbearable, was a familiar theme in stories and novels. But in how far the unconscious need for punishment ultimately hastened the main character's death can only be guessed at. Her father so much wanted her to have a pleasant carefree existence as the wife of a stolid family doctor. But her controversial way of life broke the taboo of the good spouse and housewife in an early 19th century family. Thus she emancipated herself and distanced herself in her own way of the mores of the times. In that sense author and protagonist were a match for each other.8 5 Nobody ranted and raved against the bourgeoisie as much as him, even though he was a bourgeois himself. 6 'I have eaten little, but ruminated a lot,' he wrote to one of his correspondents. What is also involved is the \u00e9preuve du gueuloir . Whether the text would read well. To Flaubert writing was an orgie perp\u00e9tuelle. 7 With her there is no notion of \u00abatonement\u00bb in a stricter sense, even though the image forced itself on the reader as an unconscious expression of it. Flaubert, son of a surgeon, who as a child could be a spectator at the place where doctors were taught to dissect dead bodies, knew quite well what arsenic poisoning entailed. 8 Many (French) novels are -and were- about adultery, decadence, Financial mismanagement and the like. It was the way in which Flaubert put these in words that was new to the avocat imp\u00e9rial .Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell33Whether it was also Flaubert's intention to say: Madame Bovary, c'est moi!, is something we can no longer ask him. What I find masterly are the realistic, and especially stylistically impressively pure descriptions of the emotional experiences and impressions. (See appendix9) He was a natural talent in the field of psychodynamics and as a result a Freudian minded author avant la lettre. * Introduction to the discussion of Madame Bovary, for the auditorium of the Oosterbeek reading circle, 9 September 2009 9 It is steeped in psychodynamics: the daily frustrations of what in an ideal world should happen, but was in reality can happen, are so great for this woman, that she cannot help devalue her partner, she must brace herself for the hope of better times, despite her lack of self esteem and evaluation. She is yearning for revaluation, but cannot from herself derive any comfort and optimism from any kind of little windfall.PERSONAL SNIPPETS34Appendix with 'Madame Bovary' And yet sometimes it occurred to her that this was the finest time of her life, the so-called honeymoon. To savour all its sweetness, it would doubtless have been necessary to sail away to lands with musical names where wedding nights leave behind them a more delicious indolence. In a post-chaise, behind blue silk blinds, you climb at a foot pace up precipitous roads, listening to the postillion's song echoing across the mountain, amid the tinkling of goat-bells and the muffled noise of waterfalls. At sunset you breathe the scent of lemon trees on the shore of the bay. At night, together on the terrace of your villa, with fingers intertwined, you gaze at the stars and make plans for the future. It seemed to her that certain parts of the world must produce happiness, as they produce peculiar plants which will flourish nowhere else. Why could she not now be leaning on the balcony of a Swiss chalet, or immuring her sadness in a Scotch cottage, with a husband in a black velvet coat with long flaps, and soft boots, and peaked hat, and ruffles! She would have been glad of someone in whom to confide all this; but how describe an intangible unease, that shifts like the clouds and eddies like the wind? Lacking the words, she had neither the opportunity nor the courage. Nevertheless, had Charles so wished, had he guessed, had his eyes once read her thoughts, it would instantly have delivered her heart of a rich load, as a single touch will bring the ripe fruit falling from the tree. But as their outward familiarity grew, she began to be inwardly detached, to hold herself more aloof from him. Charles' conversation was as flat as a street pavement, on which everybody's ideas trudged past, in their workaday dress, provoking no emotion, no Laughter, no dreams. At Rouen, he said, he had never had any desire to go and see a Paris company at the theatre. He couldn't swim, or fence, or fire a pistol and was unable to explain a riding term she came across in a novel one day. Whereas a man, surely, should know about everything; excel in a multitude of activities, introduce you to passion in all its force, to life in all its grace, initiate you in all mysteries! But this one had nothing to teach; knew nothing, wanted nothing. He thought she was happy and she hated him for that placid immobility, that stolid serenity of his, for that very happiness that she herself brought him. She used to sketch; and it was great sport for Charles to stand there, bolt upright, watching her as she bent over her drawing-block, half-closing her eyes to see her work better, or rolling little bread-crumb pellets between Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell35finger and thumb. The there was the piano: the faster her fingers flew over the keys, the more he marvelled. She had a confident touch, and would run right down the key-board from top to bottom without a break. Shaken up like this, the aged instrument, with its warped chords, could be heard all through the village when the window was open, and the bailiff's clerk would often pause as he went by bareheaded along the highroad and stand there in his felt slippers, his sheet of paper in his hand, listening. Emma knew how to run the house, as well. She sent out the accounts to the patients, in well-phrased letters devoid of all commercial flavour. When they had one of the neighbours to dinner on a Sunday she always managed to put some dainty dish on the table. She was expert at building a pyramid of greengages on a base of vine-leaves, could turn preserves out of the jar on to a plate and even spoke of getting finger-bowls for use at dessert. All this reflected considerable glory on Bovary. Possessing such a wife, Charles came to have an increased respect for himself. In the living room he would point with pride to two little pencil drawings of hers, which he had had mounted in very large frames and hung up on the wall with long green chords. As you came out of Mass you could see him at his door wearing a handsome pair of embroidered slippers. Sometimes he came home late, at ten or even twelve o'clock. He would want something to eat, and as the maid had gone to bed, Emma looked after him. He took off his frock-coat to eat his meal in comfort, and told her all the people he had met, the villages he had been to, the prescriptions he had written. Then, well pleased with himself, he finished up the onion stew, pared the rind from his cheese, munched an apple, emptied the decanter, and took himself off to bed, where he lay down on his back and started snoring.37TABOO LINKED WITH SUICIDE DOES NOT DISAPPEAR RAPIDLY1 T.I. Oei The Dutch Levent Salim Bergkotte, born in Istanbul, was recently said to have murdered 37-year-old Alastair Whewell piloting the little sports plane in which he was sitting and then switched off the engine. The plane crashed. The Argentine police think of murder because in the wreckage a bloody knife was found. Also the key no longer was in the contact. In the Dutchman's hotel room a farewell letter to his wife was found. The Dutchman, who had a pilot's licence, originally intended to hire a plane himself. When that proved impossible, he arranged a plane with a pilot. Ever since Freud published his 'Trauer und Melancholie' at the beginning of the previous century, psychiatrists and psychologists have often wondered what is fundamental to the phenomenon of suicide. But is also has become clear that the public opinion finds it hard to handle the concept of suicide. In the media regularly euphemisms for this phenomenon appear. There is no direct reference. Terms like a tragic or dramatic coincidence are then used. In obituaries as well the use of the word 'suicide' is avoided. A carefully considered suicide, like that of fashion designer Alexander McQueen recently, shocked the entire world of fashion. Such a person, who had made a comet-like ascent to the pinnacles of the fashion firmament could not have done something like that? Please note he had before hanging himself, taken a large quantity of hard drugs, taking it for granted that there was no way back. Suicide always has a morbid connotation, especially when you ask yourself how you go about it. Jeroen Brouwers made a thorough study of suicide in literature. He could find the most bizarre reasons for writers to take their own lives. He thinks there is always a reason. For Thomas Chatterton it was the penchant for fame, realizing he was a misunderstood genius, the victorious Nazi seemed to be the last straw for Stefan Zweig and his wife as refugee Jews. Aggression aimed at one's own person is usually the reason for a chain of self-destructive tendencies. But the taboo in society on such an act may explain why for centuries we have been dealing so circumspectly with it. The taboo on actions in which we harm ourselves and which in themselves may shock the legal order but which from a criminal point of view do not provide any definition of an offence, has so many diverging effects. Auto mutilation 1 Published in: Brabants Dagblad , 14 May 2010.PERSONAL SNIPPETS38is frequently the reason why borderline patients cause so much disgust and create attention from their environment, which they may or may not accept. Suicide may not be punishable, but the thought of it and the act itself are all the more shocking to relatives and surviving next of kin. In the Middle Ages the two main capital sins were suicide and usury. The Church as the civil institution of power attached the most hellish punishments in the after life with this misconduct. Fortunately Purgatory offered a small chance of a heavenly reward also for these offenders, provided they had repented before their death and preferably told about their action in the confessional. In our modern times there is a similar movement to further regulate this kind of 'misconduct'. The modern usurers are speculators, bonus hunters, fraudsters in large companies. And the law will have to reflect social changes also in this respect. The right to euthanasia for instance, but also making the pursuit of boundless profit punishable. It will be interesting to know in how far aggression will be once directed at bankers instead of at ourselves. Will the person who commits an act of aggression against his 'investor' be able to plead some kind of mental condition? The penal code already comprises the offence of insider trading. Perhaps more adaptations will follow. Unfortunately, the taboo on what society thinks of this kind of actions will not readily disappear: fretting is something people find it hard not to do. 39ISAIAH BERLIN, A MAN IN A THOUSAND1 T.I. Oei In my holidays I read a magnificent book: R. Jahanbegloo, Conversations with Isaiah Berlin , London: Halban Publ. Ltd. 2007. Berlin is the most prominent political philosopher of the previous century (1909-1997). Born in Riga, given a thorough English education after the age of twelve, after reading all the books by Russian philosophers and writers in his father's library, he became an intellectually inclined philosopher, ahead of his time in many respects. His liberal pluralist range of ideas, his views on two concepts of liberty (one negative, one positive),2 his phenomenal encyclopaedic knowledge of writers, thinkers, philosophies, particularly those from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, his classical education with knowledge of Greek and Roman history, his experiences of the typical English school, made him an outstanding example of the really British, chauvinist, wise man. He also thought England the ideal country to live in, certainly given his need of democratic freedom and the scope for the development of his immense mind. The book breathes an atmosphere that creates safety, in which you sit at his feet as it were in order to follow his thinking. This image is conjured up by his inspirational didactic method: every sentence is illustrated by examples, sayings, and practical handles. It makes the reader feel at ease, without being talked down to, kept without information, or ignored. There is a real conversation with the interviewer, who, as questioner, is always treated with respect. Sometimes he is delicately corrected or complemented and taken by the hand - always with the reassuring caress like the iron motivation of the hand in the velvet glove that leads you to the conflicts that are always accompanied by what he calls the tribulations of 'life ends'. By that he means the things people's wishes and desires can bring about. In that respect he is truly a philosopher who does not only think and consider, but who also feels and knows what goes on in people's hearts and minds. He is a psycho- dynamically inclined man, with great psychological insight, who never uses Freud's words or his philosophy. That he did get to know Freud and had a certain respect for his person, we find occasionally in his writings, for instance in Concepts and Categories (Princeton, New Jersey, 1999, p. 129, in particular p.132, p.156) and in Against the Current (Princeton, New Jersey, 2001, p. 254, p. 324). The 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society 25, 2, 2010, pp. 30-31. 2 Cf Isaiah Berlin, Two Concepts of Liberty . Boom, Amsterdam (Small Classics series) 2010.PERSONAL SNIPPETS40memorable biography by Michael Ignatieff, Isaiah Berlin, A life, Chatto and Windus, London, 1998, p. 91/92 relates - we do not know if it is true - how in 1938 Freud tried to provoke him. To Freud's question what Isaiah did for a living, he answered in German that he tried to teach philosophy. Freud then replied: 'Then you must find me a charlatan.' Ignatieff continues: close to the mark, but Berlin protested.' Berlin: \"Dr Freud, how can you think such a thing?\" Freud then pointed to a figurine (of the goddess Venus) on the mantelpiece. 'Can you guess where it comes from?' Freud asked Berlin. When Berlin said he had no idea, Freud replied, 'I see you are not a snob.' The meeting ended with a cup of tea, in the presence of Mrs Freud and grandson Lucian (who later became a famous painter). In 1996, Lucian was given the opportunity to paint someone's portrait and he chose Berlin (ibid. p. 296). There were more than a dozen sessions, mostly early in the morning, but the portrait was never completed. Lucian habitually used many sessions, sometimes daily over many months up to a year, to see a person for his work. Berlin liked to roughly divide people into two categories: hedgehogs and foxes: those who strive for targets (system builders) and the sensitive types (generalists),3 whereas there are people who display neither of these characteristics or conversely who have something of both. He took Pushkin, in his eyes the greatest Russian stylist, as an example. He says: 'Pushkin is not a man who tries to interpret everything in the light of some single all- embracing system. That's what hedgehogs do. He simply reacts as he reacts, he describes what he describes, writes what he writes. I mean, he expresses himself in many directions, as the spirit takes him...Tolstoy is a fox who believed passionately in being a hedgehog. Dostoevsky is a real hedgehog. It is not a peculiarly Russian division. Goethe was a fox, and Hegel a hedgehog. Victor Hugo was a hedgehog and Flaubert a fox; and so were Anatole France and Huysmans.' And then he goes on to explain why the distinction is so important in his thinking. He distinguishes that foxes are the pluralists and hedgehogs the 3 Berlin expands upon this idea to divide writers and thinkers into two categories: hedgehogs, who view the world through the lens of a single defining idea (examples given include foxes, who draw on a wide variety of experiences and for whom the world cannot be boiled down to a single idea (examples given include Herodotus Anderson ).Turning to Tolstoy , Berlin contends that at first glance, Tolstoy escapes definition into one of these two groups. He postulates, rather, that while Tolstoy's talents are those of a fox, his beliefs are that one ought to be a hedgehog, and thus Tolstoy's own voluminous assessments of his own work are misleading. Berlin goes on to use this idea of Tolstoy as a basis for an analysis of the theory of history that Tolstoy presents in his novel War and Peace . (cf. Wikipedia)Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell41monists as he terms them. In Tolstoy you experience the conflict: by nature he was a fox, a pluralist, but he believed in monism, he wanted to be a hedgehog. In his later work you become abundantly aware of this conflict. Berlin found his thinking about pluralism especially in philosophers like Herder and Vico. He explains his liking of Herder: 'That's why Herder...influenced the Jews and the southern Slavs directly or indirectly, because he articulated their sense of identity, which earlier theorists, perhaps only the forgotten Vico and the remote Montesquieu, had stressed.' And also: 'Herder is indeed the first person to emphasize that the need to belong to a community is a basic human need, just as strong as that for eating, drinking, warmth, security...' 'Hegel has pointed out the human need for recognition; that men want others to recognize their status, needs, character as an individual, independent entity.' It may be clear that I admire this philosopher - who is also of importance for cultural-anthropologists and transculturally and interculturally minded colleagues - who, as a person did not have any real enemies. He was so humane and tolerant, literally, but also in his pattern of communication. In this book he managed always to convey to the interviewer the idea that he mattered, a personal talent that everyone can wish to possess. 43HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL?1 T.I. Oei Hope springs eternal in the human breast. Another couple of hopeful events. In the first place a man who was thought to be in a coma, but who appeared to have been conscious for years! A man, whose doctors thought he was in a coma for well over twenty years, now turns out to have been conscious all that time. The man, a Belgian who is now 46 years old, whose consciousness was declared lost by his doctors several times, was in reality completely paralyzed and simply could not give visible reactions to the countless attempts to rouse him from his coma. Powerless he had to hear how his doctors gave up on him in his presence. 'I screamed with all my might, but it was inaudible,' he says in the German magazine Der Spiegel . With the aid of special computers the man is now able to communicate. Car accident In 1983 the man was involved in a serious car accident and ever since that time, he had been in hospital, fully paralyzed, but not, as his doctors thought, in a coma. The researcher who discovered the man's real condition, the Belgian neurologist Steven Laureys, brought the matter to light as a result of research that he completed this past summer. He concluded that in some 40 per cent of all 'hopeless' coma cases, signals of consciousness were measurable after painstaking research. 'Once a coma patient is labelled \"without consciousness\" it is difficult to get rid of that label again'. This may, according to Laureys, explain the incorrect diagnoses of many coma patients. The 46-year-old patient is extremely grateful to the neurologist for his careful scrutiny. 'I will never forget the day of my \"rediscovery\". It was my second birth'. A few days ago (mid-November 2009) Prof. Wouter Buikhuisen was rehabilitated. The generally demonized and socially ostracized colleague 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society , 2010, 25, 6, p. 135.PERSONAL SNIPPETS44criminologist, who - in a Freudian sense - sought his present life in the past, went into antiques some twenty years ago and later settled with wife and family in Spain. Every time he received a message from Leiden University, his Alma Mater, he hoped that there might be some recognition or apology. When, some months ago, the dean of Leiden Law School visited him in Spain, the first thing he said was: 'I don't need an apology or an honorary doctorate [as had been suggested earlier by colleague Theo Doreleijers, professor of child and youth psychiatry at the VU Amsterdam and professor of Forensic Psychiatry at Leiden University, to] but at my age [he is now 76] all that really matters is \"peace of mind\".' He wanted to live on and die as it were in peace. In an interview with the Leiden University weekly student magazine Mare earlier this year, he said that after his experiences in Japanese POW camps when he was 10 and had managed to keep his spirit intact in spite of the many humiliations, he had lived through his Second War in the eighties. Everybody, colleagues everywhere, the national press, the University of Leiden, put him systematically, mentally, morally and socially in their bad books. Finally he was practically banned from teaching. If teaching is made impossible in times of war, as it was for many in the Second World War on account of resistance to the Nazis, this may be accepted as inevitable, but when it happens in times of peace the mildest term one can apply is 'unpleasant'. What about group aggression, you might wonder as a psychoanalyst. Is it that the individual loses or denies his 'ownness', to avoid primitive fears of banishment and rejection by any means? Or is identification with the aggressor (you follow the example set by the leaders) in the first place a group phenomenon, similar to the so-called acts of senseless violence (hooliganism, violence for the sake of violence, mass rape in war regions)? 2 2 Colleague X: Buikhuisen's daughter is my son's colleague. He thinks she is a fine doctor. Through our son we experienced what such an affair can do to children. He was very concerned.45DIAGNOSING PERSONALITY DISORDERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF BORDERLINERS IS DIFFICULT T.I. Oei Introduction Borderliners are usually in a difficult position. They find it hard to deal with the little everyday ups and downs and the uncertainties of life. They pretend they have an extra sense for feeling difficulties in others, but in fact this is mostly untrue. Pretending everything is hunky dory is quite common with them. They have qualities; they are often excellent in literature, either as author or as protagonist. They frequently have hidden talents. As a result of their mood swings they can just as easily wrong-foot the people around them as get them to start thinking. They divide, they exaggerate, they are inclined to acts of over-confidence, and in their relationships they find intimacy and proximity extremely hard. If someone else were to develop a strong liking for them, they would soon find this threatening. They drive people off, become morose, cold or standoffish. As their partner you can never do the right thing, but by golly, what if you would leave or betray them. Then things will really get out of hand and feelings of rancour are let loose. The borderliner will latch on to anything that is wrong with you, and will persecute you, as it were, beyond the gates of hell. Diagnosing of personality disorders always is, always will be difficult. What is a true picture of what a person can do and achieve, when that person is different from day to day? Research by Theo Ingenhoven On 24 November 2009, Theo Ingenhoven, chief treatment officer at the Centre for Treatment of Personality Disorders of the Symfora Group at Amersfoort, successfully upheld his PhD thesis The Role of Psychodynamic Assessment in Diagnosis and Treatment of Personality Disorders. Reliability and Validity of the Developmental Profile at Erasmus University Rotterdam, an interesting book, which I can recommend to everyone. On the basis of the research with the 'Development Profile', started 13 years ago at De Zwaluw, he wrote a series of scientific articles on the reliability, significance, and usefulness of psychodynamic diagnostics in personality disorders.PERSONAL SNIPPETS46Summary of his findings People with a personality disorder are dysfunctional in various reaches of life and are often significant burdens on the people around them and on mental health care. Quite apart from all the personal suffering, this leads to high costs to society. Personal and social functioning can be greatly improved by means of intensive psychotherapy, a considerable but cost-effective investment. However, not all patients appear to profit in the same way from therapy. The present DSM-IV classification of personality disorders is not suitable for determining the indication for any specific treatment and is of hardly any assistance in predicting who will profit from which therapy. The aim of this thesis research was to gain greater insight into the reliability and validity of psychodynamic personality diagnostics: a form of diagnostics in which not only the behaviour and the conscious experiences of the person are charted, but in which also attempts are made to get an impression of the underlying motives and the structure of the personality. To this end the 'Development Profile', a psychodynamic diagnostic method on the basis of a semi-structured interview, was made of with a group of patients with a personality disorder. The Development Profile offers an overview of both the pathological and the healthy aspects of the personality. Such a strength/ weakness analysis is deemed of great importance in determining the nature and intensity of the treatment and is therefore potentially of great importance for determining the indication. The most important part of the study was to establish the reliability and the predictive possibilities of the Development Profile with regard to the treatment process and the results of treatment in clinical psychotherapy. To that end a 'Development Profile' was taken of 148 patients in the centre for clinical psychotherapy 'De Zwaluw' of the Symfora Group at Amersfoort. In contrast to DSM-IV personality disorders, the Development Profile appeared to predict in a meaningful way the length of the treatment as well as a premature termination of treatment (drop-out). According to the Development Profile primitive psychodynamic behavioural patterns also predicted therapy-disruptive behaviour in patients during the first few months of treatment (infringements of treatment agreements, impulsive behaviour, and paroxysms of anger). The decrease of symptoms during the year of treatment and the way complaints developed during the treatment follow-up period were also acceptably well predicted by the Development Profile. This study is a foundation of the reliability and validity of the 'Development Profile'. It illustrates how a psychodynamic concept can be of assistance in understanding the psychopathology and for the indication of the correct treatment.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell47An excerpt from a clinical vignette from a person with borderline symptoms informing her coach (and psychoanalyst) 'Do you know what it is? My cousin is so irritating with her eternal yearning for comfortless sadness and misery and sombreness and gloom. A sentence like this: \"A person is naturally irreparably alone with some things (she is talking about her son). And, oh, maybe with most things.\" Do you know what she asked me when our granddaughter, the child was 10 (!),got out of bed one night because she kept thinking that all people would ultimately die and that she found that sad? Whether I had ever given her something by BLOEM to read! And do you remember which line she had picked to put on my mother's mourning card? 'It is raining and it is November...\" Oh yes, a fine poem, no doubt, I think so too, but for her there is Bloem's brokenheartedness in EVERYTHING and I have really got it up to here with that. November (J.C. Bloem) It is raining and it is November Autumn returns and besets The heart, which sadly, but more and more accustomed Bears its secret aches. And into the room, where uncomplainingly Everyday life is lived Shines from the comfortless streets A colourless afternoon light. The years go like they went, There is no distinction Between the numb memories And what is lived and still to come. Lost are the tender roads To escape the time; Always November, always rain, Always this empty heart, always. She really gets my goat with all her stories about her unhappy children and the unhappy girlfriends of her children and the unhappy colleagues she used to have, and sad neighbours and so on and so on. And she irritates me as well when she starts writing nonsense like: \"Such a long walk ... etc., I would look upon it as a DAY TRIP.\" That sounds so PEDANTIC, or am I wrong? She has NEVER been such a stickler for detail, but now she has got this Polish woman to teach Dutch to, she will PERSONAL SNIPPETS48immediately feel the DUTCH SCHOLAR which she is not! And then complaining that everybody makes (spelling) mistakes in their emails, and that SHE will not be correcting them! But it is not the spelling mistake, it is posturing, an affectation, showing that SHE knows, that a word in - ing is of feminine gender, whereas not one living soul cares about that any more in Dutch. And when I react slightly ironically, she goes \"Oh, but I do that quite automatically, you know, after all, I explained all this to my GRAMMAR SCHOOL students for so many years!\" Oh really, as if at Dutch schools for the past few decades people have bothered about whether a word is masculine and feminine! Poppycock, that's what it is. Of course I could try to shrug it off, not to get excited about it, not to be bothered, I could try to put on an endearing smile. But I cannot bring it off and I simply do not feel like crying along with her and being sad and moping and complaining and feeling pity for her! She probably does not realize this, but she IS exceptionally arrogant, yes, indeed! Advice, which is directed at ordinary people, who would never be able to understand HER very special existential problems! That's why, you see, that's why she irritates me so easily, with that tired, arrogant, all-understanding, powerless sadness of hers! And that is why I always in some kind of mulish obstructiveness have opposed her, I will try to find another perspective, I may at times be ironic, I will refuse to take her sadness and pathetic stories seriously. But obviously you agree with her, not with me, I understand.'49PSYCHOANALYSIS AS SELF-INITIATIVE1 T.I. Oei A couple of days ago (25 March 2010) I received the message from a close colleague that the provision of psychoanalysis (four or five times a week of intensive psychotherapy on the couch) has been struck from the list by the board of health insurances. This means that ongoing analytical treatment will still be financed from government funds and that new treatment is to be paid by the patients themselves. Thus we have returned to the earliest days, when Sigmund Freud treated patients at their homes or at his home at 19 Berggasse, Vienna. At first sight this means we are back to square one, and that is normally not a good sign. Of course, apart from much capital loss (because of looming loss of expertise of the analysts through fewer possibilities for analytical practice) and the impossibility of many patients to pay for treatment out of their own pockets, there is also a positive aspect. After all, this revolves around the motivation to take your development into your own hands, which everybody will confirm. Some 35 years ago, I myself took the initiative to go into analysis, after it had been suggested by my then psychiatric tutor that some analysis might be something for me. I had been in analysis according to the Jung method for six months with a student of his, and although I found it very interesting and I already felt slightly better, there was something missing. I myself did not think that the analysis of dreams in itself sufficiently met my need of self- knowledge and self-analysis. So I went to the Amsterdam Psychoanalytic Society and asked for a list of psychoanalysts. At the top of this list, for alphabetical reasons, was my own tutor, and I did not want to go to him. Second on the list was a lady, who happened to live close to me. She had her practice in Amsterdam West and I thought: I am going to try, although colleagues had already told me that most analysts had a waiting list for new analysands. Contact by telephone went swimmingly and within a week I could schedule an appointment with her. She told me a few things about the Association and asked me if I had the ambition for training in psychoanalysis. She was the secretary of the educational committee of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society at the time. I was slightly surprised by the question. I made it clear to her that I came for 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society , 2010, 25, 5, p. 108.PERSONAL SNIPPETS50myself and did not envisage any kind of training. I could start analysis within a few months. It turned out to be quite a productive analysis. It was five times a week, 45 minutes on the couch each time, an intensive treatment, characterized by free association, and punctuated with free ideas. I myself was a junior doctor training as a psychiatrist, and my salary was by no means sufficient to pay for the treatment. However, I got the opportunity to make so much extra money by doing physical examinations that treatment was affordable. Naturally I had to take restrictions in time and all sorts of personal limitations into account, but also for me, in a sense, the saying 'where there's a will, there's a way' was applicable. I sincerely hope that this experience will remain possible for all those colleagues who themselves have lots to offer.51EMOTIONS AT BEREAVEMENT T.I. Oei Spui , the Alumni magazine of the University of Amsterdam is a periodical containing a lot of information. On the obituary list in the first issue of 2010 there is the name of my late colleague Bart de Smit: Nicolaas Wilhelmus de Smit, 1930, Medicine 1955, emeritus professor of Forensic Psychiatry VU, Knight in the Order of the Dutch Lion (1 February). I got to know Bart in the early nineties, when I, employed at the Dr. S. van Mesdag Hospital since a few months, was summoned to the department where he had already been Psychiatric Advisor for years together with Cor van der Hooft, child and youth psychiatrist. Among other things he wanted to know what the significance was of the PhD thesis of Siegfried Tuinier, The psychiatrist and the wild man : a field study of the relation between psychiatric syndrome and criminality (1989). At the time it was rare for a psychiatrist working in the forensic field to take his PhD, and Siegfried had had the guts to do so. Taken quite by surprise by the abrupt question, I answered that I looked upon Siegfried's book as the product of an erudite author. Bart commented that he thought this was a diplomatic answer. Bart was an amiable colleague, charming and to the point, sometimes a bit provocative and now and then humoristic. To one of the colleagues he once remarked: I think of you every day, which brought a blush of shame to his cheeks. In his valedictory address Bart personally called me (I had just been appointed) 'the youngest professor of forensic psychiatry'. I had not expected to be mentioned at all, but that is the kind of person he was: warm, thoughtful and always willing to be meaningful as a colleague. In those early years he had to try and interest colleagues in the field of forensic psychiatry, which was hardly a respectable field with the generalists among psychiatrists. That business was not really a psychiatric task, let alone a psychiatric sub-specialism. The little club of forensic psychiatrists/ psychologists numbered twenty or thirty people at most then. They held an annual Justice Day when also the partners of colleagues took part, which always generated numerous anecdotes. One of those anecdotes was about a man who had held up a petrol station and who was not sentenced to TBS although the court had been advised to do so and the culprit himself expected it as well. 'Then I [Pietersen] call Bart de Smit at the Department, and he says: do you drive a car, Mr Pietersen? No, not yet, at the time. Neither do I, PERSONAL SNIPPETS52he says. So?' In other words, it won't trouble you or me, so why impose such an expensive detention. Bart fell ill some time after his retirement. I think he suffered from Parkinson's disease. At first he lived in London, a place that he loved. Unfortunately I lost contact with him, but I still remember him with emotion.53GETTING OVER INFLICTED SUFFERING MAY ALSO BE TRAUMATIC T.I. Oei Cancellation of limitation causes more misery NRC Handelsblad 29 March 2010 Victims of sexual abuse want recognition, but criminal law is the not proper instrument for that. Filing a claim for damages with a special fund would be a better idea, is what A.M. van Kalmthout suggests. A.M. van Kalmthout, professor of Restriction of freedom in immigration and criminal law at Tilburg University: Now that, after Ireland and Germany, the cesspool of child abuse in Catholic schools and boarding schools is opening up also in Holland, it is unavoidable that the people who still want to put the perpetrators on trial find support. BNR invited listeners to call in speak on air about the proposition that sexual offences, like war crimes, should have no limitation. At the moment limitation is set at twelve years and for the most serious sexual offences the term is twenty years. In contrast to other offences, this period does not start at the moment the offence was committed but at the moment when the victim reaches majority. Criminal law is overestimated. There is no denying that many victims only come forward at a later age. It often happens only when it dawns on them that they were not the only ones it happened to. That explains why, once the lid is off, so many people start to talk about what happened to them. They are justified in asking for understanding and recognition. It is fitting that atonement - financial, but also immaterial - should be made by those who have done this to them and by the institutions under whose auspices everything happened and who covered things up for decades. Whether the victims derive any real benefit from an abolition of the limitation can be seriously doubted. The suggestion sounds agreeable. It does justice to the demand not to let the perpetrators get off without punishment. Trial and punishment, the supposition goes, can contribute to the recognition the victim desires. In my opinion the possibilities of criminal law are overestimated. As more years pass between the moment of abuse and the possible criminal trial, hardly any beneficial effect of a trial is to be expected. The furnishing of proof. The biggest problem that I see is the furnishing of proof. Even today, especially in the case of sexual offences like child abuse, proof is hard PERSONAL SNIPPETS54to supply. After criminal trials in which it was impossible to convict the offenders because of lack of evidence, quite a few victims feel more miserable than before. What will it be like when such trials take place after forty years? The Penal Code makes strict demands on the furnishing of proof. When the defendant denies the allegations, in many cases the evidence is impossible to supply. And many defendants will deny. Either because they do not want to admit to the acts publicly in a criminal trial or because they have repressed things, but also because, in a number of cases, the acts did not take place as alleged. Such a thing is not exceptional and this should be taken this into account criminal proceedings. Going through the criminal process is often torturous for the victim, especially when it results in acquittal. It means a fresh open wound for the victim. Atonement. This is one of the main reasons for the legislator to determine the terms of limitation. Another reason is that with the passage of years the effectiveness of the punishment decreases. A large number of the potential defendants are now elderly or extremely advanced in years, or even deceased. What punishment can give sufficient satisfaction to the victim? Many victims do not want retribution and punishment: they want recognition of what they had to go through because of the offence. That recognition cannot be given through criminal law; it should come from a different source. It is, for instance, possible to put in a claim with the Schadefonds Misdrijven (Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund) and claims can be filed with the institutions under whose responsibility the offences took place. Some institutions even carry insurance for such cases. It is not to be expected that these institutions would dare invoke the statute of limitations. Mea culpa. But it is not only financial compensation that is involved. The need for recognition goes much deeper and should comprise more than a public 'mea culpa' by ecclesiastical institutions. Nor is the creation of an investigation commission into the scale and nature of the sexual offence within the church enough. Apart from this 'truth finding commission' there is also the need for a 'reconciliation commission'. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which managed to realize in South Africa years ago what could never have been achieved by means of formal criminal proceedings, should be a shining example to the Catholic Church to do justice to the justified call of the many victims of sexual abuse by church functionaries to be heard and recognized. Sooner or later everyone of us goes through a traumatic experience, even if it was only the first moment we were separated from our parents when we went to a nursery. But apart from this kind of 'ordinary' events, there are also special life events. Life events that put a mark on our souls, such as the loss of Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell55a partner, or a beloved member of the family, or a serious disaster or accident and suchlike. We often react thunderstruck: we look straight ahead, give slow reactions to signals, always give the same answers, and have no feelings; we are like zombies. Now the cesspool of sexual abuse of many years by (often closed) institutions is in the news. The Roman Catholic Church is the centre of public attention. Such things are practically always to be found in closed, cramped systems such as sects or radical movements, where isolation from society is the norm. We should not forget prison camps, war areas, and guerrilla activities. It is a serious fact that minors, children, young people, dependent people become the victims of people with a perverted use of power. As a rule such behaviour comes along not only with aggression but also with sex. Man's most basic instincts are involved. No matter how horrible, what is important is that the suffering that was inflicted on them should be dealt with properly. Reasons for the victims' long silence are especially feelings of shame and guilt. They blame themselves for the abuse that occurred. Children also always blame themselves when their parents decide to separate: it is my fault Daddy and Mummy are splitting up. I am to blame. And every system therapist/ psychotherapist/psychoanalyst experiences the system's impotence when, in such a discussion, the children are unable to voice any criticism of what the parents have done. We are dealing with a very precarious situation when we try to address sexual abuse, acts of violence within a closed system. First there must be some distance (in time, place, and person) to the event (the abuse or reliving the event), before it is possible to deal with the facts themselves, in a therapeutic respect as well as in a legal and social respect. A chance to process the fact, which gives both victim and perpetrator the opportunity to grant it a place in their lives. If, however, this happens too hastily, too abruptly, too much according to the First Aid model, namely 'putting out fires' in places and at times when the panic is highest, then this can only have disappointing results. Anton van Kalmthout warns that wisdom, caution and patience are needed, also in a political respect.57RISK ASSESSMENT IN INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE! T.I. Oei The man who on Thursday night, 13 May 2010, in Enschede, killed three people and then himself, had been detained last week in connection with threats uttered to his former girlfriend, one of the victims. The man was released after two days, as no direct threat was thought to exist. On Thursday night in an apartment on Utrechtlaan in Enschede the police found the bodies of four people killed by gunshots. They were a nine-year-old boy, his 35-year- old mother and her 18-year-old sister and a man of 35, the ex-boyfriend of the 35-year-old woman. This man, in all probability the perpetrator, is a man of Italian origin born in the Netherlands. The victims had moved from Brazil to the Netherlands in 2003. During the shooting two other women and two other children from Brazil were present in the apartment. The police and judicial authorities had been aware for a considerable time that domestic violence regularly took place in the relationship. In the past years the family had been in contact with the police between five and ten times. The relationship came to an end about six months ago. In mid-April this year the woman got in touch with the police again. According to the police spokesperson a few more incidents had taken place, culminating in the arrest on 4 May. That day for the first time the woman filed an official complaint against the man for threats. On 6 May the man was released. The police had extensive talks with both the man and the woman and concluded that there was no reason for further steps or the protection of the family. 'Domestic violence is a frequent occurrence', spokesperson Patricia van der Valk says. 'It is always difficult for the police and judicial authorities to find the right balance and do the right thing.' According to chief of police Rik de Boer 'the man and the woman could not live with each other, but could not do without each other either. Sometimes a short cooling down period will do. That seemed to be the case here as well. Both the woman and the ex- partner thought that things had returned to normal again to such an extent that release was warranted.' A tragic coincidence, but at the same time a highly unsatisfactory result where the guidance of the family or the persons in question is concerned. Violence is a fierce force, carrying in it every danger of re-offending, certainly when such violence takes place within relationships or families. In effect it PERSONAL SNIPPETS58is a socially important and well-described phenomenon for the application of risk assessment instruments. Perhaps it is desirable for the police and judicial authorities, but also for Child Care and Protection Boards, youth care agencies, and all sorts of other agencies that come across displays of violence to use risk assessment instruments more and more frequently. What is possible for the assistant prosecutor on the basis of data provided by, among other things, a risk assessment instrument is to put a domestic exclusion order on somebody for a specific duration.1 Then the 'heat is off', at least for some time, but naturally the main thing is long-term guidance, which must be such that re-offending can be (permanently) avoided. Still difficult cases will remain, for instance when the victim does not file a complaint with the police, or because there is no satisfactory relationship between the persons concerned and the professional or mediator. It should certainly be possible to predict serious violence, at any rate in a better way than is now done by professionals or persons concerned. At Tilburg University much research in this field is done by Dr. G.M.F. (Ren\u00e9e) R\u00f6mkens,2 former professor of Victimology/Interpersonal violence, in particular violence in the private sphere, in the International Victimology Institute Tilburg (INTERVICT), within the Institute for Victimology (Director: Prof. M.S. Groenhuijsen). Let us hope that the government will continue to make sufficient funds available for the careful study of this important social problem: violence within the family and violence within institutions (marriage, partnership, commune , etc.). After all, it is not only important that there is awareness of the problem, but also that further research is done to find solutions to prevent this violence. 1 Cf. Katinka L\u00fcnnemann, Ren\u00e9e 2009, pp. 941-946. 2 The Reporting Code Child Abuse and Domestic Violence was her initiative. Professionals within education, care, welfare, the Industrial Safety and Industrial Welfare Services are called upon to report serious violence to authorities like the Child Abuse Counselling and Reporting Centre [Advies en Meldpunt Kindermishandeling (AMK)] Geweld (ASHG)].59LACK OF INTERESTING CONTACT T.I. Oei At a congress of importance to me, I happened to enter a hall where there was a vast crowd of interested congress goers. Several halls had been made available because there was so much interest in the speaker from across the ocean, a big name in the profession. As far as I knew, he had already published quite a few interesting articles, most in a transparent, clear style, and also in a language that was accessible to people of lesser expertise and to the general psychiatric audience. I had already bumped into a colleague I had not seen for decades, and consequently I was really feeling good, because of these two surprises in one morning. However, the disillusion, which I did not manage to hide, was all the worse. The speaker spoke at an incredible speed with a broad American accent and a vast number of sheets, making me rapidly lose track of the line of his argument, in so far as I had been able to pick it up in the first place. I was under the impression that I knew a thing or two about the matter, but this story was quite beyond me, and as the time passed, my displeasure and irritation mounted. Particularly because I noticed that this colleague was not in the least interested in bringing his story across, but unfortunately only trotted out his speculations for himself. It was as if there were two worlds then: one of and for him, and another world that belonged to the audience: highly or averagely intelligent psychiatrists, psychologists and others. This highly intelligent speaker (who incidentally physically resembles Freud) displayed himself to the world as all-perceiving. This was also the case when he spoke of genetics, which is a matter of importance for us all and of which everyone in the audience wanted to know the latest developments. The speaker reminded me of one of my patients, who, already as a student at school, manifested himself as a 'nerd', and was called 'professor' and 'Mozart' by his fellow students, because he was the only one at is grammar school who had violin lessons and the only one who thought pop music and flower power weird phenomena. In hindsight he realized that he had always been afraid to be the odd one out and to be ostracized by his fellow students. Later he became a successful conductor and teacher, but he always remained that insecure, somewhat solitary man, who regularly talked to himself and tried to compensate his lack of social skills by means of thinking of clever constructions to outwit his colleagues or his bosses. After the erudite American colleague had finished his presentation, I left, with a feeling of indifference, and it was good to be outside again.61OLD AGE AND SAYING GOODBYE T.I. Oei A 92-year-old woman in Sydney (Australia) is accused of murdering her 98-year-old husband, we read on 13 March 2010. What exactly happened in the home of the couple the police do not yet know. After the neighbours had raised the alarm, police hurried to the apartment. Help came too late for the 98-year-old. He was found dead in his living room. It appeared he had been repeatedly hit in the head. The woman was taken into custody, the Australian media reported this on Saturday. Old age does not make immune to crime, nor to accidents. On the contrary. Continuing decline, both physically and mentally, is a heavy burden for the older person. As Douwe Draaisma puts it: memory defects cause gaps, and emptiness. That emptiness no one can live with.1 Research shows that old age has its own crime.2 What it boils down to is that increasing loneliness 1 Draaisma, D., Waarom het leven sneller gaat als je ouder wordt, (Why Life Speeds up As You Get Older), Groningen 2001, p. 239. 2 Van Alphen, S.P.J., & Oei, T.I., The increase of over-sixty crime the Netherlands: exploration Proces , philosopher, Wikipedia, 2010. was born in Algeria, to French parents (so-called 'pied-noirs'). After the death of his father, he left for Marseille with his mother and sister. He was admitted to the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, but could not complete his studies because he had to serve in the Second World War. After the fall of France, Althusser was interned in a German prison camp, where he became attracted to communism. After the war, Althusser restarted his studies, but he suffered ill health, both physically and mentally. He underwent electroshock therapy, but his mental condition would always remain problematic. In 1946 Althusser met the communist H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rytman, a Jewess originally from Lithuania, who was to be his companion until her death. In 1948 he became a member of the French Communist Party (PCF) and graduated ( agr\u00e9gation ) that same year with a dissertation on Hegel's philosophy. The period that followed was a turbulent one for left-wing France. The 1950s witnessed the de-Stalinisation of the communist party and a shift towards a more humanistic form of Marxism, which Althusser could not support; he felt a greater liking - with some reservations - for Chinese communism. Nor could the students' revolt of May 1968 find his support; in this Althusser followed the line of his party, and he condemned the students who took part in the revolt for their 'infantile' ideas. In 1980 Althusser strangled his wife H\u00e9l\u00e8ne in circumstances that are still unclear. Althusser stated that he had no memory of the event; he was supposed to have acted in a fit of madness. There were no witnesses. Althusser was diagnosed as suffering from diminished responsibility and he did not stand trial; instead he was hospitalized in a psychiatric institution from which he was discharged in 1983. He then retired to his house in Paris. Apart from his autobiography, he did PERSONAL SNIPPETS62and the death of members of the same generation, combined with a further loss of trusted relationships, make the individual focus more and more on his own person and his own problems. Interaction with the partner goes less smoothly, and the flexibility to bear everyday frustrations becomes proportionally less. The daily budget decreases perceptibly, certainly in times of crisis. When the daily contact with the outside world stagnates, on account of immobility, family feuds, or lack of social contact and support in a world that is becoming tougher all the time, aggressive tendencies can only be focused on the one remaining contact: one's own partner or housemate. In itself this is not alarming, on the contrary. What is important is that there is contact, but the value of the farewell is determined by the answer to two questions: how will we associate with each other in times to come and what kind of ending do we envisage? This holds good particularly in relationships that have lasted decades. That Freud himself found this difficult is demonstrated among other things by his psychoanalytical treatment of Pankejeff (The Wolf Man)3. not write anything in the last few years of his life. Althusser died in 1990 of a heart attack. 3 Kanzer M & Glenn J. (eds.), Freud and his Patients , New York 1980. 63RECOGNITION AND APPRECIATION OF IMPORTANCE THROUGH THE GENERATIONS*1 T.I. Oei Carlos Kleiber (1930-2004) was the model of classical conductors striving for excellence. In the press, he was repeatedly called the best conductor ever. He was the only son of the world-famous conductor Erich Kleiber (1890- 1956), who was said to have lamented that Carlos had musical talents. It was not clear why the father thought so. Against his will the father sent Carlos to Zurich to a prestigious school and held the opinion that he should do something serious instead of the pursuit of music, namely chemistry. But it was not long before Carlos went his own way, which in reality meant a way that resembled that of his father: composition, making music (among other things singing, plying the piano and timpani) and conducting. Already in his early twenties (like his father), he conducted an orchestra for the first time. Like his father, Carlos perfected every preparation. Sometimes quasi- unendingly: the father could have scores of rehearsals with the orchestra before he was satisfied. Carlos went even further: he might cancel concerts at the last moment and for unfathomable reasons! Probably because he was not satisfied with the performance of the orchestra. His few filmed appearances sometimes show an amiable, smiling Carlos, with a conducting style that made it appear as if he magically produced the melody from his baton on the spot: his carriage, arm and hand movements appeared perfectly attuned to speed, pitch and vibration, sometimes interspersed with a slightly nervous expression, aimed at the orchestra, not at an individual violinist or soloist. One of his rehearsals with an orchestra shows how sensitive and light hearted his working method was. No one was admonished, it was always about slightly more pianissimo, or with somewhat greater expressiveness or restraint. His Kleibergrams (notes scribbled on bits of paper he left behind for the orchestra) testify to his literary talents. For instance, the love duet in the first act of Othello should be regarded 'as a sprinkling of snow on a Christmas tree'. In this way, the maestro achieved the optimum effect. His somewhat unorthodox conduct was soon identified with the image of the musician of genius: someone who went his own way, beyond the control of anyone. His musically independent, but social conduct (he could be very agreeable and good company) brought many requests from all over the world to display his talents. Most of these invitations he turned down. Not 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society, 2010, 25, 10, pp. 191- 192.PERSONAL SNIPPETS64one journalist could tempt him to an interview. The story went that he had identified with the music and the intentions of the composer to such an extent that he would relive as it were the creative agony of the composer when he was rehearsing to perform his work. This allowed him to reproduce what the composer in question had tried to express. The role he played was only that of the composer's interpreter, centuries after the piece had been composed. He chose favourites: Beethoven symphonies, operas by Berg, Bizet, Puccini, Strauss, Verdi, Wagner, and some other works, e.g. those by Dvor\u00e1k. He seemed to have internalized those works. Such identification with an object is of course an emotional and energy-sapping affair. His Slovenian wife (a ballet dancer) died and within a year he passed away as well, 74 years old. But his retiring way of life suggests that his strengths had been depleted slowly but surely by depression and emotional exhaustion. Why he must have felt misunderstood, may be explained by taking a closer look at his youth. Carlos spent his youth in boarding schools. An attachment problem must have played a part, for in stories about his youth there is hardly any mention of his mother. The father, by nature an overbearing person, did not wish a career as a conductor for him. Reports say the son was sensitive, insecure, afraid of failure and wavering. The father died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 66. Ever since his emigration to Argentine (he was then 45), he never had long-term contracts like at the beginning of his career. Nor could the son, in his later life, be bound to long-term appointments. He was afraid he would have to occupy himself with things that he disagreed with on principle, for example, the commercialization of a conductor's existence (with lots of income generated by recordings). In the end (after the age of 50), he only worked as a conductor when there was nothing left in the fridge. This was reported by a colleague (Herbert von Karajan), who was known for his lucrative record contracts. Von Karajan (and later also Bernard Haitink) never made a secret of his admiration of Carlos' extraordinary conducting talent ('conductor of conductors'). Carlos loved expensive cars, but his conscience obviously denied him buying them himself. He once accepted an Audi limousine as a present for a once-only concert in Germany. The father (not Jewish), highly principled, consistently refused to follow the Nazis or to subject himself to them. Therefore many prestigious functions in Germany passed him by. In the 1930s he emigrated with his family to Argentina, where he changed the name of his son Karl into Carlos. The father had different plans for his son, but could eventually not prevent him becoming a conductor. Whether Carlos lived in fear of his father the various reports do not make clear, but he was adamant that he was not to be called 'the son of papa'. Once Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell65he made his debut as a conductor under the alias Karl Keller2 upon which the father informed Mr Keller that he knew that he and his son were one and the same person. From a very early age, Carlos suffered under the weight of his father's importance, just as he suffered from missing a mother who could provide some counterbalance (emotionally and factually). The course of Carlos' life shows that, in spite of all sorts of ambivalences, he sought his father's appreciation and recognition. He tried to find this recognition and appreciation in the field in which his father had become so famous, a territory where the father was challenged to control himself not only to be able to bear the presence of his son, but also by so doing to afford his brilliant talents a chance of success. To be the child of a genius must be hard (how can you ever surpass your father?), and is an even greater agony when, as the child, you are also a genius: who is better? Patricide cannot take place psychodynamically, to detach yourself from the father, without - by means of your excellent achievements, symbolically - killing him. The uncertainty of the issue - who is the better, father or son - keeps eating out your insides like a consumptive disease. In the case of Carlos Kleiber, it is certain that he gave his all, but it is also certain that the early death of his father (Carlos was 26 years old then, too young to be able to claim his own place in the world of conductors) stood in the way of the father's recognition of the son's achievements. There is a need for recognition in the sense of: it is sufficient for me as a parent that you are there, whatever you do. It is remarkable that the father had been orphaned as a toddler and had not been able to find recognition from his own father either. Psychodynamically, it goes for both Erich and Carlos that - despite their extraordinary talents (and the joy and happiness they brought to many generations of music lovers) both demonstrably missed out on the happiness and joy of living. Talk of transgenerational pathogenesis (lack of parental recognition through generations). * On the occasion of the 120th and the 80th anniversaries of Erich and Carlos Kleiber 2 Carlos wanted to make his own way. As the son of Erich (=Karl) but not as the son of the world-famous Kleiber. There is ambivalence in the choice of the pseudonym: he did not want to be recognized, but went - symbolically - underground (Keller means cellar).67IN HIS OWN W AY, AT HIS OWN SPEED T.I. Oei Yesterday a colleague I much respect and admire gave me the message that he had to drop out. He had decided to abandon his initial ambition to take his PhD, considering his personal circumstances and the fact that he wanted to continue as a clinician, with his patients and his everyday activities. At first everything went quite well, but from the moment he was invited to become the manager of a department he got more and more rattled: both as a person and as a professional. My feelings about too rapid a career flight I have discussed before in an article - Why further research like that of Schnabel from 1982is needed , cf google, t.i.oei- but quite apart from that I am also concerned with the human aspect we so often miss in organizations. In these institutions what matters are mostly the results, and for the rest there is a fairly large void. Meetings and receptions are organized, because they are unavoidable, but the lack of communication that is present below the surface is then often the reason that they are not fully enjoyed. It is after all in the nature of the beast that occasions like parties and jubilees go along with a large proportion of stress, sometimes even greater stress than when we have to mourn the loss of a friend or loved one. Speed, the digital world, dealing with others more and more in passing, rather than at home or over drinks do not make our social lives any easier. And whichever way you look at it: each of us needs a hug now and then, either in the form of a compliment or in the form of a conversation with some human warmth. I value this colleague highly, and I want to thank him for the opportunity he has given me to remain in contact with him. In his own way, at his own speed. 69TAKING YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY, AND YET GOING AGAINST THE COURT'S INJUNCTION Is this new justice, or merely base commercialism? T.I. Oei Crime reporter Peter R. de Vries will be broadcasting material of Koos H. recorded by hidden camera after all. On Friday, the court in Amsterdam ruled that the material was not to be broadcast after interim injunction proceedings had been brought against broadcasting company SBS and TV production company Endemol by Koos H. Both parties are prepared to pay the penalties of \u20ac 15,000 each. De Vries, SBS, and Endemol are of the opinion that the multiple confessions of H., who was sentenced to life for triple murder and has served thirty years already, serve 'an enormous social interest' which outweighs the privacy of the convict. The material was made of H. by means of a hidden camera in the psychiatric hospital where H. is detained. 'It is for the first time that I go against a Court injunction, but if there is any case worth doing so, it is this one,' De Vries says. 'I cannot and I will not accept this. The way in which Koos H. talks about his young victims, his body language and his distorted psyche show that this serial killer is still exceedingly dangerous.' According to De Vries, H. answers questions the survivors have been asking for years. De Vries admits that the decision to broadcast his material on Sunday night after all was not an easy one. 'I do not willingly or frequently break the law, but this case justifies it.' The penalty was not put at \u20ac15,000 for nothing. The demand in summary proceedings was \u20ac500,000. That he, a crime reporter, breaks the law is something he takes in his stride. 'It is also against the law to go over the speed limit: you know there are consequences. In this case, I am willing to take them.' Policies on the basis of taking your own responsibility, as the government would like to see it, may sometimes bring about a radical shift and demonstrate a conflict of duties. That the bodies who want to make the broadcast, take a court ruling into account in their policy deliberations, and subsequently ignore it, is unprecedented. The transparency of settling PERSONAL SNIPPETS70conflicts in court has been further interpreted in the light of considerations that may lead to ignoring the ruling, in spite of the penalty imposed. That the two TV organizations are willing to pay the penalties seems to be a shift in justice. The court's injunction is regarded as a piece of advice which one may lawfully accept or ignore. This cannot be justified; it has every appearance of taking the law into one's own hands. The TV moguls behave like higher justices of appeal who either express a closer interpretation or make a new pronouncement, this time with the media interests as their motivation. Or is it a simple commercial interest that tips the balance? It is a long lane...71SAYING FAREWELL, A PROCESS THAT HAS NO ENDING1 T.I. Oei Six months ago, I was overcome by a number of life events everyone finds in his path at some time or other. It happens to us all. For a while everyday misery is no longer ordinary, but quite bad for a longer or even for a very prolonged period. I became more irritable and restless, was unable to immediately get things organized. I was sometimes going round in circles in my daily programme of activities and, for a time, things were by no means easy. This is also what the analytical patient experiences when it is time to say goodbye. One patient took two years to shape a farewell. It went like this: he would sometimes appear, often a few days in a row, then he would not: fluctuating between attracting and letting go. He talked about many things that used to be, as if he wanted to make up for what he had found difficult to express before, when he was on the couch. Sometimes it was all, then for a while nothing. A couple of days gone, then a couple of days of hard work on the couch. And then for a time nothing at all: either he was not there, or he did not speak when he was on the couch, as if free association had struck a dry well. There was no flow at all, let alone a flow of thought. One of the other patients came to me, a year after analysis had ended, with the message below. We had told each other that silences of some years after termination of the analysis regularly occurred, and that such silences had a meaning: letting go takes time. She mailed this message: In spite of the prescribed silence I want you to know this: I feel like a flower in a never-ending movement of opening. I am experiencing an enormous transition. Recently I even found myself crying over the suffering of other people. Friends keep coming and open up with me. I have an enormous feeling of love for everyone, even for those who seemingly put obstacles in my way. I owe you very much. I think you should know this. Love, W. Saying goodbye is a process of giving and taking, of attracting and of letting go, of remembering and denying, of feeling and of not feeling. I find these 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society , 25, 9, 2010, p. 176.PERSONAL SNIPPETS72feelings encroaching on me more frequently. It must have to do with the progress of life. But also with encountering loss more frequently: of friends, relatives, work, and activities. We must manage to deal with such losses, so that life may take on a new appearance. The appearance of looking ahead, realizing that much is gone. Both visions are important. This is probably why the mildness in people of experience is so prominent. Saying goodbye is also a challenge: like with that colleague who, on the morning of another colleague's funeral, had been occupied with this, that, and the other to such an extent, that, coming to the funeral in a hurry, she announced over the coffee that that morning she had realized so intensely what the deceased felt, and that, exhausted as she was, she had thought: 'I might just as well lie down, like him'. Such an approach to the farewell is obviously comforting: our own end won't be all that bad, it is really quite natural.73IN HOW FAR IS RESEARCH INTO SPECIFIC HU - MAN CHARACTERISTICS ABJECT? T.I. Oei If one were to take a group of tramps as an example of the lack of sufficient moral awareness of what can and what cannot pass muster, both in a cognitive and an affectionate sense, sometimes the thought crops up that this group would be characterized by anti-social habits and ways of life. This goes along with fearful expectations as to defects in the offspring. The offspring would supposedly be burdened with a lack of affectionate/cognitive moral awareness. In this way debatable ideas are formed about whether or not pseudo-hereditary traits exist in the case of tramps and nomads who form an unstable, self-centred society which is closed to society. We should be on our guard against considering or even identifying habits and customs that in themselves might be a means of existence, like keeping body and soul together by purloining other people's material goods, as unchangeable, biologically embedded, abject characteristics in behaviour, language or outward appearance in groups of people. The Nazis persecuted the gipsies, often for that suspect reason. The occurrence of certain characteristics in groups of people, unmistakeably leads to the exclusion of exactly those groups in which the alleged characteristics are mistrusted or abhorred by other groups of people. Diagnosing or branding fellow citizens on the basis of exterior dispositions, that is to say conduct, physical or mental characteristics, appealing characteristics (like cleverness), or conversely those manifestations of a person which are considered ridiculous (such as the hunchback or the theatrical exaggerations of the fortune teller) will sooner or later inescapably lead to discrimination. And before you know it, the damage has been done. In ignoring, excluding, banishing various people or sending them to Coventry the so-called social infection delusion is made concrete. People start avoiding each other more and more, evade any form of confrontation, stop correcting each other. They fear the supposed objectionable aggression of the alleged opponent. Impeded by the results of their social infection delusion every creative attempt to come to a solution by means of mutual respect and appreciation is suppressed. Naming the alleged biologically embedded phenomena, or characteristics, for groups of delinquents would mean the opposite form of exclusion. Typifying people for certain biological traits that often occur in defendants and justiciables (who may or may not have been judged by society) might be PERSONAL SNIPPETS74a solution for their better reception, treatment or change. That would appear to be an attractive datum, if people who have been condemned by society, and who have been classified by experts as suffering from a disease, were to suffer from treatable disorders. The question is whether classifying people according to a specific model really leads to determining illnesses or disorders which can be dealt with in their causality. Up to now this has not been the case. The classification model (for instance DSM-IV) only serves to systemize the research plan to be tested and should make the review of the research hypothesis in question possible. So it is purely an aid for researchers to be able to test in a predictable way the (quantitative or qualitative) research models used. Such a system of qualification is in effect a special language and must help bridge the lack of communication between researchers of different cultures and continents. It serves therefore a teleological motive, namely increasing of contact between researchers, scientists, professionals, governments in the world, in order to be able to (objectifiably) communicate with each other For instance the application of statistical models is just as much teleologically determined. What they are intended to demonstrate is that a specific research design and the used analytical methods are, to put it bluntly, up to scratch and in their results can substantiate the truthful impression they create. That means: can the results in fact have the effect they suggest? Connected with this are the questions: are the analytical methods that are used followed consistently? Do the theoretical starting points follow a recognizable course in the research methods followed? It is self-evident that in this digitalized world, in which facts and knowledge management can determine financial scope, classification is of enormous importance. Once more: classification as a means of making people communicate. But in the first place communication is an economic factor: it leads people to a form of existence, which may lead to sufficient funds. And that leads us back to the initial question. In how far is research into specific human characteristics abject? It can only be reprehensible if it would de facto mean the exclusion of people, banishing them and eliminating them socially. Therefore continuous alertness is of essential importance. A task therefore for the ethically-minded researcher. 75FAITH KEEPS A MAN'S BALANCE T.I. Oei Rosary 'saves' British soldier A British soldier is convinced that his rosary saved his life in Afghanistan, like it saved the life of his great-grandfather during World War II. British media reported this on Tuesday (3-08-10) The 19-year-old soldier was on patrol in the Afghan province of Helmand when his rosary slipped off his neck. He stooped to pick it up and then noticed he was standing on a landmine. His colleagues were able to free him from this perilous situation after 45 minutes. The soldier's great-grandfather had had a similar experience. He was walking through open field with a number of soldiers when he stooped to pick something up. At that moment a bomb exploded. He was the only survivor. It turned out he had picked up a rosary. Whether such a story is pure coincidence or not can hardly be tested and ultimately it is not so very important. The believer's attribution will be: through the aid of a supernatural power, in this case the Virgin Mary, such a special thing is possible. Also unbelievers can give shape to what is special. What is striking is that your faith, in yourself or something else, can bring about a lot. The belief in your own ability, the idea that what you can do yourself may make the difference. It may also end badly. Primo Levi,1 Italian author, was of a depressive nature (whether or not being vexed and taunted in his youth had something to do with that or had a negative influence on his depressive inclination is uncertain) and his concentration camp experiences did not improve his mental state. Ultimately he died at the age of 67 in an incident (he fell down a staircase). Bystanders and the coroner thought of suicide. In spite of or owing to his depressive nature he produced important works. Primo Levi states in his entire oeuvre that the improvement of mutual understanding is not found in grand and compelling actions and in the great, old virtues but in the daily exercise in small virtues. Anyone who wants to can start at once under all circumstances. This shows how he persisted in the thought that he should leave the people something sensible. 1 Ian Thomas, Primo Levi, A life , New York: Henry Holt and Company, 2002.PERSONAL SNIPPETS76Faith in yourself makes your own goals attainable, and in that way setbacks can be more easily dealt with. I once had a colleague who wanted to edit his thesis with me. He knew he would stand very little chance. What he did have was his belief in his own possibilities and the firm conviction that what he was aiming for was possible. From his partner he had adopted the art that whatsoever happened, nothing would change his own will to make something of it. It took this colleague quite a long time to obtain his PhD. But this aside it was quite clear that as he finished his pages of text, he more and more believed that he would be successful. In doing there was a reinforcement of his sense of self and his willingness to give it all he had. During World War II Viktor Frankl2, a psychiatrist had been interned in a concentration camp. As Jew he was the 'enemy' of the Nazis. He was on a list for the gas chamber. However he kept his belief in the meaning of life and of his own existence. His fellow prisoners he saw succumb, one by one, through illness, lack of strength, total malaise or the inhumane treatment. He himself, however, remained alive, and he survived the war. He subsequently accomplished the so-called third Viennese psychotherapy direction (Logotherapie), after that of Alfred Adler (Der Wille zur Macht) and that of Sigmund Freud (Die Macht des Unbewusstes) The methods according to Adler, Freud and Jung (Swiss) formed the three depth psychologies; Frankl's logotherapy is a form of existential analysis. Viktor Frankl became 92 years old and conquered the world (he remained lucid) with his ideas. In the sixties I even had the privilege of corresponding with him. A most amiable and friendly man who never lost the belief in his own abilities, not even for one day of his life. 2 V.E. Frankl, De zin van het bestaan. Een inleiding tot de logotherapie . (The meaning of An Introduction to Logotherapy) Rotterdam: Ad Donker , 1997.77A GREAT TREE Oei The police arrested a 28-year-old man from Dongen who had assaulted a psychiatrist in the psychiatric centre Jan Wier in Tilburg. The victim was kicked and beaten. He sustained several bruises in the face and the kidney area, a black eye and a number of abrasions. The alleged perpetrator, a patient at Jan Wier, was arrested and is in detention. The man says that psychiatrists have destroyed his life. It is mostly underage boys from normal families who are responsible for the many threats addressed to politicians in The Hague. Case officer Nicole Vogelenzang said this in AD last Saturday. The boys, whose ages average at 13.8 years, often place without any further consideration 'one death threat after the other on the Internet' the paper writes, basing this statement on data from the Team Threatened Politicians of the Hague police. Most threats target PVV leader Geert Wilders, outgoing prime minister Balkenende coming second. Often youngsters place such messages on their Hyves pages in the supposition that no one will read those things anyway. Last year there were 386 reports of threats. This year, up to now, there have been 214 reports. It is true threats are also placed by frustrated men. The fact that the Internet is so easily accessible plays a great role. We might wonder if coincidences such as these represent a definite trend. We have the impression that more than ever before we have made such active displays into a trend. Venting our internal mental conflicts, like banging doors, giving vociferous comments, is a form of communication which we prefer to fisticuffs, sneakily trying to do someone in, and especially allowing our own responsibility to lapse or leaving things to others. The research of some years ago by Dr. Rob Brouwers, first physician of Trajectum Hoeve Boschoord, about impulsive, affective violent behaviour clearly shows that the more people are given (or even take) the opportunity to channel their frustrations by means of the spoken word, the less expressively they need to be acted out.2 That adolescents of today increasingly use the 1 Published in: T.I. Oei, 2 Reaction of Rob Brouwers dd. 16-08-10: The explanation that this boy gave, namely that psychiatrists had ruined his life, might well be an interpretation after the fact. I mean, it has the appearance of a premeditated (instrumental) action: psychiatrists PERSONAL SNIPPETS78pc and the Internet to vent their feelings is in itself a good thing. Let them communicate, by means of Hyves, Facebook, twitter and such like. Do not forget adults (politicians and policy makers) readily use these media as well, to channel their emotions electronically. The expectation is that as a result less aggression needs to be pointed physically at the intended opponent(s). That aggression nowadays occurs more frequently than before in Mental Health Care institutions is a well-known fact. My colleague Henk Nijman, professor of forensic psychology of the Radboud University Nijmegen, frequently published about this phenomenon. Still, we should not forget that 'if you break the pottery, you have to pick up the pieces yourself' not only holds good for children/adults, but also for patients. The responsibility for their own behaviour should rest as much as possible with the person themselves. The primary assignment is growing up as a developmental task. That is why reporting such an incident to the police can be just as educational as a pedagogical slap in the case of children. destroy my life => I destroy a psychiatrist, but it is possible that the violent behaviour came about impulsively after all and that it was the lack of verbal forms of expression that played a part in this. Exactly in the case of mounting stress the ability to give verbal reactions rapidly diminishes, especially in the differentiation. You have to make do with one-liners then, like Get lost, Go away, or Stop it. One stage further not one more word is uttered and non-verbal forms of expression give some indication of what is going on. Especially psychiatrists needs to be on the lookout for this. Most workers in forensic psychiatric institutions are familiar with this and take their distance on time. 79MORALITY AND THE PHILOSOPHER1 T.I. Oei One of the most striking quotes to be recorded from the mouth of Ludwig Wittgenstein was: 'How can I become a philosopher of any standing, if I can barely manage to be a decent human being?' This brilliant philosopher, who lived morally and consciously and was one of the greatest thinkers of the twentieth century, often wondered what his justification for living was. He was a son of an incredibly rich family, in which the father (already a man of substance and wealth by inheritance) as an industrialist in the Habsburg Austrian Hungarian Empire towards the end of the nineteenth century was the key figure in Viennese cultural life. In a material and cultural sense Ludwig Josef Johann (1889-1951) himself grew up as the youngest child of the family in an almost paradisiacal milieu. The family numbered eight children, five of whom were boys. Within a few decades, father Karl (1847- 1913), an engineer, had amassed a fortune in the steel industry, and when he was fifty could well afford to live off his income and focus his attention on his hobbies, for instance the arts, composing poetry and writing articles about the economy. Ludwig's mother, Leopoldine, was an ardent lover of art (for instance music) and culture. She would often organize musical soirees, and Brahms and Mahler were frequent houseguests. Ludwig's older brother Paul became a concert pianist, and after he had lost an arm in World War I, Ravel and Strauss wrote one-handed concerts for him. Ludwig had lots of talents, he was very musical, played the clarinet, and had a photographic memory. He could whistle complete musical works. He was also technically gifted, and already as a child he built a sewing machine. His religious leanings Ludwig got from his mother, a Roman Catholic, while his father was from Protestant stock. Religious awareness was always the theme of his life: a few times he considered entering a monastery. But just as often he was so depressed that he considered ending his life. Three of his brothers committed suicide (also as a result of -contemporaries say- the domineering attitude of the father, who put high demands on his children). Yet his most intimate thoughts concerning religion and problems with mood swings he kept hidden to the outside world. Only infrequent traces can be found in his works. 1 Published in: T.I. Oei, SNIPPETS80Being the domineering person he was, Karl had pigheaded ideas about education. He himself assembled study packages for his children who were home-taught until they were fourteen. Ludwig did not have a level that was sufficient for admission to a Viennese grammar school or Realschule. He scraped into the Realschule of the provincial town of Linz, the same school Adolf Hitler went to. Ludwig spent three unhappy years there and left without a final certificate, necessary for university entrance. He dearly wanted to study technology and that is why (urged by his parents) he went to Berlin Charlottenburg. He could not really find his feet there either and he left again after three failed terms. Yet he became interested in building aircraft and started studying this subject in Manchester. Although he was registered as a student at Manchester University for two years, her spent most of that time on the European mainland. He designed a propeller with jet propulsion, and was fascinated by the mathematical side of aeronautics. In this way he landed in mathematics and he was fascinated by its philosophical foundations. Taking advice from all and sundry about which literature was interesting, he got into the tome Principles of Mathematics by Bertrand Russell. He was fascinated by it, although he had hardly been schooled in philosophy. Before then he had already read something by Schopenhauer. Russell's work had given him the main part of the latest developments in the fields of logic and philosophy (Gottlob Frege en Bertrand Russell). He got in touch with Frege, who advised him to continue his studies with Russell. He followed the advice and in 1912 enrolled in Cambridge as a student with Russell. He spent five terms there and learnt a lot. He and Russell discussed logics and philosophy. Fairly soon the relationship between Russell and Wittgenstein was no longer that of teacher-student, but a relationship on a more equal footing developed. Russell ('he [meaning Ludwig] is the most gifted person since Moore') became increasingly influenced by Wittgenstein's opinions. Ludwig travelled a lot and frequently isolated himself to pursue his studies. For example he built himself a hut far away in Norway (towards the end of 1913) in order to be able to go deeply into logic. G.E. Moore came to visit and jotted down Ludwig's ideas, and these notes were later to grow into the Tractatus logico-philosophicus . In 1914 he became a soldier in the Austrian army and spent two years on the eastern front, Krakow and Lwow. In 1916 he was sent to officers' training in Olm\u00fctz, where he had lengthy conversations with Paul Engelmann about religion. After the capitulation of the Austrian-Hungarian army he was a prisoner of war in a camp near Monte Cassino. Shortly before the war his father had left him a considerable fortune. He had a life style then that mirrored his wealth. However, the war meant a turning point in his personal opinions. He gave all his money to his brothers and sisters, led a simple life, no longer flashy (for instance, in contrast to his dress from before the war, he seldom wore a cravat). He had always had somewhat ascetic tendencies, Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell81and because during the war he had read Gospel in brief by Leo Tolstoy which impressed him enormously, he seems to have gone through a complete change. Whether this was to do with the sense of sinfulness, such as Tolstoy could so vividly describe, or that his own feelings of homosexuality were the deciding factor, is not clear. What is quite clear is that Wittgenstein was a very different person after the war than before. He frequently expressed himself in greater irritation, had an eccentric way of life. When he became a prisoner-of -war he had nearly finished the manuscript of his main work ' Die Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung' better known as the Tractatus logico-philosophicus . He completed the manuscript in the camp, aided by discussions about his ideas with someone who was also interested in logic. He managed to send a copy of it to Russell, but could initially not find a publisher for it. In the end, in 1921, Russell managed to publish it in German, with an introduction written by himself, and in 1922 the English translation appeared. After Wittgenstein had obtained the book he absolutely disagreed with Russell's introductory words, and he blamed Russell for not having understood a word. Do not forget that at the end of 1919 he had had penetrating discussions with Russell about this work when they met in the Netherlands. The Trac tatus is the only book Wittgenstein has written. Much later, in the late twenties, he got his PhD on the basis of this book in Cambridge with Russell and Moore. In the meantime he had got the idea that philosophy was over for him and he wanted to become a schoolmaster, which he did. For two years he was a teacher at a village school near Vienna, where he was far from happy. He went to other schools but never stayed anywhere for long. He produced a pronouncing dictionary for use at elementary school. His irascibility and his tough discipline repeatedly got him into conflicts with the parents of pupils. In 1926 he returned to Vienna. He got depressed because he had failed as a teacher, became a gardener and for the third time contemplated whether the monastery was not the place for him. He asked for an interview but was told that his motives were not the right ones after all and that monastic life would not give him what he expected of it. Fortunately he was distracted by having to design and build a house for one of his sisters. Architecturally the house was such a success, that G.H. von Wright thought that the house had the same 'static beauty' as the Trac tatus. This success gave him renewed optimism and he got into contact with the Viennese Circle, philosophers of the Viennese University. He did make their acquaintance, but refused membership. His rekindled interest in philosophy, however, led him to the conclusion that the Trac tatus had not solved all philosophical problems. This conclusion brought forth renewed activities in philosophy. He decided to return to Cambridge, completing his academic involvement with his PhD. He was offered a Fellowship, and PERSONAL SNIPPETS82was philosophically productive. After a period of five years he decided to emigrate to Russia and he started to learn Russian. He was a great admirer of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and had always had great respect for this immense country. He visited Russia in 1935, but did not live there. He spent a year in his hut in Norway to return to Cambridge afterwards. In 1939 he succeeded Moore as Professor of philosophy in Cambridge. However, before he could get started, World War II broke out. Until 1944 he worked as a messenger boy, first in Guy's Hospital, after that in the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne. He had become a British national, so he did not have to be interned. He was active as a professor in the years 1945-1947. He hated the conversations at High Table, preferring his own company. Towards the end of 1947 he left Cambridge, settled down in Ireland in a hut and later in a hotel. Here he completed the main work of his later phase, the Philosophische Untersuchungen . In 1949 he discovered he had developed cancer. Until his death he stayed with friends in Oxford and Cambridge. As best he could he kept jotting down his philosophical thoughts. Although many biographies were written about him, each and every one of them is a rather subjective depiction of his person. Painting with a wide brush, it is possible to say that he was a somewhat dominant man, living intensely, with strong likes and dislikes, restless and complicated. He could focus his piercing eyes on you and had a fierce, inflexible nature. He impressed people with his forcefulness and the striking gestures he made when talking. His classes were characterized because he vocalized his thoughts. He became known by his Trac tatus but in those classes he also rejected many of its most important theorems. He would discuss the new ideas he had formed. This gave his students the impression that they were witnessing an important development. Sometimes he would only say: 'I am being stupid, today!' Sometimes he would react intemperately to students' suggestions that he disagreed with. He was in essence a vagrant, a nomad, who could never stay in one place long, always on the look out for a next location, and then off again. In the company of friends he might manage to remain for some time, but when he was on his own, which happened frequently, he could not cast off his restlessness. He had many professions, but none, not even his chair, could give him any satisfaction. He led a fragmented life, and it is probable that there were few moments of real happiness in his life. He could be a good friend and he was generous and kind. But to other people he could be harsh and rejective. There was sometimes an attitude of a certain arrogance, intolerance and rudeness. He was even actively engaged -for unknown reasons- in trying to keep many of his students from pursuing an academic career. He was a self-taught man who did not have an ordinary educational and academic background. His career was scattershot, but his brilliant nature allowed him to gain expertise in many fields much faster than others. He had had an ideal youth as far as material and intellectual possibilities were concerned. Which is also why the emotional obstacles which he had to overcome in his youth Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell83and the general course of things should not be underestimated as decisive developmental factors. This leads to a hypothesis about the personality of this special man, one of the greatest thinkers -perhaps even the greatest- of the twentieth century. Had he been more gifted as a communicator he would have obtained the mantle of greatest philosopher -prizes and honours and respect would have been heaped upon him by society. Now there was only an almost hidden death for him. For he was averse to this kind of social attention, such as honours and tributes. A force that made him an icon to independently-minded, unconventional people. Literature A.C. Life , Berkeley/Los Angeles/London: The University of California Press, 1988.

Oei Women of middle age, who are regularly subjected to stress, have 65% bigger chance of Alzheimer's disease. This is shown by a Swedish study of 1,415 women. No cause for a panic, the scientists soothingly add. Also many people with stress do not develop Alzheimer's. 'So there is no point in needlessly putting a scare into people.' In the course of the study the women were interviewed at three moments -in 1968, 1974 and 1980- about stress. Stress was defined as a feeling of irritation, tension, nervousness, fear, fright or sleeping problems, for the duration of one month or longer. The women were between 38 and 60 years old when the study began. 161 women developed Alzheimer's during the study. The more frequently the women reported of stress, the greater the chance of Alzheimer's. Those who indicated that they were regularly subjected to stress had 65% more chance of the disease. Constant stress on two measuring moments heightened the risk by 73%; stress on all three moments doubled the chance of the memory affliction. According to the researchers this study is the first that proves that stress in middle age can have negative effects on the memory. But they do not think a warning is necessary as the most women who had stress in the study did not develop Alzheimer's. (23-08-10) As in lots of epidemiological research, that is: research in large numbers of people, there is a larger or a lesser chance of contracting a specific affliction in comparison with a control group. But most people from such an a-select group with the same risk factors will remain healthy. It is important to know whether the people who were not exposed to any risk factor also had the same chance not to develop the disease as those who ran the risk of getting the disease and actually did get it. It is impossible to study these two things at the same time. So the mere fact that the study group of people did show higher probability for the development of the disease than the control group is of importance only for that group. Generalizing is something that as a doctor I would not readily do, for what is stress (sleeping problems and fretting is different from experiencing fear or being shocked, or suffering the loss of a partner etc.) what is the definition, how long must the stress have existed, is it a different kind of stress than the stress people usually feel, and so on and so forth. Questions that remain unanswered. People soon forget things, especially when you ask them whether they felt stress (nervousness etc.) a month ago. What also often happens is that when another group of researchers want to replicate such a study, they are actually forced to have PERSONAL SNIPPETS86the same methodological flaws etc. as the first group, otherwise there is no replication. In short: the crystal ball will continue (fortunately?) to exist, even though the reader gets the impression that he now knows more than before the study in question. And when journalists print it under a big heading, the reader cannot help but believe that something special is going on, for they are only human after all: wanting to belong, afraid to miss out on something, feeling uneasy in the certainty of the fact that we will all fall ill at some time or other. No truth in it! Just carry on living, and try to make the best of everyday miseries, that is my advice. 1 1 With thanks for the comments of Dr. P.M. Dingemans, Head of the Psychology Department of Mediant Mental Health Care Centre, Enschede. 'How is \"stress\" operationalized and especially how is \"no stress\" operationalized? Feelings of irritation, tension, nervousness, fear, fright or sleeping problems, for the duration of one month or longer. That is quite a sweeping definition. For instance anybody working at a university or any housewife with children might recognize themselves in this. Not only memory but also personality traits might play a role in remembering or forgetting negative experiences like stress. How was Alzheimer's operationalized? How was \"in middle age\" defined: women were between 38 and 60 years old when the study began. This kind of research always has \"a base rate problem\": It is about the prevalence of Alzheimer's (how operationalized) within which range of ages combined with a problem of selectiveness (in how far are the women in the study representative of women in general in the ages between 38 and 60 who run the risk of developing Alzheimer's (for instance Alzheimer's has a marked genetic component), the incidence of Alzheimer's is slowed by \"utilizing\" your brain and there is also the question: was this group a good representative of all layers of society or was it composed too selectively. Jim van Os wrote about the base rate problem for schizophrenia in the Magazine for Psychiatry. I believe it was in 2002. The transition rate is 11.4% for this study; I do not know the base rate of Alzheimer's in the general population, not the incidence. They jointly determine the \"true score\".' 87SHARING THE UNCONSCIOUS WITH ANO - THER PERSON, BY CHEWING THE FAT1 T.I. Oei zu besitzen.' 'What we are born with, we must make our own Or it remains a mere appurtenance.' (Goethe, Faust 1 , 682-683) When I talk with PhD students I always say: If at all possible, write down your thoughts, daily, no matter what, no matter how. What is important is that you learn to put your own impressions and feelings into words, at the rate in which your pen moves. Surrealists knew the \u00e9criture automatique . Then the unconscious really comes forward. Free association is a psychoanalytical method which Sigmund Freud devised as a means to unfold your own space and your own vision. It appeals to your creativity, airs your objections and makes you more transparent for what lives inside. But it also makes you more susceptible for what comes at you from the world around you. In so doing you have a greater sense of your own human needs and those of others. The feeling for human relations it develops remarkably quickly. On top of that you can air your own vision in a way that affords just as much freedom as when in the psychoanalyst's surgery you would allow your own thoughts and feelings free rein. Writing and free associating are rewarding occupations that do justice to the reflection on what goes on inside you and what stimuli confront you. It will be about reconciling the reality and the distortions which you produce, flawed and imperfect, as a person through the secret obstructive, because dark, activities of the unconscious. This happens best when everything happens as parallel as possible. Free association and writing down the things that crop up in the consciousness also leads others that read what you wrote to free associations in themselves. Does it not often happen that when you reveal something of yourself it makes it easier for the interlocutor to share something personal of himself with you? And this often on the basis of information which seems to come out of nothing into his consciousness. Reciprocity is such a characteristic which may bring about great relief when you are saddled with something that you would love 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society, 2011, 26, 8, p. 191.PERSONAL SNIPPETS88to share.2 That is how deep friendships and relationships come about. Once, when we were celebrating his fiftieth wedding anniversary, an older colleague said to me: 'The secret of our happiness is the fact that we have always been able to chew the fat together.' 2 Reaction of colleague/PhD student: 'This piece strongly touches on the concepts of reflection and congruence between the inner and outer world and between two people interacting. The importance of reflection is also brought forward in intervision and supervision. To contemplate what the patient does to you and what you think you bring about in the patient. There are also moments of reflection in therapy, in the first instance to take some distance from the patient in order to be open to new information from the patient. In your article you talk about free associating which is typical for an analysis or a creative process. For me as a PhD student I regard your suggestion more like a reflection which leads me to other complementary insights and experiences, sometimes just by thinking, sometimes by writing.'89SOME ASSOCIATIVE CONTEMPLATIONS ON THE OCCASION OF A TRIPLE SUICIDE1 T.I. Oei The 56-year-old woman and her two daughters aged 29 and 30 who on Tuesday evening 16-08-2010 were found hanging in the hallway of their home in Dalhem (Vis\u00e9, province of Li\u00e8ge), committed suicide after collective mental derangement (my italics,to) This is the finding of the police physician of the office of the public prosecutor of Li\u00e8ge. It was the occupant of the house who discovered the bodies of his wife and two daughters on Tuesday evening. The federal judiciary police of Li\u00e8ge and the scientific police went to investigate. The occurrence of a collective delusion (cf. the term above: collective mental derangement), or a collective psychosis on the basis of group collusion is fairly rare. It then concerns the phenomenon collusion, in which by means of pressure or compulsion, power or powerlessness people have an unnatural mental or psychotic stranglehold on each other. A shared ideology, quasi- religious elements, megalomania of the sect or gang leader perhaps harmoniously intertwined to a working substance, which must lead to the loyal cooperation of the adherents. In Guyana the American preacher Jim Jones2 killed his followers (more than 900) by means of mass poisoning for the sake of socialist rule (in the hereafter?). The preacher had Messiah delusions and claimed he was in direct contact with higher powers. Such manifestations, although from a psychiatric point of view highly diverse, whether inspired by irrational, psychotic motives or not, also occur today. For instance when in the name of a higher authority, the Jihad, pronounced by a minor or high spiritual leader (or a person that has been designated as spiritual authority) suicide commandos go on the rampage (for religious/ 1 Published in: T.I. Nijmegen, 2011, pp. 443- 446. 2 He (Jim Jones) impressed on them that Guyana soldiers were on their way to torture and kill them, on account of the murder of Leo Ryan. Jones proclaimed that the time had come for 'death with dignity' and led -in his own words- 'a mass suicide for the glory of socialism'. Everyone got lemonade with cyanide to drink; who refused was forced to drink, was injected with cyanide, or was shot dead by the guards of the temple. Jim Jones himself died by means of a bullet through the head.PERSONAL SNIPPETS90political/ideological reasons). But they do this in particular with the aim to take others (the intended opponents, or the unbelievers) with them into the hereafter, where -it is their firm conviction- they will be received as martyrs, whereas their victims will be doomed eternally. It is not clear whether such a mental (and perhaps partly ideological) disorder is also the background of the triple suicide in Dalhem. We do not have sufficient information about the case, but that such phenomena occur here and there in the world is an established fact. There is frequently very little we can do about it. But it is good that we try to put our worries into words. Feelings of powerlessness and curiosity should not induce us to be passive onlookers. Madness may suddenly change into an incorrigible (by religion or ideology coloured) delusional disorder, which in groups may lead to these tragedies. None of the survivors will be happy to know this, unless he/she in some way was the reason or cause of the tragic fact itself.3 The driving force, the person who leads such a (criminal) organization, is mostly averse to any input by group members and only accepts his own narcissistic (sometimes psychotic) motives, which mostly only serve his own gain and honour. The own targets are set at material (riches) and immaterial welfare (widening the position of power, world domination) and adulation. The faithful group members are but puppets and are themselves often the victims of violence or repression in their lives. Also within a family domestic violence may sooner or later lead to tragedy. Another minor transition to a purely material goal within the group and you will find them everywhere in the form of Mafia gangs and groups of rebels. Such phenomena occur all over the world and it is therefore a good thing that (inter)national (criminal) law pays close attention in order to delineate the medium to large-scale excesses (such as the civil wars in Rwanda, Liberia, Somalia, with hundreds of thousands of victims and casualties, and between 3 The Nazi movement with Adolf Hitler as leader. He too committed suicide together with supporters (Eva Braun, Goebbels and family) in order to demonstrate that he was convinced of the power of the Almighty (whoever that may be). Many authors feel that he wanted to avoid a merciless trial against him, after the surrender of Nazi Germany, but Hitler himself did not look upon the attempt on his life (by Von Stauffenberg) as a setback. The fact that against all expectation he escaped death he triumphantly considered an intervention by 'Providence'. This is all the more remarkable because ever since he was 19 years old he had not shown any public religious act and had no more ties whatsoever with the R.C. church. Later even a priest was murdered under his responsibility. His followers too kept believing in the Nazi salvation movement: people like G\u00f6ring, and later also Eichmann and others based their inhuman violent behaviour on their responsibility as loyal subjects of the F\u00fchrer, Adolf Hitler, protected by the Almighty, 'Befehl ist Befehl'.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell91the various drug cartels in Mexico with tens of thousands of casualties) and to bring the instigators to justice. To sum up in conclusion: the purposeful use of violence in order to indulge one's own power and glory is an enormous temptation. A call for an exercise of power to which every person is exposed sooner or later, within the family, but also in institutions and constitutional bodies. It is important to expose these tendencies in every organization in which power and subservience play a role of importance. Hence that criminal law, certainly in our country, takes a critical view of government meddling and interference. For it always starts with something every person can understand: for instance these beach riots where police actions caused many casualties (one fatality), because policemen felt threatened. And in those families where physical violence is the panacea for exacting actions, urgent psychoeducational talks need to take place. Sometimes they do not help and then the police must be notified -certainly in cases of abuse. For the social worker such a report to the police often causes feelings of powerlessness. But legal borders must sometimes be drawn, when common sense fails. What would leniency towards violence in small and large groups otherwise lead to? More police, more control, more reason for interference and limits to people's freedom. Whoever holds the principle that people will have to convince each other by means of the proper example and by means of talking will understand that (physical) violence, certainly within families must always be combatted. Closing our eyes to it, in the sense that we remain just bystanders and do nothing, that we use the excuse: 'we thought it was not too bad', or 'we had not expected it to go this far', or 'we knew absolutely nothing about this', can never be an alternative. Thanks to Professor Abram de Swaan, sociologist, emeritus Professor Univerity of Amsterdam. 'The problem with those very serious violent offenders is that they so very rarely see the psychotherapist (and if they do, the therapist cannot report them). These collective delusional suicides are quite incomprehensible: no one lives to tell... I saw in a documentary that this Jones demanded extreme sexual privileges from his subjects, also from men, and that he always (?) got his way. Shame might therefore play a large role. The difference between ordinary killers and genocidal murderers is that the latter always operate in groups, within strongly affirmative and supportive institutional contexts. Hence the modern (socio- psychological) clich\u00e9 that any one of us in such a situation might have done the same... The suicide terrorists are also adopted into a similar context but also kill themselves. (That was not, nor is, the genocidal cup of tea) The female suicide terrorists are often related to victims of hostile violence, and as widows often in a hopeless situation.PERSONAL SNIPPETS92People in the resistance, like we know them from WW II, operated in more of less identical circumstances, sometimes recklessly, verging on suicidally, but always allowed themselves -I think- a chance of survival, which is therefore quite a different thing. Moreover they selected a specific target that had 'deserved it', not an anonymous crowd (and every one of them of course deserved it for not dialling the phone number of the Supreme Being.).' Thanks to Professor Anton Loonen, physician and pharmacologist, professor of pharmacotherapy with psychiatric patients, RUG: 'I often think that it is interesting to find out what the basis for such a collective delusion may be. Is it a continuation of current philosophies or beliefs or can it also be bizarre. A second question is the degree of induceability by means of medication. I know a case where a man suffered a relapse in the framework of his chronic (non-psychotic) depression, overindulged in his benzos (for momentary peace and quiet, like so often) and subsequently acted in the line of his paranoid ideas and committed a double homicide. I think his benzo abuse got him into a psychosis.( In spite of that he got twenty years) I seem to remember that in that sect in South America substances were also used.' With thanks to Dr Wouter Gomperts, psychoanalyst and university teacher Clinical Psychology, University of Amsterdam. 'You are putting Nazi Germany, Rwanda, Liberia, Somalia, etc. and the murderess of Dalhem in one framework. It is very much in the traditional line of criminologists and psychoanalysts to regard genocidal actions exclusively in conjunction with predisposing psychopathological characteristics. But the explanation of genocide does demand a sociological supplementation. When with many people for a longer time the psychopathological dispositions have existed, this contributes to the social conditions in which these dispositions lead to mass violence, and when those social conditions have existed for a longer period with many people, those psychological conditions develop which can lead to mass violence etc. A corkscrew interaction therefore between psychological and social processes. Certain social conditions that have existed for many people for a long time, create the large-scale mental dispositions, the mental dispositions that have existed on a large scale create the social conditions.'

Oei Religious mania is the extremely pathological manifestation of a distorted idea and practice of the preaching of a religion.1 In my practice I had a patient A who came from such a sect. The sect comprised the members of the family, some relatives of both parents and a few scores of friends and acquaintances under the leadership of one person with some theological and philosophical schooling. Actions took place that could best be looked upon as private group etiquette and rituals in order to be able to promote a feeling of safety, familiarity and intimacy. There was a kind of reservation inspired by fear regarding contacts with people of different convictions. Open communication with the outside world suffered visibly through this. The members of the sect attributed to themselves a special role and cherished a feeling of being the chosen ones. Their task, in their minds, was to propagate the special character of their life by retaining their singularity as much as possible. My patient felt the urge to see his life as an example to others. Within his own family he felt he was the chosen one, the one with a calling who, highly talented, was in the best position to devote himself to art, which is why he looked upon his work as an artist as more than just a hobby. He went to an art academy; fell in love with a theology student from his sect. They became a couple and after a few years got married and left from their community to live in the big town. There the question how they could be together and yet adhere to their own traditions proved to be problematic to them. The information from the outside world was of such nature that they started to doubt more and more the principles their upbringing had impressed upon them. A fear of the unknown and a feeling to be floating around on an island characterized their existence for many years. He came to see me when he was thirty years old. By now he had got a divorce, had his own studio where he could daily do his sculpting and painting. He was talented and also had a few students who tried to learn the basics of the trade from him. 1 A daughter of the American evangelical fundamentalist Terry Jones, Emma Jones, on Friday (10-09-10) told the German press that her father was in need of aid. She fears he has lost his mind. Emma Jones lives in Germany where from the eighties of the previous century until 2008 her father led a religious community. She left the church when she was in her teens and said that when she visited the community in 2005, it had begun to look like a sect. Terry Jones was expelled by the community in 2008. Terry Jones, who now lives at Gainesville, Florida, nowadays features in the media because of his plan to burn Korans on Saturday. Later (11-09-21020) he revoked his plans.PERSONAL SNIPPETS94A complained of sexual inhibitions and especially of ejaculatio praecox (premature orgasm). He had become afraid to have contacts with women and felt increasingly thrown back on his own studio, where he did have the reassuring feeling of being able to go beyond the limits of his space. He had a fertile imagination and his contact with his students was permanent. Although he had -he maintained- severed the links with his sectarian background he was still in daily phone contact with his mother, who had always supported him. She took the initiative to visit him in the big town, or, being his mother, when she was in the neighbourhood she would buy all sorts of foodstuff for him. He experienced the mental pressure which was exerted on him as unpleasant. It took him some time before he was able to tell her this. The treatment was insightful and took place daily (five times a week) and it seemed to teach him a few things. After some time, however, it appeared that his primitive fears of being rejected, his fear of failure, his fear of being called eccentric were still with him every day. He was afraid his income would be insufficient; he thought his work did not have sufficient quality and he missed a partner who could be understanding and supportive for his specific situation. Moreover he could not face becoming older and particularly the idea of dying. He suffered from feelings of depersonalization and derealization when he regarded all the tasks and assignments in his work. He felt the phenomenon of death an unfair answer to being. It took some years of treatment before he could experience feelings of freedom, before he could take every day as a new opportunity for personal development, before he could shape his ambitions. In the treatment he learnt to put the pressure of a pre-ordained course of life and ideal into perspective and to assign it a place in his daily life. When he had achieved that, his frequent fears disappeared. He became more and more relaxed; he might or might not be able to fully comply with tasks according to the mood of the moment. He had a greater feeling of being part of the world and he was more often cheerful. From that moment he could remember that as a young lad he had been in love with that girl from his sect that he had gone to school with at the time. His feelings for partnership also crystallized and after a few months he fell in love with a artist he had met during an exhibition. The relationship was a satisfactory one and his sexual complaints disappeared. We may gather from this case that the distorted character of the sect lay especially in the fact that communication only meant propagating and defending their own opinions. Such a sect has a closed nature and its members are obliged to stick to certain codes within a given framework. The sect is mistrustful of society, will not admit strangers just like that, and is relatively uninterested in outside influences. Through his fears A did not find the courage to talk with people of different convictions and he experienced high emotional thresholds when Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell95he intended to take initiatives in that direction.2 He felt burdened, ashamed towards strangers and thought he could not accomplish contacts anyway. These things were decidedly to do with the pressure he consciously and unconsciously felt not to overstep the mark. His fertile imagination and the insightful treatment in the course of years allowed him to achieve his own personal development. The somewhat na\u00efve behaviour he had displayed at the beginning of the treatment gradually changed into more self-assured, adult conduct in which the daily tribulations were no longer addressed in an obscure, rigid way, but with an open mind and borne by self respect. 2 Adriaan van Dis' fearful experiences of the mistreatment by his father and his ambivalent feelings of love/hate for him. He (AvD) was 'a chicken-hearted little so- and-so with a yearning for adventure'. Writing as salvation. Van Dis goes on: 'The effect of classical analysis is now disposed of for financial reasons as scientifically unproved, but a brain scan before and after analysis definitely looks different. You can get treatment for the wounds in your brain. I would advise it to everybody, especially to people who vociferously claim they are not troubled by anything. I cannot help but shake my head sometimes, when I see all those youngsters chasing after kicks. It is very understandable, but it does leave scars. I had that tendency as well, to harm myself, to go too far, to squander and dissipate, like my alter ego in Tikkop, to stay out until all hours, to sleep with the wrong kind of people.'

'Worse, that Weekly 11-17 2010, NRC Handelsblad , p. 6-10, especially p. 10.97CONFUSION ABOUT THE EXPERT T.I. Oei Afshin Ellian 'The substantive treatment of the case against Geert Wilders MP has begun. Defence counsel requested four professor of jurisprudence to testify. The court refused this request. Who were the four lawyers? De Roos (Tilburg), After the court's refusal we, the witnesses that were not to be heard, gathered to exchange thoughts on the matter. Interview We had not discussed the case with each other before. I even did not know colleague Sackers personally. Simultaneously there was the request by the daily De Pers whether we would give a joint interview about the Wilders case. We decided to grant the interview. That was in July. The interview was published a week ago. We came to the conclusion that Wilders should be acquitted. Commentary \"I am not too pleased with the preview published in De Pers about Wilders. The four professors in the interview, De Roos, Sackers, Zwart and Ellian, apparently agree that prosecution is wrong,\" says Ybo Buruma, professor Criminal Law at Nijmegen. You must know him, for he often appears on television to comment on penal cases. Why was Ybo not too happy with our opinion? Buruma: \"I do not mind at all when an action group or a columnist maintains that the freedom of expression is more important than a ban on hate mongering or a group insult. But professors who publicly make a pronouncement table a claim to veracity in so doing. 'This is it, there are no two ways about it'. I may be old-fashioned but I think the position taken by a professor is more than just an opinion.\" Judgment Oh, a claim to veracity! It does not hold good for Ybo, but it does for others. If it were to hold good for him as well, he should never ever in the media voice PERSONAL SNIPPETS98an opinion on a case that is still sub judice. And he is only too willing to do so. Today he is permanently in the media to give his opinion about the trial and therefore about what the court should do. And what is it all about? Should we not claim veracity in political and social questions? Why did Ybo then become a member of the programme commission of the PvdA (the Dutch Labour Party)? In so doing he lent the authority of veracity to the paragraphs on justice and security of the PvdA programme. I do not mind this at all, but it does go against his own principles. Also Ybo Buruma was the only professor who immediately supported former Minister of Justice Piet Hein Donner in the case of blasphemy, shortly after Van Gogh had been murdered. Religious values Shortly after Van Gogh had been murdered Donner suggested that the most profound religious values of others, in this case Muslims, ought not to be hurt or insulted. That is why he was of the opinion that, exactly in the light of Van Gogh's murder the stipulations regarding blasphemy should be more actively applied. What was it that he really said? It's your own fault, live with it. He thought he could neutralize Muslim terrorists by silencing critics of Islam. In a letter to the editor of NRC Buruma defended this problematic position which lays the blame at the feet of the victim. It is not inunderstandable that Buruma is in favour of finding Geert Wilders guilty as charged. And he probably wants people like me to shut up. Postulation And then that claim to veracity. This morning in a reaction to defendant Geert Wilders remaining silent the judge said: 'We also read the newspapers and watch TV now and then. You are reproached for being good at advancing a thesis, but subsequently avoiding any discussion. There is every appearance that you are doing this here as well.' Watch the images again, see how the judge, angrily and rhetorically, slams his pen on the table when he addresses Wilders. Defence counsel challenged the court: the judge creates the impression of bias. Immediately after colleague Buruma appeared in the eight o'clock news to attack the defence. Buruma said he had expected this. Did he know this? Had he talked with the judges? No, he had heard rumours that the defence wanted to drag out the case. That would play into the hand of the formation.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell99Fantasist Ybo, is this your claim to veracity? Would you allow us to know how you came by these rumours? You really must be an enormous fantasist to come up with this kind of thing. This is a criminal case of international importance. And the defence is justified in applying all legal means. That this is right up Wilders' political alley, we already knew a year ago. It was also for that reason that we suggested not to prosecute. Now Buruma should not be whining about a trial that was started by his political friends. Samir A. Buruma thinks it is quite normal for a judge to say something like this. Is that so? A couple of months ago I attended the trial against the Hofstad group. They also claimed their right to silence. Suppose the judge had said to Samir A.: \"We read the papers and we watch TV. From the reconstruction in De Volkskrant it appears that you think that Muslims should not talk with unbelieving judges. It would seem to us now that you are acting in accordance with those ideas.\" Their defence counsel would have rightly objected to this. For the court makes pronouncements on the basis of the dossier. Gossip, stories in the media are no basis to make annotations to the fundamental right of the defendant, his right to silence. Joran van der Sloot Another hypothetical example: In the case of Joran van der Sloot the defendant claims the right to silence. The judge's reaction then is: \"I have seen you on TV. The journalists have come to the conclusion that when you speak you lie, and that when you remain silent you do so to mislead the others. There is every appearance that you are doing this here as well.\" This as well would be an unacceptable opinion of a judge in a case where he has as yet to pass sentence. In all these hypothetical cases there is the impression of bias. According to the European Court of Human Rights in the determination of judicial impartiality only the perception of the defendant and of the 'ordinary citizen' are relevant. Has my colleague Buruma forgotten this? Do penal principles not apply to Geert Wilders. Tragedy This case revolves around political pronouncements of a Member of Parliament. That the judge made a mistake like this has to do with the nature PERSONAL SNIPPETS100of the case. The judge is also a voter and as a voter he has an opinion of the pronouncements made by Wilders. Therein lies the tragedy. Ybo, people who have experienced a tyrannical regime know exactly why the courts should never but absolutely never be involved in a struggle of ideas. Read the vicissitudes of Joseph Brodsky and intellectuals in Iran. Freedom is a matter of principle. Freedom is not only for kindred spirits but also for the objectionable opponent. That is a claim to veracity. I wish you every success in your cunning campaign against the freedom of expression in the eight o'clock news, News Hour, talk shows and the rest. This is an interesting analysis by Prof. Afshin Ellian. It has always been, will always be, difficult for lawyers who are both professors and (substitute) judges or justices to keep their low public profile. Very quickly you will find changes or confusion of roles. That also goes for behavioural experts. Recently I was asked to write an article for a newspaper about a man in detention in a psychiatric hospital, who, as part of his longstay, had been allowed accompanied outside leave, but stabbed a woman in a shop almost fatally. A very serious case. But because this psychiatric detainee was accused of attempted murder, and therefore his case was sub judice, I refused. Which I regretted, for I would have loved to give the media what they wanted. But sometimes you must be able to resist the siren's call. Fortunately I know that many colleagues in similar circumstances do this as well. But sometimes an individual colleague may find resisting too hard, and will therefore blunder. I had a conversation at one time with the well-known professor and former senior medical officer of the Pieter Baan Centrum, the late Prof. Frank Beijaert. He was asked quite frequently to give his expert comments in the media on current affairs or events. The simplicity and humility he radiated were touching and to me quite instructive. He told me that he would have to be lying low for a while, because he had obviously overstepped the mark a little in his informative attempts for the media. It is only self-knowledge that can lead to such a decision. Let us hope that colleagues will take this to heart.101THE SECURE EXPRESSION OF FEELINGS OF EXTREME FEAR SUCH AS HATRED OR ANGER NOT ONLY BRINGS RELIEF, BUT MAY ALSO THROUGH ADV ANCING INSIGHT PROMOTE TOLERANCE T.I. Oei I had to think of these words, when I watched the interview in Buitenhof with outgoing Minister of Justice E.H.M. Hirsch Ballin LLM. A brilliant man of intellect and integrity, for years professor at Tilburg,1 repeatedly minister in various Cabinets, member of KNAW, a highly respected person, a man of great merits, who still is of great importance for country and society. The conversation became more profound, when he referred to a personal meeting with Camiel Eurlings MSc, outgoing Minister of Transport (Likewise a CDA member). The reason was the government and tolerance agreement made by CDA, VVD and PVV (Christian Democrats, Conservatives and Freedom Party respectively). It was about the (widely criticized) way in which Wilders through his use of language2 incites groups of people against each other. This is a touchy issue for people who themselves suffered from a climate in which groups of people were stirred up against each other: during the Second World War, in Nazi times, in Jap times, in the many conflicts after WW II in countries behind the Iron Curtain (e.g. Hungary in 1956 and in what was then Czecho-Slovakia in 1968), and in the past few decades (and still) in Bosnia/Serbia/Kosovo, to name a few well-known examples. The discussion Minister Hirsch Ballin had with Minister Eurlings was also about the question why the CDA in the past entered into cooperation with the LPF with the support of Hirsch Ballin himself. Hirsch Ballin himself, remarkably enough, referred to the person of Pim Fortuyn, who, as a practising homosexual, (and who, as Fortuyn himself made public, had been in analysis for his problems for years), he thought taking all in all, had made provocative pronouncements but never incited one group of the population against another. Why Hirsch Ballin linked the person of Fortuyn with his openly avowed homosexuality and the problems he had because of his Islam statements is not clear. Obviously Fortuyn was controversial for his homosexual behaviour, while there was also the impression that, because 1 In 2011 he is a professor of Dutch and Constitutional Law at Tilburg University . 2 Cf J. Kuitenbrouwer, De woorden van Wilders & hoe ze werken , (The words of Wilders how they work) Amsterdam: De Bezige Bij, 2010.PERSONAL SNIPPETS102of his Islam bashing, he was absolutely unable, or even unwilling, to rectify this controversial role. On the contrary in that way he even stimulated the sentiments against the Islam! Now Fortuyn occupies a prominent place in Dutch history, perhaps somewhat enhanced by the fact that he was murdered.3 We may draw the conclusion that though being controversial is rewarded with publicity, recognition, perhaps even fame, at the same time it carries a certain smell. And it is that ambivalence (being for and against a person or a cause) that appealed to me in both the reactions of Hirsch Ballin and Eurlings, and also in the sometimes braggart, provocative, trumpeting utterances made by Wilders. And then I was personally touched by what Hirsch Ballin said. Not so much the content, but the way in which he put it. Here a human being was speaking, one who had experienced a lot and suffered especially because groups of people are incited against each other. 4 I also had to think of what occupied Minister Eurlings. He has a partner (Hungarian Enik\u00f6 Borbely) from one of those countries that were once behind the Iron Curtain. On further reflection I realized that Wilders' partner was Hungarian too. So all three of them have something 'foreign' in common, all three have taken that foreign element to their heart. Although each developed his own political vision, all three have given a meaningful interpretation to what both separates and joins them. The reason why I now place important final moments of an ongoing treatment of an analytical patient next to the problems of a conflictuous relationship between democratic and non-democratic sentiments has to do with the commonness of the theme: emotion, spontaneity, a leaning towards destructiveness, and exclusion. What struck me was what was going on in my practice simultaneous to the developments relating to the cooperation between VVD/CDA/PVV When in my practice one of my patients was about to end his psycho- analytical treatment, he displayed some of the phenomena he had had at the beginning of treatment as well. He became more fearful, showed more 3 In a KRO television broadcast (15-11-2004) Pim Fortuyn was proclaimed the greatest Dutchman of all times. William of Orange comes second, Willem Drees third. 4 Hirsch Ballin is the son of the German lawyer Ernst Denny Hirsch Ballin . In the thirties, being Jewish, he had been sent to the concentration camp Buchenwald. Later he fled from Nazi Germany to the Netherlands, where the lawyer Pieter Gerbrandy helped him obtain political asylum. During WW II he went into hiding and contributed to the resistance. After the liberation he became a professor in Amsterdam. His wife Maria Koppe was a Roman Catholic, their son was raised in her faith. Cf WikipediaForensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell103signs of fatigue and regularly called treatment off for being indisposed. There was a regression to an earlier treatment phase. There was a sudden outpouring when I interpreted his regression as a fear of the loss of me as his analyst, in the phase when I would no longer be physically present. In his reaction to this interpretation he said that his hatred of Wilders' opinions is also to do with his primary impulse, namely that he wants to bump Wilders off, like he wanted to do me in as well. His murderousness, which he had never before experienced so consciously, he compared to that silent wish to commit murder he had had before in life, when he found himself thwarted by his parents, by classmates and also by his own partner. The fear not only of being rejected, but also of losing something of his own drove him up the wall so to speak. He could become so furious that he smothered everything in his relationship with his partner, when she was about to divorce him. That fury paralyzed him completely. The marriage went on the rocks years ago, not because there was too much bickering, but on the contrary because he was unable to discuss their problems with his partner. He was fearful of being denied 'lebensraum', and in a more restrictive sense of discrimination against his own need for his own place and function within the relationship. He compared that immense need for 'lebensraum' to what Wilders really thinks, namely that -in the words of my patient- 'we as a nation no longer have the space to live our own lives.' Such a primitive statement can only be understood from the position my patient was in, namely being on the verge of having to give substance and meaning to his life on his own after years of intensive treatment. Psychologically such a need goes back to the toddler period: the situation of the two-year-old who has just learnt to talk, who feels threatened by the younger brother reaching for his toy, and then lashes out vehemently by saying: you stay away from what is mine! My patient compared his primitive sentiments with those of the Wild West, where as a newcomer to the village you could be shot without further ado when you became too much of a threat to the sheriff, or as a customer in the local bar. Would the similarity between what Wilders says about the Islam and about people who are no good, and my patient's reactions to all this not be found exactly in the Umwertung aller Werte ? Analogous to what Nietzsche meant. For example: My patient's silence towards his partner, and concerning me his frequent absences during the treatment were to do with his fury and his death wishes for his partner and for me, but he says: 'I hate that Wilders, I could bump him off like in a primary impulse.' Wouter Bos wrote a book entitled: This country can do so much better. According to Wilders Bos will continue to bring planefuls of people from Muslim countries to the Netherlands, and then Wilders says: 'Wouter says: This country can do 5 Ibid. Kuitenbrouwer, p. 84.PERSONAL SNIPPETS104My patient is unconsciously angry with me, because the end of the treatment is approaching. He is extremely alert, brooks no contradiction, and is quick to react when I say something. He vehemently reacts by shifting his (unconscious) murderous attitude towards me to what Wilders has to say. 'Those people want to exclude as well.' My patient felt excluded by me, discarded. He either dare not say this, or he is not conscious of this. He is conscious of the expressed anger with a person he does not know at all, but whose ideas he finds abhorrent. He says to me: 'I vote PvdA. That Wilders, he abuses words and statements of others whom he repudiates. Bos is PvdA, he has written a book, and he takes the challenge that this country could do better. Wilders ridicules this, turns things upside down, insults him, maligns Bos and accuses him of evil intentions. He claims that Bos would short- change the country, by bringing people into the country with no schooling. Feelings of fear and insecurity of people are so radically evoked, that you might speak of a threat to their feelings of safety and security.' My patient feels insecure, is afraid of being abandoned by me. He gets obsessed by what Wilders does. He maintains: 'By what Wilders says and does, people are magnetically drawn to the subjects that Wilders touches upon. It seems as if people are automatically drawn to this prophet of doom! That Wilders propagates negative sentiments is demonstrated according to Kuitenbrouwer by the word \"bad\" which he uses over-averagely compared to fellow-politicians, and the word \"good\" never.'6 Apart from what is the matter with my patient, and what goes on in the country now that a (new) controversial party has entered the political playing field, what we can identify is that we must go on learning from each other and that we have to discuss with each other what we find difficult. And that in all openness. Because the basis in every person's life (both that of my patient and of people in the country who are so focussed on what is said by Wilders) is in fact the question whether there is sufficient basic safety. The feeling of basic safety which is like the elementary childish need important up to adulthood. Joseph J. Sandler called it an important condition for a healthy mental development, from infant (up to 2nd year), as toddler (2nd-3rd year) to pre-schooler (4th - 6th year) and then the latency time (7th -11th year), puberty/ adolescence (12th-25th year). The feeling of security can overrule feelings of pain and unhappiness. In this light 'stress' can be regarded as a reassurance. Regarded like this 'success' may become something threatening and failure can be linked to feelings of intimacy and safety. If basic safety becomes a disposition of the personality, this will lead to feelings of autonomy. This signifies the ability to apply 6 Ibid. Kuitenbrouwer, p.95.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell105strategies that can maintain the feeling of basic safety, also in the midst of threats from our urges, the super ego or the outside world.7 Being able to take control of your own life, rather than surrender to fatal insecurities linked to possible threats. This latter aspect is something present in most people who are drawn to Wilders. Ultimately my patient achieved the insight that his feeling of change had replaced his fear of the unknown. 7 P.

Oei DEN HAAG (ANP) 11-10-10 - 'Fred Teeven the intended State Secretary of Security and Justice (VVD) wants to do more for victims of violence and criminality. He stated this intention after his visit to Mark Rutte who is charged with the formation of a new government. Teeven will be in charge of the portfolios of prisons, psychiatric prisons, probation and juvenile delinquency among others. He wants to deal with capacity problems in closed youth care. The present cabinet was already occupied with this, but because two ministers were involved, namely those of Justice and of Youth and Family, the problems were not solved as yet, Teeven says. There were too many youngsters in youth custody because there was no room for them within youth care.' The new state secretary is planning to focus his policy in the coming years on aid to victims and on attention to victims of crime and criminality. It is to be hoped that his enthusiasm and energy, which before this was directed at more punishment and punishability of crime, will also be used to give criminal law a more humane outlook. It is necessary for people who have offended to be approached humanely. Although the punishability of crime should be consistent on all fronts, both for substantive criminal behaviour as for the age at which offences are committed, the individual approach should be geared to the person of the culprit1 as far as procedural law and material criminal law are concerned. The courts always bear this in mind, but the policy is sometimes difficult to understand for the outsider. That recently a grandmother was sentenced to conditional detention in a hospital, plus a term in prison, for sexually abusing an infant (baby up to 2 years of age), is, certainly for laymen, difficult to fathom.2 If, in this case and other cases like 1 Christian Diesen at the IALMH Congress in Berlin, 22 July 2011: 'The society is not equal, but a trial might be.' 2 Monday, 11-10-10. A 57-year-old grandmother who was co-offender in the sexual abuse of her five-week-old grandson and assisted in the filming of the abuse is sentenced to conditional detention in a psychiatric facility. Within the framework of the detention she will be treated in a closed department of the facility. The court also sentenced the grandmother from Vught to a prison term equal to the time she was remanded in custody (263 days). After the abuse, in September 2009, the woman contacted the police herself. She committed the offence together with her then boyfriend (48). He was the one who had the original idea and she, extremely impressionable, did not go against him. The 48-year-old man from Rosmalen will stand trial on December 6. PERSONAL SNIPPETS108it, the intended state secretary would make a stand for more openness and clarification, not only the victims but also the perpetrators would benefit. In his editorial in the prominent periodical for criminal law Delikt en Delinkwent (Offence and Offender) ( DD 2010, 7, p. ff.) Groenhuijsen also discusses this, and he mentions the growing attention of criminal justice not only for white-collar crime, but also for the older criminal. The attention to the persons of culprit and victim he puts as follows: 'Having come to the end of my story, it appears that my examples and arguments all tend to oppose once again and forcefully the administration of criminal justice that seems to operate increasingly with \"little regard of the person\". That is the yardstick which I shall apply to the actions of the coming cabinet in the field of criminal justice.' I could not agree more.109'CLINICALLY DEAD' WOMAN AW AKES IN HOSPITAL T.I. Oei BORDEAUX (ANP), 20-10-2010 - A woman, who, according to doctors in a French hospital was clinically dead, woke up a few hours later. French media reported this on Wednesday. Patient Lydie Paillard was being prepped for treatment, when she suddenly lost consciousness. A doctor managed to resuscitate the woman and to apply artificial respiration, but after consultation with other doctors pronounced her clinically dead. The doctor then informed the sons that their mother was 'most assuredly clinically dead' and suggested disconnecting her from the respirator. The sons refused and the woman was transferred to another hospital. She was given a brain scan, which showed that she was not clinically dead at all. A few hours later she woke up. The hospital blames this blunder to 'a problem of communication'. Miracles never cease, even though there are communication problems. The question is of course whether miracles really only have to do with communication problems. In practice patients might want to question everything that doctors think, unless they switch off their own critical mind or overcome by emotion cannot find words to express their frustration. It is therefore of great importance that doctors realize this. Their powers are sometimes put up on a pedestal which in turn is harmful for the doctor's self-esteem. Communication is also to do with being attuned to each other, and whatever is the matter with the patient, to put your own person, your own ego as a doctor in the proper perspective. After all, it is the patient that is concerned, nothing else. When doctors experience their vulnerability it has to do with the feeling not to be taken seriously by their patients. However, that is again a misconception of what patients expect from their doctors: they have to keep control of themselves in every respect, even if it means that they sometimes have to put up with the patient's aggression. That is part of good professional practice. It is not for nothing that the medical profession was regarded as a calling. The golden lining of the honour only serves to somewhat lighten the pain of the responsibility for other people's lives and the unexpected nature of the profession.

Fascinating book!'PERSONAL SNIPPETS110Karel Oei sturende brein' (The Executive Brain) by E. Goldberg, Wereldbibliotheek, 2010, in which he convincingly asserts that the frontal lobes are of importance in making decisions in ambiguous situations, that is to say human situations in which individual considerations play a considerable role and not the dichotomous (deterministic) games and/or sometimes (pseudo) scientific experiments that neuro-cognitive scientists are mass-producing nowadays. I am afraid our western society shows a preoccupation with these things. I for one prefer to stick to the individual considerations that mean more to us as human beings, I think, than those (fake) affairs. Situations in which yes/no, big/small, black/white solutions are necessary to achieve a result for scientifically reductionist hobbies, but which brings us little as human beings, I am afraid. The advantage of such a viewpoint is that it is a method that gives the person very rapidly a feeling of breakthrough, and that is addictive, for we \"finally within a relatively short period of time we have a response -oh golly,\" (that is what we think then) - but quite the opposite.1' Reaction of A. Korving, psychotherapist 'What you write in your e-mail about 'reductionism' is close to my heart. Adhering to \"the individual considerations that mean more to us as human beings than those (fake) affairs\" would appear to me to be an important quality for professionals who work in and with \"relationships\". A quality that ought to be stimulated. The practice for social care workers, however, is that making and forming individual considerations is becoming less and less a matter of course. In effect you are no longer expected to do this, let alone to say it out loud. It is more and more a dichotomy, a black/white perspective into which everything must be fit. All rich colouring is thus done away with. I find this as a desolate state of care-giving that is developing, or perhaps has already developed, care-giving that more and more dehumanizes, and subsequently needs even more reductionism in order not to feel the alienation that has been caused. It is exactly in this \"no longer daring to experience\" that causes the damage, damage that I see/hear/perceive almost daily with my clients who above all things need a therapy where something else is allowed to happen than the mere dichotomy, who need the multi-perspective to get their stagnant experiencing flowing again.' 1 D.

'In London the Saudi prince Saud Abdulaziz was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his \"servant\". The case calls forth questions around Arabian hypocrisy concerning homosexuality. Prince Saud Abdulaziz bin Basser al Saud (34), a grandson of the former Saudi king Saoud, was slightly drunk with champagne and cocktails on Valentine's Day this year, when he retired to his hotel room in London with his \"servant\" Bandar Abdulaziz (32). The next day the servant was found dead, after a wild night of sex that ended in asphyxiation. At first prince Saud seemed to entertain the hope that his status as a prince would make him inviolable, but a London judge decreed differently. \"It is most unusual for a prince to stand trial for murder,\" British justice David Bean said, \"but it would be wrong if I sentenced you more harshly or more leniently than others simply because you are a member of a royal family.\" Footage from security cameras in the lift already recorded days before how the prince vented his anger on his servant and gay lover. But on the morning after the murder the prince stated that his servant had been beaten up in London \"some weeks earlier\" hence the marks of violence on his body. His death had gone unnoticed, because he had been asleep. Justice Bean sentenced the Saudi prince to life yesterday, to serve a minimum term of twenty years. The judge mentioned \"a position of authority that was grossly abused\". In the Middle East the case was avidly reported. Conversely in conservative Saudi Arabia not a single mention of the case was made in the press, even though the Saudis could get detailed information on the Internet and via satellite television. Thus the murder of a servant puts a number of things on edge. Homosexuality is officially forbidden in the Middle East, although everybody knows that this proclivity is just as frequent here as in the West. It is often the most conservative cities that are most familiar with the love between men, exactly because comfortable associations between men and women are made so difficult. The murder also places the relationship between \"master\" and \"servant\" in the Arabian elite in the spotlight. In contrast to tens of millions of families from the middle class, thousands of richer families have servants from the PERSONAL SNIPPETS112Philippines or Thailand, who mostly do not have any rights and are dependent on the good intentions of their \"employers\". Prince Saud regarded his \"servant\" as a toy, justice Bean said, \"and the most likely explanation is that you could not care less whether he was dead or not.\" Finally this murder case also raises questions about the authoritarian regimes in power in the Middle East. Whereas their subjects have to live in accordance with thousands of petty rules, the children of the dynasties feel that they are beyond all kinds of legal authority. When a son of the Libyan leader Moammar Khadafi was violently abusive against a valet in Geneva, Khadafi started an all-out financial and diplomatic war against Switzerland. Last year in the United Arab Emirates prince Issa was prosecuted for assaulting a servant -the torture was amply documented by a film on YouTube, but he was eventually acquitted. The dissatisfaction with this is not only demonstrated by the verdict of a British judge, but also by the complaints of the public at large in the Arab world. It is ironic that in his own country prince Saud risks the death penalty because of the \"mortal sin\" of homosexuality. It is therefore likely that he will remain in the West after completion of his prison term.' A tragic piece of news because of this dramatic and at the same time shocking fact. Various conflicts can be found in the way in which homosexuals in the Arab world, and particularly in Saudi Arabia, have to deal with their nature. The power/powerlessness situation which occurs in every dependency relationship, so also in a sexual relationship is reinforced by the differences in social status of the two lovers: the prince and his servant. On top of that there is a law that stipulates the death penalty for homosexuality which in the country of the prince is regarded as a most serious crime. The state of obvious inebriation caused by heavy drinking with a lover on Valentine's Day clears the way for and facilitates sexual debauchery. Psychoanalytically, it is known that the function of the conscience is dissolved by imbibing alcohol: the critical reflection on what is termed free will and on what should make second thoughts possible (can I square this with my conscience Yes or No?) is then no longer present. The feeling of responsibility disappears behind the horizon of drunkenness. And also, this is demonstrated by such conditions over and over again, the existing conscious or unconscious, repressed mental conflicts are easier to indulge. The prince's power to do with his servant as he pleases gets absolute traits. Physical and mental assault gets the upper Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell113hand. The demands of the one in power (in this case the prince) become bigger; there are no more bounds on what is or is not acceptable. Interaction becomes a game of chance. The pursuit of both pleasure and power receives all attention and priority, at the expense of humanity or human dignity. There is every appearance that sexual games and/or challenges in the night in question got out of hand. The servant was strangled and later found with bite marks in his cheeks. It is likely that the victim, during intense love making, had to be (or wanted to be?) used by the perpetrator . Erotic asphyxiation (Asphyxiophilia) is a well-known phenomenon among sexual activists. It prolongs sexual enjoyment and some say it will continue deeper than ever, because erotic asphyxiation may cause an almost permanent state of erection. That the prince claims that he was asleep and did not know what was going on, seems rather farfetched, but also reveals his deepest conscious or unconscious desires during the tragedy. Obviously he wished to sustain a state of sexual excitement and high, the blending with his lover, on the basis of a sadomasochistic collusion. The prince hoped for a reduced sentence, considering his high origin. The court was not susceptible. What is obviously possible in Saudi-Arabia: class justice, is impossible in Great Britain. Neither do they have such cruel criminal laws.115IS THE LAW OF NATURE SOMETHING THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING? T.I. Oei Earlier this week Eindhoven Councilman Nico Stoevelaar CDA (Christian Democratic Appeal) was the only person to oppose the council's initiative to put Eindhoven forward as candidate for Pink Saturday 2013, because he thinks (following the Bible) that homosexuality is unnatural. Stoevelaar said this on Thursday (23-09-'10) because of a report in the Eindhovens Dagblad . 'It is a very simple reason: I find homosexuality absolutely unnatural and we should not be promoting this,' he explained on being questioned Thursday. Stoevelaar said that preceding the council meeting his standpoint was discussed in his political party. 'My party was not too pleased with my point of view, but to me it is an essential point and I was free to oppose the initiative.' Eindhoven CDA chairman Maarten Houben admits that five out of six CDA councilmen disagree with their party member's point of view. The Eindhoven CDA is willing to help all the people who want to make something of their lives, regardless of origin, belief, race or proclivity. 'This is why it would have been strange if we had forbidden him to take a diverging standpoint,' Houben explained. Quite apart from whether the opinion of the esteemed councilman is right or wrong, the first thing we must establish is if we can speak of a law of nature, which is revealed so to speak to every person at the moment of birth. Philosophical treatises have been written about this and philosophers from the Greek and Roman eras, but also from later times, confirm the standpoint. In a sense detached from the facts of his own observation, Man can find that there is a truth that is a firm given, beyond anybody else's authority or correction. Many of us know in themselves and through their own experience what is true and just, both in a philosophical and in an ethically social sense. People develop a conscience from about the age of six or seven and also people without a factual upbringing and schooling should know that for instance the Ten Commandments are to be regarded as the invariable norm in their lives ('the orthodox' - O). There are others ('the moderates'- M) who think that in principle people have the right to question everything that seems to be true. They wonder if it is right what people believe or presume. After deliberating the matter with themselves and others, they may arrive at a (provisional) final conclusion. There are also intermediary positions of people between the one pole: truth as immutable natural law, and the other pole: truth as product of debate with others and culturally determined.PERSONAL SNIPPETS116 Nowadays the individual right to create order and to debate is a great blessing. No longer people accept everything at face value and swallow everything whole; no longer do they unquestioningly recognize that there is a general truth that must hold good for everyone. In the fifties in the United States homosexuality was considered a disorder, a disease, only to be cured with the aid of medicine. This \u00abdisease\u00bb was regarded as a serious one. Often such an affliction could hardly or not at all be cured. Within the medical field a series of options for treatment was started that claimed that homosexuality could be cured. This is (fortunately) no longer in vogue and all those methods, ranging from self-affirmation therapy, to behavioural interventions (electrical) 1, psychoanalytical treatments, or the hardly effective biochemical-hormonal interventions are now looked upon as obsolete. The \u00abdisease\u00bb has disappeared from the register of diseases, the so-called DSM classification. Politics in the Netherlands and other countries no longer regarded people of that propensity as deviant. Two well-known examples of the fact that open homosexuality was equalled to a criminal offence are the writer Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) who was sentenced to two years in prison at the end of the nineteenth century for his relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas,2 and the mathematician Alan Turing (1912-1954),3 1 From a patient: 'Then they connected electricity wires to my ankles and arms and I had to look at heterosexual and homosexual photos. If I did not turn to the next picture quickly enough I was given a shock. Those pictures today would be about as exciting as current affairs photos in a magazine.' The man got thirty sessions of about thirty minutes each. Years later he got married, in spite of the fact he was a homosexual. 'I still find it hard to discuss this with my wife. She is aware of my sexual inclination and is still trying to come to terms with it. And oh, we never had any sex anyway.' 2 In 1891 Wilde met Lord Alfred Douglas , son of the Marques of Queensberry. Both men became extremely fond of each other, despite the fact that Wilde was married. Douglas' father wanted the relationship to end. In 1895 Queensberry accused Wilde of sodomy; Wilde repudiated the charge and started proceedings against the Marques for slander. The court, however, ruled in favour of Queensberry. Evidence was produced during the trial that Wilde had had 'improper dealings' with young men of inferior birth and now he had to be in the dock himself. Although Wilde had the chance to flee to France he chose not to do so. Oscar Wilde was arrested and sentenced to two years hard labour. His wife divorced him and adopted the surname 'Holland' for herself and her two sons. During his imprisonment Wilde wrote a long letter to Douglas which was only published after his death under the title De Profundis . Cf Wikipedia. 3 He was a British mathematician and computer pioneer. In 1936, even before the existence of an electronically programmable computer, he devised a calculating model, the so-called Turing machine. In 1950 Turing published and article in the magazine MIND entitled Computing Machinery and Intelligence. In it he described his Turing test. For his vital contributions to the war effort Turing received an OBE ( Order of the British Empire ), and in 1951, for his important contributions to mathematics was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. The ACM Turing Prize is generally considered Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell117who was arrested in Great Britain for homosexual behaviour. He was sentenced to one year of hormonal treatment. Yet this human inclination calls forth all sorts of resistance here and there, despite the fact that it has never been scientifically shown that such behaviour would be unworthy. In the light of modern knowledge and opinions about how people should behave towards one another such stubborn adherence to this standpoint would be discriminatory. It can only mean that people never took the trouble to broaden their scientific knowledge and that they oppose any belief in progress. If the politician of today, a model for his electorate, persists in an archaic image of mankind, it reminds us of what not so long ago was claimed by politicians (like former president Mbeki) 4 in South Africa about Aids. He denied that it is a disease that can be combated by prevention (use of condoms) and by adequate medical antiretroviral treatment. As far as I am concerned the greatest enemy is the ignorance that people consciously or unconsciously (based on denial, indolence, fear of punishment or disaster) maintain. It is nothing but a show of mistrust of their own intelligence and that of others. the highest distinction in Information Technology. In 2009 people in the United Kingdom wanted a posthumous rehabilitation. In September of that year Prime Minister Gordon Brown on behalf of his government offered posthumous apologies to Alan Turing. Cf Wikipedia. 4 Tabo Mbeki questions the link between viruses and AIDS and believes (my italics, to) that the correlation between poverty and the AIDS rate in Africa was a challenge to the viral theory of AIDS. His fate was not helped by Health Minister Manto Tshabalala- Msimang and the overhaul of the pharmaceutical industry in South Africa. The delay in distributing antiretroviral drugs is attributed to the ban he placed on their use in public state hospitals, and is also linked to the estimated deaths of some hundreds of thousands. Thabo Mbeki has also been criticized for responding on negative comments made about governance by accusing them of racism. Cf Wikipedia. I would not be surprised if Mbeki (perhaps posthumously) were to be prosecuted for knowingly causing great damage to health and loss of life.119MIXED TEAMS OF OLD AND YOUNG PEOPLE RAISE PRODUCTIVITY T.I. Oei When assembling teams managers would do well to have older employees work together with younger ones to enhance output. Absenteeism would also become less. PhD student Franz Josef Gellert proposes this in his examination of the relationships on the shop floor between older and younger employees. He also established that not age but an education- directed environment strongly influences personal growth. With the prospect that employees will have to go on working longer because of the strong increase of the aging population, it becomes of interest to examine the relation between age and work. Gellert examined the influence of age on relationships and productivity in teams that are engaged in mentally and physically demanding work, such as working on an assembly line and caring for the aged. He collected data in old people's homes and small businesses in Germany and at a car manufacturer's in Sweden. Gellert comes to the conclusion that older people achieve more because of their experience. This holds good particularly in an environment with routines and automatisms, such as working on an assembly line. There was higher productivity and less absenteeism. Training It is wrong to suppose that older employees cannot profit from refresher courses, Gellert says. Personal growth is for a large part also stimulated by the working environment: when there are possibilities to exchange knowledge and such exchanges are also stimulated individual competences can grow. Gellert advocates mixed composition teams of old and young employees on the shop floor. Franz Josef Gellert (Bochum-Wattenscheid, 1954) was a student of European Economy at the AKAD University of Rendsburg. He is currently employed as senior researcher at the Hanze University of Applied Science, Groningen, International Business School. See also his webpage UvT. As a medical specialist I know that the master/mate relationship has always been of great importance in a physician's training. You learn most from an older, wiser colleague when he can demonstrate what you must do. It is this craft that decides whether you will make it as a professional. It goes all the more strongly for physicians, since it is not only about dexterity, getting a job PERSONAL SNIPPETS120done, but also about what is the best way to go about it, and with a certainty that bears no hesitation. Imagine being the patient of a fearful surgeon. No one would like to be in that patient's shoes. The relationship manager/professional in the field is an identical one, I think. The manager must be able to be one of them, without having to be a colleague in a narrower sense. The authority the manager must emanate is not only determined by his status or his experience, but also by his bearing as person and colleague. Frequently medical staff and management cannot easily agree. Why is that, one wonders? As far as I am concerned this is to do with equality and proportionality. Equality in exploring possibilities and realizing initiatives and proportionality of responsibility for what you do. It is absolutely legitimate that the responsibility you have to bear when you are in charge of five colleagues is much greater than when you are practising on your own. But that responsibility will have to be substantiated and that can be most convincingly done by demonstrating that you can achieve the best result.121THE PARANOID-SCHIZOID POSITION OF MELANIE KLEIN1 T.I. Oei Subject: Explaining Hell!!! The following is an actual question given on a University of Arizona chemistry mid-term, and an actual answer turned in by a student. The answer by this student was so 'profound' that the professor shared it with colleagues, via the Internet, which is, of course, why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well: Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)? Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following: First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. This gives two possibilities: 1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose. 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society, 2011, 26, 6 146-147 (Title: PREAMBIVALENCES).PERSONAL SNIPPETS1222. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct... ...leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting 'Oh my God.' THIS STUDENT RECEIVED AN A+. The above comes from Mike Chayes. What strikes me enormously is that it is possible for the mind to come up with a reasoned argument that leaves us all gasping. Is Hell then nothing but the given that in extreme circumstances (rage) we would like to see others (our supposed opponents) banished to different places (emptiness, ravines, caves, prison), whereas our own ambition is heaven (on earth or anywhere)? Determinism (either-this-or- that paradigm) does not seem to be such a bad thing, although it does not completely satisfy, it seems to me. Our freedom of choice can/should not be limited to just two possibilities: black/white, all/nothing, positive/negative, truth/untruth, responsible/irresponsible, good/evil. 2 That matters of faith not only have an emotional value, but are from the earliest age intermingled with our ways of thinking and feeling is once more apparent. The value of love and the value of the mother's breast -not to put too fine a point on it- may have more to do with each other than we realize. Therefore it seemed a sensible thing to me once more to air (in broad outline) the theory of Melanie Klein, one of the psychoanalytical pioneers, who today has great significance for psychoanalysis worldwide (especially in the English speaking world and in Middle and South America) Melanie Klein (source: Wikipedia) describes the earliest stages of infantile psychic life in terms of a successful completion of development through 2 M.F. Chayes: 'You are talking about where our conceptions of heaven and hell come from. You refer to pre-ambivalent dichotomies in pure opposites; characteristic of ----- but not identical with ----- what Kleinians group with their \"paranoid-schizoid position\". Really interesting, and very important, for events, controlled at that level, embellish but also corrupt our world.'Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell123certain positions. A position that Klein describes is a set of psychic functions that corresponds to a given phase of development, always appearing during the first year of life, but which are present at all times thereafter and can be reactivated at any time. There are two major positions: the paranoid- schizoid position and the depressive position. The earlier more primitive position is the paranoid-schizoid position and if an individual's environment and up-bringing are satisfactory, she or he will progress through the depressive position. The paranoid-schizoid position is conceived as the state of mind of children, from birth to four or six months of age. Although this position develops into the next position, it is normal to move back and forward between the two positions although some people operate in the paranoid schizoid position for much of the time. As one of the originators of Object Relations theory, Klein sees emotions as always related to other people or objects of emotions. Relations during these first months are not to whole objects but only to part objects, such as the breast, the mother's hands, her face etc. Paranoid refers to the central paranoid anxiety, the fear of invasive malevolence. This is experienced as coming from the outside, but ultimately derives from the projection out of the death instinct. Paranoid anxiety can be understood in terms of anxiety about imminent annihilation and derives from a sense of the destructive or death instinct of the child. In this position before the secure internalization of a good object to protect the ego, the immature ego deals with its anxiety by splitting off bad feelings and projecting them out. However, this causes paranoia. Schizoid refers to the central defence mechanism: splitting, the vigilant separation of the good object from the bad object. Klein posited that a healthy development implies that the infant has to split its external world, its objects and itself into two categories: good (i.e., gratifying, loved, loving) and bad (i.e. frustrating, hated, and persecutory). This splitting makes it possible to introject and identify with the good. In other words: splitting in this stage is useful because it protects the good from being destroyed by the bad. Later, when the ego has developed sufficiently, the bad can be integrated, and conflict can be tolerated. Later with greater maturity and the resolution of the depressive position, the ego is able to bring together the good and bad object thereby leading to whole object relations. Achieving this involves mourning the loss of the idealized object, and associated depressive anxieties. Klein described development as proceeding through two phases: the paranoid-schizoid position and the depressive position. In the paranoid-PERSONAL SNIPPETS124schizoid position, the main anxiety is paranoia and hypochondria, and the fear is for the self. When things are going well, the mother is experienced as an all benign figure. However, inevitably when needs or desires of the young baby are not immediately met by the mother, because she is not there to fulfil them, the absence of the good object is experienced as the presence of the bad object . The bad object is then hated and in the imagination it is attacked. The hated frustrating object quickly becomes persecutory as it is imagined to get revenge in a similar way to how it is being treated. This is why the baby feels persecuted, hence the ' paranoid ' in paranoid schizoid. As well as the bad (aggressive, hateful) parts of the self deriving from the death instinct being projected onto the object, goodness is also projected onto the object. It is easier to see why badness is projected outside the self rather than it being felt to be within. It is more difficult to understand why goodness also may be projected out. The reason is when the person does not feel that they can sustain goodness and it is safer for it to be put into the object. This is the basis for idealization, and it can be useful in certain situations, e.g. idealizing a doctor who is operating on you. The projection of badness into the object is the basis of racism, homophobia, or any other irrational hatred of another group seen as different from the self, e.g. estate agents, liberals, cyclists, single mothers, Northerners, Southerners, traffic wardens etc. Over time the baby becomes more able to tolerate frustration and hold onto the good object for increasing periods, enabling the baby to tolerate its own bad impulses without fear that these will destroy it. This enables a more realistic view of the self and object as possessing both good and bad attributes, leading to the greater integration and maturity of the depressive position. Klein emphasizes that the good and bad parts of the self are projected onto or into the object. This represents the operation of the life and death drive, of love and hate.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell125Literature Klein, M. (1946). Notes on Some Schizoid Mechanisms. Int. J.

Oei Last Thursday I was privileged to be in the cortege of professors of the University of Leiden during the PhD graduation ceremony of my niece, daughter of my late eldest brother.2 In many respects it was a memorable day. My two elder brothers are no longer alive and as the only male Oei I was allowed -on the invitation of the Dean- both as an uncle and as a professor, to do the honours. She was clearly appreciative, as she was regularly looking at me while upholding her thesis. Of course I was not allowed to join the opposition. When push comes to shove, two blood relations do not go well together. After all it is a formal, extremely responsible, struggle to stake your claim to scientific independence in the academy, and the best way to do that is to confront an audience with a maximum of different opinions. There were two foreign professors in the opposition and also her former professor who had supervised her master thesis. Furthermore four other colleagues, among whom her contemporary from UA (University of Amsterdam). While she was upholding her thesis it occurred to me more than once that you always should be clear in your objectives and communicative in your elucidations. She did so and applied touches of humour, which surprised outsiders, if I can interpret some peals of laughter like that. It is perhaps typical of the way in which the experienced scientist manages to bring his expertise across with a certain autonomy. I think that she did very well and it was a pleasure for me to congratulate her. But there can be no mistake: A PhD is the result of years of hard work out of the public gaze, the result of a project that usually requires the assistance of many colleagues, certainly in her field. The project demands the candidate's social talent to win people over, to want to have to do with people, in short that you love people. That is not in everybody's character. You must also be able in time to adapt yourself to altered circumstances, so as not to be led astray during your PhD studies. The lesson I learnt here was that it is not at all bad to show your soul, but that the answer to the question whether you will be successful lies in your own attitude and your own objectives. 1 Published in: Newsletter Dutch Psychoanalytic Society , 2011, 26, 4, p. 103. 2 During the PhD graduation ceremony 18-11-2010, of Nicole Y.L.

Oei 'Dear Karel, as always I read your mail with thanks and pleasure. I prefer them to Max Broadcasting or even NRC appendices. Owing to your attention attended a fascinating meeting \"Genesis of Mass Violence\" in Trippenhuis (Royal Scientific Society) in Amsterdam. Met interesting participants. Jan van Hooff told his primates tale again. Each time it is a joy to listen to this raconteur. This time the emphasis was on concerted demonic violence of chimp males with shocking footage. Did not appear to me to be a territorial issue, even though the victim lived next door. But inexplicable (fairly rare) sudden blood lust. Genetic meaning for Sapiens was suggested, but connection hard to make. Criticism from audience therefore based on thousand years of linguistic and cultural tradition of latter. Eye-opener was Otto Adang of Police Academy. Discrepancy between media reports of violence and police evaluations, among other things on video. Intelligent control strategies and disjunction from prejudices and press-exaggerated evaluations of numbers. Young Tom Postmes from RU Groningen (social psychology) I thought best of the lot. I am going to ask text of his lecture. As always Abram de Swaan last of the speakers, reflecting as usual more originally than anyone on state violence on the basis op opinions he had published before. There were no medico-psychiatric contributions. Nothing new after \"Massenpsychologie und Ich-analyse\"? (Quite a meagre essay by F.) Among the audience three young neurologists, who told me a lot during the break about the brain research they were conducting. Yesterday I received the thesis from one of them. R. Dijkgraaf, President of the KNAW [Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Science] wants to continue the research of violence. It is to be hoped that people representing these disciplines did not go unnoticed. Nor social psychologists who might supply a more focused new look on influence of group on individual violent transgression? With this reaction as my thanks and friendly salutation, D. I was recently asked by one of my colleagues if I knew a good proposition for his thesis. I did of course do a few suggestions, but, looking back, I think I could not entirely convince him. What I can propose, if and when he reads this, are the lessons I drew from reading the book by Luuk van Middelaar, De passage naar Europa , (The passage to Europe), Historische Uitgeverij, 2009. The authoritative nature of this book, last May upheld as a PhD thesis, lies in a virtuoso intertwining of words, language, comprehension and meanings, which all combined from a viewpoint in the past always are meaningful PERSONAL SNIPPETS130regarding people's behaviour and expectations. Inspirations by the French philosopher Michel Foucault. I have read the book with all my attention and will not try to suppress my admiration for this achievement. The writer had already impressed me with his wonderful book ' Politicide' some ten years ago, an elaborated book version of the thesis which he had upheld when he was a student of philosophy and history. I feel that in this present work the writer has matured somewhat further. His talent to unfold in a few lines a world of thoughts and meanings is almost exemplary. I hope he will continue like this. Some telling examples (possibly for a PhD thesis) I will take from the first 25 pages of Middelaar's thesis. It will be clear that I wish the reader all possible pleasure. In order to discover something new, you first have to let go of the idea that you already know how things work (p. 8, ibid.). But like an archaeologist you can also try to expose the events and the struggle that in all cases went before (p. 9, ibid.). Only this room (for European politics), which in essence turns out to be an interspace, remained invisible on account of the compulsion exerted by current patterns of thought (p. 9, ibid.). It [the book] wants to make the currents of history felt in our experience of today; it wants to mark our place in time and space (p. 11, ibid.). The term 'triangle' is rhetorically brilliant. He pacifies the conflicting positions by prescribing a balance (p. 20, ibid.). In language there is hidden disciplining, already in force at word level (p. 20, ibid.). Scientific 'persuasiveness' may be found both in analytical instruments and in the political premises. Fact and norm are not always strictly separable (p. 21, ibid.). Knowledge of integration requires a measurable result. That is why in this linguistic field bureaucratic policies are better-loved than whimsical politics (p. 22, ibid.). Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell131More exactly: like the knowledge of economists and social scientists exists by the grace of concrete results, like the historians and political analysts tell of the establishment and the exercise of a public will, so does the representation of lawyers revolve around casting unknown and uncontrollable situations in a form (p. 22/23, ibid.). Only the rule of law can transform a conceptual castle in the air into an institutional fact (p. 23, ibid.). 133WHO IS RIGHT IN A DEBATE ABOUT THE V ALUE OF LONG-TERM PSYCHOPHARMACA? A TEST OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE T.I. Oei In the recent book by Robert Whitaker about 'Anatomy of An Epidemic', 2010, we see how ill-considered, or in a different word unquestioning use of medication over many years can deteriorate into causing or sustaining unnecessary human suffering. First the words of Robert Whitaker (28-04-2010): 'A few years ago, while writing an article about the merits of psychiatric medications, I looked at whether the number of adults receiving a federal disability payment due to mental illness had significantly changed since 1987, which was the year that Prozac was introduced. Our society's use of psychiatric medications, of course, has soared since that time, and here's what I discovered: The number of adults, ages 18 to 65, on the federal disability rolls due to mental illness jumped from 1.25 million in 1987 to four million in 2007. Roughly one in every 45 working-age adults is now on government disability due to mental illness. This epidemic has now struck our nation's children, too. The number of children who receive a federal payment because of a severe mental illness rose from 16,200 in 1987 to 561,569 in 2007, a 35- fold increase. I wrote Anatomy of an Epidemic to investigate this epidemic, and this pursuit necessarily raises a very uncomfortable question. Although we, as a society, believe that psychiatric medications have \"revolutionized\" the treatment of mental illness, the disability numbers suggest a very different possibility. Could our drug- based paradigm of care, for some unforeseen reason, be fueling this epidemic? To answer that question, you need to pore through the scientific literature for the past 50 years and piece together a documented account of how psychiatric drugs affect long-term outcomes. Do the medications help people stay well? Function better? Enjoy good physical health? Or do they, for some paradoxical reason, increase the likelihood that people will become chronically ill, less able to function well, more prone to physical illness? Researchers have studied these questions in a variety of ways, and their results tell a story that is, to the say the least, startling. Here is just one of many such studies. In the 1980s, Martin Harrow, a psychologist at the University of Illinois, began a long-term study of 64 newly diagnosed schizophrenia patients. Every few years, he assessed how they were doing. Were they symptomatic? In recovery? Employed? Were they taking antipsychotic medications? The collective fate of the off-med and medicated patients began to diverge after two years, and by the end of 4.5 years, it was the off-medication group that was doing much better. Nearly 40% of the off-med group were \"in recovery\" and more than 60% were working, whereas only 6% of the medicated patients were \"in recovery\" and few were working. This divergence in outcomes remained throughout the next ten years, PERSONAL SNIPPETS134such that at the 15-year follow-up, 40% of those off drugs were in recovery, versus 5% of the medicated group. As Harrow reported at the 2008 annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, \"I conclude that patients with schizophrenia not on antipsychotic medication for a long period of time have significantly better global functioning than those on antipsychotics.\" This does not mean that antipsychotics don't have a place in psychiatry's toolbox. But it does mean that psychiatry's use of these drugs needs to be rethought, and fortunately, a model of care pioneered by a Finnish group in western Lapland provides us with an example of the benefit that can come from doing so. Twenty years ago, they began using antipsychotics in a selective, cautious manner, and today the long-term outcomes of their first- episode psychotic patients are astonishingly good. At the end of five years, 85% of their patients are either working or back in school, and only 20% are taking antipsychotics. In Anatomy of an Epidemic , I report on the long-term outcomes literature for schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, and bipolar illness, and also the literature that details outcomes for children treated with psychiatric medications. My hope is that if our society can become informed about these long-term studies, then it could have a reasonable discussion about embracing other models of care--like the one pioneered by the group in Finland--that have proven to help people get better and stay well too.' (My italics, to) In a debate about this matter my attention was particularly drawn by the reaction of Dr John, MD: 'Fascinating debate. How brave of Mr. Whitaker to present his work in such a venue. It's like Farrakhan preaching at a KKK rally. I would have to agree more with Dr Carlat however that the explosion in disability rates is a by-product of the disease model in psychiatry and the explosion of those being diagnosed along with the pt/lawyer/Dr disability industry rather than meds causing the disability. Regardless Mr Whitaker's overall indictment of contemporary biological psychiatry has merit. I cannot see how anyone could look at the contradictory data such as the WHO outcomes on psychotic disorders or the 15 yr Harrow study and not seriously doubt the current paradigm. (Those who get psychotic should always be given anti-psychotics and mostly should always be left on them) Why would anyone believe that? The drugs are a shotgun which may in fact blunt some symptoms but they certainly do not treat or reverse an understood neuro-pathologic process. I see just as many relapses on meds as off yet we always assume relapses are mostly secondary to people coming off their meds. Maybe for some they help and others they may worsen the course but we have no ability to predict what they are going to do for any pt we see in the long term. In the short term their benefits are not exactly impressive for most. I am not so sure deinstitutionalization can be credited to meds. That was a complex social and economic process. State hospitals and community in-pt psychiatric beds are evaporating. Are we to assume this is simply due to improvements in meds? There certainly is no evidence for this. Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell135After investing all that time in training I would love to say Robert Whitaker is mostly wrong in his general hypothesis about the failure of biological psychiatry and its potential to create iatrogenic pathology. Watching people get psychiatric TX for 15 years and seeing most of them either not get any better long term or even be made worse by it convinces me he is mostly right.' (My italics, to) The clinical convictions that antidepressants and antipsychotics will be necessary for the entire life of a patient with schizophrenic psychoses and bipolar depressions now seem outdated. 1 2 It is true that these convictions 1 UMC Utrecht Monday 11 April 2011: Patients who have recovered from their First psychosis must continue medication. Otherwise frequently a new psychosis occurs. Psychiatrist Geartsje Boonstra puts this in her PhD thesis. She will uphold her thesis on 12 April at UMC Utrecht. Boonstra analysed 20 schizophrenia patients who had had a first psychosis. The patients were mostly men of about 30. After recovery they continued using antipsychotics and did not show any more symptoms for at least a year. After this year half the patients began reducing their medication. The other half continued as before. After nine months of the reducing group 82 per cent had had a second psychosis in the medicine group only 12 per cent. Reducing medication therefore strongly increases the chances of a new psychosis. The effect was so strong that Boonstra and colleagues decided not to continue the research. All patients were advised to continue taking their meds or to restart their antipsychotics after relapse. Patients that were treated for psychosis are often eager to stop taking the medication when they are stable. After all they no longer suffer from the illness, but still feel the side effects. Antipsychotics lead to increased weight, motion disorders such as cramps or an urge to keep moving, dullness, flatter emotions and limited facial expression. \"I do understand quite well that patients have an urgent wish to stop taking their meds\", Boonstra says, \"But nearly everyone who tries suffers a relapse. We already knew that this was the case after several psychoses, but this research shows that it also happens after a first psychosis.\" Boonstra advises patients to keep taking their medication, even when they feel well. When they still want to reduce their intake, it is best done in consultation with their psychiatrist. The patient's treatment continues, so that in a relapse the psychiatrist can step in. \"It can also be an education for the patient A relapse can lead to the realization that the patient is permanently vulnerable, and that medication remain a necessity.\" Schizophrenia is chronic. The symptoms can be chemically suppressed, but will return when medication is stopped. Schizophrenics suffer psychoses. In a psychosis the patient has lost the normal touch with reality. The patient may be confused, hear voices and see things other people do not see. About one per cent of the Dutch population suffers from schizophrenia. Psychiatrist Geartsje Boonstra conducted her research at the UMC Utrecht; she now works at Altrecht GGZ. Prof. Ren\u00e9 Kahn and Prof. Diederik Grobbee of the UMC Utrecht supervised her research. Although the result is appealing, I think it is still too soon for a general conclusion. There were only 20 patients involved, and I am certain that researchers will have to do a large-scale research into the validity of this research. It is quite all right if on the basis of a clinical conviction patients are advised to continue their medication for some time after a first psychosis, but for how long, will for the time being remain an open question which certainly needs further research. 2 E.M. van Gent (28-02-11), neuropsychiatrist, expert in the field of bipolar disorders: 'You know, serious psychoses with relapses get antipsychotics earlier and every PERSONAL SNIPPETS136had been around already for some time, but, without doctors or hospitals or politics adequately (that is to say consciously) testing them, they were never refuted. Another perhaps somewhat longer current viewpoint is that people think that the unconscious has no importance whatsoever. For nobody knows exactly what it is. And moreover the unconscious is often not recognized. Where ignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise. It is obvious that the human being is hardly concentrating on processing views that are difficult to materialize. These unconscious ideas seem based on facts and on wishes and desires of people and of things, but are difficult to operationalize and therefore less relevant to daily practice. Nevertheless the value of the unconscious has been of topical interest again for some time now. (See for instance the book by A. Dijksterhuis, Het slimme onbewuste [The Clever Unconscious], 2007)3 Often certain interests go along with scrupulously fostering convictions and opinions. Interests on the basis of social positions and financial motives. The influence of politics is usually essential in this. We think for instance of medical consumerism, to what was so prominent in the 20th century: ideologies like Marxism (everyone was to claim equality in possibilities, the 'new man' would arise who was free from selfish and bad characteristics), liberalism (the freedom of the individual to seek self-development) empiricism (experience is the test of truths), scientism (the sciences are supreme; belief in science), psychoanalytical determinism (every event in a person's life can be analysed back to the data of the person). They have all individually (consciously or unconsciously) enraptured people just as much as they have unjustly forced them in a social straitjacket of what is good and proper and what is expected from you as a person. But the inner part, one's spiritual life is the treasure that every person should be proud of. It revolves around giving meaning to your life, as long as that is possible. The outer part of your human life, everything that confronts you or inspires you carries the lack of attraction of its secondary character: of what people or things already did, formulated, thought up, caused. The interaction between the two is only interesting from the moment you are conscious of your own desires and possibilities, in other words of self-knowledge. Preferably independent and separate from the thoughts and judgments of time you try to reduce they get a relapse. So eventually, after years, you have serious psychoses under antipsychotics left and the better ones have no medication. It does not mean anything for the effect of medication and social functioning.' 3 Ap Dijksterhuis is an advocate of intuitive thinking; in other words thinking without being conscious of the fact. He strongly proposes sleeping on taking difficult decisions. Your unconscious will get to grips with the problem while you are at rest, and after some time it is much easier to come to the right decision according to Dijksterhuis. In brief: unconscious thinking. The unconscious is the process that takes place in the brain but of which you are not aware.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell137others. This is not easy and can sometimes not be realized. Then creativity and the results of primary process thinking come into play. Those words that you use are not always the ones that best fit the thoughts, emotions, impressions, ideas and needs that you unconsciously have. That is why repeated evaluation (reality testing) in term -sometimes after some minutes/hours or days, sometimes after one or even several years- is necessary to review those opinions and convictions of yours and where necessary to adapt them. For the work that cannot be (socially) tested rapidly falls prey to critics. The criticisms of society are often not conclusively argumented, and are most times characterized by a certain - often unconscious- tendency. This might be an ideological tendency (e.g. market mechanism, of an economic nature, or psychosocially determined) but may sometimes get the character of inertia, indolence, naivety, fear of change. That is why self-knowledge is of utmost importance for the individual's development, in order to be able effectively to test the veracity of opinions and convictions of yourself and of others. Reaction of a former A-trainer psychiatry in Dordrecht: 'Dr. A. (Lex) Wunderink, founder of Het Kasperspad in Dordrecht, and now A-trainer in Friesland, got his PhD in Groningen two years ago on a study of patients with schizophrenia that refuse to take their medication. And the results prove them right with striking frequency.' Reaction of an emeritus professor psychiatry: 'I also sometimes can't help feeling that the long-term prognosis of our psychiatric patients has greatly deteriorated since the beginning of my training (1979) and that that is the consequence of a chronic use of psychopharmaca. In former days we did not refer to most psychiatric afflictions as chronic diseases, now we do. I sometimes think: our psychopharmaca help in the acute phase, but subsequently make the patients dependent. It seems to me they deregulate synaptic activity for good, so that they can not do without pills. Like prednisone suppresses the natural activity of the adrenal cortex.' Reaction from a head of research of a large psychiatric centre, who is prepared to make me a present as an advance on my coming retirement: 'That is an interesting thought which actually has been around in psychiatry for quite a while and that no one wants to burn their fingers on. That is how I remember things with people with a first psychosis in Holland. There were those who advocated light titration to a clinically effective dose which would then be slowly reduced once the disorder had disappeared. Another aspect was that there PERSONAL SNIPPETS138would be light titration with a first or second psychosis, that with a first psychosis the maintenance dose would be set at one and possibly two years whereas with a second psychosis the maintenance dose would be kept at two to three years after the psychosis. Then, with a third or more frequent psychosis a lifelong need for a maintenance dose would be indicated. All this led to a polarized debate that was mainly dominated by a typecasting of psychiatrists: there was for instance A. who advocated the first and B. who advocated the second strategy. Neither was handicapped by any insight in the matter, let alone a willingness to find out how things really were (evidence based medicine). Your example is a nice case in point because it shows that years of medication also lead to iatrogenous and harmful effects. You will not hear pharmacists about this because it would mean nibbling at their income. I am at X where there are also long-term patients, and I find myself quite faced with the long-term effects of neurotropic medication. They are not trifling. The question is of course whether these effects are caused only by the psychotropic substances or mediated by the almost inhuman situation in which chronic patients find themselves. I quite agree with the idea that longitudinal research should be conducted. For that matter not only psychotropic medications should be dealt with, but also those for somatic afflictions. And what about those piles of psychotropics for dementing people, combined with meds prescribed to reduce the side-effects. The research you refer to is a good start. But: can you imagine what is demanded/required in order to awaken the realization with generations of psychiatrists and psychologists that medication is/ should be a temporary aid. And also: with a temporary somatic deficiency or failure would you dare suggest after some time that meds have more side effects than effects? These times require revolutionaries to operationalize such questions. Karel: you cannot leave, you must stay.' 139FORW ARD TOW ARDS DEDICATED FORENSIC POLICY CONCERNING TREATMENT AND TREATMENT PLANS T.I. Oei Yesterday it took me several hours to get from Zeist to De Steeg. Snow, biting cold and slippery roads were the reason. Then I arrived at a wonderful country seat1 with vaulted ceilings, run for the past year and a half by two active people. One of them was so kind as to give me a lift to the restaurant 'Het wapen van Athlone',2 which also used to be a hotel in former days.3 I was there for the biannual dinner meeting with the board of the Foundation Koningsheide. As always it was a cosy, friendly, educational and especially heart-warming affair. Among others there was Dr. Henk Nijman, professor forensic psychology of RU Nijmegen. Two newly appointed Foundation professors were there for the first time: Dr. Ko Hummelen, Professor forensic psychiatry RU Groningen and Dr. Jan Hendriks, professor forensic psychiatry and psychology of the VU Amsterdam. They outlined an interesting panorama of activities, and also their plans for the immediate future. There were lively discussions, about subjects that regard us all: the security of the country, government policies regarding detention in a psychiatric clinic, youth detention and the penitentiaries. We talked about the future plan to have the professors of forensic psychiatry and psychology discuss mutual interests and activities more frequently. And furthermore also of course about current, sometimes rather emotional themes, such as: what the judiciary and the behavioural experts can accomplish together, the political resistance and influences that often colour the policies of Justice and of Mental Health Care. Plus the question whether it is not about time, now there is more traffic between Justice and Mental Health Care, for professionals from both sides to have more and more mutual contacts for cooperation and coordination of many activities like guidelines, achievement 1 The estate 'Rhederoord' lies near Arnhem in the village of De Steeg. The stately country seat in a park of 12 hectares offers wonderful views of the spurs of the IJssel valley and the woods of the Veluwe. There are 22 hotel rooms and the establishment can accommodate 250 guests in atmospheric rooms. 2 One of the reviews: ' A fantastic restaurant... Absolutely top class. Wonderful food, tastefully served. The atmosphere is highly enjoyable. Prices are reasonable. Service is courteous and thoughtful.' 3 [The Athlone Arms] The name Athlone refers to the history we share with castle Middachten. PERSONAL SNIPPETS140indicators, methods for management and care on the shop floor. The importance of a therapeutic atmosphere in the clinics and more treatments that matter determine the balance between the actual work connected with treatment and its administration. After all, the more effective the treatment, the more sense its reporting makes. The function of the EFP was emphatically mentioned, and the cooperation with bodies such as NIFP (Netherlands Institute for Forensic Psychiatry and Psychology ) and the NVvP (Dutch Association of Psychiatry) Attention was specifically drawn to the biannual prize organized by the Foundation Koningsheide. 4 In short, for many there was plenty of food for thought and of further plans for serious activities to benefit the patient detained in psychiatric hospitals and in the penitentiaries and policlinics. 4 Rules Koningsheide Prize 2010/2011 1. The Board of the Foundation Koningsheide can award a prize to a behavioural expert who because of his/her publication has made a special contribution to the scientific development of the field of forensic psychology and/or psychiatry. Furthermore the Board can award an honourable mention. 2. The prize is awarded biannually and will be in the form of a sum of money to be determined by the Board. The next Prize will be awarded in the autumn of 2011 and will be \u20ac 5,000. 3.

Authors, both individual and groups can submit one or more publications, moreover everyone can register candidates for the prize with the Board of the Foundation Koningsheide. Registration must be completed before March 1, 2011, at most two months after the end of the evaluation period for the publication. 5. If the jury does not nominate candidates the Board of the Foundation Koningsheide will decide not to award a prize. 6. The prize will be presented in a way to be determined by the Board of the Foundation Koningsheide. Professors at the Foundation Koningsheide can register publications as co-authors, but the other authors can only be eligible for the prize. 7. The Board of the Foundation Koningsheide will see to adequate publicity surrounding the prize. 8. The Board of the Foundation Koningsheide will decide regarding all issues not covered by these rules. 9. Authors are invited to bring publications that appeared in the period 1 September 2008 until 1 January 2011 to the jury's attention by sending four copies to A. de Feijter LLM, secretary of KA Arnhem). Those who want to draw the jury's attention to a publication are requested to do the same. The closing date for publications is 1 March 2011. A jury consisting of Prof. F.A.M. Kortmann (chairman), Em. Prof. A.W.M. Mooij and Dr. R. van Veldhuizen, will evaluate the entries. The prizes will be presented in the autumn.141CONSOLATION T.I. Oei A Republican senator from the American state of California, who detests equal rights for homosexuals, yesterday (8 March 2010) admitted on radio that he is a homosexual himself. Last week Roy Ashburn was extensively in the news for having been caught for drunk driving. The rumour then was that the senator returned from a visit to a gay bar. Yesterday the truth was aired on local radio. Ashburn is indeed gay. In the past the 55-year-old father of four regularly made choices that were negatively received by the gay scene. Ashburn repeatedly voted against bills that were to provide more rights for gay people. He said that he opposed these bills because his voters wanted him to. Such a news item is neither new, nor world shaking. A century ago Freud already thought that man has bisexual tendencies. Yet (still or again) violent contrasts are created between what a homosexual and a heterosexual ought to be. If only we would stop to consider the fact that we all, without exception, have both feminine and masculine traits in ourselves, we would perhaps be a little further in our scientific insights. A typically feminine cerebrum (slightly less heavy than the masculine one) or a masculine muscularity hardly changes things. Perhaps we have the potential, just as in many animals, to display homosexual or heterosexual behaviour, without in advance wanting or wishing to do so. It is true that radical behaviour may boomerang. The inclination for black/ white thinking is a pointless way for finding pragmatic solutions. Pluralism is the best medicine against all sorts of monistic radicalities if we were to paraphrase Isaiah Berlin's classification. Absolutism has always been a primitive way of lending magic powers to our human frailties. It has an attractive aspect: all or nothing thinking lends a certain peace and quiet to the human soul. However, life itself is more difficult, with its depths and heights, contrasts and obligations, uniformities and diversities, laughter and tears, pain and consolation, in short everything that the misery of everyday brings along. We cannot escape that our unconscious will always be victorious: the will to survive remains the ultimate expedient in our existence. That the senator who wanted to forget his depression and unhappiness through liquor and intoxication, ultimately arrives at the real truth about himself by an unburdening to the entire world, can only be applauded when we talk about the mental hygiene of his mind. Coming clean in the sense of confession may not only be a consolation to the soul but apparently is also salutary for the resolution of internal conflicts.143THE TRUTH ABOUT FREE WILL AND WHAT NOT T.I. Oei 'Veracity finding in the criminal trial' Some self-relativization scientists cannot be denied. It is especially expressed in the only truth that scientists wholeheartedly embrace: \"There is no truth\". That is correct. For also that truth is not completely true. When a scientist talks about 'the truth' he mostly means the provisional truth in the sense of a hypothesis or a theory that has not yet been refuted, that has not yet been \"falsified\". In that light the proposition that truth does not exist is the driving force for scientific progress. After all, scientific progress is in fact not much more than a continuous exposure of scientific errors: there is always room for improvement. But there are also other concepts of veracity. Such as: truth in the sense of \"not telling a lie\"; truth in the sense of \"corresponding to reality or corresponding to what actually happened\"; truth in the sense of \"a conclusion from a sound and logical reasoning\" or more generally: truth in the sense of \"a result from a system of pronouncements coherent with the claim to veracity\". And even: truth in the sense of \"corresponding to a normative rule or to a normative decision of an authoritative body\". Such as: he has committed a punishable offence. From that point of view the proposition \"there is no truth\" at any rate is true insofar as is meant that there are more truths than the scientific truth. Not only do most of these concepts of veracity play a role in the framework of scientific veracity finding, but also and sometimes exclusively (cf the \"normative\" truth) in the framework of the substantive veracity finding in the criminal trial. Does \"there is no truth\" also hold good for all those other concepts of veracity? When someone tells what he knows, he speaks \"the truth\". That truth exists at any rate. A different matter is that the court must guard against interchanging the various concepts of veracity. For example it must not derive the truth that belongs to the one concept of veracity from another concept of veracity (finding). If a person does not tell a lie, and in that sense speaks the truth, it does not go without saying that \"truth in the sense of corresponding to what actually happened\" may be concluded from it. It takes more than that. At least it must be established that the person in question was able to observe what he says he has observed. That means that the truth in the sense of \"not telling a lie\" perhaps not in itself, but in conjunction with other relevant \"truths\" can contribute to the conviction of the court that the charges can be said to have been proved. In other words: the various concepts of veracity (and the types of veracity finding that go hand in hand with them) must be methodologically clearly distinguished, but PERSONAL SNIPPETS144their results must be soundly linked together to form a multiple anchor for the conviction of the court. A problem, however, is that in complicated cases the court regularly has to ask scientists to appear as experts for assistance in solving difficult issues. What value should the court attach to the scientific truth on which the expert bases his contribution, now that in science -practice shows- continuously errors are exposed and scientists (also within the framework of criminal veracity finding) on the basis of new insights not infrequently rescind earlier scientific views and assumptions? In that light does asking scientists to appear as expert witnesses in the criminal trial not by definition constitute an unacceptable risk for substantive veracity finding in the criminal trial which is the basis for the ultimate, frequently radical, judicial reckoning? And is the court actually able to form a judgment of the correctness of what the expert maintains, now that even in science it is by no means considered unlikely that the truth may be superseded by new insights? Here as well applies that the court's conviction must be founded on an addition of mutually reinforcing (concepts of) truths, often not decisive each in itself. In that sense the court must work miracles. Building a consistent and solidly anchored story that leads to a judicial finding with an acceptable margin of uncertainty nowadays is highly demanding. For, although normally speaking exposing scientific errors can be qualified as scientific progress, scientific errors that lead to judicial errors are unmitigated disasters. Add to this everything that may methodologically go wrong with (interchanging and linking of) all sorts of different concepts of veracity (finding), it is nothing short of miraculous that there are still courts that still find the courage to cut knots and that in the majority of cases they are correct. However, as all scientists know from experience: there is always room for improvement. A powerful lesson that scientists are only too willing to teach lawyers - considering the comments in scientific circles on some notorious errors of justice- and which we naturally are willing to learn.' ( N.J.M. Kwakman, Column RU Groningen January 2011). In a workshop on 20 January 2011, organized by the Platform Psychiatry and Justice of the Dutch Association for Psychiatry and the Faculty of Philosophy of the VU Amsterdam, about Accountability, about free will, science and justice the amiable neuroscientist Victor Lamme was one of the speakers. At first sight an unpretentious colleague, physician by origin, but he had never treated patients. At an early age already into experimental research, medical- physical and later purely neurobiological/neurocognitive. 'I find it pleasing to think up things', was his comment to the question why he decided to choose that career. In the past year he featured prominently in the media because of his publication 'There is no free will' nice and provocative for anyone who sooner or later (in)voluntarily finds himself tangling with the question Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell145whether or not he/she uses a free will. He was kind enough to be present for almost the entire workshop, whereas he had first intimated that he would have to leave after lunch. What struck me as a listener was that everyone took great pains to follow his nearly inexhaustible supply of scientific experiments as earnestly as possible. However, no one there had been surprised that he had dedicated his book to 'Yoka, my love, my only real free will'. (p. 4). And that while in his argument he had definitely been upholding his disbelief in the existence of free will. What concerned me was in how far we can live with ambiguities, ambivalences, and the acceptation of being at the same time for and against something, a person, a matter, a belief or a conviction. Later that day Ybo Buruma, a gifted speaker, could convince his audience that free will is found of importance by us, people, and that justice is not immune to that. This, witness the judgment of the Supreme Court from 1916, as Leo Polak did in his own inimitable way, means that a free will is attributed to the individual.1 So it has a normative meaning and as such a special nature of veracity. When you put it like that it sounds likely and is acceptable for the average citizen.2 1 'Combating fate and evil was the moral task of every right-minded person: elevating himself and others above the seeming inevitability of injustice in human existence. Just trying your best. Only the person who did that, with his slight powers or his mighty ones, is morally responsible, is worth and worthy of his freedom.' Cf Wikipedia about Leo Polak. And also: '(...) more and more he had been won over by the 'retaliation concept', and circa 1916 his ideas had become concrete in the form that he termed 'objectification theory'. Ever since then he regarded retaliation as an imperative demand of justice, compatible with other purposes of punishment, but which could on no condition give way to them. His starting point was the main principle of Heymans' ethics: the objectivity and the moral reproach of the character. The selfish inclinations in the character may not prevail, not only in a practical way (compensation, restitution), but also insofar as the person who acts immorally may not derive satisfaction from actions that from the legal point of view and so from that of a right-minded person are regrettable. This degree of regrettability and the suffering caused by the penalty must be in proportion. But capital punishment can never qualify as penalty: death is no suffering in itself, the fear of death may be, but cannot have a relation to the offence.' polak [13-03-2008]. 2 Sigmund Freud for example was not one of the last psychoanalysts to maintain that there is no free will. He put it as follows: in important decisions we always have the feeling that we are driven by all sorts of conscious and unconscious forces; in deciding small, insignificant things we experience the opposite: we feel free to do this or that. Our belief in free will is deeply rooted, but is nevertheless illusory. Freud belonged to the group of the so-called incompatibilists: he believed that free will and determinism could not co-exist (Edward Erwin, Philosophy and Psychotherapy , London, Sage, 1997). He did believe that disposing of freedom of action and the ability to act PERSONAL SNIPPETS146 The need that we feel as human beings is that in principle everybody is free to act and behave as he wishes. And, no matter what, that this freedom entails that we are faced with ambiguities and ambivalences in behaviour. When a patient asked a colleague psychoanalyst whether psychoanalysis could endanger his faith, my colleague answered: 'At the beginning of my own learning analysis I was an atheist, at the end of the analysis, I had become a believing atheist.' If in human relations reciprocal reactions are possible, then most certainly also human contradictions. otherwise are one and the same. Erwin says: 'Freud's argument is just the traditional one of the \"Hard Determinist\".' For the most part Freud takes his own experience and maintains that all actions and mental events are caused. Psychoanalysts find it interesting to know in how far we are free, if we are free at all.147THE RELIABILITY OF SCIENTIFIC REPORTS AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS AND OUR BRAIN WHEN ACHIEVEMENTS ARE TO BE MADE T.I. Oei How reliable are scientific studies? Marcus R. Munaf\u00f2 and Jonathan Flint, editorial, British Journal of Psychiatry, 2010, 197, p. 257-258. Why is so much scientific research likely to be false? 'A number of factors are empirically known to introduce bias into the literature and contribute to the risk of false-positive results: 1. Publication bias; 2.Longer time to publish for results which do not achieve statistical significance; 3.The trend for effect sizes to decrease with year of publication; 4.The poor predictive value of initial reports; 5. The post hoc study of further subgroups defined by gender or environmental factors; 6. Source of funding. There is evidence that all of these frequently occur. (...) Further: We found, perhaps paradoxically, that studies published in journals with a low impact are more likely to give an accurate effect size estimate than those published in journals with a high impact factor (Munaf\u00f2 MR, Stothart G, Flint, J. Bias in genetic association studies and impact factor. Mol Psychiatry 2009, 14, p. 119-120).' Every human activity has its strong and weak sides, contains honesty and falsehood, legal aspects as well as illegal ones. That is inherent to being human. Fortunately we can be somewhat opener about this, although money often turns out to be a taboo area. Where science must be translated into money, in the sense of subsidies and the like, the human factors of honesty but also of dishonesty will appear.1 1 'A great number of years ago a conflict about a manuscript was suddenly focused on the question whether the use of cannabis or personal characteristics are determinative in a recurrence of psychosis. The statistics of the time indicated that both are strongly linked variables in the result. To get an answer to the question what to do I sent the anonymized manuscript to a number of external colleagues, asking for advice. This was regarded a casus belli by the professor. An internal Inquisition commission was appointed and the end result was that yours truly was said to be wrong on the basis of the argument that in the 'cannabis sample' there were more subjects (5) of the total sample than in the 'personality sample' and was therefore over-representative and PERSONAL SNIPPETS148This need not surprise or irritate us for achievement on the basis of self- interest is a thorny issue.2 The recent credit crunch speaks volumes: many were only concerned with making the maximum profit, at the expense of what is just and proper. Already early in his scientific career Freud had to do with this kind of business.3 He found that money had to do with emotion and where emotion is concerned the unconscious will make a hefty contribution. In the sense of hanging on, letting go, not budging, keeping in reserve, not playing the trump cards, living it up or strutting around in borrowed plumage, and so forth. In politics we see this happening every day of course, but also in science. Science and politics are to each other as bees and honey. The one is impossible without the other. The one party want or has to impress the other party, often on the basis of unconscious aggression. In other human actions as well unconscious, dark feelings play a part. The German who had been deserted by his boss, in frustration drove aimlessly valid. And would I please find other employment. In the years after 1990 this research group publishes/published articles of two fixed samples of 200 and 79 articles with sample sizes of 20-200, and 10-79 respectively. I have at times expressed my surprise internally, among others to former members of that so-called Inquisition commission some of whom now professors, and was rewarded with looks expressing -over the years in my perception increasing- melancholy. I have on occasion bared my heavy heart to the chairman of the university science commission, who looked at me and explained that by my co-publication I had agreed to this reality...', a colleague/ professor says. 2 A frustrated colleague/patient about another colleague: 'Throughout his career this colleague has breached good publication practice and so he has continuously clearly defined intellectual dishonesty in scientific articles. In the period that I was working as assistant to Z, and after that and also regarding other colleagues, Z claimed first authorship for articles to which he had made no contribution whatsoever. 3 In 1908 Freud identified money with faeces and made a connection of money to anal eroticism. He also wrote (1917) of the unconscious, symbolic connection of money, through transformation of the instincts, with penises, babies and gifts. According to Turkel (1988) Fenichel enlarged on Freud's linkage of money with faeces 'by declaring that money can symbolize anything one can give or take: milk breast, baby, sperm, penis, protection, gift, power, anger, degradation. He viewed money as a source of narcissistic supply originating in an instinctual need for food and for omnipotence.' (p.525) In Turkel's own more recent view, money in our culture 'is also a symbol of worth, competence, freedom, prestige, masculinity, control, and security, all of which can become areas of conflict.' (p.525). The connection of money with psychopathology was established by Freud, who linked it with anal character traits and obsessional neurosis in the Rat Man case.(1909) . Cf Freud, Sigmund. (1909) Notes on a case of obsessional neurosis. Standard Edition , Vol. 10. (p. 155-318). London, Hogarth Press; Freud, Sigmund.

The abduction culminated in a probably explosive mix of actions and emotions, such as sexual abuse, fear, guilt, shame, remorse, which eventually could or had to lead to the boy's violent death. 4 That is more or less how I imagine it.5 4 'Another fact that belongs to the problem-rich field of ethics is that adversity, so frustration from outside, extraordinarily reinforces the power of conscience in the Superego. As long as the person prospers, his conscience is mild and allows his Ego everything; as soon as an accident occurs, he subjects himself to self- analysis, concludes he is sinful, tightens up the demands of his conscience, imposes deprivations on himself and punishes himself by penances. (...) It is remarkable how differently primitive man behaves! If an accident has happened to him, he does not blame himself, but the fetish, which has obviously not done its duty and castigates it instead of punishing himself.' Cf S. Freud, The discomfort in culture, in: Cultuur Co, London, 1948. 5 The German man who was arrested for the murder and abuse of the German Mirco Schlitter (10) has confessed. This was announced on a press conference in Krefeld (Germany) on Friday (ANP, 28-01-2011). The man is 45-year-old Olaf H. from Schwalmtal, ten kilometres on the other side of the border from Roermond. He is a father of three, of 2, 14 and 17 years old, married for the third time. He was arrested in his home on Wednesday at 6 a.m. His family are completely surprised and shocked by his arrest. The man worked for a large telecom company in Bonn. Random victim He said he had done the deed because of stress at work. (This turned out to be a falsehood, later he indicated he had been abused as a child, which cannot be verified). His boss had come down hard on him that day. After work he drove around for hours in his car in the surroundings of Grefrath, just across the border from Venlo. At about ten o'clock he had overtaken the boy from Grefrath, who was on his bike. He got out of his car and ordered the boy to get in. The boy was a completely random victim. Not buried The man kidnapped the boy and undressed him. He then tried to perform sexual acts. All in all he was occupied with the boy for three hours and then thought: 'I cannot allow him to go home any more', leader of the investigation Ingo Thiel said. The police refuse to say how the boy was killed. After his arrest the alleged killer was relieved. 'He was very calm and said: okay then, I will tell you where the boy lies', Ingo Thiel said. Olaf H. had not buried his victim, but put him in a sheltered place. A thousand policemen Olaf H. did not have a criminal record. Nothing was known of paedophile inclinations. For months the man had been silent about his act which took place on 3 September. When the boy was reported missing police mounted one of the largest searches in German history. In one action one thousand police were deployed. Track Contrary to belief it was not the Volkswagen Passat Kombi that put the police on the man's track. He had rapidly disposed of the car by selling it, so it was no longer registered. There were other indications that put the police on the scent, the leader of the investigation stated. The car now has Luxemburg registration. It was found near Frankfurt airport. In the car traces of Mirco were found.PERSONAL SNIPPETS150The same emotions and feelings that every individual experiences when he indulges in a pointless affair or activity, which is combined with money, abuse of confidence, power/powerlessness in a relationship and then scoring in the sense of unleashing a sexual and/or violent urge. Going astray, research shows, finds its origin in the brain. Of course: we are nothing without our head, but it revolves round the question whether when in origin a flame somewhere starts burning, this can be brought into focus (in and through our brain) and in how far such a thing can be tempered or brought under control. For this latter consideration and reflection, that is to say internal dialogue and will power are important, factors that unfortunately are difficult to visualize I am afraid. Our brain is too crudely built and too little transparent to us humans. Nothing under the sun progresses of its own accord. 151I COULD NOT AGREE MORE T.I. Oei The success of a good research institute lies in the altruism of the research leader. Professor Peter Nijkamp, VU Amsterdam: 'Scouting talented and gifted researchers is of utmost importance. You will often see that a research leader is afraid to appoint people who are better than himself. But when such a person retires, mostly the research institute just collapses like a jelly shortly after.' This is a fine and true statement of a great researcher, economist and (most certainly) human being. I do not know him at all, but the way in which this statement expresses his individuality, to me speaks volumes. There is no need for me to know him personally, although I would certainly wish it were so, but sometimes you know instinctively that here we have dependable human action. It is not something that you need to dwell on too much or too long. The true character of a person or the beauty of a statement immediately suggests itself to you, as if it radiates the evidency. Sometimes words fail indeed, or it does not take any time at all to know that things are all right. People can find each other quite easily then. Especially when there is that 'click' in the contact.153BETTER IS THE ENEMY OF GOOD T.I. Oei Early improvement in positive rather than negative emotion predicts remission from depression after pharmacotherapy European Neuropsychopharmacology Volume 21, Issue 3 , Pages 241-247, March 2011 Abstract Knowledge on mechanisms involved in early prediction of response to antidepressant medication may help optimize clinical decision making. Recent studies regarding response to pharmacotherapy implicate resilience- like mechanisms and involvement of positive, rather than negative emotions. The aim of the current study is to examine the contribution of early change in positive affect to the prediction of response to pharmacotherapy. Positive and negative emotions were measured at baseline and during the first week of pharmacotherapy, using experience sampling techniques. The association between early change in positive and negative emotions and severity of depressive symptoms at week six was examined in a sample of 49 depressed patients. The added benefits of measuring early change in positive emotions compared to early Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) change alone were evaluated through model comparisons. Early improvement in positive affect during the first week of treatment predicted the continuous HDRS score ( = 0.64, p < 0.001), response (50% reduction; OR = 4.32, p < 0.01), and remission (HDRS 7; OR = 9.29, p < 0.001) at week six with moderate to large effect sizes. Effects of early change in negative emotions were only half as large and disappeared when evaluated simultaneously with early change in positive emotions. When early change in positive emotions was added to the models including early HDRS change only, all three models improved significantly. In conclusion, early change in positive rather than negative emotions best predicted response to treatment, supporting the notion that antidepressants activate resilience-like mechanisms. Moreover, monitoring of positive emotions in early stages of treatment may improve clinical decision making. This is a clinical research, just as clear as it is practically reproducible with the aid of HDRS. As a researcher one would wish there was more research of this kind. At the memory of that research-focused, clinically sound thinking Max Hamilton (the spiritual father of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - HDRS) I cannot but recall the seventies/eighties. Herman PERSONAL SNIPPETS154van Praag1 introduced me, fledgling psychiatrist, to the IGSAD friends in 1979: International Group for the Study of Affective Disorders. The group consisted of venerable clinicians/researchers from many countries: among them Bernie J. Carroll (known for his studies with the dexamethasone suppression test as a diagnostic tool in depression) Fred K. Goodwin and George Winokur from the US, Paul Grof from Canada, Jules Angst from Switzerland, Max Hamilton et al. from the UK, Ole Rafaelsen from Denmark, Julien Mendlewicz from Belgium, and representatives from Sweden, Germany and Israel. All of them had already won their spurs in clinical psychiatry and they were working on biological psychiatry which was emerging then. For me as a budding psychiatrist, but also as a fledgling researcher it was a special experience to be permitted to join the intensive discussions about recent research in a pleasant ambiance of erudite and learned colleagues and researchers. But they were especially fascinating as persons. It was paradise for a beginning researcher. I was preparing for such a career, but did not have any idea whether it would be all right. Later it turned out that Herman van Praag had become too big for the provincial university town of Utrecht. He was to receive an honourable offer to make two institutions in the Bronx in New York work together, and to expand the research and the teaching there. He wrote about this, for instance in the preface to the textbook J.E. Hovens, 2004, p. 7-13. I remember quite well that Herman asked me if I was not interested in writing. I had done my PhD already a few years earlier at the Freie Universit\u00e4t in West Berlin, but was involved in the learning analysis, which took a lot of my time. Travelling up and down between Zeist and Amsterdam where the analysis took place. It took nearly the whole morning. I was still single at the time. Which appeared not to be a bad thing, for I was told in the analysis that it might be better to postpone marital worries for a while, in other words to put off things that might cost a lot of energy. Energy that was badly needed for a good analysis. This kind of arrangement is no longer made, we now know better. 2 'Of course I would like to write', I explained to Herman, but 1 Scientist X: ' (... ) I have good memories of him from my time in Utrecht. That was the period of anti-psychiatry, the time of \"the journey inside\" that schizophrenia patients were said to be making. In this period I asked him now and then to teach on psychoses and mood disorders, and he always did. He never dodged the discussion and always tried to keep the debate with those hot-headed ideologically motivated people (\"the fascists of tomorrow\" as Che Guevara would say) going, to try to make them see that there was and is another side to the medal. For him as an academician I have always been highly appreciative.' 2 'La mejor es lo que m\u00e1s te guste', the better thing is what pleases you more. 20 uur geleden.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell155I added that I did not have the energy. And on top of that I feared that I did not have the qualities of a good writer. His laconic rejoinder: 'What is better, so long as it is good!' He has remained true to this principle throughout his career (even though he will think that there is always room for improvement), and not without success! In that sense I really feel that I am his pupil, for that principle I have always firmly adhered to even though I knew there were many pitfalls. 157RETURN TO SOCIETY T.I. Oei The formal leave-taking (04-03-2011) of Professor M. Moerings, professor of penology (the science of punishment) at the University of Leiden on his 65th birthday took place in the Grand Auditorium of the Academy building, 73 Rapenburg, Leiden in the midst of an impressive audience. Impressive for two reasons: 1 Every seat in the hall was taken: professors, the board of the faculty and of the criminal law department, colleagues, students and other interested parties. Among them a lady who found it impossible to restrain herself during the absorbing lecture. All at once she loudly exclaimed: Vice, that is all so superficial, that is not what I came for, -or words to that effect. The speaker stood thunderstruck, then resumed, saying: I will continue nevertheless. Some spluttering from the corner where the lady was seated, one of the others in the corner intervened, successfully: quiet returned to in the hall. 2 The speaker interlaced his speech with instructive slides, and everyone appeared interested. At the end of his lecture he concluded by showing THANKS as his last slide, and expressed his appreciation of the university, faculty, colleagues, co-workers and students. The dean, Professor C.J.J.M. Stolker referred at length to Professor Moering's communicative characteristics. This was not only because within ten years -in close cooperation with his co-workers- he had built the criminology department from scratch, but also because on top of the work for this he found time to supervise PhD students and successfully to manage various projects. One of his PhD graduates corroborated this outline of the person and his importance for the atmosphere and the productivity of the department. His positive attitude, his amiability, the meaningful impression of a man who loved men, but surrounded himself with women. In other words a friend for and to all. I thanked him for the honour of inviting me. I have known him since the time I wrote some contributions to ' Proces ' [Trial] where he was editor in chief. That this co-operation was a reason for a relationship of many years standing -he also invited me to his inaugural lecture- clearly shows what importance Martin attaches to contacts with people. I praised his loyal friendship even though I do not consider him a colleague/friend in a narrower sense.PERSONAL SNIPPETS158Yet friendship can mean more than simply inviting people. It concerns the basic attitude of people for associating with other people (including criminals and handicapped people): to make them return to society as full citizens and to treat them as such. There and then I had the opportunity to have a conversation with a former psychiatric patient (whom I had never met before), a classmate of the guest of honour and as such an example of that attitude. What is important is that a person after serving his penalty can continue with his life as he would have if the criminal act had not queered his pitch. The penalty must not entail that a justiciable person is wounded in his soul to such a degree that it would mentally break him: not only penalized by exclusion or physical restraint, but also by mental humiliation.1 1 Michel Foucault has brilliantly elaborated this phenomenon in his book Discipline, Toezicht en SHAME1 T.I. Oei Article Says Researchers Know Little About How To Treat People Contemplating Suicide. Forbes (10/8/26, Langreth, Ruiz) reported, 'Roughly 35,000 Americans commit suicide each year -- more than die from prostate cancer or Parkinson's disease.' In young people aged 15 to 25, suicide 'is the third leading cause of death. Yet, researchers know astonishingly little about how to treat people who contemplate killing themselves.' According to Forbes, 'fear, logistics, low research funding, and more risk than reward for drug companies all conspire to make suicide the neglected disease,' and points out that 'the National Institutes of Health is spending a paltry $40 million in 2010 studying suicide, versus $3.1 billion for research on aids, which kills half the number of Americans.' Suicide is a great problem, when it takes place unexpectedly (which is mostly the case) and especially when it is motivated by an underlying personal problem. Goethe's 'Die Leiden des jungen Werthers', was not for nothing a clarion call for many adolescents of that time (1774) to end their lives. The pangs of love, which happen to young people, often hit them like a bolt of lightning, and when you are struck by one as a young adolescent, it is difficult to stand up to such a painful experience. In Trauer und Melancholie Sigmund Freud describes the despair (and unconscious anger) mounted within a short space of time to enormous heights which are often at the basis of the fact: a successful, sthenic (deliberate) suicide attempt. As a group, psychiatrists run the greatest risk of suicide, but also other professionals in mental health care are subject to augmented risk. If you play with fire... But also: depression and feelings of meaninglessness increase the risk of suicide. The despot and the thinker is the interesting study by Anton van Hooff of the relationship between the Roman emperor Nero, who elevated cruelty to art, and his philosophical master Seneca. Their deaths as beginnings: both men died as they had lived. The ultimate hours of Seneca's 'voluntaria mors' (voluntary death) (on the command of Emperor Nero) were hours of stoic dignity and he was surrounded by faithful people that he loved. Nero on the 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society, 2011, 26, 1, pp. 36-37.PERSONAL SNIPPETS160other hand died abandoned by all people, hated, on the run, cowardly looking for postponement: the greatest humiliation a Roman could inflict upon himself. It was not until he had manoeuvred himself in the most miserable corner, that he ferried into Hades, and even then with the assistance of another person. In Japan seppuku (hara kiri) is a cultural phenomenon of suicide, in which traditionally death is found by thrusting the sword through the belly (cf for instance the opera Madame Butterfly ), because dishonour is deemed insufferable by the person himself and also by society. When the honour of the country or of the people is at stake, one is as it were forced to commit suicide, but also when one's own inadequacies and the honour of the family demand this. The thousands of kamikaze pilots in WW II found it a great honour to be able to sacrifice their lives for their nation. Although the chosen death in other cultures, especially with the Eskimos, frequently occurs (they want to end a life that -through illness or handicap is virtually useless to society or the extended family and they acknowledge that they have to make room for the younger people), the trend in Western society is quite different. In an emergency such a solution may be sought, but only through a euthanasia procedure. One assumes (at any rate in the Netherlands) that there is a hopeless situation on account of disease or infirmity in the final stage of an illness. At the moment that all hope of improvement or essential change seems impossible there is still the need for advice by an independent psychiatrist/expert. Yet we have to ponder the fact that entitlement to2 persons is generally founded on reciprocity of satisfaction. This goes together with the inner need, which may or may not be emphasized by the culture, for balancing feelings of gratitude, indebtedness, shame. Such feelings always emerge when the help of others is involved in the acquisition of positions, or rights, or opportunities in society. After all feelings of gratitude, indebtedness and shame continue to exist consciously or unconsciously, when no balancing takes place. Being nice to one another is usually based on a form of balancing.3 In western societies children should as long as possible respect and support their parents, but they are not under any legal obligation (except in France, where the financial support of parents is regulated by law) and they can dodge 2 'To be entitled to,' term of Iv\u00e1n B\u00f6sz\u00f6rmenyi-Nagy (1920-2007), Hungarian- American family therapist, with his contextual therapy. 3 Care, assistance, support, gifts and presents keep relationships alive. Dorien Pessers researched the concept of reciprocity: 'When we are willing to give generously to foreign people and the weak, we will get good citizens who will work hard for society.'Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell161the moral obligation. In eastern cultures the principle is that the child will till death support their parents both in a material and an immaterial sense, regardless their motivation or their own opinion of the matter. The feeling that one owes others something -on pain or fear of unbearable shame and remorse- does not lapse or is not neutralized because of their own evaluation or argumentation.4 It is true from a cerebral point of view that there are limits to the obligation to do something for others in return for what they have acquired in their lives thanks to those others. Yet properly speaking the benefactor (parent as the case may be) must be expected to indicate how far and to what extent such a return goes or should go as an expression of gratitude. That seems to be self- evident, but in practice it is not. For a measure of courage and independence, plus a disengaged attitude to life, seems required to be able to indicate the limits for the feeling of gratitude. Also in the West such an independent attitude seems to be the decisive factor for determining in how far parents or people in general can and sometimes must impose limits on their children or each other concerning feelings of support and gratitude. How difficult it is to impose limits to feelings of gratitude/loyalty becomes evident when loved ones are separated or at the loss through death of parents, such as for instance in the story of one patient (from Wikipedia): 'As an expert by experience, when years ago my parents passed away within a short time of each other, I experienced the problem myself, I immediately relaxed my hands on the handlebar. Let's see what Else-Marie (the family therapist, to) had to say about that. My cycling trip promptly became a side issue, for there seemed to be hardly an end to the series of harrowing anecdotes. Such a family therapist gets a tough ride, that was clear. I myself was also quite recognizably in the picture. For had I not stated, in a generous mood, when the inheritance was to be divided, that apart from \"that one little book\" I absolutely wanted nothing at all? A pitfall, according to Else-Marie, for after a couple of years people such as me, bitterly regretting their original choice, then suddenly unexpectedly put in an appearance with some relative to demand something material. No way, as far as I am concerned, but I am quite willing to believe our family therapist with her vast experience.' 4 In a socio-economic sense debt sustains poverty. That immigrants should regard this as a central problem, was argued by Ayaan Hirsi Ali in her book, Nomade , Uitgeverij Augustus, Amsterdam/Antwerpen, 2010, p. 193 ff.163LIMITS TO WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW The need for strong leadership, as a reflection of the need for regulation T.I. Oei 1. In an instructive contribution of H.G. van de Bunt1 the writer informs us that it is an open question whether 'knowing everything about each other' (as in the U.S.) or partial transparency (as in the Netherlands) really has a preventive effect for former sexual offenders. 2. Police or resettlement organizations often meet with problems, when it becomes known that a former sexual offender is no longer in detention, and might want to join a football club for young people, or regularly goes for a swim in a particular swimming pool. What is to be done? Professionals face the identical problem when they come across former patients who are likely to transgress again: for instance paedophiles or exhibitionists who want to work as teachers or as coaches. How about priests who know from the confessional about fellow clergymen who go beyond the pale in sexualibus (paedophile contacts, sado-masochist scenes and so on), who cannot share their knowledge with anyone, only on the altar or in their prayers to their God? 3. Can professional secrecy, or the secret of the confessional, still be sustained to its full extent in this day and age? 2 On the one hand we have 'Big Brother 1 H.G. van de Bunt, Not everything has to be transparent for everyone, DD 2011, 8. 2 That professional secrecy is sometimes a cloak to cover up crime is proved by the following case: Two Turkish psychiatrists from Rotterdam declared many healthy patients to be mentally disturbed, so that they could claim generous benefits. Detection was made difficult because of the medical professional secrecy. The office supplying these social benefits had suspected fraud for some considerable time, but could not produce evidence. This was reported by De Telegraaf , 26-03-2011. Fraud: The Public Prosecutor in Rotterdam and the Criminal Investigation Department investigated the large-scale benefit fraud. Medical examiners of the Social Services had suspected fraud for some considerable time. However, the court forbade re-examination of a patient who was suspected of simulating his disease. The psychiatrist who was treating him said it was superfluous. Also the Social Services were only able to transfer their own medical data to the Public Prosecution Service after a court order, says Social Services spokesman Wessel Agterhof to Elsevier.nl. 'Medical professional secrecy is powerful legislation that cannot easily be turned aside.' Payment in kind: The psychiatrists asked their 'patients', often from the Turkish community, a few thousand euros for a declaration of incapacity for work. Some female patients paid one of the psychiatrists PERSONAL SNIPPETS164is watching you', on the other we find that on Internet sites and with webcams many perverts can find active and passive satisfaction in abundance. In how far is it possible then to stick to rules of common decency and of empathy? There is no denying that many kinds of behaviour, formerly characterized as perverted sexual lechery, nowadays are often found in the guise of daredevil actions (streaking), or trainings (body building) or uncommon professions (doping in sports) and so on. In these ways perverted desires can be satisfied, but damage to others can hardly be prevented. Is it still possible to maintain freedom of religion and of speech when it becomes evident that people can easily call each other the most horrible names and level absurd accusations, without there being much legal redress? 4. It might well be that in the near future we will have to find entirely different ways of dealing with discretion or rules of decency, respect and respectability. When there is cause for giggles in a quiz, because the word cumshot is hardly known to many, but for those in the know a reason for some kind of exhibitionist excitement? It should all be permissible, should it not? Perhaps it would be a good thing to mark time, to provide clarity as to what kind of language and what kind of words we want to use and also that certain limitations should be respected. 5. At the time Freud thought that the censorship function of our conscience not only serves to preserve social taboos, but can also break them apart. For example the taboo on public sexuality and sexual practice in general. According to the properly formed conscience of the time thinking of sex, discussing and practising it could never be allowed to the individual, as it was sinful and reprehensible. Later this taboo was broken apart among other things by the psychoanalytical view of Freud, with excesses into free sexuality (Reich's sexpol). Freud's psychoanalytical view was even blown up to the proportions of a scandal among intellectuals and religious institutions. His findings were tabooed. But as the struggle whether or not such taboos could be permissible in kind. The claimants subsequently received benefits, a personal budget and in some case even a parking place for the disabled. In one family all four members were 'ill'. Possibly the fraud amounts to tens of millions of euros. The psychiatrists and two intermediaries were recently arrested. Two firearms and 100,000 euros in cash were found with the intermediaries. Houses, jewellery and cars were impounded. But the problem does not lie with the medical professional secrecy. There is a malfunction in the system. The Social Services should never accept a diagnosis of a physician who is paid by the person who claims the benefit. After all, your own family doctor cannot declare you incapacitated for work. There are special medical examiners for that. Moreover it is better not to take the opinion of a single psychiatrist. The Social Services should have asked at least one of two other psychiatrists for a second opinion. So the problem in fact is that mental complaints are treated differently from physical ones.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell165progressed, the value of his view that the unconscious by its nature is very difficult to suppress became more and more generally accepted. 6. In how far can we now still maintain the limitations of what is permissible in the case of discretion and privacy? Discretion regarding sensitive, personal viewpoints or attitudes, the secrecy in job interviews and upcoming appointments? Why can Mr Wilders call someone 'an idiot', why can't someone else? This question the Amsterdam lawyer Sander Janssen last Wednesday put to the Public Prosecutor in the capital. Janssen is counsel for a Mr X and on Wednesday morning (16-03-11) he heard Mr Wilders, who is violently opposed to Mr Buruma's upcoming appointment as member of the Supreme Court, say on NOS radio: 'Such an idiot does not belong on the Supreme Court'. As his client is being prosecuted for exclaiming 'you bunch of idiots' Janssen concludes that using the term 'idiot' is slander. Will the public prosecutor proceed against Mr Wilders for qualifying Buruma as 'an idiot'? counsel wrote in his letter to the public prosecutor. 7. Perhaps there is a need for social censorship3 4 5 6 instead of or by the side 3 In this case I use the term censorship instead of prohibition. I am thinking for instance of pro-active procedures such as banning the sale of alcohol to minors, the tit for tat policy in dealing with football hooliganism, actively investigating the possession of child pornography and making the denial of the Holocaust a criminal offence. 4 History shows us that there has always been the need for independent evaluation by someone else, or by society as a whole. In the time when the king was the absolute ruler, a crime constituted not only a breach of the law producing damages, and was satisfaction exacted by society (compensation), but the rights of the sovereign, who had to uphold the law, had also been infringed and therefore part of the punishment had to come directly from the king. Cf Michel Foucault Discipline,Toezicht en Straf [Discipline, Supervision and Punishment] Historische Uitgeverij, Groningen, 2010, sixth impression, p. 71 ff. 5 It is true, as a rule the faults are not in the laws as such, but in incorrect interpretation of abuse. Sometimes the reason that things can go wrong for so long is bureaucratic slowness. I had a colleague who had retired two years before and still received his full salary. Why? Your guess is as good as mine, but it did (does?) happen and perhaps regularly. At the time a colleague who had been sidelined by his superior managed to be declared 'situationally incapacitated for work by the doctors, namely that in his job he experienced all sorts of mental problems: authority conflicts with his boss to put it bluntly. For years this colleague had the nerve to stay at home when he should have been working and he even managed to get his PhD on a subject connected with collaboration in WW II, whereas the superior he so despised was a Jew. Thus he did symbolically indicate the problems he had with his boss. M. Chayes refers to this a 'the splits'. 6 Volendam school can forbid wearing headscarf 4-04-2011(ANP): 'The Don Bosco College in Volendam can stop pupils from wearing headscarves. The court at Haarlem determined this on Monday. 15-year-old Imane Mahssan had summoned the school because she was not allowed to wear a scarf at school. The magistrate will PERSONAL SNIPPETS166of a personal censorship of what the conscience can find. Most certainly now the commandments and bans of religion and their ecclesiastical expression are constantly weakening. Mark Bovens in his lecture to the or threatening democracy?] 14-03-11, made clear that among people with little education the feelings of insecurity and uncertainty (for instance the disappearance of faith in a church) may have furthered the vote for right-wing parties such as the PVV (with a strong and clear profile). Who knows if that is why the strong hand (for he makes unprecedented use of his freedom of speech) 7 of the PVV foreman makes such a strong ponder the question whether the school can legally impose this ban. The magistrate determined that the ban is in keeping with the catholic foundation of the school which forbids other religious expressions. The magistrate finds that the ban does not limit the freedom of expression and that the school does not discriminate on the basis of religion. The school imposed the ban in September of last year, a couple of months after Imane had asked to be allowed to wear her scarf. Since for months the girl had not had a reaction to her request she had started to wear one. At the end of March her lawyer Jelle Klaas said it was a disgrace that the school subsequently suspended her. \"The school has amended the school rules especially for Imane, whereas it should provide protection to its pupils.\" The school told the magistrate that it is true that there was no special policy regarding scarves until Imane's request, but that it was laid down in the school rules that pupils had to respect the Roman Catholic nature of the school. Imane could have known that wearing a scarf could be interpreted as distancing herself from the school's catholic foundation. The CGB (Commission for Equal Treatment) had earlier decided in Imane's favour. It was, however, not a binding opinion, which the school decided not to follow. PVV foreman Wilders enthusiastically welcomes the magistrate's decision. \"Congratulations to Don Bosco in Volendam\" he writes, \"Fully justified result! I hope many Christian schools will follow the example.\"' 7 Out of order, Jaap Bakker; Sommige dingen doe je niet [Certain things are just not done]. 'My mother, a Rotterdam sailor's daughter of high intelligence but who hated delicate distinctions, had to raise her only child on her own. My father had already been arrested before I was born. He died three years later in a Jap POW camp. My mother never remarried. A good friend told me that she had been raised with proverbs. My mother had a fair share of them, as well as all sorts of useful sayings. One of those sayings was \"Certain things are just not done, full stop!\" It was one aspect of a much wider idea regularly used by her. When as a child I asked why she was angry about this or that, this wider idea was immediately brought to bear: \"It is a matter of inner civilization\". What my mother meant with that I have always, I think, instinctively felt. But I have had problems with analysing the idea for a long time. For what is at the heart of \"inner civilization\"? Doubless it is something to do with the genes. How else to explain the pleasant, pleasing and extremely correct behaviour of people of whom you know they have had a terrible youth full of neglect and violence? But a genetic disposition is not the main thing. It is much more an acquired mentality, a self assured awareness of how you want to be, in you association with others, in your decisions, your choices. That Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell167impression, now the censorship function of conscience, as the expression of what our norms and values ought to be, seems to be over. comes from the heart. It is not inspired by obedience to laws, rules and codes or the fear of sanctions if you were to break them. Nor is it the result of current circumstances, as in the example of a man who allowed a lady to go first. \"You do this because I am a woman?\" she asked. \"No\", he said, \"I do this because I am a gentleman.\" The present Cabinet started regularly using the slogan \"norms and values\". Of late it has become slightly less, or perhaps I have grown accustomed that it no longer draws my attention. And, you know it too, when a word is used over and over again, it loses its soul. It becomes a stopgap. Whereas \"norms\" and \"values\" refer to inner civilization, laws, rules and codes refer to outer civilization. Apparent civilization to be precise. At the moment the level of civilization of our society seems to be in a lot of trouble. Almost daily there are reports of money-grubbing managers, cowardly tax officials and overpowering superiors. All quite identifiable as symptoms of corruption. A decay that was already begun many years ago. Much less identifiable as such is the shift, apparently honourable, from inner to outer civilization. An increasing number of matters that should be subject to the individual level of civilization are subjected to rules and regulations. Insulting the monarchy by comedians? Minister Donner's reaction on TV is that he may bring legislation against it. Abominable behaviour of top businessmen? The Tabaksblatt Code offers the solution. In this way we are all trying to rid us all of every personal responsibility. \"I will do anything not prohibited by law\", an ABP manager stated a few years ago. Laws, rules and codes give the bad guys a bit of a hard time, but it does not make them civilized. As a matter of fact, this expanding regulation puts inner civilization under threat. Am I a cultural pessimist? Not at all. The world, including our tiny country, is improving all the time. Intensive communication and millions of flying miles each day make \"Unknown, Unloved\" lose its meaning and people start feeling the meaning of the word Peace. Will I ever refer to \"the good old days\"? I don't think so. The rigid self-evidences of yore have given way to the colourful mobility of progress. But it is precisely in this mobility that you have to be more alert than you used to, that you have to speak up sooner, more clearly. In the grey inertia before Rock 'n Roll you could scrutinize social events and there was no need for immediate reactions. Bishops forbade their parishioners membership of socialist unions. An unconcealed matter of course that you could be for or against. Also after some time had elapsed. At the moment there is a proliferation of rules for outer civilization which we seem hardly to notice. Rules that make the impression that the level of our civilization will be alright again. I have quickly raised my voice against this risky illusion. We are dealing with inner civilization. My mother will not be bothered by it any more. She is still alive, but after ten years of Alzheimer's she does not exist any more. In her nursing home, with its Surinam and Moroccan staff, she is approaching the end of her life, surrounded by warmth, respect and genuine involvement. Inner civilization has many faces.' 169DEFINING A PROBLEM IS ONE THING, PROVIDING A SATISFACTORY SOLUTION IS ANOTHER Mental susceptibility for transference in a case T.I. Oei Hans Visser, emeritus PKN (Protestant Churches Holland) pastor in Rotterdam, associated with the Stichting Ondersteuning Stemlozen [Foundation for the Support of the Voiceless], who supports the visiting by volunteers of paedophiles says in the daily Trouw, 19-02-2011: 'Paedophiles must start to understand sexual limitations, in view of the vulnerability of children. Paedophiles must be helped. Who will teach them to associate with children respectfully. Now they have nowhere to go. In his study \"We are our brain\" neuro-biologist Dick Swaab explains that the cause of the fascination with children in paedophiles is to be found in the development of the brain in the womb and the early development after birth. The sexual orientation is determined by our genetic background and the developing brain pre-birth. I would like to put this genetic explanation of paedophilia in perspective. Psychiatrist Frank van Ree wrote that there are certainly genetic factors, but one thing is clear: according to Van Ree genes are nothing more than the text of a play. How the play is performed, is different each time. The paedophile taboo has led to its absolute rejection. The result is that people with a paedophile nature are left to their own devices. The authorities look upon paedophilia as a disorder. Paedophiles have nowhere to go and they are supposed to solve their own problems. What the people want has become the decisive factor. Occasionally there are demands for the chemical castration of paedophiles. It is too easy to dismiss paedophilia as a disorder. I would advocate looking for the narrow path between two undesirable situations. There must be a middle course between on the one hand the free autonomy of people who reserve the freedom to do with children what they find pleasurable, and on the other society's complete rejection of the paedophile.' 'We have to be honest,' Visser continues, 'For everyone sexuality is a drive that is not simply manageable by means of moralistic regulation. People will always look for possibilities to give this drive form and substance. Even children have erotic feelings. They look for warmth and affection. However, a paedophile must not respond to these feelings with adult sex, and he must carefully listen to children. In this paedophiles need support and advice. Society must not leave them to their fate. Society must learn to deal as wisely as possible with people of a different sexual inclination. It is possible that emotionally we live at a great distance from these people. But they are fellow human beings, who frequently act responsibly. It goes without saying that paedosexuality in which the child is treated as an object PERSONAL SNIPPETS170within the framework of adult sexuality may be harmful. But this harm is now sometimes exaggerated and dramatized. A child is automatically considered and treated as a victim, which leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy. The child will become the victim it is supposed to be. Recently in the Amsterdam sex case we were told about the accused Robert M. It is clear that this man has transgressed. Painstaking investigation is called for. But the reactions of the authorities are sometimes out of proportion. The word \"monster\" is used. But then what about the man who almost beats his wife top death in front of his children? What about the homosexual who uses a relationship and then dumps this partner? Frequently the factor power is introduced. In all sexual relationship power plays a role. Terrible manipulations go on in the world of sex. What is especially essential: paedophiles must be able to appeal to their family doctors and mental health care institutions for sound advice. Formerly the NVSH, the Dutch Association for Sexual Reforms, had paedo groups where people could meet and support each other. Such groups are once more needed. The genetic factors that play a part in the lives of paedophiles must not prove fatal for them. Like Van Ree rightly said: these genes are the text of a play. Society must give the paedophile the opportunity to learn to deal respectfully with children. The media must not stoop to moralistic dogmatism. Paedophilia is not a disease, but an inclination that cannot be eradicated by means of laws and rules. Paedophiles are not automatically delinquents. In all sexual relationships people must get to know the limitations. The paedophile has to learn to understand these limitations as well -in view of the children's vulnerability. Treatment of paedophiles is necessary. Many now end up in psychiatric hospitals or spend their lives in longstay institutions, a measure that is often not in proportion to the offences they have committed. Justice and politics should not be guided by public opinion, which only rejects. When paedophiles have learnt what is and what is not permissible with children, they must be given a second chance in society and they must be coached by experts and volunteers', Pastor Visser says. As a psychoanalyst/psychotherapist I can well understand this plea. That Visser advocates treatment is in my opinion correct. And also that convicted paedophiles, like all justiciables, ought to be given a second chance and are entitled to re-socialization. Paedophilia is a genetic vulnerability, which, I fear, cannot be resolved with the good will and discipline of the paedophile in question alone. Take for instance the impression the writer gives that a paedophile should be able to listen closely to a child. I think that friendship between paedophiles and children should not be promoted, nor tolerated. That they can have occasional dealings with children is another matter, but it must be clear to society that a friendship between two completely different subjects (inequality of age -child/adult-, mental maturation, and position of power) is out of the question. I do agree with him that paedophiles are not by definition and purely on the basis of their inclination delinquents, just as this holds good for people with other sexual preoccupations (exhibitionists, sado-masochists, gerontophiles, and so on). I disagree with him (as a Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell171psychotherapist) when he lumps paedophiles together with paedosexuals. Generally a paedophile is an adult who can have emotional/sexual fantasies and actions with children and youngsters. Paedophilia is to be divided into general and core paedophilia. The general form is to be subdivided into latent and manifest paedophilia. In latent paedophilia there are no factual emotionally sexual contacts, but erotic feelings (intimacy, security, safety) do play a certain part in the contacts with children and minors. We refer to this as latent paedophilia, as opposed to manifest paedophilia in which apart from eroticism also sexuality plays a role (collecting photos and such like of children, producing erections and sexual excitement in the paedophile), without there being factual contacts with children. Possessing or collecting child pornography (pictorial representations) is punishable by law. There must be a differentiation from the paedosexual, who compulsively expresses his needs (in fantasies and factual sexual actions), without the need for the person of the child. The child has been reduced to a mere object, who can have a function for the paedosexual as it were even blindfolded. A core paedophile or paedosexual can only share his own erotic and/or sexual desires with children and minors, or he can only be stimulated erotically/sexually by children and minors. There is the precarious fact in both paedosexuality and core paedophilia that there seems to be no cure. Persons with this disorder (not just an inclination) may have to be permanently monitored by professionals and social workers. This constitutes an additional claim on the public spirit and tolerance of society. For years I had a manifest paedophile (but not a paedosexual) in psychoanalytical treatment. After a number of years the temptation to consort with young girls (his vulnerability) had been sublimated in his work as an art teacher (from a manifest paedophile he had become a latent one). Together they would do nice things in drawing; there was nothing more to it. It had become possible to channel his inclination (to manifest paedophile actions, such as starting emotional friendships with children) and to be abstemious (regarding his paedophile tendencies) in his dealings with children and others. An example from the life of journalist and writer/poet Boudewijn B\u00fcch: He once let slip that he had renounced his paedophile tendencies, when he found he was called to the police station too often. His interest in visiting far-flung destinations, such as unknown little islands and his fascination with the book for children, seemed a sublimation of this. 1 1 Personal information Leiden, 1976. Later, especially after his early death, it became apparent that he had 'a lively imagination'. He could create stories and events out of thin air. PERSONAL SNIPPETS172Going back to my patient. He met the love from his youth again and the relationship that blossomed after many years of no contact was a stable one. He realized that he still had a soft spot for young people, especially for those of the opposite sex, but he always managed to find a way that did not cause any problems. He rejected new potential contacts in anticipation, or he managed a professional approach to new contacts. Continuing coaching by a mediator2 after the conclusion of treatment was apparently beneficial. As with all professionals: Look before you leap! As a member of the board or as consultant of associations in the field of psychotherapy I have come across professionals who had problems dealing with eroticism and sexuality with youngsters but also with adults. When, as a colleague, you suspect that problems might be the result of a relationship in the sense of a (close) friendship with a (young) patient evaluation and focusing on your targets are urgently required. For the limit of what is tolerable has been approached or has already been exceeded. This evaluation and orientation should also recur regularly, as tools to determine what you are doing and what you have started. Sooner or later the question crops up whether the current contacts (such as actually having a feeling of infatuation with your patients, with strong transference) are still useful, whether they are sufficiently satisfactory considering the nature and the targets of the original situation. This situation occurs for instance when as a professional you are matched to a patient who is (too) attractive, (too) na\u00efve/youthful or has other characteristics that you find it difficult to deal with, considering you own vulnerability in the matter. This concerns not only colleagues who have paedophile tendencies/ weaknesses, but also colleagues that are in a different way vulnerable (who have quick erotic-sexual transference). For instance those who are having relationship problems themselves, and are yet supposed to treat patients with relationship issues. Saying farewell is always difficult, certainly when 2 J.A. van Vliet (20-02-11) is to be thanked for this information: It must be possible to place TBS-convicted persons who were previously convicted for a sex crime under supervision for the rest of their life. State Secretary for Security and Justice Teeven (14-02-11) will prepare a legislative amendment for this purpose. Currently, supervision is limited to a period of at most nine years. Serious sex crimes are very dramatic for victims and their immediate surroundings. The suffering sustained - both physically and mentally - is often great. Moreover, this sort of offence shocks society's trust in the rule of law. By introducing a measure that enables sex offenders to be supervised for a longer period of time, it becomes possible to more effectively monitor the compliance with conditions that should prevent recidivism. The legislative amendment is an elaboration of the investigation into permanent supervision of sex offenders that was already announced in the coalition agreement. The investigation will also focus on the manner in which supervision should be implemented, and the specification of the categories of sex offenders to which the measure should apply. This investigation will commence later this month. Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell173matters are concerned in which you are completely involved as a person, like in a treatment or in a profound friendship. Hence the necessity, when as a professional your vision becomes blurred, both in and outside treatment3, to wonder whether not every adult-minor relationship should be queried. Such a situation is always ripe for marking time by means of supervision and intervision4. The help of colleagues can make all the difference and prevent fresh problems. For that matter when such strong transference or too amicable a relationship between professional and patient is brought to the attention of the IGZ [the Inspectorate of Health Care and Disabled Care], the IGZ generally demands that a colleague with such problems (be they problems of his own, or problems with the patient5) that he be treated himself and also given supervision, taken for granted that all contact with the patient/client involved is to be terminated. Not dealing with problems, in the sense of evading them, is one thing, providing a satisfactory solution is another. 3 Also at secondary schools it is a relatively frequent problem between teachers and pupils. At many schools of secondary education in the past decade there was sex of a teacher and a pupil once or several times. (11-03-11). This was shown in an investigation by KRO Brandpunt done in cooperation with EDG media conducted with 700 teachers in secondary education. The official data of the education inspectorate indicate only sporadic instances. The KRO Brandpunt investigation shows it is much more frequent. Sunday 13 March KRO Brandpunt broadcast a report about rules that are not observed and schools that prefer cover-ups rather than face damage to their image. The school management is legally obligated to report relationships to the inspectorate and the police. For the nuances of the matter, cf J.C.W. Gooren, jongeren', [Unequal sex. Some reflections on the criminal proceedings against child abuse] DD 2011, 10. 4 How sensitive such matters are and how heavy they can oppress the soul is illustrated by the following tragedy (08-03-11): A suspect in the Amsterdam vice case who was recently released from custody committed suicide. His counsel Heleen Bos stated this in Nieuwsuur on Monday night. The accused, according to Nieuwsuur a fifty-year- old man without a previous record, denied all involvement. He had been in custody for two weeks when the court ruled there was no reason to prolong his detention. A week after his release the man committed suicide. 'I cannot imagine that there is no relation between the charges and my client's death. The charges had enormous impact on him', the lawyer said in Nieuwsuur. 5 These problems may be the result of an infatuation that got out of hand, even considering starting a relationship with this patient, or an erotic relation that went out of control and/or that the problems of the patient became too much for the professional. Out of reasons of security the Inspectorate is to be informed by the professional when the limits of what is proper have been broken both materially and formally. The patient can file a complaint at all times.PERSONAL SNIPPETS174Conclusion6: The concept 'paedophilia' is still too closely linked to punishment and exclusion, and also with inadequate definition, so that it will be some time before anything sensible can be said about it. Much ground must still be covered, both in a treatment specific and in a diagnostic sense. The paedophile cannot help being the way he is, says for instance neurobiologist Dick Swaab, who recently found indications of congenital brain anomalies in some paedophiles. In such cases there is no real cure. That is why research must be done in this unexplored territory, so that we can develop the best methods for teaching paedophiles to control their impulses. Professor of forensic psychiatry Hjalmar van Marle is strongly in favour of confronting the problem and he thinks that crimes may be prevented by tackling the problem early. Group therapy in which paedophiles feel secure to talk about their feelings turns out actually to produce insight and control. Unfortunately that is by no means an end to the matter, for also when more research is done an unambiguous answer to the problem remains impossible. Paedophiles come in all sorts and sizes and causes of their affliction, for that is how most experts look upon it. Paedophilia is highly complex. Lumping all paedophiles together, as often happens in the social debate, is therefore not only counterproductive, but also wrong. 6 The source of this text is inconclusive.175COURAGE AND A PIONEERING SPIRIT MAY CHANGE CULTURE T.I. Oei 1. On Sunday (August 2010) at a wedding in the south-eastern Turkish village Akcagoze the groom accidentally shot his father and two aunts. As an expression of his joy the man fired his Kalashnikov into the air, but lost control of his weapon. His father and aunts died in hospital of their wounds. Apart from the three fatalities eight people were wounded. The bridegroom was arrested, the press agency Anatolia reports. Turks regularly fire in the air at weddings and sports events that have been won. It is a habit that has cost already many lives. The government has not had any success in trying to eradicate this custom. 2. While everyone was busy celebrating the Gay Pride this weekend (8-08- 10) there was one man in the Netherlands who was not so glad with gay people. On Friday rapper Kempi said on Twitter that schools ought to teach children that homosexuality is unnatural! After a storm of criticism this Dutch artist rapidly distanced himself from his statements. His first message ( mistakes in spelling have been approximated to give a clearer impression) was as follows: \u00cd think that you must teach children that gay is unnatural and forbidden of God... (It is not that you steal something because you are hungry)'. This was Kempi's reaction to the news that gay education should be compulsory at Dutch elementary schools. Get lost When one of his 'followers' commented on this Kempi reacted with agitation: 'Get lost with all your homo education EVERY religion forbid Gays this country praises them gives them parties. And now homo lessons!' God is coming The rapper, who is of a Christian persuasion and believes in the second coming continued his story, by calling out to anyone who would listen that 'there is only one God and that he \"is coming\".' At any rate he enjoyed the discussion: 'I find it nice to have this discussion with all those mens that freak out for a discussion eat a dick since you are gay anyway.' Regret A short while later, probably after a call from his manager, the rapper decides to take everything back and to ask his Twitter friends to forgive him. He offered his apologies and said that he does regard gay people as human PERSONAL SNIPPETS176beings, but that he does not condone their actions. He also informed his listeners that god loves everyone. Kempi is a rapper, whose real name is Jerrely Slijger. He is of Antillean descent and grew up in Eindhoven. His 'Du Gangsta Tape' was released in 2010. Whether or not a tradition is cemented in a culture, it is the interpretation of what is happening. Is it God's will that such a thing (1) takes place, however bad and dramatic it is? As an outsider or atheist you might argue that a religion (archaic or not) may definitely be in the way of progress in the sense of an adequate test of reality. (1 and 2). It should be possible for people to critically ask themselves: what is reasonable, yes or no. Thinking should not come to a standstill when articles of faith are involved. When it becomes impossible to distinguish things, we must fear the worst. Outside interference can hardly make things better. After all, saying Yes and acting No (for a believer, as well as an unbeliever) is not the same as saying No and acting Yes (in the case of a believer, or an unbeliever) certainly when essential issues are at stake. But to continue to explain patiently that assuming your own responsibility may mean progress in the life of/for everyone, however difficult.1 The person who is the first to do something like that, -assuming the responsibility for one's own actions (a-typical or unusual or not),- may fear criticism from all quarters. But what is more important than the search for a piece of truth? Courage and a pioneering spirit have always in history functioned as the driving force in progress and prosperity. Reaction of a colleague Interesting theme that a specific custom or article of faith puts a stop to thinking. Professor Kuitert, emeritus VU professor, Calvinist through and through, kept thinking about the existence of God and proof of His existence. Eventually he comes to the conclusion that God does not exist but is used to answer questions to which there is no answer. The Austrian bishop who declares that the casualties at the love parade in Duisburg were a punishment of God because the partygoers were all sinful. 1 A colleague did a therapy with a family, the parents were very religious and unable to solve their problems, as long as they put all responsibility on their therapist. He was regarded as the authority, on a level with God. The therapy went well after the parents could assume the responsibility for their own behaviour. Our task when treating people who hide behind religious motives, which -they say- determine their actions, is to approach their own responsibilities, in spite of the presence of religious motives.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell177Reply (as a behavioural expert) As for the bishop: I think, in all modesty, that he has applied a so-called attribution mechanism. It is an interpretation regarding a feeling of disbelief or discomfort and at the same time a feeling of shame and guilt. It might be that he wanted to express these feelings in the punished-with-Hell statement. Saints, for instance St Theresa of Avila or St John of the Cross, and also teachers from a Protestant persuasion, such as Zwingli and others who deserve our respect, such as Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela from our times, would be more inclined to apply the cloak of love, I should think. The example of South Africa with its Truth commission to find reconciliation is a historic and historical fact of generosity and human greatness. And when those I mentioned were to feel shame or guilt because of the actions of others, they would be/have been inclined, I suspect, first to envisage their own failings or attempting to intervene constructively. After all, no one is in direct contact with the Supreme Being, unless from pathological convictions. And even if on the basis of ecstatic experiences someone arrives at a profound religious awareness, the role of judge would not be given to him. Also Freud, although not religious, or even unbelieving, agnostic or atheist (I do not know which, I cannot look into his soul) showed no rancour in his actions, but tried to channel his emotions and passions (which could be fierce) in psychoanalytical language, - a form of rationalization rather than judging or condemning. I must say that every pronouncement towards chastising others is reason for me to try and see such pronouncement in perspective. After all nothing human is foreign to the human being. And if judges can err, who are we?179SHOULD YOU ALW AYS FOLLOW YOUR CONSCIENCE?1 T.I. Oei The world wants to be deceived, The sentence from: Hendrik Jan Korterink, crime reporter, Trouw , July 2010. 'Life with a motto is not for me. There are so many things that you find out in the course of your life and that make you change your conviction. In my work as a journalist I have seen that people are easy to dupe. That they believe stories without really thinking about them. I am a reporter. I go to people and make my observations. At a given moment you think you know how things hang together, but you can always be wrong. So I am open to improvement. Frequently people have difficulty with such an attitude. I noticed that in the reactions to my book \"Real men do eat cheese\" in which I expose the story of Maria Mosterd and her lover boy. Some colleagues found it extremely difficult to admit that they had been wrong. They allowed themselves to be taken in by Maria Mosterd. You can only prevent this by investigating, by digging up facts. If I had to choose a motto, it would be: Mundus vult decipi, ergo decipiatur. Petronius, means in translation: \"The world want to be deceived, so it will be deceived.\" Some people translate \"it allows itself to be deceived\". I heard this slogan for the first time when I was in the first form of my secondary school. I was very curious for awkward slogans or difficult words. The slightly cynicism of this motto suits me. If people persist in being stupid, then cheat them. Something I do not want to do myself. To put it even more strongly, I hate lies and deception. It must have been imprinted in me during my Calvinist upbringing. Why do people behave like they do? Where did things go wrong? Those are the questions that make my job interesting. In Germany there is a serial killer of young girls, who is half of an identical twin. But his brother is an ordinary office clerk. Genetically they are identical. Why is the one twin wrong, and not the other? There are so many factors, you cannot make any prediction. I am getting more and more convinced that it is practically impossible to structurally change human behaviour. Between the end of the nineteenth century and now forensic psychiatry went through quite a development. There was a time when they thought that they could see by a person's appearance whether he was a criminal. At the moment lots of attention goes to genetic and biological research. Scientists like Dick 1 Published in: Newsletter Dutch Psychoanalytic Society , 2011, 26, 3, p. 81.PERSONAL SNIPPETS180Swaab look upon the human being as the plaything of his own genes. And that would imply that no one can do anything about their actions. I look upon my work as a hobby. I find it interesting to investigate things and to be able to write. I grew up on a farm. Every morning up the meadow to collect the cows and milk them. That is no life for me, I find it too primitive. Colleagues are sometimes surprised that I maintain my website on a daily basis. I regard that as a matter of discipline, like the farmer who has to milk his cows every day. Only this work I find more fun. Like builders and surgeons do useful things, that is not how I look upon my work. My work serves to entertain people. It is not a primary condition of life. As a reporter you can aspire to the noble goal of finding out facts that are useful to people. As in the Maria Mosterd case. It inflicted enormous damage to Thorbecke Comprehensive School and made \"lover boy\" Manou into a rapist and a murderer, which he was not. I find it important to bring out the truth, but that is about it. I do not have to be a starry-eyed idealist.' I had a patient A, who had suffered pains in his limbs and joints for years. On top of that he had to close his firm and he was saddled with heavy debts. A certain Body sanitized things. This Body demanded that A kept writing applications. He had been doing that for the past eighteen months and was turned down each and every time. The Body saw his applications and urgently advised him by no means to mention his condition, fibromyalgy. The Body was fearful that he might otherwise find it hard to find employment. A's conscience began troubling him: I can't go around telling lies, he said. Sooner or later they will find out and then they will fire me after a few weeks. I could understand his reasoning and told him that assuming your own responsibility also meant something like: upholding your principles, but also taking the needs of your family into account. I can only hope that the Body will also tell him this: how to deal with your conscience, when your conscience is bothered by the advice given by official bodies to muck about with things ethically. At least that was how A understood the advice. 181WHERE THERE'S A WILL, THERE'S A W AY1 T.I. Oei Eveline de Ruiter BAARN - 'Motivation and intelligence are of equal importance when doing an IQ test. American research shows that a good score means that high intelligence goes hand in hand with the motivation to achieve a high score. Scientists of the University of Pennsylvania come to the conclusion that cleverness does not always lead to a good score. When the will to do the test is missing, the result may be lower than was initially expected. And likewise a high score may be the result of a good motivation, even if the person doing the test is not overly intelligent. Motivation In the study 250 boys are followed in their years from adolescent to young adult. Among other things the researchers compared the results of various IQ tests and came to the conclusion that some people basically try harder than others when there is nothing at stake. They also researched how testing material stimulates and how this influences the results. What did they find? Stimulating material is important for everyone, but especially for people with scores below average. Overrated This is why researchers say that IQ scores are sometimes 'overrated' as a tool to measure intelligence. A high IQ score requires both high intelligence and competitive impulses which motivate the testee to use his abilities better. Personality Professor of psychology, James Thompson, of University College London compares life to an IQ test and a personality test. \"When an IQ test does not motivate the testee, this means something for his personality.\"' Sources: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences - 26-04-2011 The will is a trait that every man can use to his advantage. The will determines both the person's conscious and unconscious effort to achieve a good end to an activity. But it also depends on the will, if something happens between 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society, 2012, 27, 3, pp. 26-27.PERSONAL SNIPPETS182people. Cooperation, or tearing each other's throat out, on the basis of personal, often unconscious, motives. Often to the extent that people (have to) make their success dependent on the extent of their willpower2. The will is a formidable partner or opponent in the daily struggle for life. To want means to be able to. In everyday psychology3 this is referred to as the temperament (genetic drive) that the will also determines. Philosopher Harry Frankfurt mentions wanting to want: Being free means wanting what you want. Wanting to impress, wanting to achieve, wanting to make nice music, wanting to learn and know. Doing IQ tests is therefore a thing. Girls generally do better than boys, whereas the boys are more competitively inclined. To want to do too good, to try too hard, has a negative effect on the results, because fear of failure may then increase. 'Wanting too much' is not good. 4 The will is not only a condition of human action but also decides whether something is actually achieved. Wanting is a condition of something, to be or to become an animal or a person. This in the sense of existence and being. Wanting is to do with motivation, but also with drive, enthusiasm, passion and a preparedness to act selflessly. If man wants to achieve something then this will usually be brought about, unless forces of nature (disasters), unexpected occurrences and/or life events render this impossible. Philosophers like Nietzsche (Der Wille zur Macht) and Schopenhauer (will to live) have taken the Will as the starting point of their philosophy. And psychotherapists like Alfred Adler (individual psychology, will to power), Viktor Frankl (logo therapy, will to meaning) and Sigmund Freud (psychoanalysis, will to pleasure) found the Will as a principle of great importance in their psychological opinions. Wanting does not only mean capacity, but also being, bringing to completion. Will power makes an average, even a handicapped, person a success story in sport (Lance Armstrong), as is demonstrated time and again in the Olympiad for the Physically Disabled. Let us not forget literature, science and art. Think of Helen Keller, the deaf and dumb linguist who later even achieved 2 Cf the notion legal capacity from medical ethics . Legal capacity, in contrast to what is sometimes thought, is not a legal term; Legal competence is. Legal capacity is a practical term that is especially used in reference to medical decisions. A doctor must ascertain the legal capacity of a patient before he can ask him to decide concerning a treatment. 3 Thanks to Anne van den Berg. 4 Cf: Marc Chavannes, NRC.nl, Saturday 30 April 2011, 'Andr\u00e9 Rouvoet (former Minister of Dutch Government's Cabinet, to), the handicap of being too willing to do good: (...) it is an awkward paradox: who wants too much to do the right thing, runs the risk of broken strings.'Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell183a PhD. Or Stephen Hawking: despite a progressive neurological condition -amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , which confines him to his wheelchair and allows him only to communicate by means of a speech computer, he has proved himself to be a prominent theoretical physicist. But also blind Ray Charles (according to Frank Sinatra: 'the only true genius in show business') who developed into an icon of modern pop music. And blind, later multiple- handicapped (no sense of smell) singer-songwriter , multi-instrumentalist , record producer and activist, Stevie Wonder. These examples may show that the more self-realization is impeded by handicaps, the will plays an increasingly deciding role. Wanting is simply indispensable for people who wish to be in their lives and to shape their existence. 185MONISM IS A FINE IDEAL, BUT SOMETIMES THERE ARE ONLY LOSERS T.I. Oei Justice Tom Schalken (67) of the Amsterdam Court of Justice has resigned. He thinks that the Amsterdam Court has treated him 'scandalously' during the proceedings against PVV foreman Geert Wilders. He states this on Saturday (2 July 2011) in NRC Handelsblad Schalken was one of the Justices who ordered on behalf of the court the prosecution of the PVV foreman, among other reasons for hate mongering. According to Wilders, Schalken attempted to influence expert witness Hans Jansen, expert of Islam, at a dinner party. Schalken was then for hours subjected to an interrogation by the court, although the CID had already come to the conclusion that there had been no attempt of influencing. This offends him. 'I have been sacrificed to the hunger of public opinion. I was the sacrificial lamb for Wilders and his lawyer. The dinner party was made into the main course of the proceedings', Schalken says in the newspaper. The court 'bowed to the image created by the media' he explains. (ANP) This story confirms once again that the unconscious is always part of our acting, feeling and thinking, in short in our behaviour. Isaiah Berlin suggested1 that roughly two kinds of human behaviour can be distinguished. A. Monism is the behaviour -in simple terms- that decides that as far as possible a person acts, feels and thinks according to a certain system, a certain ideal, a certain view of life. The ideal is realized as far as possible, sometimes even slightly beyond the limitations of what is feasible or possible. B. Pluralism is taking into account as much as possible what is in practice feasible or possible. C. A mix of both types of behaviour is always possible 1 Justice Schalken2 it is easily visible that he acted from a specific ideal of justice. He stated that there must be room for as explicit an explanation of what the law says about it. The laws in the Statute Book discuss admissible human behaviour in articles and other texts. The correct interpretation of the law rests with the judge and the court. These verdicts are collected in the living jurisprudence. It constitutes an important element of the philosophy and the development of law. This, Schalken stated, was the only thing he envisaged when as a member of the court he ruled that Wilders should be prosecuted. But the media, politics and his jurist colleagues, like Theo de Roos and other prominent scientists, judges and lawyers were of the contrary opinion. They thought it unnecessary and even counter-productive. As a layman you might be inclined to say that so far there is nothing the matter. But, as usual, conscience or the unconscious turned out to play a role in human behaviour. The stress and frustration which -understandably- every new flash (of indignation, tumult, opposition, criticism, depreciation and the like) in public opinion may bring about had to find some kind of release. One possible outlet is the show of emotion, the alleviation of - figurative but also material - hunger (for attention) and the yearning for satisfaction as a compensation for the lack of requisite social and fraternal support. A combination of social attention, intellectual togetherness and material pleasure is for instance a dinner club of intellectuals. And that's when it happened, when Schalken was partaking of such a meeting, in which he joined in full awareness, in the presence of a witness in that Wilders trial: you cannot come any closer to the flames of the ambivalent happening of monistic pleasure and pluralist attention. Schalken has proved himself to be a man of flesh and blood. That he relinquished his monistic ideal eventually for human disappointment is completely understandable. But in so doing he demonstrates once again that a purely monistic fundamental attitude is hardly viable, if it does not become clear through self-analysis and self-insight why a man acts the way he does, namely maintaining a pluralistic attitude, with sometimes the need for a monistic background. 2 Schalken was substitute Justice of the Court at Amsterdam and he was a member of the Bench (Of three Justices) which decided the Wilders case; not on behalf of the Court.187RELAXATION AS A POSSIBILITY OF EFFORT1 T.I. Oei When I was still a young student at Amsterdam, I made several group trips with contemporaries to various European countries. Sometimes we hitchhiked, in the sixties a common phenomenon, sometimes we lugged a tent along, as a fall-back, other times at the invitation of friends, acquaintances or relatives abroad. Being able to relax at the time always entailed such physical exertions that every night broken physically and mentally you fell into the arms of Morpheus. I saw a lot, heard, talked and most of all drank and ate a lot. Nowadays, when everyone can equip himself with iPhone, iPod, iPad and all those other things, a holiday often means being busy with the daily business of your activities, especially in exotic places. For instance a mountain trip in the jungles of Sumatra, or taking in the wonders of the Himalayas sitting on the back of a mule. And what I also did, simply being on a sunny island, in my case Tenerife/ Gran Canaria. On the buses that we diligently used every day, you saw the ordinary world go by. From crying children to screeching schoolgirls, bickering tattooed young men, shy, older women and not forgetting the elderly men, sometimes with their physical handicaps. The bus driver possessed a fair degree of human insight: often the automatic ticket stamp did not work, so that he had to write on the ticket what the trip would cost. In the end this would have no effect at all, for the automatic stamping machine cannot read anybody's handwriting and with a ticket worth 30 euros you should be able to travel quite a bit (1.5 euros to go from one village to the next) In spite of the air-conditioning, wonderful soft seats and other creature comforts in the bus human actions depend on pen and paper, a helping of patience and empathy. Regular stops were often made, and as a passenger you might see the driver at the end of his run, relax with his colleagues at the terminal and drink a 'cortado natural' at the coffee stall, and those who were hungry could enjoy a 'perrito' (a hotdog). I was struck by the cultural diversity of the population of Tenerife: Europeans, such as mainland Spaniards, Scandinavians, Germans, Englishmen, Italians, Belgians, Russians, people from France, Holland, the Balkans. Also the occasional African, with their displays of flashy sunglasses winding their way through the throngs of tourists, realizing full well that what they were doing was illegal, for as soon as police appeared they were gone in a jiffy, and some Chinese people with their tiendas: bric-a-brac shops, restaurants and little businesses. I thought one could feel at home there as a globetrotter. And this cultural versatility in a way also determines local habits and customs. I 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society , 2011, 26, 5, p. 117.PERSONAL SNIPPETS188was amazed at the difference in meaning of words for something as ordinary as coffee with some milk: caf\u00e9 con leche , or cappuccino cortado natural (caf\u00e9 espresso with frothy milk). The slightly more posh form of cortado with condensed milk is called caf\u00e9 con leche y leche , or leche y leche for short. And completed with a tiny slice of lim\u00f3n, a dash of can\u00e8l and a thin layer of licor 43 it was called barraquito . Instead of licor you could ask for gin, which had the elegant name carajillo . But in the capital of Tenerife, Santa Cruz, this drink (barraquito) went by the name barraquito especial . Which only goes to show that as a tourist and a coffee lover you must keep your eyes and ears open. Well, in such a good mood, my stay there and my reading a book by Arthur Schopenhauer about the freedom of the will inspired me to making a few remarks that mainly concern his idea of the will. In how far they have determined his influence on the world (among his admirers are both Gerard Reve and Willem Frederik Hermans, both Marcel Proust and Richard Wagner, both Leo Tolstoy and Charlie Chaplin) Thomas Mann describes in a literary essay at the end of the book.189HOW AN UNCONSCIOUS FRUSTRATION CAN LEAD TO A MASTERPIECE1 About free will, according to Arthur Schopenhauer T.I. Oei On the occasion of a conference in Amsterdam on 20 January 2011 about accountability, I have delved into the literature concerning the notions of free will and accountability, in relation with justice and science. One of the references I studied was the still topical (for justice and behaviourism) essay by Arthur Schopenhauer from 1839 (see Arthur Schopenhauer, On the freedom of the Will , Wereldbibliotheek Amsterdam, 6th impression, 2007) winning him the prize set by the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences. The essay is a thorough contribution to the question which already for centuries has occupied especially philosophers whether free will (=Liberum arbitrium) can be considered a manageable notion and what the consequences are for the scientist. Is free will really 'free'? What is the will in fact? How are cause and effect related to the will? Do animals have a will? What is the meaning of the will to the man in the street? What are the consequences of the use of free will in criminal law? Looking at the essay with modern eyes, this treatise contained ample material for a complete thesis, if only for the persuasive structure and the stylistic fashion in which it was written. Also in our times a prize for this work would have been justified. Most thorough of construction and conviction. Honest and well-considered, and where necessary without mincing his words. Written in a persuasive style and with an attractive vocabulary, I could catch him to my surprise at an occasional emotional, somewhat embroidered critical assessment of Hegel's philosophy and way of thinking of the Berlin of the first half of the nineteenth century. I thought: This somewhat overdone reaction is possibly brought about by a failed academic career or a personal feud with Hegel himself, or some other connection. Leading up to the challenged passages ad hominem against Hegel, he criticizes Friedrich Wilhem von Schelling, -after praising him for his 'Untersuchungen \u00fcber die menschliche Freiheit', - for the shallowness of his thoughts. But also for the preoccupation with which Schelling places his own thinking in the foreground at the expense of Kant's discoveries, which he obscures by only talking of 'idealism' when he refers to Kant, while never 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society , 2011, 26, 5, pp. 118-121.PERSONAL SNIPPETS190mentioning his name. According to Schopenhauer in so doing he disavowed the pioneering work of Immanuel Kant, who rejected the term 'idealism' as the correct description of his magisterial philosophical magnum opus. I quote a few passages. He (Schelling, to) expresses himself on the other hand in such a way, that most readers, who are not exactly informed about the content of the extensive and difficult works of the great man (Kant, to), cannot but believe that they are reading Schelling's own thoughts (Ibid. p. 90/91) He mentions concrete examples to underpin his thesis. And subsequently: Neither would Schelling have shrunk from appropriating the thoughts, nay, even the words of Jakob B\u00f6hme, without disclosing his source. (Ibid. p. 92) He thinks that since then and as a result of this kind of writing and thinking a problematic situation has developed in German philosophy. Thus 'intellectual observation' and 'absolute thinking' have ousted clear notions and honest research in German philosophy. Overawing, confounding, mystifying, pulling the wool over the reader's eyes by using all kinds of tricks has become the method, and usually the discourse is dominated by the intention one has and not by any insight into the matter itself. All this could not but result in a continuing lowering of the regard people had for philosophy -if it still deserves that title-, until finally it reached its shameful nadir in the person of Hegel. In order to suppress the freedom of thought that Kant had fought so hard for, this favourite of the ministry made philosophy -the daughter of reason and the expectant mother of truth- the mere tool of interests of the state, of obscurantism and protestant Jesuitry. (Ibid. p. 92-93) he writes: '...the liberum arbitrium indifferentiae, - every result of a reason is necessary, and every necessity is the result of a reason -presents itself to them under the name of \"moral freedom\" as a foregone conclusion, as if all those great men mentioned above (among whom Kant, Spinoza, Goethe, Voltaire, Aristotle and so on, to) have never lived. They state that the freedom of the will is an direct given of self- awareness, and that as such it is so unshakeably fixed, that all arguments to the contrary are pure sophistry. (...) This characterizes precisely the stage of innocence, in which Hegelian philosophy, after so many illustrious predecessors, has replaced German thinking.' My suspicion turned out to be a reality when I read somewhere why Schopenhauer could dispense a measure of emotional venom in order to commit character assassination of a colleague. There was a personal background. This was confirmed when it became apparent that Hegel was Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell191Schopenhauer's rival. Schopenhauer spent years waiting in vain for a chair which he was never awarded, whereas Hegel was the celebrated professor of philosophy in the Berlin of powerful Prussia, the Berlin where German politics was determined. Moreover the Hegelian glorification of the state was a thorn in his flesh. But apart from (or owing to?) this emotional opposition, he kept remarkably aloof, considered the state a necessary evil, opposed everything the authorities were wont to do, in this case supporting an ing\u00e9nue -in the eyes of Schopenhauer- like Hegel, but Schopenhauer does have a point when he brings out the value of Kant's position. This I have freely paraphrased: The theory developed by Kant about the relation between empiric and intelligible nature is fully based on everything that is his philosophy's Leitmotiv, namely the distinction between the appearance and the thing in itself. And just as to him the perfect empirical reality of the world of experience is combined with its transcendental ideality, in like manner the strict empirical necessity of action is combined with its transcendental freedom. (Ibid. p. 105) In a word: Man always does what he wants, and nevertheless does this of necessity. (Ibid. p. 107) Finally Schopenhauer discusses intellectual freedom. {Earlier he had dealt with physical freedom (= the absence of material obstacles of whatever nature, the freedom in relation to ability), moral freedom (=liberum arbitrium, free will, the freedom in relation to wanting) Ibid. up to p. 108} There as well his opinions are pronounced. I can follow his thoughts more or less step by step. (Ibid. p. 109 ff.) The intellectual freedom of man is shaped in the results of the reaction of his will to the motives present in the outside world. They hold good both for him and for other people. He is morally and legally responsible for those actions. For example external conditions may permanently or temporarily have disrupted the faculty of cognition, the medium of motives (for instance through madness or through force majeure, when instead of a medicine a poison is administered, or when the servant is mistaken for a thief and shot) on account of which the interpretation of the motives is affected or falsified. In both cases namely the motives were adulterated, making it impossible for the will to judge as it would have judged if the intellect had given it a correct representation of the conditions in question. The offences committed under such circumstances, are not punishable by law. For the law takes for granted that the will in a moral sense is not free -which means that it cannot be directed- but on the other hand at the mercy of the force PERSONAL SNIPPETS192of motives. Correspondingly the legislator wants to counter all possible criminal motives with stronger opposing motives, in the form of sanctions, Schopenhauer says. (Ibid. pp. 109-110) The intellect, however, is not subjected to punishment; the law, just as morality, is only to do with the will. It alone shapes the actual man: the intellect is merely its tool, its antennae to the outside, that is to say the medium through which the motives affect him. Intellectual freedom can also be (only partly) neutralized. This is especially the case when there is an effusion or a fuddle. An effusion is a sudden, violent stirring of the will, caused by a representation that penetrates from outside and becomes a motive and which is so vivid that all other representations that might serve as counter motives are obscured and are prevented from penetrating the consciousness. (Cf our Penal Code, originally 1886, in the text dealing with mental force majeure, which resembles this). 2 These latter representations are mostly of an abstract nature, mere thoughts, which do not get a chance to function, whereas the former is concrete and tangible. Also in this construction are the legal and moral responsibilities, to a greater or lesser extent corresponding to the conditions, but always partly neutralized. A fuddle is a condition that promotes the emergence of emotions, by reinforcing the vividness of the visual representations, on the other hand weakens abstract thinking and at the same time raises the energy level of the will. Instead of being responsible for the actions, one is now responsible for the fuddle itself (culpa in causa). This does not provide an excuse for the fuddle in a legal sense, although in a fuddle the intellectual freedom is partly neutralized. It is this intellectual freedom (already described by Aristotle) that is referred to, when in forensic medicine and in criminal justice the question is raised whether the culprit was in a state of freedom and as a result must be held accountable. Schopenhauer disagrees with Kant when he finds that, if moral freedom does not exist and on account of the resulting inevitability of all actions of a certain person, no offender should be punished. He thinks that Kant starts from a wrong concept of punishment. Schopenhauer imputes that Kant thinks that punishment is an affliction of the offence for the sake of the 2 For a successful appeal to mental force majeure there must be an urge coming from outside which the defendant in all fairness could not, nor needed to resist (HR 30-11-2004, NJ 2005, 94, LJN AR2067). Cf also M.M. Dolman, Het stelsel van strafuitsluitingsgronden , system of for freedom of punishment] Dissertation Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2006.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell193offence, a retribution of evil with evil, and that on moral grounds. However, although this is a Kant doctrine, this would be absurd, meaningless and completely without justification. For what would give man the right to set himself up in a moral respect as the absolute judge of someone else, and for that reason to torment him for his sins! Rather the law, in other words the threat of punishment, aims to be the counter motive for offences not yet committed (as a deterrent). Should the law in isolated cases be without effect, then punishment must be administered (enforcement of justice), otherwise the law would be ineffectual also in all future cases. It is striking what Schopenhauer writes in his treatise about the freedom of the will. He takes Kant's position, in recognizing on the one hand free will as an aspect of being (esse), and the possibilities of determinism as an aspect of ability (operari), or the degree of practicability of our actions. But he does not go along with Kant when he deems the free will so essential that there should not be room for punishment in human intercourse if there were no moral freedom for man anymore and he would in fact be the plaything of his motives. Schopenhauer denies man the possibility to be the ultimate (absolute) judge of someone else on the grounds of the absence of moral freedom or of moral motives. He thinks that the law definitely can punish people, should practice show that the threat of sanctions as a counter motive to the offence is not effectual. His adage is that what we are can be deduced from what we do. And thus he confirms his method, which was aimed at describing, at arguing for, at comparing the freedom of the will with the standpoints of other historically important philosophers. But at the same time he settles scores with his (supposed) opponents and adversaries and contemporaries (Fichte, Schelling, Hegel) from the German-speaking regions, against whom he was forced to act considering his profound personal frustrations with regard to authorities and time servers/philosophers of his time. In that way he wanted to make society realize how deeply involved he was with the political goings on of what he felt to be a humane government.3 3 Much of what Schopenhauer found is recognized in psychoanalytical doctrine and it is remarkable that Freud denied knowing of Schopenhauer's writings, until an advanced age. 'Schopenhauer's concept of the will contains the foundations of what in Freud became the concepts of the unconscious and the id. Schopenhauer's writings on madness anticipate Freud's theory of repression and his first theory of the etiology of neurosis. Schopenhauer's work contains aspects of what becomes the theory of free association. And most importantly, Schopenhauer articulates major parts of the Freudian theory of sexuality.' Cf SCHOPENHAUER AND FREUD, Christopher Young & Andrew Brook, Essay by Christopher Young & Andrew Brook from 'International Journal of Psychoanalysis', 1994; and also, Christopher Young & Andrew Brook, Schopenhauer, Arthur (1788-1860), in: E. Erwin (Ed.), The FREUD Encyclopedia, theory, therapy and culture , 2002, Routledge, New York and London, pp. 504-506.PERSONAL SNIPPETS194Reaction of a colleague 'Dear Karel, Nice to read how you enjoyed your holiday and found the inspiration to delve into the thoughts of Schopenhauer especially where free will is concerned. The title of your essay \"How an unconscious frustration can lead to a masterpiece\" is striking. It's a deep one. A superficial contemplation of his youth immediately supplies hypotheses about the unconscious breeding ground of his later violently narcissistically inclined frustrations or affronts (father commits suicide when Arthur is 17 years old - mother goes her own way - there is not one woman who is any good, Arthur says) Free will and frustration. Now for some raw reality. A couple of weeks ago my 19-year-old son was beaten up for no reason at all (well, you might argue that he was in the location where it happened). First knocked to the ground without any warning, when he tried to get up once more knocked out unseen from aside and finally when he lay on the ground, dizzy, he was kicked in the head (a few centimetres from his temple). He thought he knew the perpetrator (who did not act alone by the way). When he had regained his senses X realized that it is a fellow student. It had earlier been pointed out to him that his twin brother had been killed in a hit-and-run accident when he cycled home through a dark polder after a party. Frustration and free Will? X reacted as level-headed boys of his age will: a frustrated psycho, but that can be no excuse! The immediate lust for revenge of son and father has meanwhile given way to relative indifference. And that indifference nourishes the tendency to cultural pessimism which may even be more destructive than the social causes of this pessimism.'195TAKING EACH OTHER'S MEASURE T.I. Oei Steven de Jong, NRC Handelsblad 4-04-11: 'The division of power is not absolute, for the legislative, executive and administrative powers must check each other. This also includes the functioning of a judge. An appointment for life is an obstruction to such a check. This is argued today by PVV foreman Geert Wilders and PVV MP Lilian Helder (also former lawyer) in the correspondence columns of NRC Handelsblad . Therefore they want judges to be appointed for a maximum of five or six years and not for life as is now customary. It would take a constitutional adaptation to bring this about. Wilders and Helder are considering bringing in a private member's bill. They emphatically point out that this does not mean that the government should be able to sack judges. They are only concerned with abolishing appointments for life. \"The term of office should be of a definite duration and should be legally terminated - without dismissal, simply because of the passage of time. At the end of the term there is room for an evaluation of the work of the judge in question, should he or she want to be considered for re-appointment.\" The politicians do not indicate who should be doing this evaluation, but Wilders does have a couple of ideas about the assessment criteria. In the news programme Uitgesproken WNL he elaborated them in an interview with Joost Eerdmans. \"See whether their penalties were stiff enough. If they have only imposed community service, they can go and work at the social services of with RIAGG. When they have given hefty sentences, they can be re-appointed.\" The Council for the Administration of Justice uses a different profile for judges. Some essential skills, according to the Council, are 'being decisive', 'sharp formation of judgment' and 'being in control'. Recently Wilders objected to the appointment of Ybo Buruma as a Supreme Court Judge, because earlier the professor had expressed negative opinions about the PVV. Also in the court case against Wilders the neutrality of judges has repeatedly been the subject of discussion. Last year the court at Amsterdam was challenged. Minister Opstelten (Security and Justice, VVD) is absolutely opposed to doing away with life appointments. \"Fortunately we live in a country with division of power\", he said on 18February in the interview programme Pauw en Witteman . \"An independent judge, simply appointed for life, we must absolutely keep that.\" There was also criticism from the Dutch PERSONAL SNIPPETS196Order of lawyers. \"Do this, and the entire good old trias politica has gone to the dogs\", dean Jan Loorback said. The term 'independence' refers to the relations between the judge and the two other powers of state, the legislative and the government, the PVV members write in their column. \"This independence has two elements. In the first place the formal independence, or the freedom to decide -the legislator cannot exact a certain verdict in any individual case. In the second place the personal or legal independence - the government cannot dismiss a judge. This personal independence is laid down in article 117 of the Constitution.\" Moreover, Helder and Wilders write, the European Court for Human Rights decreed already in the seventies that a temporary appointment is not an obstacle to independence. Therefore an adaptation of the terms of employment is justified, these politicians think. \"We cannot understand why every employee should be subject to assessments and the ladies and gentlemen of the administrative power exempt.\" Judges are also people, they conclude. And people make mistakes. \"Consider the verdicts in the case of Lucia de Berk and the case that has become known as the Schiedam park murder.\"' Not being a lawyer I do not have an explicit opinion about whether or not judges ought to be temporarily appointed and may continue in office if considered acceptable. If such a thing is possible with the average citizen, I would be inclined to say Why not? All kinds of rationalizations do not provide a cure.1 Probably only the monarch should have an age-independent 1 Job hopping does not appear to be a bad thing after all.

So, time for action! The SER was commissioned with a study of the job market and mobility by the previous Cabinet, Balkenende IV. The Council's conclusion is that both employees and employers should take more trouble to make a switch to another job normal and easy. Employees who regularly change jobs achieve more and can continue working in good health longer, the SER writes in its concept advice published a few days ago. Not a bad move, considering the wave of grey that is approaching. Additional advantage of a new job is that it is often better suited to someone's talents and capabilities. This is now frequently a problem, resulting in loss of motivation in employees. And because the employer also profits when employees switch jobs regularly, he should take more trouble to increase their mobility, states the report, which has the more than awkward title 'Making job-job mobility work. So bosses should exert themselves more in offering refresher and even resettlement courses. The SER does have a point: Earlier scientific research showed that much can be gained when jobs really suit the employees' abilities. Research among the staff of a car manufacturer's first charted Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell197occupation. What concerns me more is what the assessment process among professionals should look like. How does the master pupil model work? How equal are the two actors: candidate-member and ordinary member of a professional organization/professional union. When there is no difference of professional method, they should associate as two adults. There should be some kind of exchange of skills and opinions giving either the chance to learn from the other. This would imply that the evaluations ought to be highly serious affairs, in which either can be called to book by the other. And in which both parties, each in their own intervision groups, could be coached and made to train in order to develop and learn the requisite skills. In this way each individual should take their own responsibility. Nor will it be likely an issue why there are people who want to function somewhere for life. Because where responsibility weighs more heavily than official status everyone will have to/be able to face reality fairly quickly. There will come a time when the younger or more active colleague performs better, making it possible for the senior to completely transfer his tasks with an easy heart, and not to have to worry about what he leaves behind: a flourishing company. all the strong points of each employee, and then in two shifts the various tasks were re-allocated, on the basis of the data gained. What was the result? When everyone was allowed to do what he was good at, the productivity of the two reshuffled shifts rose within 6 months by no less 50 percent, in comparison to departments where nothing had been changed! This is mentioned by Wilmar Schaufeli and Pieternel their book 'Bevlogen aan werk' [Working enthusiastically] which was published last year. 'Who is enthusiastic, feels passion for his work, is really interested and finds his work a pleasure,' write Schaufeli and Dijkstra, professor of industrial psychology at the University of Utrecht and psychologist and author of non-specialist books respectively. 'But enthusiasm does more,' continues the argument. 'Enthusiastic employees feel better and happier. Thus enthusiasm contributes to our mental and physical health. Just as important is the fact that enthusiasm makes more productive. An organization will make more money more with enthusiastic employees.' 199AMBIV ALENCES AND COLLUSIONS IN RELATIONSHIPS1 T.I. Thierry de Bourmonville of the Walloon village Stavelot was stabbed by one of his sons. At the moment he is critically ill in hospital. After he had been repeatedly stabbed in the back, face and arms he was taken to hospital in Bra-sur-Lienne by means of a helicopter. According to the Public Prosecutor in Verviers the boy climbed to the roof of their house threatening to kill himself. This was later denied. It is not yet clear why the boy attacked his father. This true story (published in Belgium 12-08-10) makes us suppose how the serious collusion between father and son may lead to a pathological denouement, in this case violence. Collusion is the mental stranglehold in which two people manoeuvre each other for long periods in their lives and unconsciously need each other, notably in the roles they perform. Escalation because of a rejection or some kind of sado-masochist interaction (temptation, challenge, and the effect of a fuddle, serious loss of face and the like) may lead to a tragedy. It often concerns psychodynamically dual, mostly unconscious mechanisms in which two individuals are finding each other on the one hand and avoid each other on the other following the following lines: 1. power/powerlessness; 2. dependence/independence; 3. sexuality/eroticism; 4. urge/compulsion; 5. holding/letting go. In my view these are dominant ambivalent positions which operate individually and independently, also sometimes in various combinations (for instance 1 and 3, 2 and 5, 3 and 4). As more combinations become operative at the same time and appear to be essential in the mental problems of the individual or of the couple in question, the pathological development becomes graver. 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society , 2011, 26, 2, pp. 61-62.PERSONAL SNIPPETS200Ad 1. The combination: power/powerlessness aims at establishing each other's position on the basis of authority/subservience. Ad 2. The combination: dependence/independence characteristically means that two people cannot do without each other, yet cannot bear each other's presence. Ad 3. The combination: sexuality/eroticism is the phenomenon that two people can only take mutual positions to the degree in which the one manages to seduce or overpower or conquer the other. Ad 4. The combination: urge/compulsion is based on the way in which two people have a hold on each other (the one actively: perpetrator, the other passively: victim), by wanting to provoke/intimidate on the one hand, on the other wanting to forcefully bring about a selfish/narcissistic goal. Ad 5. Finally the oppositional pair: holding/letting go forms the unresolved problem of solving the bonds with the parental nest, in which on the one hand parental authority but also security is sought, and at the same time on the other hand wanting to dismiss the parental status of being firmly fixed in the social establishment. Behaviour with suchlike mechanisms can sometimes be seen and observed within the social structure and the way in which people treat each other. It is interesting to see how behaviour can be further analysed for such basic mechanisms. The concept collusion was crystallized in the seventies in the relationship therapy according to J\u00fcrg Willi, a Swiss relational therapist/ psychoanalyst. It is also clear that interpretations according to psychodynamic mechanisms (denoted as narcissistic, oral, anal and oedipal collusions) may play a part here. For an example of ambivalences and collusions in a relationship the following story. Ad Fransen, Leven met Reve, Gerard Reve and Hanny Michaelis] Uitgeverij Podium, Amsterdam 2010, p. 35 ff., especially pp. 86, 87 and 88. How an impossible marriage, a relationship that for the most part consists of mutual strife (and mental knock outs) between the partners also has elements of love and affection is demonstrated by the recently published story about the last meeting somewhere in the nineties of the two former spouses, both known as poet/author, Gerard Reve and Hanny Michaelis. By means of vital Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell201dialogues the couple illustrates how painful, and at the same time balmy, the effects of two people on each other may be. I will quote a passage which in my opinion fully shows the torments and moments of consolation such a relationship may provide, even though the two have separated decades before. 'Gerard, I (Hanny, to) am still ashamed for being such a belly-ache. I did not misbehave, but I am so grateful to you for putting up with so much.' Gerard: 'I was in your way, I feel very guilty. But you have to make up your mind whether it is this or the other. And then put your signature at the bottom.' Hanny: 'That was not such an easy thing to do, it was really a sad thing, splitting up. I do not regret our marriage. The final years were very difficult, but we stayed together because we were really attached to each other. Gerard did not really want to leave, he was afraid, probably because homosexuality was not quite so accepted at the time (1950, to). He wanted both: me and a boyfriend. But my psychiatrist told me that it would be better to get a divorce. And it was in fact better, otherwise we would have become frustrated. But he is the only ex- lover who remained a good friend. The affection has remained.' Gerard: 'We are still fond of each other. But look here, we cannot talk with each other, for she cannot see anything figuratively or spiritually. Redemption, mercy, those are not definable concepts. But a human being must be able to feel satisfied. You may want things, but you do not get everything you want.' Hanny: 'In hindsight I do have the idea that I have never understood you at all. That feeling became especially clear when some time ago you read De avonden on radio. I had read that novel six times already, but it was not until then that it dawned on me what moved you, what vexed you, what lived within. I used to be unaware of all that then.' Hanny is seconded by her successor Joop Schafthuizen. He tries to comfort her: 'Gerard is simply a difficult guy to live with and you soon become a whiner when dealing with Gerard Reve. Gerard is a masochist, who may change into a sadist from one minute to the next. But he is also honest. If he did not have that honesty, he would be an utter swine and you could not live with him for an hour. Gerard only exists for his work, next to his work everything else is theatre. It is that simple. Let me tell you that, Wolf (Pet name for Gerard, to).' The writer furtively laughs up his sleeve at this and nods agreement \"Sadist\", it has a ring of distinction.' 203WE WILL CARRY ON...*1 T.I. Oei 'If you want to be loved by everyone, you should choose a different trade. Or you should not be successful'. Scientist Titia de Lange: 'Kanker is mijn leven'. [Cancer is my life]2 How do you notice that you are not popular? 'Sometimes you come across someone who is honest and simply tell you. Does not happen often. But you can also deduce it from stories about others. For each successful scientist there is a bunch of stories. About what a terrible guy he is and that he has stolen everything. Would they talk differently about me? I don't think so.' The way you talk about your work: that is love. 'It is like with artists, or writers, they are also into their work 24 hours a day. You can't switch off, it goes on and on. It is even worse now, with all those computers. When I am travelling, I still have access, to my people's data, to all literature, and I am inclined to carry on.' For the money (of various prizes, to) can be used to fund new research. ' Are you crazy? That is personal money. I live in America, I have to provide for my own retirement. Life is tough here, Third World sometimes.' Breast cancer again? 'But much more drastic this time. Treatment was uninterrupted misery. Chemotherapy and everything out and amputated. And then you have to sit tight. I am still here. But you can never say: it is not going to come back.' When your mother fell ill, you must have grown up very quickly. 'I would not call that grown up. I think I was tough. In the American sense. Keep everything orderly. Vacuuming properly. Mopping up, Grit. True grit. Never give up.' Like you are also dealing with science. 'Never give up. Carry on.' Titia de Lange, a world famous researcher, who became a smash hit in America when she became the first female professor at Rockefeller University. Then she was awarded countless prizes for her pioneering cancer research. She herself turned out to have a hereditary gene anomaly. Her mother died of 1 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society , 2012, 7, SNIPPETS204cancer of the ovaries. She had breast cancer. Meanwhile a second occurrence. The same factor is the cause of both forms of cancer. A tough, brave, amiable woman who combines a large measure of self-knowledge with an ability of relativization, an example to the reader. 3 It is remarkable that in the case of many experienced people who can stand to look at themselves in the mirror when they grow older, there is self- knowledge and a relentlessly positive attitude to life. I myself have experienced with patients and friends that the more you manage to put things into perspective, the more energy becomes available for you to use for your own goals, your own comfort and pleasure. Those who look upon themselves as the victims of nature or of life, suffer from this to such a degree, that, as it were, on waking up every morning they would rather hide under their own bed than face facts. The understanding that as a human being one has limitations is a wisdom that cannot be repeated often enough. It goes without saying that this awareness is a way to be better able to plan your activities: for feasibility and efficacy. 3 In my psychoanalytical treatments I usually give examples of cases and treatments which 'others' have had or done. This brings the analysand often to associations and reflections which impose themselves on the reality of the analytical space. An example presented itself after a colleague read the text of this column. Reaction of a column: 'You came even closer when you wrote about the breast cancer of this American professor you admire so much. In 1950, after the birth of my youngest brother (a late arrival) my mother developed a lump in her breast. The old guru who was our family doctor (and family friend!) thought that this was an inflamed milk gland and nothing to be worried about. Even after several consultations. Finally my mother went to see her brother, who is a surgeon, and after the shortest of examinations he was cursing like you wouldn't believe. Counter to all the usual rules he performed an urgent operation on his sister, and it was an amputation on a grand scale, as it was called if I remember correctly. And just then a new therapy had become available: Radio therapy to be done in Amsterdam in the Antoni van Leeuwenhoek (Hospital, to). People did not know a lot about this therapy and my mother sustained serious burns. But then: What I am now writing to you is the biggest secret in my mother's life and in our family. No one was to know. And you should take the words \"secret\" and \"no one\" literally. Mother found herself a doctor outside W. At home the subject was an absolute taboo. At the same time: What a difficult time. Mother must have had, to have to deal with this on her own and not to be able to talk about it with anyone. Can tell many more concrete stories about this, but you can imagine that I am fully aware of the openness of today, particularly of this American lady, and clearly remember \"the old days\". Incidentally this was not what my mother died of. Forty-two years later she got a cerebral haemorrhage. The lesson I have learnt? Most certainly never to put your head in the sand where health/illness is concerned. Well, that was an unburdening of facts brought about by your American contact.'Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell205It is therefore my experience never to mention being busy or having a full agenda, for it leads to nothing. And hanging back from an activity, each time before starting, might be compared to scoring an own goal, the disadvantage is your own fault.

He died 31 May 2011.207ASSISTANCE IN SUICIDE IN PSYCHIATRY - WHERE WE ARE NOW ANNOTATION IN A CASE OF ASSISTED SUICIDE IN PSYCHIATRY (2008) A. P. de Boer, T. I. OeiForensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell209In 2002 the Euthanasia Act came into being in Holland. The Act, in full called 'Act for the Review of the Termination of Life by Request and Assistance in Suicide', does not distinguish between physical and mental suffering and thus creates equal access to assisted dying for both categories. In the twenty thousand cases since 2002 in which euthanasia has been practised or assistance in suicide has been provided, until recently it always concerned incurable physical suffering. In almost 90 % of the cases this involved physicians assisting patients with terminal cancer. In 2008 for the first time two cases were reported of psychiatrists assisting in the suicides of psychiatric patients (Regional Review Committee, 2009) One of these two, the case which we describe here, is a classic example of the kind of suffering that may give rise to a request for assistance in suicide. All important aspects of the case and of the relevant criteria are discussed below. Also the historical developments in the thought processes about this kind of assistance and its actual practice are discussed. This article is limited to euthanasia in The Netherlands, although it is also a topical subject in Flanders, as became apparent in the complications surrounding the self-selected death of the writer Hugo Claus. Doubtless there is a need for a comparative legal study of the situation surrounding euthanasia and assisted suicide within the entire Dutch-speaking regions, but that is beyond the scope of this article. One actual case The request for assistance in suicide was made by a sixty-five-year-old woman. From her teens she suffered greatly from very serious medical- psychiatric problems. A serious post traumatic stress disorder and serious depressions were central. The patient described her life as a torment. She lived in serious social isolation and displayed a very apathetic and inhibited attitude to life. Her complaints had strongly aggravated after her husband's death. The woman had been psychiatrically treated for fifty years. She had had lengthy psychotherapeutic treatments. She received many combinations of drugs -antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs. Attempts were made to make her socially active. She was placed in a nursing home for an extended period. She received light therapy. The effects of sleep deprivation were examined. However, enduring positive results there were none. She made repeated attempts to take her own life, including taking rat poison. This patient had always shown constructive cooperation with these treatments. Her mood, however, remained deeply depressed. She indicated that her life had lost all colour. The death wish she had had for years became ever stronger. She reiterated her request in front of her GP, the psychiatrist and the psychologist/psychotherapist who had been treating her and her physician. She asked her doctor to end her suffering by means of a lethal injection. PERSONAL SNIPPETS210 Patient and physician were convinced of the insupportability and hopelessness of her suffering. The doctor was also convinced of the request being voluntary. All options for treatment had been discussed but there were no perspectives any more. There was somatic co-morbidity. It was considered reasonable and understandable that this patient did not want to have any more treatment for her cardiac problems. A lengthy sojourn in a home with patients with similar complaints was offered to her; her refusal to accept this offer was respected. The psychiatrist complied with the request, after careful consideration and after seeking the advice of several independent colleagues and, in accordance with the legal requirements, an independent physician within the framework of Support and Consultation with Euthanasia in The Netherlands (SCEN). After thorough examination and supported by the advice of the colleagues consulted, the psychiatrist had reached the conclusion that all legal care requirements had been met. The request for the termination of this life was consistent and well-considered. The suffering was understandably insupportable and without perspective. All options for treatment had been used, assistance in living was no longer possible. The doctor delivered to his patient a potion containing 9 grammes of pentobarbital. The review of this case The Euthanasia Act has instituted regional review committees which afterwards examine the doctor's actions for compatibility with the legal care requirements. Central requirement is that the patient makes a voluntary and well-considered request because his suffering is insupportable and without perspective. A further requirement is that the physician has counselled the patient about his situation and his perspectives and that both he and the patient have become convinced that there was no other reasonable resolution. We have already mentioned the obligation for consultation with independent colleagues. The physician must give a written account for his actions to the review committee. In the case described here the review committee indicated that, because of the psychiatric problems, it considered the assisted suicide an exceptional case, which requires extra care in the assessment, especially concerning the insupportability and the hopelessness of the suffering. (Regional Review Committee, 2009). Earlier the KNMG (The Royal Dutch Medical Society) had already stated that euthanasia and assisted suicide in general were exceptional medical actions (Legemaate 2003). The review committee endorsed the assistance, on the basis of the lengthy and careful path the physician had followed, the fact the physician Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell211had consulted not just one but several experts and the fact that extensive attention had been paid to reaching an informed decision. The committee also said that in his written account the physician had clearly argued why he thought the patient was competent. The committee decided that the choice for death was not the result of treatable psychiatric dependency. The unsupportability and hopelessness of the suffering had become understandable in the thorough discussions between patient and doctor. All treatment options had been the subjects of lengthy discussions and after careful consideration discarded as disproportional or not feasible. The review committee explicitly endorsed the psychiatrist's actions stating: \"The physician has had extensive discussions with the patient and together they could not but reach the conclusion that there were no more reasonable options for treatment available. The suffering of this patient was without perspective.\" A change in culture The positive reviews of 2008 are a change in culture which has not come about without a struggle. This change concerns all aspects of assisted dying, both in general and in psychiatry -what the patient has to bear and what he can demand, what the physician must do and what he must not do, and how the physician has to account for his actions. The struggle about these questions was primarily conducted in the law courts (van Herten, 1984). Three verdicts in cases of euthanasia from the post-war period reflect the development in the thinking about euthanasia towards a more benevolent judgment. In the first case (1952) a man who, at his brother's express request, had administered a lethal dose of morphine to this brother who was grievously ill in a sanatorium, was given a suspended prison sentence of one year. In the second case (1973) a woman, who was also a doctor, who had ended her mother's suffering at her express request, was given a suspended sentence of one week. The third case (1983) against the GP who had practised euthanasia was dismissed on grounds of justifiability -in this case the moral dilemma in a conflict of duties. The doctor publicly accounted for his actions in a court of law, and was able to justify his actions -administering or providing lethal substances- and the case was dismissed. This form of accountability was the road to be followed as long as the Euthanasia Act was missing, but proved so burdensome to doctors that it could make them shy from any form of assisted dying. The problem was not only the absolute ban on euthanasia, but also the social taboo that was involved, especially in psychiatry. (As appears from our concluding consideration of hopelessness, this resistance is still very real) In 1962 Van Ree tried to move with the times. He observed that in chronic institutional psychiatry there are very frequently cases of insupportable PERSONAL SNIPPETS212suffering and on the other hand that there are but very limited therapeutic possibilities. The admissibility of assisted suicide received more support after 1990, when the Euthanasia Act was prepared. In government circles progressive opinions were gradually gaining ground, just as earlier in the case of abortion. The patient's autonomy became more and more important, even though this autonomy was not so readily recognised in the case of psychiatric patients. This point also is still very real, and we will come back to it when considering the patient's competence to reach an informed decision. The general euthanasia debate brought forth publications about the legal framework for assisted suicide in psychiatry. In 1994 the Tijdschrift voor Psychiatrie (Psychiatry Magazine) published a survey in which the authors characterised the subject as still fiercely controversial. They advocated equal treatment for the physically and the mentally ill as far as requests for termination of life were concerned. (Van der Lijn c.s. 1994). The Geneeskundige Inspectie voor Geestelijke Gezondheid (Medical Inspection of Mental Health) stated that in exceptional cases assisted suicide can be acceptable with psychiatric patients. (Geneeskundige Inspectie, 1993). In its report Committee Acceptability Actions for the Termination of Life (CAL- report) the KNMG adopted the same viewpoint. (KNMG 1993) The Nederlandse Vereniging voor Psychiatrie (Dutch Union of Psychiatry) published its first guideline with regard to assisted suicide in the case of people with psychiatric disorders. That this Guideline filled an essential gap becomes apparent in research from 1997, which shows that in psychiatry in about three hundred cases annually urgent requests are made for assistance in suicide (Groenewoud 1997). Prominent publicists like Chabot, Kuitert, Tholen, Borst further highlighted the problem. (Chabot 2000). Thus, in a gradually changing philosophical and intellectual climate, the foundation was laid for the Euthanasia Act of 2002. The Euthanasia Act in psychiatric practice Now that the law no longer makes a distinction, the physically and mentally ill in principle have equal access to assistance in dying. The actual practice was and is different. In the first six years after the introduction of the Euthanasia Act not a single request for assistance in suicide was accepted, whereas, on the basis of the findings of Groenewoud, during that period some two thousand requests must have been turned down. It is not a good thing that such refusals can be made without form. There should be a duty to give motivations, to provide insight in the refusal. Each year some fifty patients in this group of refusals are known to resort to a frequently horrible form of suicide, even dangerous to other people. Because of, regardless of the legal admissibility, consistently turning down requests for assisted dying, psychiatry occupied an exceptional position. As we have seen, this changed in 2008. This change justifies the Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell213letter and the spirit of the Euthanasia Act, and also recognises the widely supported opinion among psychiatrists that assisted suicide ought to be an option for psychiatric patients. The increasing consensus was reflected in the Guideline of the Dutch Union of Psychiatry (NVvP 1989, second, revised edition: Tholen et al. 2009). The new guideline can be read as a manual for the psychiatrist-practician on how to deal with requests for assistance in suicide. The protocol dwells on the legal care requirements and gives additional recommendations: double, if needed triple consultation of independent psychiatrists, a written argued account of the psychiatrist to his consultant containing his own assessment regarding the care requirements, and a discussion of feelings of transfer and counter transfer, showing that the physician in full professional freedom has decided to provide the assistance. It deals with recommendations: in the case described here the committee reviewed the doctor's actions primarily against the law and endorsed the process even though the Guideline had not been followed on all points. Assessment and consultation of experts In the case of psychiatric patients the assessment of requests for assistance in suicide requires specialist expertise. Quite frequently the GP pleads circumstances beyond his control or a lack of specific expertise. Assessments appear to be best done by a psychiatrist. This psychiatrist receives the request, makes the assessment, records the proceedings and ultimately provides expert execution of the assisted suicide. The best thing for the psychiatrist is to bring in as consultant one psychiatrist who is also SCEN physician. Such a combination keeps the decision making process clear and orderly. Double or even triple consultation, as advocated in the Guideline, is a burden on the procedure without clearly improving the quality of the decision making. It is advisable not to ask the expert an explicit verdict regarding the request. The function of the expert should be focussed on which remaining options for treatment are still possible. Regarding these options he should give concrete, committed advice. It must be clear what sort of treatment can be provided, where and for how long. This ultimate offer of treatment has to be a realistic one. The proposed treatment must give a perspective of real relief of suffering. The aspect of proportionality needs to be observed. Very slight chances of small improvements do not outweigh the great effort and strain the treatment would demand of the patient. The patient's competence One of the most difficult questions in requests for assistance in suicide is the assessment of the patient's competence to express his informed will - the question whether the patient has the ability to freely make a responsible decision about his life and its termination. When this faculty is seriously affected by a mental handicap, there is no competence. On the other hand, a PERSONAL SNIPPETS214minor mental handicap is no obstruction to the patient's competence. Of course there are borderline cases, and it is exactly in those cases that the physician is faced with difficult considerations. The practice of the last few years shows that requests for euthanasia in cases of beginning dementia are not necessarily dismissed for insufficient competence of the patient. There is the important legal condition that the patient's competence is judged on the basis of the moment when the request was originally expressed, so that a subsequent loss of mental faculties does not harm the patient's rights. The problem of competence not only occurs in psychiatry, but also in various legal matters, such as decisions concerning wards of the court. Its importance for psychiatry is extra great, because it is exactly here that there was, and still is, the tendency to misjudge the patient's autonomy. Some refuse any kind of assistance in dying even in the case of mentally healthy people, because they consider 'balanced suicide' unthinkable (Koerselman 1994). How then would they ever be able to respect the death wish of a psychiatric patient? On the other hand, the patient's autonomy was defended by Legemaate (1992). The general importance of the patient's competence has led to formulating uniform guidelines for various professional groups, albeit informally. (Justice Department 1994) These guidelines put the autonomy of the psychiatric patient first. Judging the patient's competence must not be about the content of the decision made, but only about the quality of the decision making. When a patient makes a request for assistance in dying, this request may not simply be refused saying that by definition such a request cannot be well-considered. A death wish is not in itself proof of a diseased or defective will. The assessor's own moral opinions may not be normative, disregarding the rights of the patient. Only the ethically neutral question of the way in which the patient reached his decision and how he justifies it should be asked. The patient's decision making is checked on the following points: he must be clear and consistent in his request for assistance, he must be able to comprehend the fatal consequences of his request and he must show that he fully understands the explanation about the character of possibly remaining options for treatment. The grounds on which he makes this ultimate request - the insupportability and the hopelessness of his suffering - he must make reasonably understandable to the psychiatrist, in order for him to be able to determine that, in spite of his condition his judgment is not impaired. In this way the psychiatrist is also able to make understandable to others his assessment of the patient's competence. A ready-made neuro-psychological test to measure the patient's competence is not yet available. However, the test which is available, the Mac Arthur Competence Assessment Tool Treatment (MacCAT-T) can provide an important indication about the patient's cognitive competence.(KNMG 2004)Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell215 Starting point and tenor of the law and the various guidelines are abundantly clear: the psychiatric patient is also an autonomous person, until proven otherwise. But the extreme paucity of cases of assisted dying with psychiatric patients makes one suspect that these relatively tolerant norms have not been generally accepted and that as a result the required assistance is wrongly withheld from psychiatric patients. Insupportability and hopelessness with psychiatric patients It is frequently said that psychiatric patients should not have assistance in suicide because they are not suffering from a life-threatening disease and most certainly are not in the terminal phase. However, the idea that euthanasia is acceptable only when a seriously suffering patient is terminal, is not in keeping with the Euthanasia Act. Also when a patient is not terminal, his request for assisted suicide is admissible, although stricter demands will be made regarding the insupportability and hopelessness of his suffering. The insupportability is evident when the patient himself indicates this, and it is for the physician to determine that already for a very long time the patient has been obsessed with a death wish undermining all vital functions. The main problem is assessing hopelessness. Insupportability and hopelessness are interconnected, which makes the assessment extra troublesome. Sometimes the dilemma is that the more the patient is aware of his suffering, the more strongly he longs for death and the more suicidal he becomes. In the case described here the physician did contemplate relieving the insupportable suffering by increasing the medication, but the patient would then live on in a zombie-like state. The review committee endorsed the physician's opinion that this would not be a humane alternative. Hopelessness therefore does not in itself mean that all imaginable treatment options have been exhausted, but only those options that the patient can bear. The review committee also indicated that it would have been wrong to ask the patient to be admitted to a sheltered housing project with kindred desperate people. The burden that this would be for her, was judged to be greater than the very slight chance of any kind of recovery. So the patient retains the right, conferring with his doctor, to decline an offer of assistance, completely in accordance with the Law dealing with the Medical Treatment Agreement (Van Veen 2002), without this leading automatically to a rejection of the argument of hopelessness. It is not just a matter of a lack of new specialist methods of treatment. When these new methods have been exhausted it does not mean that the clinical picture is absolutely unchangeable. We have to be aware of the power of nature and the possibility of spontaneous swings in the clinical picture. Good palliative care and a good framework may effect changes in the picture. Only when, for a long time, and in vain, the physician has tried to accentuate these factors in order to make the suffering somewhat bearable, can we PERSONAL SNIPPETS216speak of hopelessness. On the other hand it is a bad thing to accentuate the time factor and simply wait for a natural death when the suffering remains insupportable. Hopelessness means: the lack of a reasonable solution to make the suffering, and, in so doing, life, bearable. This fits in with the legal stipulation that the doctor, together with his patient, has come to the conclusion that there is no other solution for the patient's situation than euthanasia. The essence of the Euthanasia Act is therefore that in the doctor-patient relationship assisted dying is conditionally legitimate. It is not an enforceable patient's right, no doctor can be obliged to assist. Legislature has chosen this wise solution, on the one hand out of a conditioned respect for the patient's autonomy, on the other hand out of respect for the various medical/ethical opinions within the profession. The law guarantees that the difficult assessments that have to be made by the psychiatrist, especially of the aspect of hopelessness, are to be accounted for to a forum of fellow professionals. Conclusion Assistance in suicide, the ultimate resource in psychiatry, legally admissible since 2002, has recently become legitimised in practice. The release of death is from now on also within the reach of psychiatric patients, which means the emancipation of the psychiatric patient and of psychiatry itself. Psychiatrists are faced with the task of making this assistance accessible within the framework of law, jurisprudence and guidelines. Naturally this does not mean that the physician should unquestioningly endorse requests for the termination of life. Care requirements are focused on determining insupportable suffering, on the protracted search for new options for treatment, and only when these are found to be absent on the recognition of the hopelessness of the suffering. If this path is followed the psychiatrist who assisted in the suicide will be able to look forward to accounting for his actions in a procedure which is not unduly burdensome. A categorical rejection of assisting in suicide in psychiatry will mean a denial of the autonomy of psychiatric patients and of the tenor of the Euthanasia Act. The introduction of an obligation to motivate the decision not to honour the request for assistance will in more cases lead to due recognition of the patient's autonomy.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell217Literature Chabot, B.E.(2000), The request assistance in suicide bij zelfdoding) Psychiatry Magazine (Tijdschrift Inspectie voor de Geestelijke Volksgezondheid) (1993) The procedure for Schudel, W.J., Heide, A. van der (1997).

Many psychiatrists are wary of providing this assistance due to unfamiliarity with the procedure that must be followed and the criteria for responsible actions. AIM To provide an overview of the procedure and the relevant criteria when a psychiatrist considers a request for assistance in suicide. METHOD Analysis of law, jurisprudence and medical ethics and of particular problems that occur in the case of psychiatric patients. RESULTS We describe the developments in law and psychiatric practice towards broader recognition of the patient's autonomy. Assessing the patient's competence and the lack of prospects for insupportable suffering is the focal point in decision making. CONCLUSION Psychiatrist-assisted suicide may occur more frequently, now that procedures and criteria have become available fitting in with the legal system.

Brouwers (1) A. J. M. Loonen (2) E.M.C. Groenewoud-van Nielen (1) T. Tilburg University 2 Rijks Universiteit Groningen Introduction With the advent of more scientists in the arena of the criminal trial more clarity about the circumstances or the cause of a violent offence is not an automatic result. Among other things this has to do with the interpretation of the facts by various disciplines, each with their own thought patterns, methods and testing procedures. For the court to be able to get an overall impression, it must at least be aware of the methods of the various expert witnesses and actors (public prosecutor, accused and behavioural expert, medical specialist) in order to arrive at a meaningful integration. Here we discuss a case in which several experts were heard, who each from their own notional framework reported to the court, and where the court had to arrive at a vision and verdict in relation to the facts and opinions offered. Oei1 thinks that the notional frameworks the various parties use during the trial differ. In his opinion the legal, the behavioural and the judicial relationship frameworks apply. To start with the judicial framework, Oei thinks that the accused uses the following order (of thought): offence, possible disorder, danger of re-offending and possible treatment. With the added comment that the accused often (erroneously) thinks that there is no disorder whatsoever. Also in those cases, however, it is possible to discuss the desired treatment with the accused. He scores positive points with the court when showing a willingness for treatment. In this way the accused hopes to escape an unconditional prison sentence or court order, but 'to get off' with a suspended sentence under the special condition of being treated by an institution or expert appointed by the court. Furthermore, when there is no disorder, the possible danger or re-offending cannot be attributed to 1 T.I. Oei, (Un)accountability and the Forensic System. The European Journal of Psychiatry , 2000, 14(2), 104-110.PERSONAL SNIPPETS222the disorder. But without a disorder there is no unaccountability and no exemption of culpability. However, Oei thinks the lawyer uses a slightly different order: possible offence, possible disorder, danger of re-offending if there is a disorder, accountability and meting out of punishment. The facts committed by the accused must first be legally proven and the facts must also be punishable. The behavioural expert's framework shows the following aspects: possible disorder, then the relationship with the possible offence, determination of accountability, possible danger of re-offending as a result of the disorder and possibilities for treatment. In the determination of accountability the following questions come up: 1 Was there a pathological disorder at the time the punishable offence was committed, 2 If yes, is the causal relationship between the disorder and the punishable offence adequately plausible, 3 If yes, what assessment should be given to accountability -in the light of the first two questions and all circumstances of the case? A disorder contributes to recidivism in this point of view, whereas in the pattern of questions of the behavioural expert, the question of recidivism is only asked after the question about a relevant disorder. Before this Brouwers, Drost and Oei2 already concentrated on the question whether medication can have undesired effects or may even give rise to violent behaviour. By taking the medication a temporary disorder occurs causing the person to behave differently than usual, but without that particular drug there is no disorder and no offence nor any danger of re-offending. On the basis of a case (LJN: BK4178) which concerns a well- considered, instrumental form of violence, the question arose whether a drug, in particular an anti depressant, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) can cause a temporary mental disorder leading to a violent offence. Description of the case The woman had been suffering from bouts of depression since 1996, for which she received medicinal treatment every time, since 2003 with the drug paroxetine (SSRI). She also suffered a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage, the exact location of which was never determined. Since June 2008 she was once more in a seriously depressed state and on 6 August the locum prescribed once again paroxetine 20 milligrammes once daily. This prescription was not filled by her. When she consulted the locum she had discussed her need of psychological aid and her daughter very much wished she would accept this kind of assistance. She had promised her daughter she would agree to 2 R.C. Brouwers, M. Drost & T.I. Oei, Medicatie en crimineel gedrag, and Criminal Behaviour) in: L. de Vos, K. Venselaar & G. 159-173.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell223this kind of treatment, but only after discussing it with her own GP, which was the reason why she had not yet taken the prescribed drug. On September 3 she consulted her own GP and as in the meantime no improvement had been seen in her depressive complaints the prescribed dose of paroxetine was augmented to 20 milligrams twice daily. Arriving home, for unknown reasons, she started at once with three tablets of paroxetine and also two tablets of oxazepam. The following day she took two more pills of paroxetine, but no more oxazepam. In the night of 4 and 5 September, after midnight, the woman met her daughter at Schiphol Airport. Her daughter inquired after the discussion with the GP. She said she had chosen the drug and not the psychological assistance, unlike her earlier promise to her daughter. The daughter got very cross with her. This conflict created a bad atmosphere in the home and after her husband and her daughter had gone off to bed, she was very shaken and sad. She sat on her settee and was caught by the overwhelming feeling that she did not want to live any more. At the same time she felt that she could not cause the grief about her suicide on her husband and daughter and she decided to take them with her in death. She then made fairly extensive preparations of her farewell and subsequently went looking in the home for a means to kill them with: she found an axe in the garage. She struck her husband in the head several times and then thought: \"two more to go\", meaning herself and her daughter. After having killed her daughter as well, she tried to commit suicide by running her car into a tree. She had by then already called the emergency number (4.59 am) and announced that she had committed murder. She got wounded in the collision with the tree and was taken to hospital. At 9.05 am blood samples were taken, which were later analysed by the NFI (Dutch Forensic Institute). In the blood traces (< 10 ng/ ml whole blood) of paroxetine were found. There are plenty of questions concerning this case, for instance: what is the function of paroxetine in the violent acts, is it dominant, monocausal, contributory (facilitating), is the contribution of paroxetine dose-dependent, how quickly do changes occur, can a temporary mental disorder be caused by it, are there differences in result on impulsive or instrumental violence? We will first discuss the relationship SSRI and violence SSRIs and violence By means of spontaneous discussions of cases attention is drawn to important hitherto unknown side effects of drugs3. Whether there is The role of causality in pharmacovigilance, Drug Safety , 1997, 17, p. 374-389.PERSONAL SNIPPETS224a causal relationship between the use of the drug and the phenomenon observed cannot be directly deduced from this. Mostly a scientific proof is not regarded as strongly necessary: identifying the possibility brings about attentiveness after the drug in question has been prescribed. Only very rarely do we see direct contrasts in the opinions of the various experts. Such contrasts do, however, occur in the question whether anti-depressants in general and SSRIs in particular may give rise to suicide and violence. An additional complicating factor is formed by reports that especially children and young people are susceptible4 5 6. The possible relationship between the use of SSRIs and violence have especially been searchingly reported by Healy, Herxheimer en Menkes 7. In addition the Internet site www.ssristories.com lists over two hundred cases in which murder, suicide and an anti-depressant go hand in hand. To the Dutch Side Effects Centre Lareb ( www.lareb.nl ) 24 cases were reported until June 2009 in which the use of an SSRI and aggression coincide (8 cases of Paroxetine, 5 cases of Citalopram, 4 cases of Fluoxetine, 4 cases of Fluvoxamine, 2 cases of Escitalopram and case Lareb reports suggest a possible relation between SSRI's and aggression. WHO data support the association. Special attention is asked for this association, considering the nature of the adverse drug reaction and the possible consequences. Relationship between SSRI's and violence (suicide, homicide) cannot be excluded\". In spite of these reports the chance of the occurrence of violence (suicide, homicide) brought about by the use of anti-depressants must be considered to be extremely small8 9 10 11. 4 U.

It is especially about the area of tension between not- demonstrable and non-existent that feathers sometimes get ruffled. The mechanism of SSRI-induced aggression incidents It has not been proved that the use of an SSRI may give rise to the occurrence of an aggression incident, but it is plausible. This is in line with knowledge gained by general experience, that the use of psychoactive substances (the best known example is alcohol) may give rise to the occurrence of aggression incidents. SSRIs are psychoactive substances and affect the nature and the intensity of emotional processes (e.g. anger). This knowledge does not conflict with the possibility that under certain circumstances SSRIs are contributory to the occurrence of an aggression incident. With this we mean that the use of the medication plays an important part in the occurrence of the incident under prevalent conditions and at that particular moment. Without the use of the drug, the occurrence of the phenomenon, e.g. aggression, outburst of anger, outburst of violence, amuck etc. would have been considerably less likely. What is the mechanism that triggers aggression? The initial idea was that aggression was the result of disinhibiting suicidal impulses: the depressive disorder goes together with suicidal desires and plans, but also with inhibitions, which stops the suicide from taking place. By the treatment with anti-depressants the activity level of the patient is improved before improving his mood. Because inhibitions disappear some people come to suicide during the first phase of the treatment. The biochemical explanatory model pointed at the consequences of various kinds of neurotransmission (adrenerg and serotonerg). The adrenerg effect was thought to be especially important for the impulse ('drive') and the serotonerg for the 'mood'. Later this turned out to be a too simple rendition of the facts. The serotonerg system plays a part in mood, fear as well as aggression. Even a distinct serotonin-dependent subtype of depression has been postulated, which precedes with aggression12. SSRIs appear not just to influence mood. Also SSRIs cause deregulations during the initial phase of treatments or after the treatment has been stopped, as a deprivation symptom. Quite soon after the start of a treatment an increase of fear phenomena (increased jitteriness, impulse outbursts, fear of dying) is identified. Such symptoms may also occur after a sudden end of the treatment. People might become aggressive as a result of this. A second possible explanation for the occurrence of (auto) aggression after the start of the treatment with SSRIs is the side effect akathisia, which is 12 H.M. van Praag, 5-HT-related, anxiety- and/or aggression-driven depression, International , 1994, 9 (supplement 1), p. 5-6.PERSONAL SNIPPETS226the urge to move about and feelings of unrest, not feeling well, inner unrest. There are various ideas about the mechanism through which akathisia triggers aggression. Loonen and Stahl describe a biological mechanism in which akathisia is basically an artificial form of being motivated to get moving13. The patient is uncontrollably provoked into executing certain (aggressive) behaviour. Another idea is that akathisia is a torment to such an extent that people in their desperation become (auto)aggressive. This side effect is especially seen with anti-psychotica, but is a regular feature of SSRIs14 15 16 for instance with fluoxetine with an incidence between 10 to 25 %. Akathisia is also a symptom of a serotonerg syndrome with mental phenomena such as restricted awareness, (auto) aggression, neuro-muscular phenomena and autonomous instability. Two forms of aggression In an attempt to illuminate the mechanism of SSRI-induced aggression we may refer to the existence of two forms of animal aggression: defence and hunt aggression17. Of these two forms of aggression there is also a model in rodents in which anti-depressants have an opposite effect namely inhibition of defensive aggression and the promotion of 'assertive' aggression18. It is postulated that in order to initiate these two forms there are in principle an emotional, affective or 'hot' form of aggression and a cognitive, instrumental or 'cold' one. The emotionally initiated form shows strong resemblance to the fear reaction and is triggered by the almond core of the brain. The emotional component (anger) is primary in this. The cognitively initiated form rests for the main part on a careful analysis of the conditions and is started off and controlled by the prefrontal cortex of the brain or PFC. The emotional component (lust) is secondary in this. The situation in man is more complex than for instance in the cat19 or the rat20 on account of the far greater linguistic skill. In man all sensory information can be replaced by language symbols and aggression can be 13 A.J.M. Loonen & S.M. Stahl. The mechanism 49, p. e28-e38. 15 R.M.

Hansen, A critical review of akathisia, and its possible association with suicidal behaviour. Human Psychopharmacologic Clinical Experiments , 2001, 16, p. 495-505. 17 T.R. Gregg & A.

Because of this and because of the wider development of the prefrontal brain the instructiveness of the cognitive control is greater. In this explanatory model the inhibition of the emotional response and the promotion of the cognitive response are functions of a certain area of the brain, the mPFC21. To put it quite simply: various parts of the brain affect each other's functioning22. The complex serotonerg system affects these structures. There are connections from the brain stem to all brain structures we mentioned before, but also in order to achieve their effects no fewer than 14 different types of receptors23 are used, four of which are associated with the regulation of aggression. When the system is repeatedly over-stimulated adaptation of receptor sensitivity changes the results of stimulation. It is supposed that SSRIs stimulate aggression by inhibiting and stimulating various brain structures. This means simultaneously the occurrence of three different types of response: dysforia (feelings of unease), the facilitation of the hot (emotional) aggression response and the facilitation of the cold (cognitive, instrumental) aggression response. To sum up: there are indications that SSRIs may have a causal relationship with aggressive violent behaviour namely by doing away too early with inhibitions in a depression, by the side effect akathisia and by an inhibiting as well as a stimulating effect on certain areas of the brain thus promoting the emotional and the cognitive aggression response. The importance of the concentration of paroxetine According to the verdict the locum had prescribed once again paroxetine to the woman in a dose of once daily 20 milligrammes (1 tablet), but that she did not fill the prescription. This was confirmed by the fact that the prescription was recovered in the woman's home, and also by the pharmacy's records which showed that no medication had been delivered to the woman between 17 December 2007 and 3 September 2008. In the consultation with her own GP on 3 September 2008 the dose was augmented, because she (the GP) indicated that she had supposed 21 F. Bruinsma & Neurobiology of cognitive and p. 77-86) 22 J.W. and neurochemistry, Loonen, The Agile of the Mental Functions , Badhoevedorp: Mension 2004)PERSONAL SNIPPETS228the 20 milligrammes had not been effective. Had the woman started her medication on 6 August, she would have been taking one tablet daily of the drug for 4 weeks, and there would not have been any improvement after 4 weeks' medication. According to the standard GP guideline24 doubling the dose was then indicated. The woman later testified that she had taken three tablets of paroxetine on 3 September and two more on 4 September. The toxicological analysis by the Dutch Forensic Institute (NFI) showed traces of paroxetine in her blood and the conclusion of the NFI was that the concentration was so low that it could not have influenced her behaviour. But later, during the trial pharmacological experts agree that the conclusion is wrong in several respects. On the basis of one single measuring of whole blood and quite some time after the drug has been ingested, it cannot be determined how high the concentration was quite soon after taking the drug. Furthermore, in the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (occasional) cases are known where normal short-term use was followed by an outburst of violence. If it is so that violence, as a side effect, is linked to the presence in the blood of a relevant quantity of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor25, then her violent behaviour could be explained by the use of the drug. We have to add that only in those cases when at the time of the actions the accused lacked any insight in the scope of her actions and their possible consequences, such a situation could lead to acquittal because intent is lacking in those specific cases. Such cases are rare. Evil intent can then be said to be not proven. Also conditional intent can then be said to be not proven. It must be evident that she did not know and could not know that such consequences might result after taking the drug. However, mostly some insight in the scope of his actions can be found in the accused. The legal practice shows that in such cases an intent defence is often unsuccessful. Sometimes the intent defence is unsuccessful, because own culpability is taken as the starting point. Intent is then assumed on the basis of culpa in verdubbelen. (Dutch General Practitioner Association, depressive disorder, M44, 2003; When insufficiently effective, doubling of dose after four to six weeks) 25 Zo heeft paroxetine een dosis afhankelijk effect op de verwijding van de pupil.

Own culpability might be assumed if it is determined that the accused has taken more medication than was prescribed, and that he also is aware, or can be aware, that a higher dose might lead to committing violence. If in the case under discussion the woman took three tablets on her own accord, because she thought that 'there was no harm in that' and also that she has not heard or read anywhere that there could be harm in that, own culpability is out of the question. But in the case that it was known to the woman that this side effect, in this case violent behaviour, may occur, that she was aware of this, then ingesting the dose can be seen as own culpability and intent can be assumed. The discussion during the trial will then probably be whether or not the side effect is a rare one. If the side effect hardly ever occurs with users of the drug, it is reasonable for the defence to plead that own culpability is out of the question. When the concentration in the blood is of no importance and she never had a similar reaction in previous treatments, taking three tablets instead of the prescribed two cannot be held against her in relation to the violence against her daughter and her husband26. Whether a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage made her more susceptible to an undesired effect of paroxetine is certainly a good question, but in other cases of violence and the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors no description of such an affliction was found. The importance of a delusion In this case the violence was disproportionate and of an instrumental nature, in which the actions were prepared over a longer period of several hours. The decision to do away with herself, and to resort to violence towards her husband and daughter was perhaps impulsively coloured, after the argument with her daughter. We know that there is more attention to negative aspects during a depression and the negative aspects may have received overexposure in the argument causing her judgment to be ultimately impaired. But once the decision was made there was obviously nothing that could bring her to desist. In this case no fewer than seven experts were heard (four behavioural experts, one behavioural toxicologist, one pharmacist and one pharmacologist) and various possible diagnoses were dealt with in the reports and during the trial ( www.rechtspraak.nl/uitspraken , LJN BK4178): delusion, psychosis, delirium, depression, recurrent depression, intoxication, personality disorder, depersonalisation, restricted awareness, lowering of barriers, paradoxical reaction, triggering effect, fear, primitive defence and coping mechanism, suicidality, tunnel vision, sub-arachnoid haemorrhage, organic brain disease, psychotoxic effect. With experts with 26 B.F. Keulen & M. Otte, Opzet Nijmegen: Ars Aequi Libri 1999. PERSONAL SNIPPETS230so many differing opinions it is difficult for the court to find its way through this maze and a review seems to be appropriate. Because it concerns in this case a well-considered instrumental form of violence depersonalisation and a psychosis (delusion) enter the picture. Simply put, in depersonalisation feeling is divorced from cognition and apparently businesslike actions are possible27. Reasons for the occurrence of depersonalisation are severe stress on account of the argument with her daughter, sleep deprivation because of staying up into the small hours and the use of paroxetine. The conviction the accused had to kill herself and her daughter and husband may be qualified as a psychotic condition within the definition of Van der Waard28 : a delusion could best be described as a shuttered unfalsifiable conviction with which the patient feels emotionally related and which is deemed implausible by most others because of the unshakeable certainty with which it is expressed. In the trial the woman testified that she had repeatedly struck first her husband and then her daughter forcefully in the head with an axe in the early hours of the morning29, and that this was the only way for her to do any justice to herself and her family members. There can be no question of intent, if any insight in the scope of the actions and their possible consequences is lacking in a person30. Her attorney maintained that she was not free in the exercise of her will and had been deprived of any insight in the scope of her actions and their possible consequences, because her mental condition at the time of her deed was seriously impaired. According to the court none of the experts had deemed a delusion, psychosis, delirium or similar condition likely. The experts did agree on a recurring depression, but evidently not on a psychotic depression. The question whether paroxetine can cause a delusion or whether during a delusion the use of paroxetine can produce or promote violent behaviour was not answered. The affliction, the drug and the deed Apart from the systems of thought used by the various parties this is the chronological order which is important for the scenario of the offence, if the affliction, or the drug, or both play a part. In this scenario the question functions whether the actions take place under the influence of paroxetine because of changes in certain psychological processes. Paroxetine may affect 27 M. Sierra, Depersonalization, a New Look at a Neglected Syndrome , Cambridge: University Press 2010. 28 R. van der Waard, Wat is een waan? Een fenomenologische beschouwing, , 2006, 48, p. 453- 359. 29 The verdict does not reference to a contusio cerebri (concussion) as a result of running into the tree, and she could obviously remember everything quite well. 30 HR 22 juli 1963, NJ 1968, p. 217.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell231the depression or perhaps it is better to say certain psychological functions during a depression, but there are also indications of influences of SSRIs (which include paroxetine) in the case of healthy volunteers and laboratory animals. The use of paroxetine may affect neuro-physiological functions and the normal thought patterns so that the thought in this case 'not to be able to inflict the grief of her suicide on her husband and daughter and that she had to take them along' could not be tested against the social norm: it is not acceptable to kill a fellow human being. The woman testified herself to have taken paroxetine in the days preceding her act and a low concentration of the drug was found in her blood. Even with low concentrations of paroxetine (or other serotonin reuptake inhibitors) cases are known in which (short term) use was followed by violence and suicide during the first week of the treatment31. The woman had the time and the opportunity to reflect on and to account for the consequences of her intended actions. It is remarkable that obviously in the period that she was preparing her actions the horrible nature of her intentions did not make her correct herself. Apparently he was convinced that her actions would spare more grief. The question is whether she did not experience the appalling nature of her intended actions as such because of the effect of the paroxetine on certain areas of the brain that usually have a correcting effect. There are indications that SSRIs affect neuro-cognitive processes. Almeide and his colleagues32 for instance found that citalopram (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor) had a negative effect with healthy men on the task \"contextual processing\". This concerns a temporary anomaly in the discrimination between new and familiar objects within 24 hours after taking an anti-depressant. Similarly Harmer and her colleagues33 found that healthy volunteers who had not been depressed before showed a diminished response in certain areas of the brain to pictures displaying a threat. What makes this research special was that the time in which the picture was displayed was so short that the testee was not aware of the threatening content and that nevertheless after the use of citalopram the areas of the brain in question responded less fiercely than without the use of citalopram. With people with a depression and a single dose of citalopram, the pictures 31 See for instance the case of Joseph Wesbecker, who, in the morning of 14 September 1989 in Kentucky, USA, shot twelve people while using a serotonin reuptake inhibitor: \"Did prozac make him do it?\" 1994. 32 S. Almeida, D.C. Glahn, S.V. Argyropoulos & S. Frangou, Acute citalopram administration may disrupt contextual information in healthy males, European , & G.M. Goodwin, Antidepressant drug treatment modifies the neural processing of nonconscious threat cues, Biological Psychiatry , 2006, 9, p. 816-820.PERSONAL SNIPPETS232with scary portrayals were perceived less fiercely34. To sum up, a contributory effect is quite well possible and in the first few days of their treatment with an SSRI in certain persons with a depression neuro-cognitive processes may be affected in such a way that feedback of intended behaviour takes place less. Assessing causality The question in our minds is whether a different framework of relationships also leads to a different result? The lawyer takes the action as his starting point. Her attorney argued alternatively that, in view of her mental condition, she should be found completely unaccountable and that this condition does not lie with the assumption of premeditation. The court rejected this argument in its deliberations because firstly even if the fact were not to be attributed to her at all, this then does not automatically lead to the conclusion that she was unable to act with premeditation and secondly that the violent actions were not the result of an immediate impulse which caused her to act without delay. The circumstances outlined by the court show that the accused had the time and the opportunity to consider and to account for the consequences of her intended actions. The question is whether this happened during a pathological condition. The behavioural expert takes the disorder as his starting point. In this case the violence is instrumental and syndromes that may explain instrumental violence must be demonstrated or excluded. Earlier we mentioned akathisia, depersonalisation and delusion, but also depression is of importance where SSRIs may have a causal relationship. SSRI effects have been mentioned of experts, such as a boosting effect or a barrier lowering effect, but these were not considered to be likely explanations for a violent effect of that kind. To sum up: depending on the advice the experts, a wide range of possibilities is presented which only enter the picture when a disorder is suspected and when that disorder is linked to the facts the accused is charged with. When paroxetine has an unknown, recorded, direct effect (distortions of perception, cognitive distortions, depersonalisation, akathisia) but is not dose-dependent, the woman could have been acquitted because intent is lacking. But if the effect turns out to be dose-dependent and she was aware or could have been aware of this, culpability, culpa in causa, enters the picture: an unintended or unpursued effect but nevertheless the result of an initial overdose. If, as an element of the affliction, a (temporary) delusion exists, which is 34 Z. Bhagwagar, P.J. Cowen, G.M. Goodwin & C.J. Harmer, Normalization of enhanced fear recognition by acute ssri treatment in subjects with a previous history of depression, American Journal of Psychiatry , 2004, 161, 166-168.Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell233not caused by the drug, then (possibly) complete unaccountability can be put forward, (possibly) resulting in criminal disposition. If that is not the case and only the affliction depression contributes to the action, she can only be held partly accountable. Should the chance of re-offending be deemed small, detention in a mental hospital as a possible court decision is to be deserted and ordinary punishment remains. A treatment would then still be a possibility. The court might decide to impose a conditional sentence with the special stipulation that the accused undergo treatment. The accused's preparedness to undergo treatment could be discussed in the court. Perhaps, in complex cases such as this, it is advisable for the public prosecutor and the defence attorney to avail themselves of the opportunity (since the introduction of the Act Experts in Criminal Cases) to have pre-trial deliberations with the magistrate about which additional questions regarding content should be dealt with in the report pro justice. When answering the third material question of article 350 and 352 Sv35 as to the punishability and possible exemption from guilt, the court came to the conclusion that the experts agree that there is a certain extent of lessened accountability, but that it has not been determined which element to which extent has been exactly responsible for this and that no circumstance has been deemed likely to completely exclude culpability. We can find this verdict acceptable, because no single factor is in a monocausal relationship to the offence. However, in our opinion greater value should be attached to a contributory psychotoxic effect of the use of medication (SSRIs) and the disorders of judgment and criticism that go along with a depression. Summary Sometimes more than one expert advises the court. They report different opinions about the case they examined. In this case we like to discuss the relation between the use of paroxetine and a fatal tragedy in a family where the mother was accused of killing her husband and daughter a few days after use of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor. More attention must be paid to the mentally debilitating influence of medication on certain psychological functions shortly after intake. Although a monocausal relation is a necessity for a clear verdict we believe that is never the case. Keywords: violence, medication, opinion, judgment. 35 See also: F.A.J.

Oei, MD PhD, emeritus professor of forensic psychiatry at Tilburg University235PSYCHOANALYTIC TREATMENT: SOME PERTINENT CONSIDERATIONS12 T.I. Oei I have written before, that saying goodbye is a process that never ends. What matters is that both parties in an analytical treatment agree that the time to part is a decision mutually arrived at. The treatment to which the analysand (meanwhile, \"the client\") refers has in truth proceeded in this fashion. It is indeed so, that certain matters are fictitious, and that names have also been changed. Ultimately, what mattered most was the evaluation by the analysand, something which has been rather neglected in the literature. I have found it a great privilege that for well over ten years, I have been allowed to conduct this analysis with someone who originally would not even hear of it. Someone who exuded opposition, but who kept coming, at first even to the exact minute, until after nine months the question arose why he acted in this way, i.e., as if he were in fact experiencing no feeling of aversion. It was only after this had been made explicit that he was able to become more aware of his real feelings of opposition. I will now let the analysand/client speak for himself. By now he has become a self-assured, independent person. Although it cannot be determined or proven to what extent the psychoanalysis has been effective, it can be argued that he derives many positive experiences from it; at any rate, more than negative ones. He is also prepared to carefully consider his opinion about this after one, and after five years. The original question The motive for my request for psychic help had in the first instance been determined by the problems surrounding the love relationship I had at the time. In this relationship I, Coenraad Lakenstad, began to recognise the same features which had prevailed in the previous relationship, which had been broken off; namely, a putative \"knowledge\" of infidelity, combined with thoughts of and fantasies about other women, which, thanks to the attendant taboo, became ever more dominant. At the start of the analysis, the current relationship was, in fact, also nearing its end. Looking back it is easy to see that the essential problems originated at greater depth than that of the current love relationship. 1 This is a personal overview, by the analysand, of a psychoanalytical treatment which the author of this brief communication have been allowed to do. Its publication was approved by CL. 2 Published in: Newsletter of the Dutch Psychoanalytic Society , 2012, 27, 1, pp. 17-20.PERSONAL SNIPPETS236 The need , casu quo the self-imposed compulsion for complete control led to a constrained attitude towards life, in which there then barely remained any room for experiencing primary emotions, or even for a free stream of thoughts. I had great fear and aversion against relinquishing this regulated attitude towards life. A strongly rational and intellectualistically formal attitude, displaying some autistic features and combined with a reasonably developed intelligence and verbal dexterity, supplied a powerful means of either regulating feelings and emotions, or, even more frequently, of keeping them away in the subconscious. It has been the great merit of the analysis, at times involving laborious discussions, to work towards awakening to, recognising, articulating and eventually expressing these feelings and emotions. In my opinion this process will never be fully completed. Hopefully, I will also in this context continue to be able to find new ways, and continue to see my feelings, thoughts and behaviour in a different light. External circumstances In the course of the past few years my life has changed markedly in almost all relevant practical aspects. Although it cannot be proven, as far as I am concerned it is obvious that in great part these changes issue from an internal mental foundation, upon which the analysis has obviously had a certain influence. Housing situation Rather than in a nondescript, out-of-the-way little apartment in Slotermeer, I have now lived for almost ten years in a ground-floor apartment with a small backyard in the inner city of Amsterdam. I thus no longer live in isolation, but have immediate access to the city and its public transportation. Looking back, I can hardly believe that I so dreaded making the decision to move to where I now live. Social situation At the start of the analysis, my work consisted of teaching at two music schools. On top of that, in the past seven years I have worked myself up to become the conductor of two military bands and am the regular accompanist of a choir with which I have also made concert tours. These additional activities not only provide considerable extra income, but are also a source of wider social contacts and thus for my development as 'leader' of a group. While, for the execution of these tasks, in the first stages of this development I relied heavily on my supposed intellectual superiority, by now a lively, more personal approach has grown towards members of the orchestras, my public, and the board of directors, resulting in my being more relaxed and self-assured during rehearsals and when conducting. Sometimes Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell237I get the feeling that it is a great privilege to be allowed to function in this way. I also think that I am more realistically aware of how I interact with the group, and of how I am as a person. As far as the lessons at the music schools are concerned, I have been able to develop from a person who first and foremost sought the approval of pupils, parents and colleagues, into someone who through experience and involvement has something to offer and is appreciated and respected because of that. Age awareness Certain things are also related to my awareness of my own age. For a long time I felt younger than the absolute number indicating my age. Subsequent to the infantile notion of infinity that had also been nurtured by my religious background of life-after-death, I have been experiencing great difficulty with a growing sense of the finite character of life. It is true that rationally it was easy to consider that this limited span was a logical necessity of the awareness of time, but emotionally it was a shock to realize that there would be a goodbye. By now I am increasingly able to appreciate the moment itself and to experience the privilege of life more consciously. Along with this goes a realisation of the continual temporariness of experience; a sense which is augmented by the expectation of possible new experiences. The memory of past experiences is therefore a treasure that I can cherish, but to which I do not have to try to hang on in the way that I used to. As a \"brand-new\" 50-year-old, I am much more aware of my present phase in life. Material situation Although perhaps less relevant, my improved material situation also plays its part in my increased self-assurance. Whereas I used to be barely able to make ends meet, and to be deeply in the red at the end of the month, thanks to my additional activities I have become -in the first instance out of sheer necessity- a fiscally independent entrepreneur. Without wanting to term my greater financial scope as an amassing of capital, I can -and more importantly, dare - allow myself a more luxurious life-style today. Often this also makes it easier to make decisions: I have come to know that it is not the end of the world when now and then I make a wrong choice . There is a better considered balance between risk and caution. Social context I still extremely value my autonomy, and am not prepared to give it up. As far as I can see I go through life primarily as a loner. My ties to my family are rather loose and more or less free of obligation. My mother's illness did touch me quite profoundly, and the realisation of my parents' mortality is painful as their old age becomes more apparent. The contacts with the few friends I do have are not very intensive, but I find them heart-warming and comforting.PERSONAL SNIPPETS238 Contacts with colleagues, orchestra members and pupils I find very cordial, but limited by the professional frameworks within which they take place. In a society that is becoming ever more open; in which the code of social conduct is ever more diversely culturally determined and therefore potentially more variable; this limitation within professional frameworks provides me with a clarity within which I do not feel confined, but which on the contrary gives me space in which to shape the expressions of my personal feelings. For the past five years or so I have been in a love relationship with Hanny, an old girl-friend. Even better: an old (albeit onesided) boyhood love. Because she lives in France and has built a professional and social existence there, our relationship features all the LAT characteristics. Every evening we see each other and talk by means of Internet (Skype); and chat about whatever currently holds our attention. On average we meet every six weeks, go on holidays together, and involve each other in our individual social contacts (her parents have been close friends with mine for ages). It probably goes without saying that this form of relationship is also an expression of my seeking a balance between on the one hand my need for contact, and on the other my need for autonomy. There will always be tension between my individuality and that which we have in common. Whereas in any relationship this balance will probably not be fully congruent for both partners, I feel that my present relationship is more viable than the previous ones. The role of psychoanalysis As a client, I often had no idea of how I was doing. Was I making any progress? Was I performing OK? Often a feeling that I had had so frequently as a music student crept up on me: of course you studied, but you never really studied enough, and, as a student, you saw any progress you had made only afterwards; while a realistic view of the learning process was much more difficult. Later I realised that the latter questions were really part of the problem : it was not the achievement that was important. I also had to get used to the idea that I was not being treated by a physician, but that I had to do the major part of the treatment myself. I also found it difficult -certainly in the early stages- to free myself from the notion of an artificial laboratory situation, in which there is supposedly a personal commitment with someone who operates purely professionally. Was it for instance possible for me to love such a person? Have any feelings for him? What did he really feel for me? The unwillingness to 'surrender' to such a person expressed itself in a pattern of absenteeism, either with or without giving notice. It was only after exploration in depth that I was able to see this absenteeism as an aggressive expression of unwillingness. But of course I really did not want to accept that. Forensic Psychiatry in a Nutshell239The practical circumstances of my late-night activities as a clarinet teacher and conductor were naturally not easy to combine with the early morning schedule of the analysis, so that this often provided a ready excuse to cancel. It has been the great merit of my analyst that he remained patient, that wherever necessary he provided room for me not to give up, but at the slightest opportunity indicated to me a direction in which I did not really want to go, and to which I brought all kinds of rational and very sophisticated objections. He summoned the energy to open all registers (varieties of intervention which facilitate analytic possibilities, such as clarification, confrontation, allusion, interpretation, self-disclosure, witticisms, taking as-if positions, converting rational comparisons into sensory situations, bringing in other people's parallel experiences) in order to be able to pinpoint those areas where I could not help but react. In so doing, the approach and context of the analysis have deviated slightly from the original idea of free association in which the analyst hardly speaks at all. When in the final stage the contact became more personal and it dawned on me that my behaviour might influence the feelings of my analyst, I found that at first rather scary, and almost inappropriate for the professional character of the relationship as I imagined it ought to be. But I later found it gave me the scope to experience great congeniality. The moment of goodbye came rather unexpectedly. It seemed to be somewhat extrinsically induced and based on my analyst's approaching retirement. It was fitting that he gave me the room to decide myself on the exact moment for reducing the frequency of our contacts. It would have been much easier for me if he had indicated when things were finished. Now I had to make a decision myself. As I myself did not have any realistic idea regarding the course of the tension span of the analysis over the years, in mutual agreement we fixed the date on the 'official' day of his retirement. But exactly that fixing of the date gave the analysis a final dynamism of its own: for the first time I became aware of a life after analysis, in which I would be facing everything on my own. And I was struck by an awareness of goodbye, of the temporariness of it all. In addition I then felt something which for a long time had evaded my conscious awareness, i.e. that the analysis had also functioned as an emotional safety net, as a counsellor and a sounding board for my actions. This made me more aware of the parental and educational role of psychoanalytic treatment. This goodbye will hopefully also mean that in a sense I have reached maturity.
