DOCTOR OF ACUPUNCTURE AND CHINESE MEDICINE Dr. Irina Logman Dr. Irina Logman, DACM, LAc has been practicing acupuncture for over 16 years, and is a New York & Florida State licensed Doctor of Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), National Board Certified in Acupuncture & Chinese Herbs. Dr. Logman graduated in the top 1% of her class from the industry-leading Pacific College of Oriental Medicine in New York City. Prior to completing her doctoral degree in the field, Dr. Logman received her B.S. in Health Sciences from Hunter College where she earned a Certificate of Excellence majoring in Medical Laboratory Science with courses such as hematology, pathology, and immunology. Her lifelong interest in medicine and holistic wellness has made her an expert in diagnosing and effectively treating each patient's unique, idiosyncratic conditions. Dr. Logman is a firm believer that treatment therapies of traditional medicine combined with the technological advances of its modern Western counterpart powerfully complement one another, successfully increasing the chances of treating many disorders. As a continuous learner, she stays up to date in modern biomedical advancements and new topics in medicine & health by attending professional events and workshops. Advanced Holistic Center was founded to share Dr. Logman's passion for medicine, and provide the most complete and effective healing experiences for her patients. As she was pursuing her medical degree, Dr. Logman realized that there was a large gap between what she was learning in her studies and the more encompassing support she wanted to provide her patients. It was clear to see that while many individuals benefited from medical intervention, there were still many others whose care and treatment fell short of an optimal prognosis. All too often there are side effects from medications, risks associated with surgeries, and challenges in effectively treating chronic diseases. As Dr. Logman searched for answers, and learned more about the wide array of medical practices all over the world, she discovered the rich history of ancient Chinese medicine. Curious about how Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has, for millennia, treated mild to severe medical conditions, she further explored this fascinating style of holistic medicine to see what could be gleaned from its implementation. Dr. Logman was immediately captivated by how comprehensive the diagnoses and treatments were. Impressed with its results, she built on her western medicine background and integrated the holistic mind-body treatment style that she had always wanted to provide to her patients. Dr. Logman entered into the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine and completed her Masters in Traditional Oriental Medicine (MSTOM), subsequently earning a Doctorate degree in Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine (DACM). She was thrilled to offer her patients alternative therapies such as acupuncture and Chinese herbs, to treat the root causes of disease instead of just the symptoms, thereby treating the patient as a whole. Believing that every moment is an opportunity to grow and learn from others, Dr. Logman is grateful for the knowledge that she has acquired from her personal experiences, her colleagues and patients. Together with her team, she is eager to share her vast knowledge of effective treatments for a wide range of medical conditions. The thoughtful combination of immersion and education enables Dr. Logman to foster an atmosphere of high-quality empathic care, and effective treatment to all patients at the Advanced Holistic Center. *The services and offerings are provided by Advanced Holistic Center, an independent third-party consultant.
