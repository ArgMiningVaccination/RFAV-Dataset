This report describesthe outcomes of this meeting. The meeting was jointlyorganized by the World Health Organization (WHO),the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS(UNAIDS), and the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise(GHVE) Regional Consultation on Expanding AIDSVaccine Research and Development Capacity in Asia. Sixty-eight participants (Supplementary Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/COHA/A2) and observers gath-ered together from 16 countries, including Australia,Cambodia, China, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, theNetherlands, the Philippines, the Russian Federation,Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, USA, andVietnam. The meeting was highly relevant for the Asian region at a time when the HIV epidemic is still rampant despiteconcerted efforts by governments, communities, scien-tists, and key stakeholders to stem its impact and advance.A great deal of work has been undertaken toward an AIDS vaccine over the past 15 years and the region has theessential assets to move the agenda forward. Genesis of the 2009 Beijing meeting In 1998, the rst Asian meeting specically devoted toAIDS vaccine research and development was convenedby WHO-UNAIDS and the Japanese National Instituteof Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Tokyo, Japan. In 2006,the regional strategy concept was revisited at the rstWHO-UNAIDS regional consultation, ExpandingCapacity and Accelerating AIDS Vaccine Developmentin Asia, hosted and coorganized by the University of Hokkaido, Sapporo, Japan. The seven recommendations of the 2006 Sapporo meeting were as follows. First, createforums to facilitate interactions between funders anddiscuss funding opportunities, funding streams, and fun-der capabilities. Second, facilitate linkages betweenresearch and development (R&D), innovation and dis-covery, in particular in emerging countries with stronginnovation capacity, such as China, India, and Thailand, and clinical trial capacity and production. Third, provide a forum for coordination of regional expertise, capacitybuilding, and technical assistance. Fourth, promote advo-cacy and communication support for region-specicstrategies. Fifth, contribute to and promote the imple-mentation of the Scientic Strategic Plan of the GHVE.Sixth, prepare for future deployment of a vaccine bydiscussing regional approaches to ensure access, delivery capacity, demand estimates, epidemiology, vaccine characteristics, and strategies for delivery. Seventh,create a regional harmonization or regional authorityfor regulatory interactions, including regional licensurereview and regional ethics committees with an initial'core' working group. To effectively implement and further facilitate the recommendation to develop an ongoing forum for coordi- nation of regional expertise, capacity building, andtechnical assistance, the establishment of AVAN wasproposed. 1746-630X Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins DOI:10.1097/COH.0b013e32833c95c1In February 2009, the Chinese AIDS Vaccine Initiative (CAVI), GHVE, and WHO-UNAIDS convened a follow-up meeting in Beijing, China to speed up implementa-tion of recommendations of the Sapporo consultation. Objectives of the 2009 Beijing meeting The objectives of the 2009 Beijing meeting (beyondthose established in Sapporo in 2006) were: (1) to dene steps and milestones for implementation of recommendations of the 2006 Sapporo consultation; (2) to constitute an AVAN Task Force, dene its objec- tives, modus operandi, timeframes, and benchmarks; (3) to review the current status of the HIV epidemic in Asia and the rationale for an AIDS vaccine; (4) to review the progress in HIV vaccine R&D and implications of the latest ndings, with emphasison achievements, gaps, and opportunities for Asia; (5) to discuss challenges for engaging countries and communities in expanding preclinical and clinical trials, as well as increasing the regulatory and man- ufacturing capacity to accelerate the development ofAIDS vaccines in Asia; (6) to dene the milestones for the development of a regional HIV vaccine strategy in alignment with theGHVE's Scientic Strategic Plan. Expected outcomes of the 2009 Beijing meeting The expected outcomes of this meeting were ve-fold.First, provide updated data on the HIV epidemic andAIDS vaccine R&D landscape in Asia. Second, identifyopportunities for regional collaboration and networking.Third, identify challenges and common strategies forbuilding regional capacity in Asia. Fourth, to provide aroadmap for the constitution of the AVAN Task Force, itsterms of reference, objectives, timeframe, and bench- marks. Fifth, the exchange of information and coordi- nated strategic plans between global, regional, andcountry representatives. Expected deliverables of the 2009 Beijing meeting Three key expected deliverables of this meeting wereformulated. First, a report suitable for publication will beprepared for the current meeting containing updated information on the state of the global and regional HIV epidemic and HIV vaccine R&D, summary of dis-cussions, and recommendations on addressing regionalchallenges and activities in support of advocacy for HIVvaccine R&D. Second, there is to be broad disseminationof the meeting outcomes and advocacy messages insupport of HIV vaccine R&D in Asia at national andinternational levels. Third, recommendations to dene a roadmap for the development of a regional HIV vaccine strategy, priorities, and activities in alignment with theGHVE Scientic Strategic Plan will be developed by theAVAN Task Force.HIV prevention technologies HIV prevention technologies were reviewed during themeeting, with a particular emphasis on how AIDS vaccinescould be integrated once available. Effective HIV preven- tion interventions are available, but there is a need for increased efforts to strengthen management systems andservices. New HIV prevention technologies, such as PrEP,have shown promising results in animal and human stu-dies. Innovative approaches to studying new preventiontechnologies in high HIV prevalence settings and popu-lations should be undertaken. Applied and clinicalresearch on new prevention tools, including for popu- lation-based application of antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs, will need to be accelerated. Various new pre-vention tools should be envisaged as working together toprevent HIV. In general, a better understanding of theshortcomings of primary prevention programs will guidethe introduction of new prevention technologies. The NIAID/National Institutes of Health strategy and current vaccine efforts Simpler standard vaccine approaches, such as using inac- tivated or attenuated viruses, do not appear to beapplicable to AIDS vaccine discovery (or to other chronicinfections - tuberculosis, malaria, etc.). Therefore, theeld needs to foster the development of new avenuestoward vaccine discovery based on deeper understandingof immunological and pathogenic mechanisms. An improved understanding of antibody effector functions is needed. There is a need for a rational development ofappropriate immunogens and better understanding ofmucosal transmission, viral pathogenesis, manipulationof immune responses, including innate immunity, B-celland T-cell regulation and function, proliferation, matu-ration, and phenotypes. New strategies for vaccine dis-covery include reverse vaccinology, systems biology, exploitation of novel technologies such as genomic associations, siRNA, and in-vitro 'vaccination'. There isa need for innovation, the mining of nascent knowledgein related elds, and counterintuitive thinking. Priorities for future research Priorities for future research that may lead to both newtherapeutic and vaccine strategies include early events during the acute phase of infection, HIV reservoirs, inter- action between viral factors and cellular partners, andcoinfections. There is a need to shift from a 'polarized'to an 'integrated' vaccine research approach, consideringboth the innate, and the B-cell and T-cell components ofimmunity, including at the mucosal level. There needs tobe a return to basic science to better understand earlypathogenic mechanisms and basic immunology. The Global HIV vaccine enterprise GHVE is an alliance of independent organizations dedi-cated to accelerating the development of a preventive436 Special articleAIDS vaccine. Its creation was motivated by a wide- spread recognition of an urgent need to create a globalapproach to address the challenges of AIDS vaccineR&D that transcends individual funders, countries, researchers, and civil society. Central to GHVE's mission is promoting more efcient, faster ways for funders andresearchers to share successes and failures and to avoidduplication of efforts. GHVE is a catalyst charged withbringing fresh thinking to the eld and creating a colla-borative and open approach to the R&D that is necessaryto develop an AIDS vaccine. GHVE serves as a neutralconvener, catalyst, and honest broker; mobilizes support for increased resources; targets signicant new resources to priority areas; promotes collaboration and coordination;encourages efcient ways of information sharing; devel-ops and maintains the GHVE Scientic Strategic Plan. The AIDS vaccine for Asia network The mission of AVAN is to 'accelerate the developmentof an AIDS vaccine through expanding capacity for allaspects of AIDS vaccine research and development'. The creation of AVAN is timely as AVAN will promote the development of vaccines targeted toward the virus sub-types prevalent in the region. The group will be encour-aged to participate in multinational clinical trials and,therefore, consider regional harmonization of regulatorypolicies and community engagement. The AVAN group'sresearch strengths will contribute to diversifying scien- tic approaches and attract the very best minds to AIDSvaccine research. We envisage that AVAN will provide aunied and strong regional voice in global forums. HIV epidemics in the Asian region The total population of Asia is approximately 4 billionpeople (i.e. just over 60% of the world population). Morethan 500 million people are considered to be withinat-risk populations for HIV infection, including youth,injecting drug users (IDUs), sex workers, men who havesex with men (MSM), and mobile populations. More than 5 million people have already been infected with HIV across the region, though the epidemic is highly variableacross different countries, communities, and populations(www.unaids.org). Asian HIV epidemics are driven primarily by unsafe sex and injecting drug use and are, therefore, currently con-centrated in groups with higher risk of HIV infection. The epidemic is also slowly spreading to the general population (see Fig. 1). Although some spectacularresults have been achieved following the scaling up ofavailable HIV prevention strategies in some countriesand groups (www.unaids.org), the level of prevention,care, and treatment coverage among most risk-associatedAIDS vaccine for Asia network Rerks-Ngarm et al. 437 Figure 1 HIV-1 epidemic across Asia (2008 gures) The estimated numbers of HIV-infected people across countries in Asia are shown, both as absolute numbers and as a proportion of the population. Data from Kaiser Family Foundation.groups remains dismally low. For example, signicant increases in the number of new HIV infections areexpected to occur across the region among MSM. The geographic distribution of HIV subtypes and circulat- ing recombinant forms (CRFs) is relatively homogeneous, but varies by subcontinent: CRF_07B'/C and CRF01_AE in [2]; and CRF01_AE insouth-east Asia [3] (see Fig. 2). Some aspects of the variousepidemics can be explained by how founder viruses spreadamong dened risks groups. HIV strains within Asiancountries will evolve differently from those in other popu-lations owing to genetic differences such as human leu-kocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. Unfortunately, HIV incidence data are relatively scarce and need to be bol- stered for optimal planning of vaccine studies. The othermain factors influencing AIDS vaccine development in theregion include the distribution of multiple HIV subtypesand CRFs, the various modes of HIV transmission in theregion, diverse host genetics, as well as the disparate social, cultural, and political contexts in the region. How theseinterrelated factors will affect the R&D of AIDS vaccinesacross the region is unpredictable, but they are signicantconsiderations in the design of future studies. The com-plexity of the epidemic in the region poses substantial challenges, but also affords tremendous opportunities for AIDS vaccine development. Current efforts in AIDS vaccine research and development in Asia Signicant basic and clinical AIDS vaccine R&D efforts are already underway across the Asian region, withmany notable achievements (see Tables 1 and 2) [4-26]. Several Asian countries now have national HIV-related vaccine plans and strategies. Further harmonization andconsolidation of efforts will result in more productiveassociations and acceleration of vaccine R&D.438 Special article Figure 2 Regional distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants The relative proportion of each subtype/recombinant is shown in the pie chart for each country. Data from WHO/AIDS.Thailand AIDS vaccine activities have a long and full history in Thailand, starting from the mid-1990s [27]. This situationreflects a strong political will to invest in AIDS vaccineR&D to stem the epidemic in Thailand. The experiencein Thailand offers a good example of what can beachieved with international collaboration. Specically, Thailand has conducted phase I, II, and III trials with the AIDSVax gp120 B'/E vaccine, as well as studies ofother candidate vaccines (see Table 1) [5 /C15].Important phase II and, more recently, phase III trials the ALVAC (canarypox, vCP1521) and AIDSVAXgp120 B/E prime-boost regimens have results of this trial (called 'RV 144'), pre-sented at the AIDS Vaccine Conference in 2009, showeda modest (31%), but signicant ( P\u00bc0.04) reduction in new HIV infections; this result was from the modied intent-to-treat dataset. This landmark result is the rst time an AIDS vaccine has exhibited protection againstHIV acquisition, though there was some controversyAIDS vaccine for Asia network Rerks-Ngarm et al. 439 Table 1 AIDS vaccine trials across Asia to date Country Vaccine Sponsor Subtype Phase/time MVA, modied vaccin Infectious Diseases; PrEP, pre-exposure prophylaxis; SOP, standard operating procedure.

There were 74 new HIV infections among the 8198 placeborecipients compared with 51 of the 8197 participants whoreceived the vaccine regimen [9 /C15/C15]. Further research will now be required to understand the mechanisms of induc- tion of immune protection and to further improve vaccineefcacy. In addition, the retention of more than 16 000volunteer base for this phase III trial (the largest con-ducted to date) was 96%. The Thailand experience in successfully conducting two phase III efcacy trials has provided world-class expertise in collaborative teamwork, community engagement activities, good clinical practice (GCP) and ethical com-pliance, sample repositories and good laboratory prac-tices, volunteer retention strategies, and large-scale datamanagement approaches. China China's AIDS vaccine scientists have recently formed the CAVI supported by the Government of China. The initiative includes projects aimed at cohort development,vaccine vector design, establishment of clinical trial units,a manufacturing facility using principles of good manu-facturing practice (GMP), a primate center, a humanizedmouse center, and technical platforms encompassingboth neutralizing antibody and T-cell expertise. Chinese governmental research programmes and scien- tists have signicantly invested in AIDS vaccine research.National AIDS vaccine research before 2007 consisted ofphase I trials with gp120 protein vaccines in 1993 and aDNA/MVA (modied vaccinia Ankara) trial in 2005-2006 (Table 1). Phase I trials on a DNA and Tiantanstrain of vaccinia virus vectors (replication-competent)are ongoing and proceeding toward phase II testing. Preclinical studies with DNA and modied Tiantan strain of vaccinia virus as well as DNA, vaccinia andadenovirus vector approaches are also currently ongoing[10,17,18]. China's AIDS vaccine programme now hassubstantial capacity in primate centers, vaccine pro-duction capacity, and clinical trial sites that will facilitatefurther R&D in the region. India AIDS vaccine trials have accelerated signicantly in Indiain recent years. Activities include an adenoassociatedvirus vector phase I trial, MVA vector vaccine trials[12,28], and a recent DNA/MVA phase I prime-boosttrial initiated in 2009 [15]. The International AIDSVaccine Initiative (IAVI) is supporting Indian AIDSvaccine clinical trials and applied research on neutralizing antibody immunogens. Exploration of several novel con- cepts, including prime-boost regimens with CD40Ladjuvants [19] as well toward developmentof improved Env-based immunogens, is also progressing.Improved awareness of AIDS vaccine issues, training of staff, and development of trial sites have substantiallyimproved with the conduct of AIDS vaccine research andclinical trials in India. Australia Australia has long-standing capacities in biomedical HIVresearch and clinical trial activities. A consortium termedthe Australia-Thai HIV Vaccine Consortium conductedtwo recent trials, rst in Sydney and then in Bangkok, ofa DNA prime fowlpox virus boost vaccine using both B and CRF01_AE strains [15]. Australia was a clinical trial site of the adenovirus-based efcacy (STEP) trialthat was not efcacious. Through collaborations withinAustralia, vaccine candidates are emerging.These include peptide-based vaccines, gp140 immuno-gens, recombinant influenza vectors, and particle-basedvaccine strategies [21,29]. In addition, improved andsimpler assays are emerging [30,31]. These scientic approaches could beaccelerated into expanded clinical trials in future collabo-rations across the Asian region. Japan Japan has developed a pipeline of promising AIDSvaccine candidates. These toward clinical trialdevelopment in collaboration with Thailand groups. Inaddition, novel Sendai virus vectors are being developedwith the opportunity to deliver vaccines mucosally toinduce mucosal immunity [23]. Sendai virus vectorscombined with DNA vaccine candidates are movingtoward clinical trials in collaboration with IAVI. Vaccine development infrastructure and capacity building in Asia Several international groups have provided high-level support for AIDS vaccine activities in the Asian region.Further expansion of this collaborative support will becritical in progressing future vaccine development efforts. Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences- United States Military HIV Research Program The Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences-United States Military HIV Research Program(AFRIMS-USMHRP), Bangkok, Thailand has made sig-nicant achievements in building capacity for highlyspecialized laboratories including in assessment of theHIV-specic humoral and cellular immune responses, including multiparameter flow cytometry; internationally accredited clinical laboratory facilities; specimen proces-sing and archiving; HLA typing capability, and highthroughput genotyping assays. The Walter Reed Army440 Special articleInstitute of Research, of the USMHRP, in collaboration with the Royal Thai Army, has sponsored and facilitatedseveral clinical trials, including the RV144 efcacy trial ofan ALVAC prime and VaxGen envelope protein-boost regimen in Thailand. Several areas have been identied as in urgent need of infrastructure and capacity building for cohort develop-ment and future vaccine trials. These include rapidtesting and dening incident infections (including novelPCR techniques), central laboratories in country to per-form validated assays for vaccine trials, participation in external quality control programs, capabilities to perform full-length single genome sequencing and analysis fromplasma RNA, and development of novel to studyhost genetics and antibody-dependent cellular cyto-toxicity assays. NIAID Division of Acquired Immunodeciency Syndrome The NIAID Division of Acquired Immunodeciency Syndrome (DAIDS) of the National Institutes of Health(NIH) supports basic, preclinical, and clinical research ofcandidate AIDS vaccines through its Vaccine ResearchProgram (VRP). DAIDS has supported clinical and basicresearch across many countries throughout the region.There are several minimum requirements for trials forwhich DAIDS does not hold the Investigational New Drug (IND) Application. First, there needs to be ade- quate site capacity in terms of infrastructure and stafng.Second, political support for conducting AIDS vaccinetrials must be present. Third, support from local institu-tions, communities, and nongovernmental institutionsmust be present. Fourth, there must be investigatorexpertise and ability to coordinate large clinical researchefforts and to work with high-risk populations. Finally, there must be adequate laboratory and pharmacy facili- ties and expertise. International AIDS vaccine initiative IAVI Collaborative Research Centers are located in east-ern Africa (Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda) and southern Africa(South Africa, Zambia) and in India. IAVI has committedto supporting vaccine R&D, including clinical trial capacity building along with policy and preparedness activities in both India and China. These research centersare engaged in coordinating two long-term efforts:vaccine candidate R&D and developing trial capacity.This parallel development is essential for speed andefcacy. IAVI observational clinical research studies have four broad aims. First, to develop capacity and infrastructure to conduct AIDS vaccine trials. Second, to understand theepidemiology and trial participants' health issues. Third,to understand the nature of newly transmitted virus andimmune mechanisms of HIV control. Fourth, to engage the community in AIDS vaccine R&D. These aims are achieved through building site-specic and country-specic capacity to support clinical research, working with vulnerable populations, building advisorymechanisms with leaders from multiple sectors and pro-moting coordination at multiple levels. Accreditationschemes are in place and most of the clinical researchcenters are now fully accredited. A particular emphasis isgiven to clinical research staff training in GCP, goodclinical laboratory practice (GCLP), laboratory techniques, gender sensitization, data management, communication, accounting and reporting procedures, advocacy andcommunity mobilization, and team management. Since2000, IAVI has completed 18 trials, enrolled more than1000 volunteers, more than half of them in Africa andIndia. HIV vaccine trials network The mission of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network(HVTN) is to enhance the discovery, and drive thedevelopment, of a safe and globally effective vaccinefor the prevention of HIV through well designed clinicalresearch, which objectively and ethically addresses thecritical questions of the eld. The HVTN has a numberof research sites around the world and will be lookingtoward Asian sites in the coming years. The recent clinical research achievements by HVTN are illustrated by the initiation and follow-up of the STEP and Phambiliphase IIb trials, expanded laboratory programs, and appli-cation of new analytical techniques. As a result of theoutcome of the STEP trial in 2008, the priorities of thescientic agenda have shifted to account for new infor-mation and to meet new challenges. These prioritiesinclude to better understand the outcome of data from STEP and Phambili trials and to use these data to help dene and evaluate conceptual improvements in T-cell-based vaccines, and to foster an iterative process betweenhuman and nonhuman primate studies that should allowthe eld to dene such conceptual improvements.Several new clinical trials are planned. To ll the gaps in our understanding, upcoming trials will address a series of questions. First, do mixtures of vaccines result in antigenic competition? Second, willpriming and boosting with heterologous adenovirus vec-tor the magnitude, epitope breadth, and character ofthe immune responses? Third, does separating the site ofvaccination increase the immunogenicity? Fourth, whatare the behavioral, epidemiologic, and biologic factors ofHIV infection among IDUs in Xinjiang, China? Fifth, what are the virological factors associated with HIV transmission in the Phambili study? Finally, how canthe HVTN assist in the development of a global systemsbiology approach to vaccinology?AIDS vaccine for Asia network Rerks-Ngarm et al. 441Regional emerging diseases intervention The Regional Emerging Diseases Intervention (REDI) is an intergovernmental organization jointly sponsored bySingapore and the USA, whose mission is to enhance the region's capability and capacity to effectively monitor, detect, and respond to naturally occurring infectiousdiseases outbreaks or man-made health threats. It offerstraining and research focusing on avian influenza, den-gue, chikungunya, hand, foot and mouth disease(HFMD), and HIV. Many of REDI's activities relatedto disease outbreak have relevance to the planning andconduct of AIDS vaccine studies. Other international initiatives The Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery (CAVD),supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, hasan active network of HIV researchers across the world andwill also be looking toward enhancing research on AIDSvaccines in Asia in the coming years. The EuroVaccnetwork of AIDS vaccine researchers in Europe is eval- uating HIV strains sourced from China with a view to further clinical trials in the region. WHO-UNAIDS andGHVE are actively engaged in policy development,clinical trial and research capacity strengthening, assist-ing the development of national AIDS vaccine plans andproviding a global umbrella for AIDS vaccine develop-ment activities. Preparing for phase III vaccine trials in Thailand Thirteen clinical trials, including two phase III efcacytrials, have been conducted in Thailand since 1994. Thevarious components involved include the regulatoryauthority, ethical review board, basic science research,clinical research, laboratory assessment (antibodyresponses - humoral, cellular), laboratory support and archiving, data management and analysis, community participation, and manufacturing capacity. The National Regulatory Authority (NRA) beneted from a series of trainings and workshops to increase itscapacity for licensing new vaccines and drugs with thehelp of WHO, the United States Food and Drug Admin-istration (USFDA), NIH, and GHVE. Standard operating procedures are in place and a workshop has been held on inspection skills. Experts can be requested from inter-national agencies. However, national staff are limited innumber. Institutional/ethical review boards have become very strong, especially in medical faculties during the past2-3 years. Some are now accredited by the Forum of Ethical Review Committees in Asia and Western Pacic region (FERCAP). However, harmonization ofethics committees is crucial to minimize time forapproval.Full phase I to phase III clinical research teams are now established with more than 100 well trained researchnurses, technicians, and research assistants, and enjoythe benets of dedicated physical spaces and staff with full GCP training. These teams include AFRIMS, the Military HIV Research Programme, HIV-NAT/Thai RedCross AIDS Research Chulalongkorn Hospital,Ministry of Public - Faculty of Medicine; Siriraj Hospital -Mahidol University, Vaccine Trial Centre (VTC) -Faculty of Tropical Medicine - Mahidol University. Laboratory capacity has been substantially strengthened over the past few years. Activities cover molecular epi-demiology for monitoring circulating viruses in Thailand,HIV diagnosis, College of American Pathologists (CAP)-certication of laboratory safety, assessment of HIV-specic humoral and cellular immune responses, theTrial Registry and Repository Centre at MOPH andBumrungrad Specimen Processing Laboratory. However, maintaining this capacity is questionable, as a high level of commitment and nancial support is needed. Data management capacity is now self-sustaining at the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bang-kok. Volunteer relation and community engagementactivities and community advisory boards (CABs) helpin strengthening health system and heath-care delivery, although they may also lead to high expectations. The strengthening of manufacturing capacity remains difcult. At the Vaccine and Cellular Immunology (VCI) labora- tory, Chulalongkorn University and HIV-NAT/Thai RedCross AIDS Research Centre, the initiation of a prime-boost phase I trial with DNA and fowlpox vaccines hasstimulated capacity strengthening, in particular at the laboratory level. The team now participates in HLA typing and epitope mapping for AIDS vaccine designunder an NIH grant. Preclinical development of an Asianmosaic DNA vaccine is underway at VCI, ChulalongkornMedical Research Centre, funded by Thai BIOTEC. Many laboratories within Thailand and across Asia could potentially play a much greater role in basic vaccine R&D. There is interest from Thai funding agencies in funding committed vaccine development teams to takepromising HIV vaccines from preclinical to early clinicalstudies. Capacity and regulatory challenges in applying 'good practice' in AIDS vaccineresearch and clinical trials Asia has abundant resources and a great capacity to apply good practice princip les in clinical trials and manufacture of AIDS vaccine candidates. China and442 Special articleIndia have advanced biological industries with a production capacity of bill ions of doses of vaccine each year. Japan and the Republic of Korea also have anexcellent capacity for good clinical, laboratory, and man- ufacturing practice. Onc e an AIDS vaccine candidate advances beyond clinical tr ials, these countries have great potential to manufacture AIDS vaccine productsthat meet international standards. Thailand has accu-mulated signicant capacity and experience in theclinical testing of novel AIDS vaccine candidatesthrough conducting most of th e efcacy trials to date. Furthermore, the recent signicant increases in govern- ment investment into R&D for a preventive AIDS vaccine, particularly in China, are encouraging vaccinemanufacturers to invest more in GMP. Taken as awhole, Asia has all the neces sary resources and capacity to move an AIDS vaccine concept from laboratoryresearch to eld application. However, transforming this capacity and potential into concerted activities and signicant progress remains a great challenge facing AVAN investigators and suppor-ters. Major hurdles are presented by the diversity ofregulatory policies and review processes among differentAsian countries, which hinder efforts to accelerate pro-gress in clinical trials. The political will to support AIDSvaccine candidates among low-epidemic countries alsofalls short of expectations. Current AIDS vaccine development in China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand is illustrativeof the capacities and challenges of applying good practicein AIDS vaccine research and manufacturing. China In China, the National Institute for Control of Pharma- ceutical and Biological Products (NICPBP) conducts technical assessments, including reviewing of the qualitycontrol methods and quality specications proposed byvaccine manufacturers, laboratory testing of clinical lotsof proposed vaccine candidates, lot release of vaccinebatches for both licensed products and INDs intended tobe used in clinical trials. The NICPBP makes recom-mendations to the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) on quality control methods and specications. SFDA, mainly through another branch (the Centre forDrug Evaluation), reviews and approves new vaccineclinical trial applications as well as the design of theclinical trials. Upon the close of each phase of clinicaltrials, data are reviewed by SDFA to decide whether ornot these products should move on further. Guidelinesfrom the NICPBP and SFDA outline regulatory require- ments for clinical trials and development of preventive AIDS vaccines. These guidelines refer to comparableUSFDA and WHO guidelines and 'points to consider'documents.Procedures for registration and licensing begin with pro- vincial or municipal review of proposals from manufac-turers. SFDA and NICPBP undertake a parallel exam-ination of the proposal and test materials, review the dossier and test data, and consult with an Expert Com- mittee for Drug Evaluation. The primary responsibility for reviewing test results and quality control, including specications of the productsand validation of the test methods, resides with NICPBP,which issues a quality control report and comments toSFDA. Primary responsibility for reviewing proposed clinical trials, ascertaining the establishment of appro- priate GCP, qualications of staff, safety surveillanceplans, and ethics committee approvals lies with SFDA. China is facing the challenge of organizing AIDS vaccine efcacy trials in the coming years. International collab-orations with both developed and developing countries,particularly Thailand, may represent an ideal solution to enhance the capacity to apply good practice to all phases of clinical trials, particularly efcacy trials. Another chal-lenge facing China's AIDS vaccine development is therelatively complicated and lengthy procedures for clinicaltrial application and approval. Although SFDA has pro-vided a fast approval process for AIDS vaccine candi-dates, further regulatory system evolution is needed tomeet the demands of an expanding AIDS vaccine pipe- line and increasing international collaborations. Thailand Prior to 2004, Thai FDA regulations for new vaccines focused on the importation of investigational clinical trialmaterial; the Thai FDA did not conduct clinical trialinspections or audits. In some cases, vaccines receivedconditional approval after examination of the proposed plan alone. Since 2004, GCP inspection has been required, as well as an IND-equivalent applicationrequiring the local conduct of phase I, II, and III mon-itored clinical trials. One good example is the clinical trial of the ALVA C-VaxGen vaccine combination in Thailand (RV-144).RV-144 is being conducted under a US IND as well as under the corresponding Thai FDA requirements. An end-of-phase II process was required by USFDA, whichincluded the development of a detailed package withinformation on all clinical data available from the manyclinical trials previously conducted with the vaccines, aswell as a meeting at which the sponsor and partnerspresented the plan and responded to questions byUSFDA. Approval to proceed with phase II was granted by USFDA, and ofcial agreement was obtained from the Thai National Authority, including approval for import ofthe vaccines, approval of quality assurance/quality controlreports, and approval of the safety evaluation plan.AIDS vaccine for Asia network Rerks-Ngarm et al. 443Subsequent to the workshop, the results of the RV-144 trial have been announced and published showing a clearbut modest efcacy of the vaccine [9 /C15/C15]. This study has provided substantial encouragement to the eld to identify the correlates of immunity and design, and to test improved vaccines. This trial sets a benchmark forfuture efcacy studies. Thailand faces several challenges for future studies, including developing legislative mechanisms to authorizeand supervise clinical trials and to monitor and enforceGMP and GCP; acquiring expertise to evaluate appli- cations, including laboratory and clinical trials, market authorization and licensing, postmarketing surveillance,lot release, laboratory testing, GMP inspection and super-vision of clinical trials. Thailand also faces challenges intraining and implementing external experts or advisoryboards for ethical and scientic review processes. Inresponse to these challenges, Thailand has proposed acapacity-building strategy that includes implementing a clinical trial review process for ethical and scientic issues, implementing a stronger adverse events follow-up system, and providing advanced training in specicvaccine development technologies. India Review of vaccine applications in India is lengthy andinvolves three separate, independent institutions: the National Drug Authority, the National Food Authority, and the Biotechnology Review Authority. Vaccine trialsalso require reviews at the institutional ethics and scien-tic committees [National AIDS Research Institute(NARI) and Tuberculosis Research Centre (TRC], DrugController General of India (DCGI) ofce, Central EthicsCommittee, Genetic Engineering Approval Committee,and the Health Minister's Screening Committee. In general, the review proceeds more expeditiously if USFDA has already approved the vaccine for clinicaltrials. Although India has developed guidelines forvaccine R&D, including regulatory, GCP, and ethicalguidelines, none are binding. In addition to this chal-lenge, private sector involvement in AIDS vaccine R&Dis limited because investment risks are not widely dis-tributed and the regulatory review process is lengthy and complicated. To address current challenges in the regulatory and manufacturing environments , India will need to develop a pipeline of robust candida tes, enhance vaccine dis- covery, maintain good laboratory practice (GLP)-com-pliant laboratories with high throughput validated assays, and create repositories of relevant specimens and sequence databases of I ndian isolates. In addition, there is a need for improved management of intellectualproperty and technology tran sfer to guarantee future access to products, as well as the development of humanand material capacity to conduct phase II and III trials. Finally, India needs a model similar to GHVE to harmo-nize and facilitate regulator y decision-making, perform risk-benet analyses, and to create an enabling environ- ment for the sharing of scientic data and biological materials. Japan and the Republic of Korea Both Japan and the Republic of Korea have more thanadequate capacity for manufacture and evaluation ofvaccine products. However, despite the high level of capacity in production and clinical trials for new vaccine candidates, an AIDS vaccine has never been a priority inthese countries. Their relatively low HIV burden mayexplain their modest participation in global efforts onAIDS vaccine R&D. However, Asia could play a moresignicant role in the global AIDS vaccine eld if greatercommitments were to be made by Japan and the Repub-lic of Korea. As a rst step, enhancing the political will of their governments is of great importance. Community considerations and needs for policy development: inclusion of vulnerablepopulations By denition, HIV prevention research must follow the epidemic and, thus, populations at higher risk of HIVexposure are asked to volunteer for AIDS vaccine trials. The same factors that put individuals at higher risk of exposure to HIV in concentrated epidemics also makethem vulnerable to cultural exclusion, social inequality,economic exploitation, and political oppression. Partici-pating in an AIDS vaccine trial might increase vulner-ability if it increases a participant's risk of exposure tostigmatization and discrimination because it highlights astudy population's increased vulnerability to HIV exposure. A trial may also decrease vulnerability if it empowers the community or provides tangible assistanceto participants, for example, by improving the accessi-bility, affordability, and quality of appropriate healthcareservices in the community. AIDS vaccine researchers andadvocates must work to decrease these vulnerabilitiesand increase the positive benets of participating in aresearch trial. A social and political analy sis of a community can help researchers to better understand how to decrease vulner-abilities and help maximize benets for volunteers.Findings from such analyses can be used to inform thedesign of research protocol s that are sensitive to emer- ging information on incidental risks of social harmthroughout the course of a trial. In some potential research populations, condi tions affecting potential vulnerability or exploitation may be so severe that therisk outweighs the benet of conducting the study inthat population.444 Special articleEarly warning systems and quality assurance should be instituted in trials involving vulnerable populations.Research protocols might also include ongoing indepen-dent monitoring of a trial in relation to its impact on the vulnerabilities of communities participating in the study (additional to scientic and ethical review committeesresponsible for providing prior and continuing review ofthe trial). Communities of people affected by research should play an active, informed role, working throughout trial con-duct with site research staff and the principal investigator who is responsible for all aspects of a trial, including efforts to enhance community participation. This 'parti-cipatory management' benets all parties; helps ensuresmooth trial functioning; and builds community capacityto understand and inform the research process, raiseconcerns, and help nd solutions to unexpected issuesthat may emerge once the trial is underway. AVANshould adopt genuine, transparent, meaningful parti- cipatory management principles by including commu- nity representatives in management structures of thenetwork. Although meaningful community engagement in clinical research is widely recognized as essential, it is also notwithout its challenges. These challenges can be magni-ed for AIDS vaccine researchers and trial sponsors who work in communities where individuals most at risk for HIV infection are also members of vulnerable popu-lations. Special considerations and challenges exist forthese communities and researchers and trial sponsorsshould take into account how others in the region havebeen successful in engaging with communities, commu-nicating results and delivering important researchbenets to the communities in which AIDS vaccine research takes place. Furthermore, AVAN can play a coordinating role to connect stakeholders to share lessonslearnt as well as use its position to set the regionalstandard for good community engagement practices. Unfavorable laws and prevailing stigma and discrimination make it difcult to reach vulnerable populations (e.g.MSM, sex workers, IDUs, migrants) who could participate in AIDS vaccine studies. To help overcome these chal- lenges, stakeholders must work to accelerate preventionefforts to stem HIV transmission, in particular among mostat-risk populations and reduce HIV-associated stigma andcreate enabling environment for vulnerable communitiesto access health services and participate in HIV clinicalresearch studies. Community and vaccine preparedness activities also play a critical role in addressing some of the challengesdescribed above. There is a need to build researchliteracy in trial site communities and beyond. Trial sitesand sponsors in the region have formulated various activities recognizing the multiple and varying layers thatmake up each: health staff, trial staff, trial volunteers'neighbors, volunteers' families, and of course, the volunteers themselves. Trial sites and sponsors in the region have had success implementing a range of community outreach activitieswith civil society, policy-makers, national and regionalmedia, and partners in the community. Local nongovern-mental and community-based organizations, researchorganizations, media, religious leaders, and doctors were consulted extensively, largely through consultative meet- ings, often held in high-prevalence areas. Informationwas disseminated through these meetings, newsletters,info-kits, and easy-to-understand brochures to explainthe research. When meeting with policy-makers, researchsponsors recognized the importance of building long-term partnerships through one-on-one consultationsand regular briengs at the national and regional level. A similar approach was implemented when looking to build the capacity of local and national media to coverAIDS vaccine research. Sponsors held media briengsand one-on-one meetings with journalists and editors tohelp build understanding of vaccine science and thecomplex issues that are involved in clinical research. Ongoing engagement is essential to help overcome the numerous challenges in retaining volunteers in any clinical trial, especially in a phase III efcacy trial, whichoften takes several years. Strategies that have beenimplemented to improve retention include team-build-ing, extended clinic hours, and a special tracking team. Results from any biomedical prevention trial have an impact on AIDS vaccine research, the way it is commu- nicated (how to maintain community and volunteer sup- port in the face of failed products) or how future vaccinetrials are designed (in the case of effective products thatwill need to be added to the standard of prevention forvolunteers). No one working in HIV prevention researchis operating in a silo, what happens in one trial, with oneproduct, in one community, happens to the entire eld. The eld must also work to sustain capacity (at clinical trial sites) and honestly communicate timelines. One ofthe biggest challenges in AIDS vaccine advocacy ismanaging expectations, as a balance must be struckbetween keeping up the momentum and support forresearch, while also preparing for what could, and likelywill be, a long road. Timelines in vaccine developmentfor any disease have often proved to be quite long and advocate need to manage these timelines carefully. As identied, one of the critical priorities is to build research literacy, particularly around difcult scienticAIDS vaccine for Asia network Rerks-Ngarm et al. 445concepts (e.g. viral load reduction as a vaccine trial end- point, which is different from what many commonlyunderstand a vaccine to do: prevent infection). In a'post-STEP' world, in which AIDS vaccine trials are increasingly complex, earlier community engagement is essential. This early and more in-depth engagementshould be guided by a new set of guidelines: theUNAIDS/AVAC Good participatory practice guidelinesfor biomedical HIV prevention trials (GPP). The GPPguidelines are designed to provide systematic guidanceon the roles and responsibilities of trial sponsors and trialimplementers toward participants and their communities. The guidelines identify core principles, essential issues, and minimum elements of how stakeholders should planand evaluate community engagement in biomedical HIVprevention trials. These and other guidelines can be especially useful in the Asian context to support community engagement andeducation work, especially in vulnerable populations. Given that Asia does not have a generalized epidemic, any larger-scale AIDS vaccine trials would need to takeplace in higher-risk cohorts, for this region most likelyIDUs and MSM. Thailand experience There are many challenges related to communityinvolvement in AIDS vaccine trials in Thailand, parti- cularly in phase III efcacy trials. A multilayered community approach should be adopted includinghealth staff, trial staff, volunteers, their families, andneighbors. Negative attitudes and misunderstandingrelated to AIDS vaccine tr ials include fears that the vaccine may cause HIV infection, or that the efcacyof the vaccine may be tested by deliberate exposure tothe virus. Retention strategies are essential and should consider the interval betwe en appointments, family and neighborhood influences, the convenience of appoint-ment dates/times, waiting times, and missed appoint-ments due to mobility, among other issues. Strategiesthat must be put in place at the clinical service levelinclude improvement in service areas, team-building,provider-based services, vol unteer relation activities, convenient-access clinics in Bangkok, and extended clinic hours. The communica tion plan for vaccine stu- dies must include community engagement through ahealth forum, volunteer network, community network,and a CAB. Additional challenges include how to com-municate interim analysis data, the notion of coprimaryendpoint, and the viral load effect. These were pro-minent issues during the release of the RV 144 trialresults. Once an efcacious vaccine is identied, mana- ging community expectations such as the likelihood for placebo recipients to be vaccinated and making avaccine available at an affordable price remain importantissues.India experience Much groundwork has been done on communityparticipation in India during IAVI-sponsored AIDSvaccine trials. Key issues to be addressed include stigma associated with HIV, mistrust of clinical trials, the import- ant role of community and vaccine preparedness activi-ties, the recruitment of volunteers in the complex Indiancultural context, the long approval process and bureauc-racy, the need to develop trial site capacity and countryscientic capacity, and the need for long-term commit-ment and support at all levels. Engaging civil society as a partner and adviser to the AIDS vaccineprogramwasachievedthroughconsultingandinter-acting extensively with nongovernmental and community-basedorganizations,women'sorganizations,policy-makers,doctors, research organizations, media, HIV-positivepeople's groups, and religious leaders, and through orga- nizing consultative meetings in high-prevalence states. Several advisory groups were constituted, including the National Advisory Board, National Consultation on Careand Treatment for AIDS Vaccine Trial Participants,Informed Consent Group, NGO Working Group, GenderAdvisory Board, and Management Advisory Board for feasibility studies. Formative research in at-risk communities (transgender and MSM) was conducted in 2007 to assess social struc-tures, understand risk proles, identify health-seekingpatterns, and assess the quality of available services,potential barriers, and opportunities for participating in AIDS vaccine research studies. A voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) workshop for MSM and transgender com-munities held in 2007 reached several conclusions. First,the existing laws, stigma, and discrimination make itdifcult to reach vulnerable populations (MSM, sexworkers, IDUs, migrants). Second, health systems arelimited in capacity to deliver required services, in particu-lar to vulnerable populations, hence the need for strength- ening. Third, some populations are geographically scat- tered and there is a need to create links to close biomedicalresearch and health infrastructure and services. Fourth,accelerating prevention efforts to stem HIV transmission,in particular among most at-risk populations, is a priority.Fifth, reducing HIV-associated stigma and creating anenabling environment for vulnerable communities toaccess health services and participate in HIV clinical research studies are key conditions for success. Working group summaries and recommendations During the Beijing meeting, participants were divided into two working groups (Supplementary Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/COHA/A3) to consider issuesrelated to the creation of the AVAN.446 Special articleWorking group 1: dening a roadmap and the terms of reference for the AIDS Vaccine Asian Network taskforce The objectives of working group 1 are to develop a roadmap and the terms of reference for the AVAN task force (e.g. objectives, modus operandi, timeframe, andmilestones); to dene the strategies, approaches, andmilestones for the development of a regional Asianvaccine R&D strategy; and to make recommendationson how Asia can best contribute to the updating of theGHVE Scientic Strategic Plan. Roadmap and terms of reference for the AIDS Vaccine Asian Network task force The participants proposed the task force membership should consist of individuals with signicant internationalscientic stature in vaccine R&D, a strong commitmentto the vision of AVAN, experience in advocacy (bothpolitical and community), and an understanding of localand regional politics and funding mechanisms. Members will be nominated by consultation working group mem- bers, proposed by WHO and GHVE, and the task forcemembers will also choose alternate representatives. Theduration of membership to the AVAN task force will belimited until the formal launch of AVAN. The AVANtask force membership will be nalized by March 2009and the terms of reference for AVAN available by June2009. AVAN will be presented at the AIDS Vaccine Conference in Paris in October 2009. The terms of reference of the task force include the following: (1) Developing a proposal for the structure, vision, mission, modus operandi, and the establishment ofthe AVAN Secretariat. (2) Identifying mechanisms to implement the Sapporo recommendations. (3) Determining needs for establishment of working groups on targeted issues, such as clinical trialcapacity, molecular epidemiology, training, and so on. (4) Developing a proposal for the AVAN Strategic Plan.(5) Prioritizing objectives for AVAN.(6) Identifying initial targets for funding based on the Strategic Plan. (7) Identifying Asian scientists to attend AIDS Vaccine Conference 2009 and raising funds for attendance. Regional vaccine research and development strategy: objectives Participants acknowledged the regional common chal- lenges and strengths (though not just in one country) and,therefore, the need for a regional approach to AIDSvaccine R&D. AVAN could be a mechanism to fosterscientic collaboration, educate governments, develop- ment agencies, and other donors. Participants identiedregional priorities, including clinical trial capacity, youngand early career investigator programs, advocacy, need for developing regional cohorts, good laboratory practices, harmonization of assays and standard operating pro-cedures, repository and molecular epidemiology, manu-facturing capacity, industry participation, and productdevelopment programs through public-private partner-ships. (note: similar discussion took place in workinggroup 2). Key objectives are to rst create an inventory of existing scientic capacity, innovative ideas, and funding in theregion. Second, develop a plan to harmonize regulatoryand ethical requirements for AIDS vaccine trials. Third,to build trust and promote regional and internationalcollaboration. Fourth, contribute to the GHVE scienticstrategic plan and efforts by participating in scientic andcommunication working groups and proposing comp- lementary topics not fully covered in the current plan. Working group 2: dening AIDS Vaccine Asian Network, identifying challenges and common strategies forbuilding regional AIDS vaccine capacity in Asia The objective of working group 2 (Supplementary Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/COHA/A3) was to help AVAN move toward the development of the common regional platforms in support of AIDS vaccinetrials in Asia, in particular around regulatory, ethical, andcommunity considerations. The AIDS Vaccine Asian Network mission, purpose, and scope Given the level of heterogeneity across different regions, nations, populations, and sociocultural backgrounds, it was agreed that a lot could be gained by sharing theknowledge and experience of different partners. Thiswould broaden advocacy opportunities for AIDS vaccinedevelopment and contribute to increasing researchliteracy across the region. It is important for the networkto be aware of the heterogeneity in regional researchcapacity and infrastructure, as well as research experi- ence, and therefore AVAN should take into account the needs of both more and less experienced members. It willalso be important to take advantage of the existing localor regional mechanisms for networking in order to avoidconfusion or duplication. It was noted that although thereis a network addressing HIV treatment-related issues(TREAT ASIA), there are no established networks inthe region addressing HIV prevention. The discussion of AVAN's purpose and scope was based on the recommendations from the Sapporo meeting, inwhich the idea of creating AVAN was put forward. TheAIDS vaccine for Asia network Rerks-Ngarm et al. 447group proposed a mission statement that broadens the scope of the network by adding the element of 'biome-dical HIV prevention clinical trials' in addition to AIDSvaccines. The proposed mission statement is to 'accel- erate the development of an AIDS vaccine through the establishment of a collaborative Asian network aimed atexpanding the capacity for vaccine development andbiomedical HIV prevention clinical trials'. The following arguments were discussed in favor of such a change. First, HIV biomedical prevention trials areoften conducted in populations with similar demo- graphics and HIV epidemiological features in a region, country, or population. Given the overlap, broadeningthe scope in terms of both capacity strengthening andavoiding competition for trial sites and populations seemsrational. Second, current progress in development of HIVbiomedical interventions, such as circumcision and PrEP,and negative results from recent AIDS vaccine trials,indicate that most likely rst-generation AIDS vaccines will need to be considered in the context of other pre- ventive strategies. AIDS vaccine development, therefore,should not be conducted in isolation but rather shouldtake into consideration the whole spectrum of novelpreventive strategies and interventions. Third, givenrelatively small numbers of HIV clinical researchers inAsia, it is likely that many HIV biomedical researcherswould already have been involved in research into a spectrum of HIV interventions. Fourth, the recent nega- tive AIDS vaccine trial results (STEP trial) and thelikelihood that it will be some time before there is successon the vaccine front, have moved other groups such asAVAC to consider broadening the scope of their focus toinclude other prevention modalities. It seems pragmaticto ensure that current investment in vaccine develop-ment and research infrastructure and vaccine trials be wisely managed so that centers and resources, such as equipment and personnel, do not remain idle and couldbe used for other prevention research and clinical trials toensure sustaining this capacity. However, some concerns were raised regarding this broadening of scope. First, this change could lead to adiffusion of effort and compromise the effectiveness of the network, undermining the initial purpose and spirit of bringing the network together in the rst place. Second,strong advocacy on the vaccine front is needed along withthe belief that an effective vaccine is the 'end game' orthe 'magic bullet' in containing the epidemic and, there-fore, combining it with other strategies could risk dilutingthe highly challenging endeavor. Third, the slope forvaccine advocacy is steeper than that of advocating for other preventive interventions and, therefore, if the effort is diffused across biomedical prevention, this may lead toan inadvertent slide toward lesser focus on vaccines.Fourth, should AVAN broaden its scope to include bio-medical HIV preventive interventions, it would then also need to consider how to deal with the development of'therapeutic' AIDS vaccines. In conclusion, participants generally agreed that the scope could encompass both components, in that theprimary thrust would still be AIDS vaccines but thatbiomedical preventive interventions should be part ofthe overall strategic considerations, which is reflected inthe proposed mission statement. Challenges, including regulatory, clinical trials, and capacity building considerations Several challenges exist in considering expanding HIV vaccine R&D capacity in Asia based on shared know-ledge and experiences gained through conducting trialsin the region. These include increasing communityengagement, streamlining regulatory review processes,facilitating ethical review procedures, improving clinicaltrial acceptance, capacity, and infrastructure, establishing accurate HIV epidemiological information, and harmo- nizing and validating procedures relevant to laboratorytesting and clinical evaluation. The working groupfocussed on issues pertaining to increasing communityengagement, streamlining regulatory review processes, aswell as clinical research capacity. Increasing community engagement Engagement with the community is a critical aspect ofconducting clinical trials. Sharing of experiences andsolutions is instructive for network members. It is likely that many materials already developed could be useful and informative for groups that are only in the planningstages of community engagement. Examples of existingresources that could be made available through the net-work include community messages and documentsaddressing important community procedures, such asCAB-operating procedures. Also cited as potentially veryuseful were updated materials on key aspects of clinical trials, such as risk-reduction guidance, and on issues related to postvaccination seropositivity in AIDS vaccinetrials. As mentioned above, AVAC/UNAIDS has devel-oped Good Participatory Practice guidelines for biomed-cal HIV prevention trials that describe recommendedpractices for community engagement; this approachcould also be considered and expanded through AVAN. Streamlining regulatory review procedures: relevant regulatory considerations Most felt that it was likely that regional multicenter trials would be required in testing future HIV biomedical interventions, especially vaccines. The opportunity to develop a network that could provide a common platformfrom which HIV-vaccine-specic regulatory issues couldbe discussed and addressed should be seized. There is448 Special articletremendous diversity in the region in terms of innovation and biopharmaceutical industry as well as researchcapacity, accessibility, and clarity of national regulatoryreview processes. Even when general policies are similar in principle among more established and experienced regulatory bodies, in particular when dealing with novelproducts, requirements often differ in specic details.Some requirements may seem unusual, unexpected, oreven unnecessarily rigorous when compared betweendifferent regulatory jurisdictions. There is a long recog-nized and great need to harmonize these processes.'Create a regional harmonization or regional authority for regulatory interactions, including regional licensure and review and regional ethical committees with an initialcore working group' (recommendation from Sapporomeeting, 2006). Among the challenges discussed were the current situ- ations in China, India, and Japan. The China SFDA hasspecic requirements pertaining to experimental pro- ducts manufactured outside China if the trials are to be conducted in China. Foreign vaccine developers arerequired to transfer all quality control processes to thedesignated China SFDA laboratory for validation andverication as well as provide access to all batch records.The current requirement, as it stands, complicates theregulatory pathway for collaborative efforts betweenChinese and foreign partners. Some exceptions do exist to this rule, as in the case of drug development, in which it is possible to conduct trials without meeting thisrequirement. In India, despite the enormous numbers of clinical trials regularly conducted on many other products, where theregulatory review seems fairly rapid, the review approachtaken with AIDS vaccines appears unusually lengthy and in some cases leads to signicant delays. In Japan, early phase clinical trials for specic products such as anything involving genetically modied organ-isms (GMOs) also face regulatory challenges. In addition,the need for an AIDS vaccine for the Japanese populationis not recognized by the government and, therefore, theresearch community working on vaccines receives mini- mal support. However, lately, there has been some opti- mism that this stance may be changing to provide theopportunity for some phase I trials to be conducted. Some participants emphasized that initiating a dialogue with regulators early in the development process wascritical for developing greater understanding of the regu-latory requirements. Such a process could minimize unnecessary delays or costs. This dialogue would also provide an opportunity to identify regulatory issues,which may require forging new mechanisms or pro-cedures to facilitate appropriate national regulatoryreview. For example, in Tanzania, the process of devel- oping a national HIV vaccine plan paved the way foran early dialogue with the regulatory authorities. Thisresulted in early discussions of gaps and issues in the regulatory review processes, which allowed for a smooth process in review and approval of a phase I trial. Similarlyin South Africa, conducting a clinical trial with an experi-mental GMO product prompted creation of specicreview and oversight mechanisms. It was highlighted that there have been several efforts initiated by WHO, national regulatory agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry to engage regulators as a net- work to discuss regionally relevant regulatory issues. Thisincludes the Developing Country Vaccine RegulatorsNetwork (DCVRN), which can be used as a platformfor engagement with regulators. In addition, for Associ-ation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, thePharmaceutical Product Working Group (PPWG) pro-vides a forum that also discusses relevant regulatory issues from a regional perspective. Therefore, all agreed that AVAN could play a useful role in facilitating andinforming such dialogue. It could provide a platform tokeep key regulatory stakeholders informed about thescience and progress in AIDS vaccine development, bothfrom a general and from a product-specic perspective. It was proposed that an essential preliminary step will be to do a quick survey of individuals and groups with experience in conducting trials in the region in orderto identify regulatory issues of concern. This could becombined with a review of available regulatory guidanceand documents. Such an analysis would not only identifythe issues, but could also provide information on speci-cities around the issues and would allow a targeted andinformed dialogue with national and regional regulators over AIDS vaccine development. It was also agreed that AVAN should make full use of current networks andforums to engage in this regulatory dialogue. One area toexplore is how they can be engaged in order to 'normal-ize' some aspects of the HIV regulatory pathway. Vaccinedevelopment and clinical trials should not be viewed asonly being conducted by 'foreign developers' who mightbe attempting to escape rigorous regulatory conditions in the country of origin. A proposed approach for AVAN when considering the challenges of streamlining regulat-ory review procedures is as follows: (1) Country level - what could be done to facilitate processes and address regulatory concerns that mayarise over certain specic products? (2) Regional level - what potential regional process/ mechanism/structure could be helpful toward improving understanding of HIV vaccine develop-ment from a regulatory perspective (task force/work-ing group on regulatory research issues)?AIDS vaccine for Asia network Rerks-Ngarm et al. 449(3) Speciallevel - dealingwithspecialissuessuchashowto deal with products manufactured outside the country. Clinical trial capacity considerations Optimizing regional clinical research and trial infrastruc-ture will be important and AVAN could play a role infacilitating several aspects of this process. Harmonizationand standardization of clinical trial conduct through hav- ing template protocols for clinical trials would be useful. Training of study teams on principles of GCP and safetymonitoring would be helpful. Harmonization of ethicalreview and approval processes could occur. Data manage-ment issues could also be assisted by AVAN. Developingclinical trial quality assurance/quality control methodsbetween countries would help building validationcapacity around clinical trial associated procedures. This would require consideration of country-specic require- ments around material transfer agreements (MTAs). A critical rst step in undertaking any clinical trial would be to conduct an analysis of the normative landscape(formal, ethical, legal, regulatory, political, and moreinformal such as social and cultural dimensions) to helpinform the many aspects of clinical trial planning and conduct, such as knowledge on local standards of care and national policy around HIV. This effort will help AVANmembers in dealing with issues such as not conductingAIDS vaccine trials in countries where there is a policy ofmandatory testing for HIV or where there is no universalaccess to HIV prevention modalities. Another fundamental element of clinical trial capacity is human resources. Development and training of investi- gators and study staff takes a long-term commitment andinvestment on many levels, and this is a critical consider-ation for sponsors of AIDS vaccine development. Strategic areas of focus The participants were convinced by the need for AVANand proposed that some concrete activities could beconsidered along the lines of a strategic framework thatwere identied as priorities. Information exchangearound best practices (GCP, GLP, GMP, SOP) and multidisciplinary training is critical. Policy and advocacy work around national HIV vaccine plans and regulatoryharmonization. Lastly, mobilizing resources to enhanceall aspects of AIDS vaccine R&D will be crucial. Preliminary activities Several potential preliminary, start-up activities forAVAN were proposed. Regional baseline HIV prevention landscape analysis Regional baseline HIV prevention landscape analysiswould be aimed at providing baseline information thatwould help develop potential activities for the network, such as conducting regional multicenter clinical trials. These activities would include an epidemiological analysis of HIV demographics and mapping of current HIV prevention trial activities. Further, an inventory ofpolicies relevant to clinical trial conduct such as existingregulatory review processes and guidelines for exchangeof biological materials and data would be very helpful. Epidemiological analysis of HIV demographics (e.g. UN commission on AIDS in Asia 2008 report) There is a need to collect and make accessible accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive information on epide-miology of HIV in the region, in a manner relevant tothe design and conduct of HIV prevention interventiontrials. This factor is particularly important in view of theinherent challenges in developing and testing HIV pre-ventive interventions in populations in whom the generalincidence and prevalence is low, as well as in subgroups in whom HIV prevalence and incidence remains unde- termined, such as in MSM. There is a need to expandmolecular epidemiology studies in order to determine thedistribution of HIV subtypes and the impact of thesedifferences for vaccine trial design. Such informationwould help the network adopt appropriate strategiesand develop approaches to vaccine development thatare tailored to the needs of the region. Mapping of current HIV prevention trial activity (e.g. alliance for microbicide development and InternationalAIDS Vaccine Initiative databases) Knowledge about clinical trials and HIV prevention interventions, as well as baseline information thatdescribes the level of community engagement, aware-ness, and activism could be helpful for researchers. This is essentially a knowledge management/database devel- opment type of activity. It was noted that UNAIDS hadpreviously attempted to develop a research activity data-base to be used and managed by countries, which wasapparently not systematically taken up. Therefore, someconcern was expressed, given that it could potentially bea rather large task and present challenges not only inestablishing such an inventory or repository of infor- mation within the network but even more so in main- taining it. It was proposed that, as a starting strategy forthis activity, existing databases could be used as sourcesof information to further populate such a database, as wellas for focal points for member institutions or countrieswithin the network. Whatever effort that is taken to collect, document, and communicate information for the network, the group agreed that a fundamental consideration will be deter-mining the scope and audience. Some advocated that thenetwork should start small and identify the scope of450 Special articleinformation that would be most useful for AVAN rst and then expand to other stakeholders. Mechanisms for implementing proposed activities A method that has been useful in helping to provide a framework for the activities proposed above is the devel-opment of a national HIV vaccine development plan.Examples of how this has been used in Thailand andTanzania were discussed. The process of developingsuch national HIV vaccine development plans also pro- vides a platform for convening the key stakeholders at a local and national level and identifying key players whocould play a critical role in the effort. National HIVvaccine plan brings together all the elements that needto be engaged with by the network, identies areas thatneed strengthening, and denes priorities and activitieswithin those areas. Such a plan also provides a platform through which the stakeholders in vaccine development could be proactiveand anticipatory in terms of engaging with communitiesor approval bodies in the early conceptual stages ofclinical development. The group recommended thatthe goals of AVAN should be facilitated in part byassisting and strengthening the development of nationalHIV vaccine development plans throughout countries in the region. Conclusion It was recommended that one of the key next steps was for the country participants to begin a dialogue withcommunity stakeholders about the network, as well aswith national or political stakeholders to gather support orbuy-in, and feedback on the network. In conducting such a dialogue, some clarity is required on what AVAN will be, whom it will represent, and what itwill do. It was proposed that some communication pointsabout AVAN targeted at different audiences/stake-holders would be important to consider. A source for thiscould be the report from this meeting. In terms of governance and setting up the network, it was concluded that it might be better to maintain an informalnetwork approach in the beginning as national engage-ment on a formal level is likely to take much longer.Initiating a network that is more informal also facilitates amore flexible and adaptable approach to accommodateregional diversity, while forging on with already ident-ied next steps and activities.
