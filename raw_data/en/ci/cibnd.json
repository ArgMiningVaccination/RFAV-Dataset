Our first time to Peru and you all blew us... read more This is my second ceremony with Peru Shaman and both times, the experiences have been profound. I went solo this time and I my guide/translator ensured that I understood in English what the Shaman was saying. I was provided with details on each step of the ceremony and also about the history of the sacred locations we went. A great experience to let go and ground yourself with Pachamama. When I mentioned to a friend who teaches Peruvian Shamanism that I was going to Peru and was looking to experience authentic ceremonies, he recommended Peru Shamans. They did not disappoint. The five-day tour provides the opportunity to visit a number of temples and sacred sites around Cusco, the Sacred Valley, and Machu Picchu with cultural excursions, such as visiting the textile factory and learn how the textile are made and dyed with natural ingredients. There is also plenty of time to visit other attractions not scheduled in the tour that come with the tourist pass you purchase to see the sacred sites that's good for 14 days. From my initial query Rosmeri was wonderful, answering all my questions about the retreat and providing recommended places to stay. My master shaman, Donello, and guide/interpreter Don Juan were great! Don Juan was full of historical information and legends related to the towns we visited that provided a wonderful texture to the trip far and above what I would have received if doing a typical tour. The ceremonies were very powerful. Donnello was so great. Not only did he share valuable information about the Andean cosmology, he shared information about the medicinal purpose of various plants we came across while trekking through the ruins. The despachos Donnello created as part of the ceremony were beautiful. I bought what I thought were Chumpi stones in Ollantaytambo when I was on my own, but I didn't trust vendor because they didn't look right. I ended up getting duplicates of certain stones instead of a full set. I didn't figure out my mistake until we were leaving Machu Picchu. Don Juan and Donnello were kind enough to go back with me and speak to the vendor so I could fix the problem. Then Donnello explained that my stones were a little different than the Chumpi stones in the direction they work with energy. At our last ceremony he explained what each of my stones were for and activated and charged my stones to work with at home. I really felt connected to the Andean shamanic tradition during the ceremonies and meditations at these sacred sites and building a deeper connection with Pachamama at her Temple in Machu Picchu. Trekking around Machu Picchu sites, as well as the other ruins, was like hiking with friends. The 5-day journey was definitely a transformative experience thanks to Donnello and Don Juan. I would definitely recommend Peru Shamans and requesting Donnello and Don Juan. You won't be disappointed. Can't imagine a better authentic place to take the San Pedro then with our Shaman Juan on the Mountaintop we thoroughly enjoy this he has such a loving and kind Spirit would recommend to anybody anywhere the San Pedro was very delicate not a bad experience to have at all, loved the time we spent with the shaman thank-you you juan.love from usa. Not only did we get to experience the same Pedro with Juan he also guided us through trails and old Inca ruins and knew so much about the history and culture and we got to see places that I don't think very many people actually get to see thank you juan for a wonderful memorable trip Pero Shamans offered us a 6 day spiritual learning opportunity that we will never forget. Janet was knowledgeable, fluent in at least 3 languages, and very helpful. The maestros shared their knowledge with us in a nurturing way. Thank you so much. We were looking for an agency that would offer authentic shamanic ceremonies, without ayahuasca (not feeling a calling for plant-based medicine anymore), and we couldn't have found any better! This 5 days spiritual tour allowed us to visit many temples and sacred places around Cusco, Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu, with really connecting to those amazing and energetic places through meditations and ceremonies, and having a much deeper spiritual understanding than we would have had if going with a classic tourist guide. Everything was perfectly organised, and the ceremonies were varied, beautiful, and powerful, and really allowed us to understand Andean shamanism better. Our guide Janet was the most amazing and kind person: she was a well of knowledge, and took extra good care of us during the whole trip. Our shaman Don Basilio was also very kind, and gave us great guidance through the ceremonies, and great insights about our future life mission - as we are on a healer's path. Thank you so much! We had a very transformative experience through connecting to Pachamama, such incredible places, and such incredible people! By luck, I heard about this unique experience from a fellow traveller and thought I couldn't leave Cusco without doing the Mountain healing ceremony. Was told it was suitable for those in the healing/therapeutic vocations to re-energize but anyone can do it in my opinion. Janet, as translator was great and I felt very safe going as a lone female. The actual experience on the mountaintop with the shaman was a unique and uplifting experience which I enjoyed very much. Thank "}
