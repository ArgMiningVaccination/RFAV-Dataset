There are several advantages offered by bioactive compounds extracted from plants: low toxicity; high yield and easier obtainment; and favorable physiological functions, e.g., they can improve immunomodulation and have anti-oxidative, anti-microbial, and anti-hypertensive functions [ [20](#B20)]. Plant extracts have been widely used as biological additives and for drug development. Notably, preclinical development of bioactive natural products and their analogs as chemotherapeutic agents is required for their future clinic applications. [7](#B7), [15](#B15), [25](#B25)]. BA and its derivatives have been the subject of intense study with focuses on their anti-cancer effects [ [22](#B22), [23](#B23)], other pharmaceutical properties [ [2](#B2), [12](#B12)]. These effects may be due to their ability to modulate immune function rather than having a direct effect on infections and on cancer cells. In addition, various bioactive materials derived from plants exhibit an immunomodulatory ability [ [18](#B18)]. Therefore, we propose that BA may be another valuable immunomodulator. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether BA affects mouse innate and adaptive immunity, which may lay fundamental groundwork for BA-based drug development. Materials and Methods Chemicals and antibodies Preparation of BA Plant material Extraction, synthesis, and identification of BA [Fig. 1](#F1)). Animals and experiment designs Effects of BA on the immune apparatus index Lymphocyte proliferation assay Determination of plaque forming cells (PFC) Determination of anti-SRBC antibodies in mouse serum [1](#B1)]. The titre of 2-mercaptoethanol-resistant antibody was roughly equivalent to that due to IgG in the serum, and thus the greater titre obtained without 2-mercaptoethanol was due to IgM. We found that serum from non-immunized mice didn't contain macrophage neutral red dye uptake assay Peritoneal macrophage culture Neutral red uptake assay Cytokine levels by ELISA assays Measurement of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 concentrations in mouse serum Measurement of TNF- concentration in macrophage culture supernatants Statistical analysis Results Effects of BA on the immune apparatus index [Fig. 2](#F2)shows that the thymus indices of the mice in the high dose group (1 mg/kg body weight) and the spleen indices of the mice in the medium and high dose groups (0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg body weight) were increased compared to those of the control group. Effect of BA on proliferative response of splenocytes to Con A and LPS [Fig. 3](#F3)shows that BA caused a significant increase in proliferative response in Con A- and/or LPS-stimulated splenocytes; in particular, proliferation of splenocytes was dramatically increased in a dose-dependent manner after stimulation with Con A and LPS together. BA-treated splenocytes cultured in absence of mitogens did not show any significant proliferative effect. Effect of BA on the humoral response of SRBC-immunized mice [Fig. 4](#F4)), and the 1 mg/kg dose of BA had the most significant effect on PFC. Moreover, the production of total and 2-mercaptoethanol-resistant anti-SRBC serum haemagglutinins (IgM and ( [Fig. 5](#F5)). was reduced by was reduced 15.5% BA-treated groups (0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 [Fig. 6](#F6)shows that the macrophage phagocytic activity was significantly increased by BA at the medium and high doses (0.5 mg /kg and 1 mg/kg) compared to the control group. No significant effects of BA on macrophage phagocytic activity were observed in mice at the dose of 0.25 mg/kg body weight. Effect of BA on thymocyte and splenocyte subpopulations [Fig. 7](#F7), the and splenic ratios of CD4+/CD8+ were significantly increased in BA-treated mice, whereas percentage of CD8+ splenocytes was significantly decreased compared to the control group. There were no obvious changes in the percentage of total T cells (CD3+) and CD4+ T cells. As shown in [Fig. 8](#F8), the percentage of CD4+CD8- thymocytes in BA-treated groups (0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg and mg/kg) was significantly increased by 8.81%, 11.37%, and 14.8%, respectively, while there were no significant changes in the percentage of CD8+CD4- and CD8-CD4- T cells, nor in the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells. Effect of BA on cytokine levels [Fig. 9](#F9), the peritoneal macrophages TNF- level was significantly increased in all BA-treated groups compared to the control group. In contrast, the serum concentration of IL-2 and IL-6 decreased significantly at the 0.5 mg/kg dose. No significant changes in the IL-10 serum level were observed in mice with or without BA treatment. Discussion [14](#B14)]. In the past few years, the percentage and ratio of two main lymphocyte T subsets, namely CD4+ cells or T helpers, and CD8+ or cytotoxic T cells, have been recognized as the most meaningful parameters for evaluating the balanced state of immunomodulation and response to homeostasis of the intrinsic immune system [ [9](#B9)]. Previous studies have shown that some extractions from plants possess immune-stimulating capacity by increasing the percentage of CD4+ cells or CD4+/CD8+ ratio [ [4](#B4), [14](#B14)]. The present study provided similar a result showing significant increase in the percentage of CD4+ cells (Th cells) in thymus and the splenic ratios of CD4+/CD8+ in BA-treated groups. Furthermore, the percentage of CD19+ cells (total B cell) was increased in the spleen of mice exposed to BA. As a result, an increase in the relative number of T and B cells could possibly result in stimulating the immune response in BA-treated mice. [8](#B8)]. The functions of these subsets of T cells depend upon the specific types of cytokines that are generated, for example, IL-2, IFN-, and TNF- by Th1 cells in contrast IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 by Th2 cells. immunoregulatory cytokine, which potentially suppresses Th1 functions such as the production of proinflammatory cytokines. These cytokines can dramatically affect not only the strength of the immune response, but also its character [ [21](#B21), [29](#B29)]. BA, an inhibitor be a modulator of cytokine production in Th1/Th2 cells. In our research, it was shown that BA significantly inhibited IL-2 (Th1) and slightly increased IL-10 (Th2) production. This observation suggests that BA has a mixed Th1 and Th2 adjuvant activity. However, its relative immunomodulatory effect turned out to be higher for Th2 as evidenced by a significant reduction in IL-2/IL-10 ratios, which is consistent with previous reports [ [30](#B30), [31](#B31)]. This data indicates that the compound stimulatory signals produced by immune cells decreased with the parallel increase in the inhibitory signals. On the hand, the serum level of IL-6 was decreased by BA. It is well-known that inappropriate regulation of IL-6 plays a protective as well as a deleterious role in antigen-specific immune-mediated diseases as characterized by low-grade inflammation [ [16](#B16), [17](#B17)]. IL-6 can also exert multiple stimulatory effects on cell growth and inflammation [ [26](#B26)], and it is involved in the initiation and maintenance of the acute phase inflammatory response in immunoregulation and non-immune events in cells and tissues outside the immune system [ [11](#B11)]. [31](#B31)]. However, further studies are required for conclusive correlations. [3](#B3)]. We found that BA also caused an increase in macrophage phagocytic activity. Some previous studies demonstrated that some agents of plant origin could enhance the capacity of the mononuclear phagocyte system resulting in stimulating host non-specific immunity [ [27](#B27), [28](#B28)]. Therefore, BA seems to enhance the antigen-presentation effect of macrophages by directly promoting phagocytosis capacity. Exposure to BA also caused an alteration in the serum levels of immunoglobulins. It is interesting to observe that BA was able to reduce the levels of IgM and IgG in mice. Since the concentration of immunoglobulins is associated with various pathological changes such as inflammation, activation of complement, and immune complex adhesion and immune deregulation, the decrease of IgM and IgG serum levels by BA can help attenuate "}
