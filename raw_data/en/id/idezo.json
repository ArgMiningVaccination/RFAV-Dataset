Although considered \"alternative\" medicine, here in the Western Hemisphere, Eastern Healing is focused on treating the patient by finding the cause of their primary discomfort. The tools we use to correct these problems are acupuncture, herbal therapy, lifestyle adjustments and Chinese massage. Each of these practices have one thing in common: they rely on the body's innate ability to heal itself by removing obstacles and stimulating the healing power of channeling the body's energy, or chi. Thank you for all your help with baby #2 - James arrived on April 29th our days are so much brighter! Big brother, Matthew just loves his little brother. You are so wonderful at what you do - thank you for helping me achieve a dream that has come true. After only two months of Acupuncture sessions, I have experienced a turnaround. During my first session, I felt a change and I had renewed energy for exercising. I have noticed changes in my posture, and have been sleeping soundly without the aid of prescription medication. My only regret is that I did not try this earlier. I am recommending Peter to friends and co-workers because I feel so strongly about the treatment and results.
