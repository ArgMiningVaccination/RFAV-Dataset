One of the major growth areas for DNA vaccination is the development of an efficient and effective formulation and DNA plasmid delivery technology that is cost effective and commercially viable. Cochleates are a unique stable, multilayered, essentially anhydrous lipid -crystal nano -particle that, following either oral or systemic delivery, safely and efficaciously delivers drugs and oligonucleotides to target tissues. MAT2203, an orally -administered, encochleated formulation of amphotericin B, (CAMB)) has commenced a Phase 2a clinical study, funded and led by the NIAID. Relative to oligonucleotides, in early stage studies, cochleates successfully formulate and mediate in vitro and in vivo delivery and efficacy of potential oligonucleotide based therapies, including DNA plasmids. Results: Oral Administration of HIV -1 DNA cochleates: of plasmid pCMV HIV-1 containing 3.5\u00b5g or 17\u00b5g of DNA were given to BALB/c mice by oral or intramuscular routes. Cytotoxicity Oral administration of two 3.5\u00b5g or 17\u00b5g doses yielded strong splenocyte cytolytic responses (73 to 85% specific lysis at an E:T ratio of 100:1) analogous to intramuscular injection. Oral administration of a higher dose (50\u00b5g) of naked DNA, was inactive. Proliferation Low doses (3.5\u00b5g) of orally administered encochleated DNA induced antigen specific splenocyte proliferation 8 -11 fold above background, similar to intramuscular. Naked plasmid was negative. Adjuvant Enhancement: HSV -2 HSV -2 gD2 (pc DNA 3.1 vector backbone) and two IL12 plasmids (equal mixture of the p35 and HSV -specific cytolytic T cell responses than Herpes infection, as well as enhancement of T helper 1 cellular responses and antibody. These studies affirmed that co-administration of cytokines can enhance the immunogenicity of a DNA -based vaccine. Naked DNA was inactive. Conclusion: Plasmid -Cochleate formulations show promise as commercially viable oral and systemic vaccines . Cochleate delivery vehicles have been shown to mediate oral bioavailability for injectable drugs , reduce toxicity , and significantly enhance intracellular delivery . Cochleates are stable, lipid -crystal, nano -particles composed of simple, naturally occurring materials: phosphatidylserine and calcium. They have a unique multilayered structure consisting of a large, continuous, solid, lipid bilayer sheet rolled up in a spiral or as stacked sheets, with no internal aqueous space. This unique structure provides protection from degradation for \"encochleated\" molecules. Components within the interior of the cochleate remain intact, even though the outer layers of the cochleate may be exposed to harsh environmental conditions or enzymes. How Cochleates Encapsulate Drugs C D Formation of Stable Drug -Cochleate Nano -CrystalCalcium Interaction with Negatively Charged LipidFormation of Stable Drug -Liposome Intermediate The API is associated with the negatively charged lipid. The addition of calcium creates a calcium- phospholipid anhydrous crystal. Nano -crystals are composed of layers of a lipid -calcium complex. The API is trapped in or between the layers protecting the API from harmful environmental elementsCalcium Interaction with Negatively Charged LipidFormation of Stable Drug -Cochleate -CrystalFormation of Stable Drug -Liposome IntermediateMacrophage readily engulf cochleates and their cargo Once inside the macrophage, the low level of calcium in the cytoplasm causes the cochleate to open, releasing the cargo moleculeCell-Targeted Delivery Divalent cation concentrations in vivo in serum and mucosal secretions are such that the cochleate structure is maintained. Hence, the majority of cochleate associated molecules are present in the inner layers of a solid, stable, impermeable structure. Once within the interior of a cell, however, the low calcium concentration results in the opening of the cochleate crystal and release of the entrapped API . ABSTRACT COCHLEATE TECHNOLOGY MacrophageFree Drug Free drug in the extracellular milieu must cross the cell membrane in order to be effective against intracellular microorganisms. High plasma and interstitial drug levels are needed. A relatively low percentage of circulating drug enters the cell. Drugs with these properties have difficulty treating intracellular infections. High circulating drug levels can result in nonspecific toxicity. Drug -Cochleate MacrophageFree Drug High calcium concentrations in gastrointestinal secretions, serum and interstitial fluid stabilize the drug-cochleate crystal. Drug cochleates enter the circulatory system, diffuse into tissues and/or are taken up by \"activated\" and/or infected cells. Intracellular levels of drug -cochleates increase and reach high levels. The low intracellular calcium concentration causes the drug- cochleates to open releasing their cargo the cochleates. Lower plasma levels are required to reach efficacious intracellular drug concentrations. These lower plasma levels may result in less systemic toxicity.Model of Drug Delivery - The \"Trojan Horse\" HypothesisTraditional Model of Drug Delivery Cochleates Can Change the Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution of Drugs These studies represent a collaboration among several investigators.

HSV -2 gD2 DNA (made with the pc DNA 3.1 vector backbone) were mixed with encochleated or naked plasmid IL- 12 DNA (made using the pED vector backbone). The IL -12 plasmid DNA consists of an equal mixture of two plasmid DNAs coding for the p35 and p40 subunits. The gDDNA or pc DNA 3.1 were administered at 25 mg/dose. IL -12 (each heterodimer plasmid) and pED plasmids were administered at 35 mg/dose. Mice were immunized via the i.m. route with either the naked or encochleated vaccine mixtures at weeks 0, 4 and 8. Four weeks post the last immunization the mice were sacrificed, and spleens and serum samples collected. Mice : Eight week old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA) and were maintained in microisolators. All animal protocols employed in this study met with established Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee guidelines.ELISPOT analysis of cytokine secretion : Spleen cells were restimulated in vitro with inactivated HSV for four days, then the viable cells plated in wells of nitrocellulose plates which had been coated with capture antibody specific for either murine IFNg or IL4. After a 20 hour incubation, cells were washed from the wells and the appropriate biotinylated anti -cytokine antibody added. Wells were washed after an overnight incubation and the peroxidase conjugated goat anti -biotin antibody added. Following a 3 hour incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the AEC substrate was added. The reaction was stopped by washing the wells with tap water. Spots were counted using a dissecting microscope . Immunization of Immulon II were coated with gD, then washed and blocked prior to addition of serial two -fold dilutions of sera. After 1 hr at room temperature, plates were washed prior to the addition of biotinylated secondary antibody specific for either murine IgG1 or IgG2a. Following a 1 hrincubation at room temperature, the plates were washed and HRP -conjugated streptavidin was added to each well for a further 1 hour, then washed again prior to addition of the ABTS substrate. Resulting color was quantitated at 405 nm using a Biotek plate reader. Endpoint titers were defined as being 2 stddeviations above the average OD of the sera obtained from naive mice.CTL Assay: Spleen cell suspensions were restimulated with UV - irradiated, HSV infected autologous spleen cells. After 5 days of culture, the viable cell concentrations were adjusted to the cell concentration yielding the desired effector cell number and 100 ml aliquots added to wells of a round bottom 96 -well plate. Each dilution was plated in triplicate. A20 targets cells, HSV -infected or uninfected, were labeled with 51Cr, then added to the wells in 100 ulaliquots. After a 4 hour incubation, 100 ml were harvested from wells and the gamma emissions counted. Specific release was determined by the following formula: Specific Release = (Experimental CPM - Spontaneous Release CPM) X 100 (Total 5 pED Coch < 5 pc3.1 < Neutralization : titer microneutralization assay method. Test sera were heat inactivated for 30 min at 56\u00b0C, and then subjected to serial 2 -fold dilution. An equal volume of HSV2 was added to each dilution. Guinea pig complement was also included. Mixtures were incubated for 1hr at 37 \u00b0C (5% CO2) with then directly onto confluent Vero cell monolayers in 96 -well plates. Virus, medium and complement controls were included in each assay. Following incubation, cells were overlaid with incubated at 37 \u00b0C (5% CO2) until approximately 50 plaques could be counted in virus control wells. Plaques were enumerated and titers were defined as the reciprocal dilution of the last serum dilution yielding a greater than 50% plaque reductionDNA Cochleate 17ug Oral x 2 DNA Cochleate 3.5ug Oral x 2 DNA Cochleate 17ug IM x 1 Naked DNA 50ug IM x 1 naiveCytotoxicity (%) (1 of 100:1). nakedDNA, did not induc e antige n specific cytolytic activity above ba ckground.
