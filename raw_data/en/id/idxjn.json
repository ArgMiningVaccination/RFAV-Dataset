Reforms introduced in the sixteenthcentury distinguished the Church of England as an ec-clesiastical body separate from the Church of Rome.These changes, catalyzed by King Henry VIII's several marriages in his attempt to secure a male heir, weregrounded in reforms set in motion by Protestants. Thomas Cranmer, whom Henry VIII appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury, the chief clergyman ofEngland, supported making the Bible accessible inEnglish translation and wrote the first Book of Common Prayer in 1549 with set services in English. He and other reformers, prompted by a desire to re-turn to the Christianity of the church councils of thefirst five centuries, carved out an Anglican identity thatcomprised a unique blend of Roman, Lutheran,Reformed, and Orthodox elements. 1Their reforms were consolidated by Queen Elizabeth I, who tookpains to see that bishops maintained a continuous lineof succession from the earliest times.

Even as this uniquelyAmerican church retained ties with the motherchurch, it broke significant new ground in that it was independent of a state connection and in-cluded laypersons, along with bishops andclergy, in its governance. 5Today the Episcopal Church includes about 2.5 million members. In2000, the Episcopal Church and the EvangelicalLutheran Church in America ratified a concor-dat establishing a closer relationship betweenthem, although they remain separate bodies.The Episcopal Church also continues to partici- pate in ecumenical conversations with otherChristian churches, including the Presbyterian,Roman Catholic, and Orthodox. 6 The branches of the Anglican Communion in countries around the world are united by theirties to the Church of England through a structurethat includes regular meetings of the heads of thenational churches, an Anglican ConsultativeCouncil, a meeting every ten years of all diocesanbishops called the Lambeth Conference, andrecognition of the Archbishop of Canterbury asthe head of the communion. The branches of thecommunion have worship traditions in continuitywith the Book of Common Prayer in versions dis- tinctive to each and share an historic episcopate.The Thirty Nine Articles, a confessional statement adopted by the Church of England in the six-teenth century, is an important benchmark inAnglican theology, but the communion tends notto define itself confessionally. 7Richard Hooker, a sixteenth-century theologian, set out the leadingAnglican view that theological judgments are tobe grounded in the authority of Scripture and reason in light of the understanding and practicesof the Christian tradition. 8Historically, Anglicanism has been comprehensive, includingAnglo-Catholics, Evangelicals, and Liberals inone communion and fellowship. Spiritual libertyhas been important to Anglicans, and they haveexhibited considerable variation in belief withoutcensure. This is evident from the work of suchvaried Anglican theologians and writers as JeremyTaylor, John Donne, John Locke, Joseph Butler, Samuel Johnson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, F. D.Maurice, William Temple, Charles Gore, EvelynUnderhill, T. S. Eliot, C. S. Lewis, and JosephFletcher. The governance of the Episcopal Church is carried out by a bicameral legislature comprisedof the House of Deputies, which includes bothlaypersons and clergy, and the House ofBishops. They meet and deliberate separately atthe major gathering of the church, the GeneralConvention, which is held every three years.Either house may initiate resolutions, but theconcurrence of both is required for their adop-tion. Between sessions of the GeneralConvention, the work of the church is carried onby an elected Executive Council of forty mem-bers and the Presiding Bishop, who is elected for a nine-year term by the House of Bishopswith the concurrence of the House of Deputies. The Episcopal Church includes 100 dioceses within the United States and eight more outsidethe country. These are closely affiliated to main-tain common doctrine, discipline, and worship.Following its understanding of the apostolic suc- cession, each diocese is led by a bishop consecrat-ed in the historic episcopate. In 1976, the GeneralConvention of the Episcopal Church approved theordination of women to the priesthood, and in 2 THEEPISCOPAL TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS1988, the first female priest was elected bishop. Each diocese also has a legislative body com-prised of clergy and elected representatives ofcongregations; this body meets annually andelects the diocesan bishop with the concurrenceof all other bishops. Also common to each dioceseis a standing committee of clergy and laity thatshares in the governance of the diocese with thebishop and committees and boards that pursuevarious spiritual, liturgical, educational, social,and missionary programs. Self-supporting congre-gations are governed by an elected vestry that,with the concurrence of the local bishop, calls asits pastor a priest, known as the rector, who isresponsible for pastoral oversight and administra-tion of the parish. Anglican moral theologians and ethicists have differed widely in approaches and em-phases, including among their number casuists,natural law theorists, principlists, consequen-tialists, liberal individualists,and situation ethicists. They tend to agree thatthe community, with its past wisdom and expe-rience, shapes the individual conscience and provides the framework of moral values fromwhich reason operates. 9A distinctively Anglican form of casuistry sprang up in the sixteenthcentury and continues to provide a leading formof moral thinking within the communion. Itsoriginators viewed this \"casuistical divinity\" asa comprehensive moral science that includednot only the resolution of specific conflicts ofconscience but also a systematic body of teach-ing. 10They rejected a Roman Catholic approach focused on applying canon law to cases, insteaddeveloping broader accounts of Christian faithand life that often combined the moral and theascetical, i.e. the practices of religion or what isoften spoken of today as \"spirituality.\" 11In par- ticular, the casuists dismissed the \"probabilism\"of the Jesuits, which held that any probableopinion could justify a moral choice, even if theopposite opinion were more probable. Insteadthey declared that the more reasonable opinionshould be chosen \"in the whole conjunction ofcircumstances and relative considerations.\" 12This reformed casuistry was succeeded in the seventeenth century by an approach groundedmore firmly in general moral principles, even asit revealed an empirical strain that took accountof the complexity of moral life. 13Anglican evan- gelicals and social reformers of the eighteenthand nineteenth century used this approach tocampaign relentlessly for social reforms and in-dustrial legislation designed to ameliorate hard-ship and injustices suffered by the poor. 14The quest for a distinctively Anglican moral theologywas continued in the twentieth century byKenneth Kirk, who applauded the theological tolerance typical of Anglicanism. 15\"Situation ethics,\" introduced by Joseph Fletcher in themiddle of the twentieth century, 16utilized a form of casuistry holding that love is the only moralnorm, the end justifies the means, and decisionsought to be made in view of the uniqueness ofeach situation. Although it provoked a storm ofprotest from Anglican and other Christian moralthinkers, it added yet another moral approachattractive to some Episcopalians. No single document expresses the final teachings of the Episcopal Church concerningbioethics and health care. Only canon lawpassed by the General Convention has bindingcharacter; canon law, however, generally ad- dresses matters of governance and does notspecifically address matters of health. The HolyBible assumes great importance as a source offundamental Anglican convictions concerningethical questions related to health care, exert-ing much of its influence through the Book of Common Prayer , with its largely biblical con- tent. 17Episcopalian understandings of ques- tions of medical ethics and health care havealso been enhanced by a variety of other writ-ings, including reports from the House ofBishops; pastoral letters from the presidingbishop and diocesan bishops; reports and spe-cial studies from standing commissions, com-mittees, and task forces of the GeneralConvention; resolutions of the GeneralConvention; reports and special studies fromExecutive Council committees; and articles and 3 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERbooks by Episcopal scholars at seminaries and other academic institutions. The Standing Commission on National Concerns of the General Convention includesamong its concerns issues that until 1997 hadbeen the responsibility of the Standing Commission on Human Affairs and Health, par-ticularly questions of health and bioethics. In2000, an End-of-Life Task Force of the standingcommission published a report that has been cir-culated widely as a teaching document within theEpiscopal Church and the wider AnglicanCommunion. 18The Task Force on Ethics and the New Genetics of the Executive Council is ex-pected to complete a report on genetic testing,gene transfer, and their connections with the newreproductive technologies and cloning in 2003 orlater. It will also consider ethical questions sur-rounding stem cell research. The Committee onMedical Ethics of the Diocese of Washington has published several books related to health careand bioethics that have provided additional re-sources for members of the Episcopal Church.They address advance directives (with a service for a time when life-sustaining treatment is with-drawn), assisted suicide and euthanasia, care ofthose who are critically ill and dying, and genetictesting and counseling. 19 Episcopalians also take heed of the reports and pastoral letters of the Lambeth Conference of theAnglican Communion, 20resolutions of the General Synod of the Church of England, reports of its Board for Social Responsibility,21and resolutions and reports from other branches of the Anglicancommunion. These wide-ranging resources revealthe mind of the church, but none is considered ju-ridically binding upon Episcopalians. The value of the human body is stressed, not denied, in Anglican thought. The commun- ion teaches that the incarnation\u2014the belief thatGod became human, thus experiencing human life in body, as well as mind and spirit\u2014indicatesthat human embodiment is important. This, inturn, means that we are to care for our bodies astemples of God. We are to promote our physicalhealth by seeking medical treatment, engagingin preventive care, following healthy diets, per-forming regular exercise, and avoiding substanceabuse. 22 Healthcare professionals play an important role in assisting individuals to achieve those ends.Given the importance of the values of fidelity andcommunity in Anglicanism, the End-of-Life TaskForce declared, the patient-healthcare profes- sional relationship should be one that is collabo-rative and collegial. 23Professionals should establish caring relationships with the sick andsuffering, recognizing that human beings are notisolated atoms, but are essentially social in nature.They are, as Hooker observed, \"sociable parts united into one body . . . bound each to serveunto other's good.\" 24Thus, service to others, in- cluding caring for those with impaired health,and consideration of the good of the whole areimportant Episcopalian values. Patient values and preferences play an impor- tant role in medical care decision making forEpiscopalians. The Anglican tradition recognizesthat adults with the capacity to make decisionshave the right and responsibility to choose amongtreatment options and to refuse available treat-ments when they consider doing so morally ap-propriate. 25Individual autonomy, for Anglicans, is set within the context of our relation with Godand others. This means that we are not only freeto choose, but to choose in ways that are rootedin our lives in community and in God's purposes.This emphasis on individual choice with regard to care of the body is grounded in the recognition ofhuman dignity. Such dignity derives from thespecial relationship in which each human being 4 THEEPISCOPAL TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSTHE INDIVIDUAL AND THE PATIENT -CAREGIVER RELATIONSHIPstands to God, rather than any particular qualities that an individual may possess. The dignity ofeach person means, the noted theologian WilliamTemple stated, that \"the Church must make re- spect for freedom its most fundamental principleof action.\" 26 Healthcare professionals are also individuals of great worth whose choices must be respected.When patient healthcare requests would violate the moral or religious principles of healthcareproviders, they should seek other caregiverswilling to carry out those requests and shouldtransfer such patients to their care. Carrying outsuch transfers exhibits respect for the freedomand responsibility of patients to make importantdecisions about their own health care. 27 Healing is not only of the body. The General Convention of 1991 observed that healing is ofthe whole person\u2014spirit, mind, and body. 28 Therefore, others in addition to healthcare profes- sionals can offer an efficacious ministry of spiritand mind. A church commission has recognizedthat along with healthcare professionals, clergyand spiritual healers serve as agents throughwhom God works to achieve human health. 29 CLINICAL ISSUES ANDPROCEDURES Informed consent Anglicans share the conviction that healthcareprofessionals should speak openly with patientsabout their condition and therapeutic alterna-tives. They should inform them of the probablebenefits and risks of available treatment options and give them the opportunity to give or to with-hold their consent to a chosen course of ther-apy. 30Disclosure of information and observations by healthcare professionals, the End-of-Life TaskForce observed, should take account of the indi- vidual patient's worldview, cultural background,and moral framework. \"The need to be sensitiveto our relational, as well as our informationalneeds may be particularly important outside ageneralized Anglo and middle-class culture.\" 31 Parents should serve as custodians for chil-dren for whom healthcare decisions must be made, acting with a commitment to their physi-cal, emotional, and spiritual well-being. There isa presumption that ordinarily their decisionsrepresent considered judgments about the goodof the child. 32The End-of-Life Task Force recog- nized that decisions about medical care for chil-dren are appropriately made by their parents inmost cases \"because of the love that binds themtogether and because they have a history of lifetogether in which they have shared values, joys,and sorrows.\" 33Children who are very young cannot be considered capable of participating indecisions on their behalf. As they mature, how-ever, they can make thoughtful and fitting deci-sions about their care. Most physicians andmedical ethicists recognize the importance ofseeking the assent\u2014rather than consent\u2014of achild who is sufficiently mature to participate in decisions directly affecting her health, physicalintegrity, or possible death. 34 Truth-telling and confidentiality The Anglican tradition stresses both honesty\u2014ac- curately speaking what one believes to be thetruth\u2014and candor\u2014volunteering information ofrelevance when not specifically asked for\u2014inhealth care. 35Patients cannot carry out their re- sponsibilities to make healthcare decisions with-out accurate information. Furthermore, honestcommunication among persons is fundamental toChristian life, for unless we acknowledge the dig-nity, personhood, and status of others as neighborsto be treated openly and honestly, we fail in ourduty to promote right relationships with others. There are important issues of timing and wording that arise when caregivers communicatetroubling news. To speak the truth in love(Ephesians 4:15) requires professionals to avoiduttering the truth in ways that can terrify or es-trange a vulnerable person. 36Moreover, the fail- ure to be trustworthy and to retain confidenceserodes any relationship. Therefore, confidential-ity is also demanded as a component of the rela-tionship between healthcare professional andpatient. 37 5 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERThe importance of the physical nature of mar- riage is emphasized in the words of an early English service, spoken by the man as he placesa ring on the finger of the woman's hand, \"Withthis ring, I thee wed: with my body I thee wor-ship.\" Richard Hooker, the noted sixteenth-cen-tury Anglican theologian, commented about thisphrase: Parties married have not anie longer intire power over them selves but ech hath interest in others person, it cannot be thought an absurd constructionto saie that worshipping with the bodie is the im-parting of that interest in the bodie unto anotherwhich none before had save onlie our selves. 38 John Donne, in his sermons, reiterated the Anglican view that the joining of two persons,body and soul, in matrimony is not inferior, un- worthy, or unclean. 39Sexuality is to be tied to the embrace and care of the other in a lovingrelationship. There is considerable difference of opinion within the Episcopal Church and the AnglicanCommunion in general about the moral accept-ability of homosexual relations. Despite suchdisagreement, the Episcopal Church has beengenerally supportive of the needs of lesbian andgay persons and has remained open to contin-ued study and dialogue about human sexuality. 40 In 1991, the General Convention adopted a res-olution affirming that \"physical sexual expres-sion is appropriate only within the lifelongmonogamous 'union of husband and wife inheart, body, and mind' intended by God for theirmutual joy.\" 41In 1994, a document from the House of Bishops, Continuing the Dialogue , was endorsed for purposes of study by the GeneralConvention. 42In 2000, the Cambridge Accord was endorsed by the General Convention.43This document, developed by bishops of the AnglicanCommunion in 1999, stated that no homosexualperson should be deprived of liberty, personalproperty, or civil rights because of his or hersexual orientation, that acts of violence and degradation against homosexual persons arewrong, and that every human being deserves tobe treated with dignity and respect. The 2000 General Convention, in response to a call for di- alogue by the Lambeth Conference of 1998,reaffirmed that those on various sides of thiscontroversial issue \"have a place in the Church\"and vowed to continue the process of mutualdiscernment concerning human sexuality. 44It also stated that those who are living together incommitted relationships should avoid promiscu-ity, exploitation, and abusiveness. 45Further, it called on congregations to establish \"safespaces\" for lesbians and gays. 46 Marriage, grounded in mutual trust, accept- ance, and service, is not exclusively a private mat-ter within the Anglican tradition, but is alsorooted in the community. In the twentieth cen-tury the Anglican Communion tempered an ear-lier emphasis on procreation as a primary end ofmarriage, adopting a more explicit recognitionthat mutual affection, support, and care are at itscore. In so doing, it set aside a position derivedfrom Augustine's view of sexual intercourse,which considered it illicit unless excused by theintent to procreate. The 1979 Book of Common Prayerrecognizes the need of married persons to complement and fulfill each other and to estab-lish a durable partnership. This is in accord withthe early Christian tradition, in which marriagewas closely tied to companionship. 47Thus, the Book of Common Prayer of 1979 sees marriage as primarily grounded in the commitment of manand woman to love one another, for better orworse, regardless of the consequences. The pur-poses of marriage, according to \"The Celebrationand Blessing of a in the . . when it is God'swill.\" 48This suggests that, in some situations, which are not necessarily confined to infertility, itmay not be God's will that a married couple havechildren. 6 THEEPISCOPAL TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSFAMILY , SEXUALITY , AND PROCREATIONYet the Anglican tradition also recognizes that children are a blessing and a joy in marriage. Children are cherished not only as symbols ofthe mutual commitment of couples, but also asbeings with their own integrity and uniqueness. In the Anglican tradition, couples are gifted withchildren, rather than entitled to them. Parents serve as their procreators rather than their cre-ators, meaning that children are not their par-ents' possessions, products, or projects, but theirtrusts. 49Children are beings with a fundamental human dignity who should not be seen as exten-sions of the self or a means of securing identity.They are precious gifts from God who are not to be acquired or specifically designed to meet parental desires or standards of \"quality control.\" CLINICAL ISSUES ANDPROCEDURES Contraception Until the last century, no efficient and reliablemeans of birth control were available, and conse-quently pregnancy and childbirth were the usualresults of sexual intercourse. The use of contra-ception was considered illicit. Jeremy Taylor, forone, expressed the older Anglican view that sexualappetite should not be separated from the ends forwhich it was intended by nature, including the de-sire for children. 50The Anglican Communion, however, introduced a new openness to the use ofcontraception at the Lambeth Conference of1930, indicating that couples could, without moralonus, pursue responsible family planning to con-trol the number and spacing of children. TheLambeth report was subsequently reaffirmed byseveral General Conventions of the EpiscopalChurch, which noted that responsible parenthoodrequires wise stewardship of the resources andabilities of the family, as well as consideration ofthe varying population needs of society and theclaims of future generations. 51 Sterilization What is at stake in sterilization is not just the in- tegrity of the body, but also social relations withothers, including our spouse, family and society.52 Reasons that these relations might justify a deci- sion to employ sterilization, according to aChurch of England working party, include theneed for lower population growth in a commu-nity, the need of a family adequately to providefor its members, and the need of parents for per-sonal satisfaction in one another. 53Sterilization might also appropriately be considered by thosewho wish to avoid conceiving children becausethey are concerned that they would pass on a se-rious genetic mutation. 54Important questions that those considering this procedure should askare: Is sterilization the least drastic means avail-able to attain a necessary end? Has the decisionbeen a collaborative one? Has the person in- volved considered the effects of sterilization onhis or her identity and self-image? 55 This reasoning, however, does not justify compulsory sterilization. The forced sterilizationof families in the People's Republic of Chinawas deplored in a 1994 General Convention res-olution. 56Sterilization of those who are develop- mentally disabled, an English working partyobserved, offers them only incomplete protec-tion from sexual abuse. 57We would do better to integrate such persons \"into the life of the com-munity, providing such support and protectionas they need in the conduct of their lives,\" theworking party stated. Moreover, our history ofeugenic sterilization does not provide reason tobelieve that we would use this technique wisely in the future to select persons to be sterilized.Smith maintains that \"compulsory sterilization iswrong, then, because it involves serious risks tothe person of the patient, because of its dubiouseffect and necessity, and because it is unclearthat we can formulate criteria for its fair use.\" 58 New reproductive technologies Questions related to alternative ways of having children have been significant within the Episcopal Church, for they raise the basic ques-tion of where to draw limits on human controlover natural processes. The General Convention of 1982 approved the use of in vitro fertilization 7 THEPARKRIDGE CENTER(IVF), or fertilization of an egg with sperm in a laboratory dish to create a human embryo thatis implanted in a woman's uterus for marriedcouples experiencing infertility. 59Couples con- sidering the use of such reproductive technolo-gies should seek the advice and assistance of a qualified professional counselor, the 1991General Convention recommended. 60Moreover, it added, during their deliberations they shouldconsider adoption. The use of artificial insemi-nation by married couples\u2014the impregnation ofa woman with the husband's sperm by medicalor other artificial means\u2014was affirmed by theStanding Commission on Human Affairs andHealth in 1988. 61The General Convention, how- ever, has not passed a resolution to support theuse of this reproductive technique. The Episcopal Church has not endorsed new reproductive technologies that introduce thirdparty donors into the creation of children. The1988 General Convention considered artificial in-semination by donor problematic. 62The Standing Commission on Health and Human Affairs of1988 provided preliminary reflections suggestingthat it was morally questionable to hide knowl-edge of their biological parent from the resultingchildren and to allow a donor \"to refuse moral and legal responsibility for a future child that hisor her choice helped procreate.\" Moreover, re-vealing the identity of the donor, the commissionopined, raises \"difficult issues of parenting, familyidentification for the child, and, potentially, legalissues of parental responsibility.\" 63The use of a third party can severely complicate parenting andstrain the marital relationship for the spouse whodid not contribute gametes to the creation of thefuture child, the commission maintained. The General Convention in 1982 and in 1988 rejected another practice involving the use ofthird parties, surrogate parenthood\u2014contractingwith a woman to be impregnated with a male'ssperm, bear the resulting child, and deliver thatchild to the contracting man and his wife. 64The Standing Commission on Human Affairs andHealth pointed out in 1988 that this practiceposes physical risks to the surrogate and raisesthe possibility that she will be exploited eco- nomically. 65The commission called for more complete study of this and other new forms ofreproductive technology by the church, keepingin mind the distinctive Christian vision of sexu-ality, marriage, and parenting. The standing commission advised that the use of the new reproductive technologies by singlewomen to have children of their own raises a se-rious moral problem, for the resulting child suf- fers the deprivation of having only one knownparent. Therefore, it is inadvisable. 66 The Executive Council Task Force on Ethics and the New Genetics is developing a report onethical questions related to the uses of the newreproductive technologies and cloning. Its com-pletion is expected in 2003 or later. Uses of human embryos There is no unanimous view within the Anglican tradition about the moral status of the humanembryo. Some maintain that the same protectionshould be accorded to the newly fertilized egg asto a born human being because the unique ge-netic component of an individual is largely estab-lished at conception. The same individual subjectis present throughout the process of prenatal de-velopment, they maintain, for they can find noobvious threshold beyond conception by which todiscern when the embryo should be considereddistinctively different and thus an individualhuman. 67Others hold that because the early em- bryo may divide during its first two weeks intotwo or more separate fragments, each of whichcan develop into a distinct human being, thephysical basis for human individuality is not set-tled until the primitive streak has formed atabout two weeks and the destination of the cellsis settled. 68Some in this latter group are also re- luctant to accept conception as the point at whicha living human being is present because a largeproportion of embryos (in the range of 75 per-cent) is aborted spontaneously early in pregnancy.They find it difficult to accept that God calls human beings into life at conception and then al-lows three-quarters of them to die soon after. 8 THEEPISCOPAL TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSThe Standing Commission on Human Affairs and Health stated in 1988 that Christianthought widely judges the use of human em-bryos for experimentation to be immoral andwent on to say that it could not affirm such ex-perimentation for members of the Church. 69The commission also rejected freezing fertilizedhuman ova \"for later thawing, experimentation,possible implantation, or discard\" on groundsthat the safety and efficacy of this procedurewere still in doubt. Ethical questions surrounding the use of human embryos in stem cell research are ex-pected to be addressed by the Executive CouncilTask Force on Ethics and the New Genetics in 2003 or later. Abortion The Episcopal Church generally takes the ques- tion of abortion as a matter of individual con-science, informed by the teachings of thechurch, the counsel of religious advisors, and the law. It opposes both abortion on demandand an absolute ban on abortion, tending tosupport it for the sake of the life or health of thewoman. The General Convention of 1994 reaf-firmed earlier statements that regard abortion ashaving a tragic dimension and as a practice tobe carried out only in extreme situations, not asa means of birth control, family planning, sex selection, or convenience. 70Those considering abortion are urged to seek the counsel of mem-bers of the Christian community and the sacra- mental life of the Church as they explorealternatives to abortion, including but not lim-ited to having and raising the child, asking an-other family member to raise the child, or givingup the child for adoption. Any proposed legisla-tion regarding abortion, the General Conventionof 1988 stated, must support respect for individ-ual conscience. 71The church's approach to abortion, however, has not been without its in-ternal critics, who maintain, among other points,that the church's position is self-contradictory inthat it affirms the sacredness of human life andyet allows the destruction of human fetal life. 72 In 1991, the General Convention opposed leg- islation requiring that parents be notified or re-quired to consent when a minor seeks anabortion, unless such laws allow the minor toconsult with a responsible adult outside thecourtroom setting when she is unable to notifyparents or where family dysfunction may put her\"at serious physical, psychological or emotionalrisk.\" In this context, a \"responsible adult\" is a person such as a clergy person, teacher, guidancecounselor, mental health professional, or otherfamily member. 73 There is a long tradition of thought withinAnglicanism that encourages us to pursue knowledge and develop more accurate ways of un-derstanding the natural world. The conviction thathumans are called to shape and renew the naturalorder undergirds Anglican moral thinking. 74As stewards of creation, humans are to mend andtransform the world in ways that accord withGod's purposes. In particular, we are to use our God-given capacities for scientific knowledge to alter the progression of disease. 75Yet our obliga-tions as trustees of God's creation also constrain our interventions into nature, requiring us to re-spect its integrity and order. The Christian tradi-tion sets out limits to what we may do with andfor our own bodies. There is common agreementthat they are not to be treated as mere instru-ments but are to be honored in their own right. 76 Therefore, we are to proceed cautiously with our efforts to understand and rework the humangenome, responding to disease and disability inways that fulfill God's intentions for us. 9 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERGENETICSCLINICAL ISSUES ANDPROCEDURES Gene therapy In 1985, the General Convention acknowledged the importance of research into the humangenome, recognizing its potential benefits evenas it noted the ethical concerns that such investi-gations raise. It encouraged \"genetic engineeringresearch to increase human understanding ofvital processes, recognizing that human DNA is agift of God, at the center of life and directing our development, growth and functioning.\" 77A 1988 report of the Standing Commission on HumanAffairs and Health endorsed studies involvinggene therapy that are approved by independent,adequately informed peer review boards and areintended for publication in recognized scientificjournals. 78In accord with these resolutions, the 1991 General Convention stated that there is notheological or ethical objection to gene therapythat is aimed at prevention or alleviation of seri-ous suffering and poses no undue risk to the pa-tient. 79It also indicated that the Episcopal Church has \"no theological or ethical objectionagainst the production and use of medicinal ma-terials by means of genetic manipulation fortherapeutic or diagnostic purposes aimed at theprevention or alleviation of serious suffering.\" 80 The question of whether to intervene into the germline by altering the genes of sperm, egg, orembryo to alter the genetic makeup, not only ofa new person but of that person's descendants, iscurrently under discussion within the EpiscopalChurch. If it can be used to eliminate terribledisease within a family, a prominent Episcopalthinker has maintained, that would be a gift ofGod that we should celebrate. 81However, the possibility of using this and other forms of ge-netic intervention to enhance tomorrow's chil-dren is troubling, not least because of thepossibility of the abuse of power and the impos-sibility of changing the results. Genetic testing and counseling As stewards of creation, we have an obligation topursue knowledge and to care for creation byusing our growing capacity for genetic testing in ways that serve God's purposes, a report fromthe Committee on Medical Ethics of the Dioceseof Washington stated. 82Yet in our brokenness, we may misuse this gift God has given us for ourown glory, power, and wealth. Therefore, we need to become aware not only of the benefitsof such testing, but also of its drawbacks for usas individuals and for our society. The manybenefits of genetic testing include that it may re- duce our anxiety and uncertainty, lead us to in-vestigate possible treatment or eliminate theneed for treatment, assist us in making decisionsabout the future, inform our decisions abouthaving children, and draw us closer together asfamilies. Yet such testing can also heighten ouranxiety, yield results that are difficult to inter-pret, create uncertainty, impair planning for thefuture, expose us to discrimination in insuranceand employment, and strain family relationships.The General Convention of 1991 recognized some of these disadvantages of genetic testingand maintained that \"the use of results of ge-netic screening of adults, newborns and the un-born for the purpose of discrimination in employment and insurance is unacceptable.\" 83 Consequently, deciding whether to undergo ge-netic testing is not easy. It is advisable for thosecontemplating it to call upon genetic and pas-toral counselors for assistance in decidingwhether to proceed. 84 It is also wise, the Committee on Medical Ethics of the Diocese of Washington observed,for us to discuss the possibility of testing before-hand with our family and to reach an under-standing about how other family members willrespond to our test results. 85The decision by one person in a family is not an isolated one,but has implications for other family membersas well. When a family has a history of a seriousgenetic disorder and one of its members testspositive for the relevant gene, others in the fam-ily will have to decide whether they, too, wish tolearn whether they have the gene. Thus, consul-tation with family members in advance can pre-pare others for the possibility that they, too, may 10 THEEPISCOPAL TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONShave to confront the decision whether to be tested. Genetic testing also creates certain social risks, for it opens the door to the reintroduction of eugenics into our community. Decisions byindividuals to use prenatal testing to abort fe-tuses with disabilities or unwanted characteris-tics might, when taken together, have adisastrous cumulative effect. They might create aculture in which those who are \"defective\" areweeded out, and only those who are deemed of excellent quality\u2014according to sometimes arbi-trary and perverted standards\u2014are consideredworthy of coming into the world. While it istempting to want to bring a \"perfect\" child intothe world, such a desire is unrealistic and un-charitable. Christians should embrace diversity within the human family and the equal value ofall of God's children as they work to overcomesocial stereotyping, the committee maintained. 86 The Episcopal Church has supported the useof organ transplantation and encouraged members to consider seriously the opportunityto donate organs, blood, and tissue after deathso that others may live. 87Decisions about dona- tions should be made well ahead of time so thatany tissues or organs needed for donation maybe removed as soon after death as possible. The Standing Commission on Human Affairs and Health raised important questions in 1988about ways in which organ transplantationshould and should not be used. Often this proce-dure is not morally problematic. Accepting tis-sues such as cornea or skin can enhance thequality of life of a person without imposing seri-ous burdens. However, the situation is morallymore complicated in the case of organs such askidneys, the pancreas, or the heart. The StandingCommission on Human Affairs and Health in1988 recommended careful reflection about suchquestions as: What is the risk to living donors? Isone obliged to undergo severe burdens to avoid death or, to the contrary, should one forgo trans-plantation that would be disproportionately bur-densome? Because these questions are complex,the commission urged further study. 88 The General Convention of 1991 urged mem- bers of the church to consider seriously the op- portunity to donate organs after death. Suchdecisions should be clearly stated to family,friends, church, and attorney. 89Although it is morally appropriate to decide to donate anorgan to another in need, special care must betaken by those making inquiries to avoid coerc-ing living donors. 90 The conception and deliberate abortion of fe- tuses to obtain fetal tissue for medical researchwas rejected by the 1991 General Convention, aswas the use of fetal tissue aborted for profit. 91 The convention recommended further study of the use of tissue from fetuses that have beenaborted to save the life of a woman. 11 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERORGAN AND TISSUE TRANSPLANTATIONEarly Anglicans, who lived in a society in which plague swept away vast numbers of people, childbirth often ended in death, andmedical practice was relatively ineffective, drewa close connection between sickness, death, andsin. Thus, the \"Great Litany,\" published in1544, ended with the prayer: \"Have pity uponus miserable sinners, that now are visited withgreat sickness and mortality, that like as thou didst command thy angel to cease from punish-ing, so it may now please thee to withdraw fromus this plague and grievous sickness.\" 95A steady flow of books taught those who were sick to re-pent, meditate upon \"last things,\" and die well(ars moriendi ). Chief among these tracts was Jeremy Taylor's guide to holy dying, which em- phasized the need to prepare for death over alifetime, but especially when visited by sick-ness. 96 Twentieth-century Anglicans no longer see sickness as inevitably ending in death or prima-rily as punishment for sin. The 1979 Book of Common Prayer tends to view illness as a result of a disordered universe, rather than as punish-ment directed against evil doers. Thus, it offersthe prayer to God that the sick, \"accepting yourhealing gifts through the skill of surgeons andnurses . . . may be restored to usefulness in your world with a thankful heart.\" 97Death, in the service for burial of the dead, is viewed as com-forting rather than condemning, triumph ratherthan defeat. 98The End-of-Life Task Force as- serted that \"Christian faith enables us to lookupon our own dying, and that of people we love,as a journey with Christ through death into thelife of God.\" 99 CLINICAL ISSUES AND PROCEDURES Forgoing life-sustaining treatment Human beings are precious, cherished creations of God, yet their lives need not be extended at allcosts. When individuals are near the end of lifeand medical powers cannot change their coursetoward death, there is no moral obligation to pro-long their dying. In such circumstances, it ismorally appropriate to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment and to allow their lives to come to their end. 100Although it can be enor- mously difficult to acknowledge that someonewho is deeply loved cannot be kept alive, recog-nizing when this is the case and removing bur-densome medical measures to allow the natural 12 THEEPISCOPAL TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSDEATH AND DYINGThe needs of those suffering from mental ill- ness have been of particular concern to the Episcopal Church. The General Convention of1985 called for the development of a means ofassisting homeless persons who are mentally ill,and lack an adequate support system, by variousagencies of the church and other social agenciesand the healthcare delivery system. 92The General Convention in 1991 reiterated this con- cern and encouraged initiating programs toequip clergy and laity to minister to the mentallyill and their families. More specifically, it calledfor the development of \"support groups, drop-in centers, housing and employment opportunities\"for those with mental illness, particularly thehomeless. 93Dioceses, congregations, and indi- vidual parishioners were encouraged to becomeadvocates for funding to provide comprehensivecommunity-based services, hospital care, and re-search into the causes and treatments of mentalillness. The National Alliance for the MentallyIll was recommended as a resource for congre-gations and families of the mentally ill in a 2000resolution. 94MENTAL HEALTHcourse of events to proceed is an act of care and compassion.101 Decisions to withhold or withdraw life- sustaining treatment should be made by the indi- viduals whose lives are affected. However, as theEnd-of-Life Task Force reaffirmed, when suchindividuals no longer have decision-making ca-pacity, a surrogate\u2014or family members when nosurrogate has been named\u2014should make deci-sions about the use of such treatment on thebasis of the values and preferences the patienthad expressed earlier. 102Caregivers should allow those who are near the end of life to die peace-fully in a setting that enables them to maintain dignity free from unwanted and inap propriate technology. When persons are in a comatosestate from which there is no reasonable hope ofrecovery, it is ethically sound to contemplatewithholding or removing life-support, includingartificial nutrition and hydration. 103 Not only adults, but also newborns and chil- dren for whom cure is not possible and who facea life that amounts to a form of dying should notbe subjected to useless life-sustaining treatment. Instead, they should be provided with all avail-able comfort measures as their lives come to anend. 104Children who are developmentally dis- abled or mentally challenged should not be con-sidered to be dying solely on account of theirdisabilities and should receive care that is ap-propriate to their needs. A service for a time when life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn, developed by theCommittee on Medical Ethics of the Diocese ofWashington, offers pastoral support to those who are dying and to their caregivers during the re-moval of technological medical support. 105 Suicide, assisted suicide, and euthanasia Reports from within the Anglican Communionexpress the almost universal Christian beliefthat suicide is wrong and that assisting personsto kill themselves or killing them outright is alsowrong. 106Our lives are not our own, to dispose of at will, but are a gift from God, to whom theyultimately belong. Suicide is the expression of arefusal to trust in God, an embracing of death for its own sake, a form of self-justification. Thegreat moral danger of suicide and assisted sui- cide is that they will be egotistical and manipu-lative, symbolic of an unwillingness to play therole of dependent when it falls to our turn.Moreover, the end of a person's life is not simplya private matter, but has import for those whosurround the person. The question whether it is more compassion- ate to kill those who are in excruciating painand suffering near the end of life, rather thanallow them to die in misery, can arise in un-usual, extreme cases. Any honest person will ac-knowledge that he or she would wish for ahastened death in such circumstances. 107 However, there should be no need for anyone toundergo such radical suffering today. The End-of-Life Task Force declared: \"Where there aredrugs available to hand to a despairing personnear death so that he or she can commit suicide,there are also drugs available to provide to thatperson that will afford relief from pain and allowa peaceful death.\" 108Agape or neighbor love may be \"better expressed and more deeplynourished by the careful accompanying of a per-son in his dying than by any established practiceof voluntary euthanasia.\" 109The Anglican Communion has consistently held that euthana-sia should not be legalized, for if this practicewere to become socially accepted, those who arevulnerable, such as the elderly and chronicallyill, might well feel that they had to cope withthe question, \"Why aren't you dead yet?\" 110 Some might be pressured into ending their livesin order to relieve others of the burden of theircare rather than because of pain and sufferingthat they experience. Others might elect assistedsuicide to save their families the costs of main-taining them in a healthcare system that mightdrain them of their life savings. Rather thanallow such persons to end their lives prema-turely for the sake of others, we should reem-phasize that we value all who are living andwish to provide them with care and support astheir lives draw to a close. 13 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERProxy decision making and advance directives Several reports from church working groups and General Conventions have encouraged the use of advance directives by individuals to informrelatives, friends, and future caregivers aboutthe sort of treatment they wish to receive nearthe end of life should they become unable tospeak for themselves. 111Ethical questions related to preparing such documents are specifically ad-dressed in a book from the Committee onMedical Ethics of the Diocese of Washington. 112 It points out that it is important to prepare these documents before a serious illness so that those caring for persons near the end of life will knowwhether or not they wish to have life-sustainingtreatment, what sorts of supportive care theywant, and whether or not they plan to donate or-gans and tissue to others. It urges Episcopaliansto discuss their advance directives with familymembers and friends as they develop them, sothat those close to them will be aware of theirvalues and concerns and will be able to makemedical care decisions for them should they laterbecome decisionally incapacitated. Pain control and palliative care It is widely accepted within the Anglican Communion that caregivers have an obligation toprovide palliative care and pain-relieving med-ication to those nearing the end of life, even ifthis should inadvertently shorten the lives of thedying. 113The General Convention of 1994 em- phasized that \"palliative treatment to relieve thepain of persons with progressive incurable ill-nesses, even if done with knowledge that a has-tened death may result, is consistent withtheological tenets regarding the sanctity oflife.\" 114As the report of the End-of-Life Task Force points out, recent research indicates that providing medication to patients to alleviate painin doses that are gradually increased to meettheir individual needs rarely shortens theirlives. 115Instead, giving such drugs in carefully titrated doses prolongs the lives of many who arenear death because they become more comfort-able and more apt to take greater amounts of nourishment. However, there is a pressing need to provide more adequate and extensive palliative care forthose approaching death. Several GeneralConventions have urged healthcare profession-als, families, patients, and legislative bodies toprevent intolerable suffering among the dyingcaused by the underuse of pain medication, in-cluding narcotic drugs. 116The General Convention of 2000 urged the healthcare profes-sions to improve the quality of palliative care byoffering physicians and nurses more extensiveeducation about the most recent research. Itspecifically declared that healthcare profession-als should provide sufficient levels of pain-relieving drugs to those near the end of life torelieve their pain and discomfort and shouldmake timely referrals to hospice for them. 117 Hospice care The great renewal of care for the dying, the hos- pice movement, originated with the work ofDame Cicely Saunders, a physician and nursewhose outlook has been deeply formed byAnglican practical piety. The basic goal of thehospice movement, to provide comprehensiveend-of-life care that will achieve a good qualityof life for each person by meeting his or herphysical, emotional, and spiritual needs, hasbeen widely approved within the Anglican Communion. The concept of hospice was intro-duced in 1976 in the first edition of On Dying Well, a Church of England report to which Dame Cicely contributed. 118It has since been embraced in subsequent reports from within theAnglican Communion, including those from theEpiscopal Church. 119The General Convention of 2000 strongly supported the goals of providinginterdisciplinary hospice care and communalsupport for the patient and family during thedying process, as well as care for families duringbereavement. 120 14 THEEPISCOPAL TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSJUSTICE AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE American healthcare system Historically, the Anglican Communion has been actively involved in the provision of health care. Many of those practicing medicineand surgery in England and America before thenineteenth century were clergy. As the subjectmatter of medicine became more complex, how-ever, fewer Anglican clergy found themselvesable to devote time to the study of both theologyand medicine, and the medical and clerical pro-fessions gradually developed separately. Even so,the close historical connection between pastoralcaregivers and medical practitioners, as well asthe theology of healing of the Anglican tradition(see above, \"The Individual and the Patient-Caregiver Relationship\") has made the com-munion deeply committed to ensuring that allpersons receive health care of good quality in ajust manner. As hospitals and other healthcarefacilities were developed in England and theUnited States, it was not uncommon for them tobe established under Anglican auspices. Moreover, as the Anglican Communion spread,various branches of the communion sent med-ical missionaries to found hospitals in variousparts of the globe. Hence, by the twentieth cen-tury, the provision of health care formed a majorelement of Anglican church life. 121 The General Convention has expressed its concern about the provision of adequate healthcare for those in need many times over the years.For instance, in 1985 it called for the creation of a national commission on healthcare reform andurged congregations to increase their support forsuch health services as food kitchens, shelters forthe homeless, legal aid centers, and neighbor-hood health clinics. 122In 1988, it urged the church's Office of Government in Washington, D.C., to advocate for \"all persons suffering fromillness by creating appropriate levels of cost-ef-fective healthcare, for example, hospices and al-ternative healthcare facilities.\" 123In 1991, itdecried the inequitable healthcare delivery sys- tem of the United States and called for universalaccess to health care. 124It also enunciated four principles regarding health care that includedcare of the whole person\u2014physiological, spiritual,psychological, and social\u2014and attention to pre-ventive care. 125Moreover, it encouraged the cre- ation of legislation offering comprehensivemedical benefits at all levels, including \"diagnos-tic tests, primary and tertiary care for acute andchronic conditions, rehabilitation care, long-term care, mental health services, dental care and pre-scription drugs.\" 126 Increased attention to matters affecting the health and health care of women, including \"do-mestic violence, AIDS, heart disease, breast,ovarian and endometrial cancer, safe and effec- tive contraceptives, and other methods of preg-nancy prevention, maternity care, menopauseand chronic illnesses unique to or prevalentamong women\" was called for by the 1994General Convention. 127 In 2000, the Office of the Bishop for Armed Services, Healthcare and Prison Ministries wasdirected to convene an association of Episcopalhealthcare groups and individuals to advocatefor a healthcare system in which all may beguaranteed decent and appropriate primaryhealth care, keep abreast of the changinghealthcare market, and collect resources relatedto access to healthcare for the use of the churchat all levels. 128The formation of this Episcopal healthcare association was begun in 2001. HIV/AIDS As the wide and terrible scope of the AIDS epi- demic became apparent, the AnglicanCommunion responded with a host of measuresdesigned to bring care and comfort to those af-flicted with this disease. In 1985, the GeneralConvention recognized \"with love and compas-sion the tragic human suffering and loss of lifeinvolved in the AIDS epidemic\" and repudiated\"indiscriminate statements which condemn or 15 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERSPECIAL CONCERNSreject the victims of AIDS.\" It went on to urge the development and funding of programs ofawareness, education, and prevention concern- ing AIDS and of ministry to those affected bythis illness. 129Resolutions adopted by succeed- ing General Conventions repudiated discrimina-tion against those with AIDS; approved ofanonymous testing and counseling for HIV;urged the creation of accessible drug treatment,needle access, and safe sex programs, and urgedmonogamy in sexual relationships; and author-ized funds for AIDS education programs in dio-ceses and congregations. 130 An Episcopal Commission on AIDS and a National Episcopal AIDS Coalition were estab-lished to focus on the theological, ethical, andpastoral concerns raised by this illness; developstrategies to increase awareness of the AIDS cri-sis throughout the church; and advocate con-cern for those affected with HIV/AIDS to theworld. 131In 1997, these bodies were authorized to convene consultations to examine the impactof HIV/AIDS in communities of color, clarifythe role of racism in responding to AIDS, andidentify actions that Episcopalians should takein response to such racism. 132 In 1991, the General Convention set out \"Ten Principles for the Workplace\" to govern the way in which Episcopalians relate at places of employ-ment to people with HIV/AIDS. These principlessupport the equal rights and opportunities of thosewith this illness, nondiscriminatory employmentpolicies, educational programs about HIV/AIDS,protection of the confidentiality of employees'medical records, appropriate infection control pro-cedures, and prohibition of pre-employment orworkplace HIV screening. 133The Washington Office of the Episcopal Church was instructed towork for increased funding, research, preventive education, and comprehensive service delivery re-lated to those with HIV/AIDS at all levels of gov-ernment. 134Aware that a global AIDS epidemic was developing, the General Convention urged var-ious international agencies to respond to theemerging AIDS crisis. 135 ALCOHOL ANDDRUGABUSE The 1985 General Convention declared that al- coholism and other forms of substance abuseare treatable disorders that can affect any indi-vidual, \"regardless of financial situation, educa-tion, employment, race or creed.\" 136These conditions affect not only their victims, but alsofamily and friends. Furthermore, they representa major health concern for our society. 137The General Convention encouraged each diocese to appoint a committee to educate members aboutthe nature, prevention, treatment, and pastoralcare of alcohol and drug abusers and their fami-lies. Spiritual care should be provided to thoseaddicted to substances, it specifically stated in1991. 138The National Episcopal Coalition on Alcohol (NECA), devoted to addressing theproblem of chemical dependency among churchmembers, has been commended for its work bythe General Convention. Employees of the Episcopal Church who are al- cohol or drug dependent have been of specialconcern to the church. The General Convention of1985 maintained that they should be offeredtreatment and counseling during recovery and thatevery effort should be made to offer them job pro-tection and re-employment, as well as salaried sickleave should they require hospitalization. 139 16 THEEPISCOPAL TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSThe author would like to thank the following individuals for their perspicacious comments on portions of an earlier draft: The Rev.

Minneapolis, Minn.: Fortress, 1999.Religious beliefs provide meaning for people confronting illness and seeking health, partic- ularly during times of crisis. Increasingly, healthcare workers face the challenge of providingappropriate care and services to people of differentreligious backgrounds. Unfortunately, manyhealthcare workers are unfamiliar with the reli-gious beliefs and moral positions of traditions other than their own. This booklet is one of aseries that aims to provide accessible and practicalinformation about the values and beliefs of differ-ent religious traditions. It should assist nurses,physicians, chaplains, social workers, and adminis-trators in their decision making and care giving. Itcan also serve as a reference for believers whodesire to learn more about their own traditions. Each booklet gives an introduction to the his- tory of the tradition, including its perspectives onhealth and illness. Each also covers the tradi-tion's positions on a variety of clinical issues,with attention to the points at which moraldilemmas often arise in the clinical setting. Final-ly, each booklet offers information on specialconcerns relevant to the particular tradition. The editors have tried to be succinct, objec- tive, and informative. Wherever possible, we haveincluded the tradition's positions as reflected inofficial statements by a governing or other formalbody, or by reference to positions formulated by authorities within the tradition. Bear in mindthat within any religious tradition, there may bemore than one denomination or sect that holdsviews in opposition to mainstream positions, orgroups that maintain different emphases. The editors also recognize that the beliefs and values of individuals within a tradition may varyfrom the so-called official positions of their tradi-tion. In fact, some traditions leave moral decisionsabout clinical issues to individual conscience. Wewould therefore caution the reader against gener-alizing too readily. The guidelines in these booklets should not substitute for discussion of patients' own reli-gious views on clinical issues. Rather, they should be used to supplement information com-ing directly from patients and families, and usedas a primary source only when such firsthandinformation is not available. We hope that these booklets will help practi- tioners see that religious backgrounds and beliefsplay a part in the way patients deal with pain, ill-ness, and the decisions that arise in the course oftreatment. Greater understanding of religious tra-ditions on the part of care providers, we believe,will increase the quality of care received by thepatient.
