In biology, immunity refers to the body's ability to defend itself against substances that threaten its proper functioning or survival. These \"threats\" can be of 3 types: microbes (viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites), cells that have become cancerous or a foreign body (a splinter, as well as a transplanted organ). At certain stages of life and also in winter, the immune system can be weakened. The body, then more fragile, needs full support to regain vitality and above all to help it strengthen its natural defense system. Food and micronutrition are the \"immunity\" duo par excellence.
