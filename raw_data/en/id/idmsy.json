It avoided, however, the key issue in the Lockheed-lAM dispute: An election among all Lockheed em\u00ad ployes on whether to authorize a union shop in which all workers would be required to join the un\u00ad ion. The President creatcd a three\u00b7 man board of inquiry to investi\u00b7 gate and report to him by next Monday. Its recommendations will help him determine whether to ask a federal court Qrder barring a strike while further efforts are lude to reach a,reement.

The hearing was called to consider a petition by Tom Alberhasky, 1613 East College Street, for a permit to construct a trailer court on his property located on Lower Mus\u00ad catine Road and First Avenue. Under Section 18 of the new City Zoning Ordinance, trailer courts are among the special uses re\u00ad quiring a permit from the Council before building in that area, which is now classified as an MI indus\u00ad trial zone. Alberhasky's petition for permit Is in compliance with that ordinance. The hearing was conducted in a quiet, orderly manner, although more than 20 Iowa City residentg gave voice to their opinions in favor or opposition to the permit. Mayor pro\u00b7tem Fred H. Doderer complimented the audience on its conduct. Att9rMy \"'1I1p A, LeN, repr.\u00b7 sentlnll Alberh.sky, was h rd first.

He said that trailers in the court wlll pay more than $6,000 in taxes each year, which by state law goes to the county, and the property owner will pay normal real estate taxes. Leff also pointed out that traf\u00b7 fic congestion would not be any nrenler ~hl1n frnm nn indu81.1')' in the same area. (The proposed court would have three exits on two streets).

It is not enough, however, simply to keep our doors open. A deeper question presses upon us: Shall we continue to have a real university, or only the outward husk and mere appearance of a univer\u00ad sity?\" John D. WilJjams, chancellor of the University of Mississippi, thus challenged those interested in kceping Ole Miss an institution of higher learning to answer a press\u00ad ing problem. He offered tIle challenge at an alumni meet\u00ad ing in Greenville, Miss., Oct. 3l. In action taken by the Southern Association of Col\u00ad leges and Secondary Schools in Dallas Wednesday, further weight was given to Chancellor Williams' words. In putting Ole Miss and six other Missis ippi colleges on \"extraord\u00ad inary status,\" the association threatened loss of accredita\u00ad tion and promised careful observation of the Mississippi schools. Encroachment by pressure groups, investigative com\u00ad tDittees or punitive legislative action would threaten the accreditation of the Mississippi schools, the association annoUnced. In Chancellor Williams' Oct. 31 address he noted that Gov. Barnett i sued a proclamation stating Ule state was supreme in this area of education. \"It was not,\" Chancellor Williams said, \"for tIle (University board of trustees) to determine the legality of this move ... When the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stated that the board's action was Dot consonant with federal law, the board promptly rescinded its actions and -again taking r sponsibility upon itself -directed me to admit James Meredith.\" In his Greenville speech he said the boar.d \"has as\u00ad sured our regional accrediting agency of its present and future compliance with tI1at agency's requirements.\" The action by tlle Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools is clearly deSigned to keep state officials and non-university groups out of the affairs of Mississipppi's colleges and universities. Yet tI1is is not just a \"Mississippi affair.\" Persons across the country interested in higher education should heed these words of Chancellor Williams: '1t will be a betrayal of Ihe high calling of education if we drive away from our campus those men who will not submit to thought control, if we discourage those shldents who are eager to meet the challenge of new ideas, if we close off certain avenues to knowledge and make of them dead-end streets.\" -Ed Bassett Burn, Burn!

So this \"savior of Americanism\" has threatened to print classroom lectures. 1t has ditorially stated, \"If our professors, regardless of their political bent, persist in using their classes as media for propagandizing their per\u00ad sonal political or economic philosophies at the expense of the prescribed subject material, we shall have no choice but to consider such class periods as pubHc lectures; and, as such, tI1ey shall be reported as news in tIlis newspaper just as any other university-sponsor ed lecture.\" The rationale behind this threat smacks of the Cold\u00ad water philosophy which might best be summed up, \"Teach Americanism -Americanism is what I believe.\" It gives us visions of the era of McCarthyism, book-burning, and the Salem witch trials. We completely and unqualifiedly endorse a statement made by the CU Student Senate which stated, \"The fear that statements made in a classroom might be printed would have an intimidating effect on both faculty and students and would destroy tJle necessary freedom of thought and expression which is prerequisite for signifi\u00ad cant education.\" That is precisely what the \"New Conservative\" and . supporters by the prerident of the Univerllty.

Th. story of the voices coming loud\u00ad ly from a mass grave n.ar Smoltnsk, Russia. is in the paglS of a book \"Death in the Forest,\" (By J. K. Zawodny. University of Notre Dame Press.) The bodies of some 4,300 Polish soldiers, officers, and men were dis covered in long, hastily\u00b7dug trenches in the Katyn For est near Smolensk in April 1943. ~.,. The Germans -e/1.. >\" , made the an\u00b7 dead re-\" duced the mys- tery of s 0 m e - 15.000 P oli s h prisoners by about one fourth. Perhaps 12,000 are to this day un\u00b7 accounted for. Do their bones de\u00b7 cay in some yet undiscovered site? There has been no voice to speak for them ... but there is yet time. The Nazis (as we prcsenlly shall discuss) were not merely capable of such mass murders. They did, as we know all too well, carry them out against mill ions of men, women and children - and against prisoners of war. The Soviets have claimed the Germans killed the men found in the Katyn forest . . . each shot in the head. CIt is surmised the kill\u00b7 ing was done in groups, escorted daily to the covering depths of the forest.> MR. ZAWODNY. after years of patient work, concludes. JlOwever, that while the Germans were capable oC the deed, the evidence points to the Soviets. The sta.te of decomposition of the bodies, letters found in their clothing, and other related evidence, points, Mr. Zawodny writes, to their having been killed in April or May of 1940. At tbat time the Soviets controlled the area. There still is no official conclu\u00b7 sion, but Mr. Zawodny's carefully researched book will be difficult to deny. Stalinist Russia was. as we more than once have been told by no less an authority than MI'. Khrushchev, a murderous and brulal totalitarianism . The book recalls yet another mass grave. When then Vice President Nix\u00ad on completed his visit to Russia in the summer of 1959, he moved on to Warsaw, Poland. That the journel'. was 'politically necessary was obvious. There bad to be a Warsaw visit to counter one to Moscow. The Polish vote is an integral part of the pluralistic politics of the United States. THE NIXON VISIT touched off one of the most extraordinary welcomes ever accorded anyone in any country. The Poles accept\u00b7 ed Nixon as a friend -but also as a symbol. He symbolized the long friendship of this country. The welcome was one of tumult, joy, tears. shouts, and roses flung until the cars were half filled with them -an hour of release and of testament. A part of the later schedule was a visit to a mass grave in the Palimiry forest, 15 miles from Warsaw. In the press bus we talked of how peaccful the rural scene was -small farms, vege\u00b7 table gal'dens, men and women at work in the fields, lilUe neat houses, some of them of logs, set in small groves of trees. At the villages, groups of farm people, mostly women, galhercd with flowers. WE CAME, finally. along a rut\u00b7 J ted dirt road to a cleared section' C in the forest. There were some 2,000 graves . . . each with a headstone. The bodies had been dug from the trenches where the Germans had put them after ex\u00b7 ecution. Most of the dead had been intellectuals, teachers, writers, doctors, priests. (One was Jan)JSz Kusocinski, who was an Olympic champion for Poland in Ihe 1932 Olympics in Los An\u00b7 geles.) Here and there were wo\u00b0 men pUlling flowers on graves. \"You see,\" said a Pole, \"why we hate the Germans ... This is but one reason ... And the Rus\u00b7 sians -they, too, gave us cause to hate.\" It is incredible that at one time the world included a Hitler, Stal\u00b7 in and Mussolini. DistrIbuted 1962. by The Hall Syndicate, Inc.

To be sure, the Kennedy Ad\u00b7 ministration's world a pin i a n\u00ad watC!hers will not be content to let well enough alone. But there is litUe danger that the President will buy any of the dubious con\u00b7 Iraptions. supposedly guarantee\u00ad ing to pacify the Caribbean, de\u00b7 nuclearize the hemisphere, tame Castro, and work other miracles, which are now being promoted. HSNCI:. it is now in order to add up the score. The addition suggests that the Cuban criSis was one of those great watershed events that <;bPnge everything. like the launching of the \u00b7lVJarslla}1 Plan, or the American response to the challenge in Korea. Only consider the follow11g.list. _ first_and foremost, the Krem\u00ad lin estimate of the United States has been radically changed. Be\u00b7 fore the attempted trick in Cuba, it was very clear that lhe Krem\u00ad li9 was operating on the assump\u00b7 tion that the U.S. would not stand up and b.e counted in are a I crunch. The Cuban trick was in\u00ad tended, quite plainly, to copper\u00b7 rIVet tnls assumptloli. Instead, the assumption itself w 4H-aW~ proved. The necessary revisions in the Kremlin\"'s '\" calculanon of risks by no mealfs insure the\u00ad safety of Berlin, Cor instance . But they' most ~ary t~reatl!ned areas as well, by margin. T~is ~.evision i.n t~Jl Kremlir \\ clllculilbOJis of rIsks is far more imporfant, in fact, than the sup\u00b7 posed Spur to the Kremlin to look for a viclory some~here else, in oroer to compensate for Cuba. The most alarming feature of the whole world picture, pre-Cuba, wap the maSl/ indications that the Soviet leaders thought they could kick the 'United States around with irppunity. T his primary cause for alarm has now been removed. SEC 0 N D. 'C(lba has also changed its situ\u00b7a.t~on quite rad. ically within the tommllnist bloc. While a c h e a P Qut decisive triumph over the \\Vest was still confidently hoped for, the hope itsp-If acted as.a te,nsion.reducing s.:lfely valve in Moscow and else\u00b7 where. The h~d\u00b7for \u00b7victory was undciub1edl:t count d u p 0 n to create great Soviet opportuniti es of\" many sorts, and tliese new op\u00ad portunities , in turn, were expected to make all sorts of current prob\u00ad lems easier to solve.

Unless there are po)ilical changes in lV~oscow or Pekin~. it begins to be difficult to see how the two lead\u00b7 E:IS oC the, ClJmmunist bloc can avoid an open, final break. Too much that is unforgivable has now been said too loudly'. Yet the increasing poosiblJity of a Stno-Soviet break is only one effect of the safety valve's reo moval. wtren they hmk lit tlreir domestic economy, for instance, t.bG..-Soviet-leadcrs must now ask lhemselves whether . the y can carry -the massive but al~ayS . augmenlirfg armaments burden for the very long pull -which is a very fundamental question in\u00b7 deed.

President Kennedy and ht foucy.makers, with excep\u00b7 tiona adroitness. most carefully observed every possible form 'Of pOlite'ness in their dealings wilh the other Western allies. Yet lhe fact could not be con\u00b7 cealed that in this crisis, c1ea~ly involving a risk of H\u00b7bomb war, the President made his deciSion alone, V{i~~out prior. consultatlon with any a rl e beyond his own policy .ma~ing circle. There was no other way to do the lob. Blit the simple fact that the President acted alone, as he had to do, will inevitabty and perhaps \\lrofoundly alter the Western nations' rela\u00b7 tions with one allothel\u00b7. THE FINAL result is not easy to predict, but it is cerlain that much wisdom will be needed for the unavoidable re.thinking of the Western strategic design. Fourth and finally, however, there is bet. ter reason for hoping that the American Government will deal wisely with this matter -for Cuba has also changed the Ken\u00b7 nedy Administration itself. The change is not easy to \u00b7de\u00b7 fine. Maybe the\" b s1 \\yay to pul il is to say lhat the Administra\u00b7 tion has developed much more self confidence, a dearer sense or direction, and, above all, a clear\u00b7 er. more imlted, more easily iden\u00b7 tifiable political viewpoint. This will help a lot in the time .ahead, when the crowding problems of tlre CUba\u00b7alerted world have to be tackled by the U.S. policy\u00b7 makers. Copyright [9GZ: New York Herald TrIbune Inc.

To the Editor: I must admit that J agree with the main point expressed in yes\u00b7 terday'S editorial by Larry Hat\u00b7 field, \"Academic Freedom, Hellt\" After all a censorship board or a \"screening board\" or whatever else you care to call it would eliminate all controversy from a campus -to the grave detri\u00b7 ment of the students, the faculty and the public. However, I would like to pro\u00b7 test the strange idea oC libel and its results which Mr. Hatfield im\u00b7 plied in the last sentence of his editorial. He seems to think that Sen. Goldwater is denying academic freedom by protesting when he is falsely charged with a criminal act. I sincerely hope that Mr. Hat\u00b7 field will not take the example of the Colorado student paper for fearless, courageous, crusading journalism. If he does, I greatly fear that he will spend the reo maining years of his unemployed existence shuttling between libel courts. ' As a journalist, Mr. Hatfield should be aware of the difference between the right to do something and the right to avoid the conse\u00ad quences of his action. In the United States, lhe only persons who are protected (rom the can\u00b7 sequences of lheir actions arc in\u00b7 fants not yet old enough to reason and the insane.

But the effects on our position of joining Europe have been much exaggerated ' by the critics. \"ACESSION 10 the Treaty of Rome would not involve a one\u00ad sided surrender of \"sovereignty\" 011 our part, but a pooling of sov\u00b7 ereignty by all concerned. main\u00b7 ly in economic and social fields. In renouncing some of our own sovereignly we would receive in relmn a share of the sovereignty renpunced by other members. Our obligations would not alter the !losition of the Crown, nor rob our Parliament of its essential powers. nor deprive our Law Courts of their authority in our domestic life. \"The talk about loss of sover\u00b7 eignty becomes all the more meaningless when one remembers that practically every nation, in\u00b7 cluding our own, has already been forced by the pressures of the modern world to abandon large areas of sovereignty and to real\u00ad ize that we are now all inter\u00b7 dependent. \"NO COUNTRY today, not even the giants of America or R,!ssia, can pursue purely inde~ndent policies in defense, foreign af\u00b7 fairs, or the economic sphere. Britain herself has freely made surrenders of sovereignty in NATO and in many other inter\u00ad national fields on bigger issues than those Involved in the pool\u00b7 ing of sovereignty required under the Treaty of Rome. \"The form which the political unity of the Community should take is noW under active discus\u00b7 sion in Europe, where opinions on it are strongly divided. There is a school which ardently be\u00b7 Iieves in the unitary concept of a European federation, a new European State. Here in Britain the Liberal Party Assembly voiced some strong support for Ihis solution. \"I MYSELF believe thal the bulk of public opinion in this country, and certainly any Con\u00b7 servative Government, is firmly against the extinction of separate national identities and would choose a Europe which preserved and harmonized all that is best in our different national tradi\u00b7 tions. We would, I think, favour a more gradual approach worked Ol)t by experience, instead of a leap in the dark, and this is a view shared by many leaders of opinion in Europe. \"One thing is certain. As a member of the Community, Brit\u00b7 ain would have a strong voice in deciding the nature and lime of political unity. By remaining out\u00b7 side, we could be faced with a political solution in Europe which ran counter to our views and in\u00b7 terests, but which we could do nothing to influence.\" Letters Policy R dtrs a,..

Clay Named Boxer of Month MANILLA (A'I -Cassius Clay of Louisville, Ky., was selected Wednesday as the World Boxing Association's boxer of the month for his Nov. 15 victory over Archie Moore. Anthony Petronella, chairman of the ratings committee of the WBA, released the November rat\u00ad ings here. \"We named Clay boxer of the month because of \\ his sensational and colorful fourth round knock\u00ad out of-Archie Moore,\" said Petro\u00ad nella who is en route to Tokyo for world lightweight champion Car\u00ad los Ortiz' title defense against Teruo Kosaka of Japan Dec. 3. \"If Clay's improvement contin\u00ad ues, he appears to be, potentially, the next challenger to Sonny Lis\u00ad ton,\" Petronella added. Clay, 20, moved up from No.7' to No.4 heavyweight contender . \"The proposals for increasing the International League to 12 teams and to 10 teams were turned down. In each case, the vote was 6-2.\" . It was reported that the only two IL clubs in favor were Columbus and Toronto. Under the 12-team proposal, the American Association would have folded with Oklahoma City, Dallas\u00ad Fort Worth, Little Rock and In\u00ad dianapolis moving into the Inter\u00ad national League and Denver mov\u00ad ing into the Pacific Coast League, making that circuit an 8-club set\u00ad up. Under tho lo-twam proposal, Indianapolis .nd Littl. Rock would haVi moved Into the IL; nd Oklahoma City, Dallas-Fort Worth, .n6 Denver into the PCL, with the Am.rlcan Association ag.in folding. After the rejections, an unidenti\u00ad fied major league general manager went into a huddle with the in\u00ad volved leagues and Trautman and it was learned another proposal was made that will be discussed at a meeting today. This plan would leave the a-club [nternational League as it is, while increasing the American Associa\u00ad tion to six teams and trimming the PCL to six by having Salt Lake City transfer into the American Association . The eighth PCL club, Vancouver, no longer has a major league affiliation and is expected to fold. This I... action came on the eve of a vote by the minors on whither to approvI vast rl\u00ad organiz.tion under which at least 101 clubs would be underwritten by the major leagu.s. The minors .re expected to vote affirma\u00ad HVily. The blueprint for the new deal which would lump all the minors into class triple A, class double A, class A and rookie leagues, was drawn up by a joint major and mi\u00ad nor committee beaded by John W.

Seven yeal's ago he was editor of The Daily Iowan. Now he has been named as Washington correspondent for the Milwaukee Journal. Before coming to SUI from New York in 1951, Kapenstein worked as a copyboy for the New York JOW'nal of Commerce, a business paper. As an Iowa freshman he volun\u00b7 teered for work .on The Daily Iowan. He worJ(ed his way up from reporter to editor and went on from there to the Mil\u00b7 waukee Journal to again work his way up -but this time to the position of Washington cor\u00b7 respondent, a position he will as\u00b7 sume early next year. Kapenstein is in Iowa City this week with his wife and three chil\u00b7 dren visiting his wife's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Julius Kunik, 1715 Rideway Drive. He will leave Sat\u00b7 urday for Washington to hunt for a house for his family. Since 1959 he has been a politi\u00b7 cal reporter for lhe Journal. He found that a political reporter can really have no political opinions of his own, except for private ones which must stay out of print. Kapenstein will be half of a two\u00b7 man Washington Bureau for the Journal. His job will be to provide coverage of political events of in\u00b7 terest to Wisconsin readers, \"what Wisconsin congressmen are doing and why.\" Besides covering . the Wiscon\u00b7 sin congressmen, he will cover the compl.te political pictur., but in a specialized fashion. Be\u00b7 cause the w ire services have large Washington staffs who handle all the spot news, the W IIshington correspondents of large city papers, such as the Journal, usually concentrate on reporting special political prob. lems in depth, Kapenstein said that he got his new Washington assignment with more push than pull; that is, push in the form of friendly persuasion to his editor that the Washington bureau, formerly a one\u00b7man bu\u00b7 reau, should be expanded . The Kapenstein's oldest son, four-year\u00b7old Joel, is quite excited about moving to Washington \"where the President lives in the White House.\" He's sure he'll get to meet the President, although his father has some doubts about that. * * * IRA KAPENSTEIN Former 01 Editor Have You Visited Lubin's Newly Remodeled LUNCHEONETTE?

Schnitzel reports that the latest dllg styles call for garments in bright colors. mostly reds, greens and blues. If clothes don't particularly im\u00ad press the little hound, a hard rub\u00ad ber ball with bells inside, a rolled cowhide bone, a ilea killing collar. a steak sbaped squeaker toy, or a box of dog treats should turn the trick.

These arc some of the traditions synonmo us with the holiday. For the eighl days of Dec. 22 through the 29, Chanukah will be observed in Jew ish homes in many 1 and s_ The stOl'y of the Feast of Lights Is based on an important event in Jewish history. In the period beginning In 175 A.D., the Syrian Greeks ruled Is\u00b7 rael. Under the control of Anto\u00b7 chillS, the Hebrews were forbid\u00b7 den to practice their religion. He forced the people to worship Greek Gods in their Temple. To enforce his decrees, Anliochus sen this armies to Israel. Among those who refused to fall under Greek rule was a Hasmon\u00ad ean family. 'rhe head of this fam\u00b7 ily was a priest, Mattathias . He scnt out a call to the people to join him in fighting the enemy. Many Hebrews came forward to form an army which was led by Judah Maccabee, the youngest of Maltathias' five sons, The Hebrews advanced through the country to Jerusalem, In Je\u00ad rusalem they found the Temple consecrated to the Syrian Gods, The simple peasants, turned sol\u00b7 diers fought to cleanse the Tem. pie and re-establish its worship, They removed cvel'Y sign or pn\u00b7 ganism.

Helpful Suggestions For Playing Santa Here are some hints that should come in handy if you are planning to play Santa Claus at a party this Christmas. First, practice the appropriate laugh and make it musical, taking care it doesn't come out in the old \"Ho, ho,\" that is just as likely to scare the children away. Next, find a good costume. This isn't too difficult since attraclive Santa costumes may be rented at a fairly low cost. Make sure the beard fits tight and the pillow doesn't sag. It's best not to play Santa before the child that is likely to recognize you and spoil the whole thing. You might possibly work out an exchange program with a neighbor. You will have to adapt your techn ique lind style to fit the ag. of your audience. If th.y ar. on Iy two or three, you'll have to use the gentl., soft ap\u00b7 proach. If they're somewhat old\u00b7 .r, say four or five, you had bet\u00b7 ter prepare yourself for some embarrasling questions. ,f they are much older th.n that, you'll have to do a big jab of convinc\u00b7 Ing. Now it's time for your gl'and entrance. Enter with a loud and clear \"Merry Christmas!\" You probably won't have to repeat be\u00b7 cause the childl'en will be expect\u00b7 ing you. You're now the center of attrac\u00b7 lion and you'll have to keep a cool head. Know the name of each child. This is a musl. You should have a small pre\u00b7Christ mas gift for each one. Now comes the hardest part\u00ad when they look with trusting eyes into yours and ask you for their heart's greatest desire, Don't promise anything you're nat absolutely sure the child will get! If they don't get it, the Santa image will be damaged Christmas morning. A goad idea is to get a list from the parent of what the child will receive. Even though you are armed with this information, passing this test will make a real Santa out of you. Don't make your visit long; children tire quickly and after this experience you will probably be just as tired. Once you leave, wait until you're out of sight before taking off the disguise. And another thing, don't retuL\"ll to the party. Some bright child might recognize you and you'll have a flock or disillusibned, disappointed children to deal with. The last rule is probably the most important. While you're acting as Santa Claus you must believe that you are Santa Claus. If you think the whole thing is silly, you'd bet\u00ad ter let someone else do the job. The rest is up to you. Good luck and be prepared to enjoy yourself in one of the most rewarding ex\u00b7 periences you can have. Jewelers for the Sweetlw(ll'ts of Campus HERTEEN & STOCKER lIotel Jefferson Bllilding Bogs Require Vigilance A cranberry bog is dry e:.:cept when flooded for protection against frost or winter freezing. It is often called a \"bog\" because cranberry plantations are developed from peat swamps, However, all water is drained off before the land is cleared, leveled, spread\" with a layer of sand, and t he vine cut\u00b7 tings set in. rt takes 3-5 years for a new plantation to bear a crop, but with care and vigilance against frost damage, cranberry vines will bear indefinitely.

Christmas is becoming more popular in Japan every year, not in a religious sense, but as an oc\u00b7 casion lor the public to have lun and for department store owners to make money. In a country like Japan, where Christianity is a minor religion, it is diUicult to celebrate Christmas as a religious event. Christianity was legally introduced to Japan in 1867. Although it has developed rapidly considet'ing its short his\u00b7 tory, the Christian population in Japan is still only 0.6 pel' cenl. Most people practice the traditional Buddhism and Shintoism. You may be curious why the Japanese celebrate the birth 01 Christ -pagan to them. The people adore western civilization and they tend to imitate it when\u00b7 ever possible. Howevel', this imita\u00b7 lion is superficial and without the realization ol the true significance of the event. As a matter of course, critici\u00ad sm has arisen from 600,000 Chris. tlans about what they consider to be the sacril.gious attitude of people.

II A holiday dinner should surprise the palate. It should fit the purse, fit the family. but always it should surprise and delight. . The most common faults of dressings are sogginess and compact\u00ad ness. These are caused by using bread too soCt, or by using bread crumbs that are very fine or dry and then adding too much liquid. The general rule ,for II moist dreuing is use fresh crumbs; for a dry crunchy dressing. use toasted cumbs; for a medium. dressing, use day-old bread. Rye. whole wheat or other bread can be used half and half with white bread. Whether the bread is to be shredded, finely cubed 01' grated, the crust should be trimmed off. When judging the quantity of dressing necessary. allow about 1h cup per serving. If a 12-pound turkey is cooked to serve six people twice, then ailow six cups stuffing which will. just comfortably fill the bird. And if the inside is a little small, bake the extra dressing in a foil package and dot it generously with butter or margarIne to prevent dry, ing. You could, of course, moisten this with the turkey drippings. Or make extra stuffing and pack this into a greased pan and bake along with the turkey the last half hour. . , Sausage should be fried out so that some of the fat\u00b7 is discarded before being mixed with the crumbs. Mushrooms should be sauteed before mixing so that some oC their liquId can be mixed with the crumbs extending the naVal'. Never fiil the bird tQO stoutly or it will break during the roasting. As the juices are absorbed by the stuffing during the roasting period it will expand_ For the safest results the stuffing should be mixed. immediately prior to use. The stuffed bird should be placed I., a pre-heated oven at once. If it is necessary to hold the stuffed poultry before roasting, the stuffing should be chilled before placing. in the bird and the.clean, sluffed bird should be refrigerated. The holding period should not be more than 4 hours. . o; ... r Stuffln, , tablespoons onion Y. '. cup' 119t lWster liquor Ii 1,' ~ I \\ Combine all ingredients . Toss lightly.

In most homes there is a set time for putting up the tree, a usual time for taking it down. a box of decoration s used year after year, and the same peo. pie do the arne thing in helping put it up. The time of putting up the tree varies from several weeks before Christmas to Christmas Eve, but most trees come down around New Year's day. One student comments that the tree goes up about five days before Christmas \"so that the needles won't fall 0(( before Christ\u00b7 mas.\" In other familie it is put up on the birtbday of a person in the family and is part of the birth\u00b7 day parly. In orne families the tree is put up for a traditional party. usually with neighbors or a club that the family belong to.
