As a pediatric neurologist and headache specialist, I value giving kids and their families the tools they need to treat their headaches. The right guidance can change a child's quality of life. We want to empower both patients and primary care providers to understand that migraine and other headache disorders are painful conditions and that treatment options are available. Treating headaches is not about medication. Instead, a multidisciplinary and holistic approach is necessary to treat kids with headaches successfully. Children need to feel empowered and educated about headaches. Our team takes a multidisciplinary approach to headaches. Each child has the opportunity to meet with pain psychologists to discuss healthy lifestyle habits and the importance of stress management. Psychologists teach children relaxation techniques and ways to cope with chronic pain. Specialty-trained headache nurses provide each family with educational information, so when they leave the clinic, they feel empowered and confident. I am the director of the Headache Medicine Fellowship Program and a member of the United Council of Neurological Subspecialties Task Force for updating the headache medicine fellowship curriculum. This task force is responsible for updating the rapid changes happening within our field. In addition to helping patients, I'm pursuing several areas of research. One study focuses on how kids' headaches are different from adults and how we may better treat them. We are also involved in studies looking at newer classes of migraine medications. We want to know how children tolerate and metabolize these medications and their efficacy among youth with migraine. When I'm not working, I love to spend time with my husband and three children. We take long walks, cook and try new recipes. Most of all, we love traveling as a family. BS: Loyola College, Baltimore, MD. MS: Georgetown University, Washington, DC.
