Walk Intuit offers Trauma Informed therapy and healing services We look forward to helping you on your healing journey. Our therapists are ready and waiting to guide and hold space for you. Together healing is possible! This journey started with an idea that there has to be better way to hold people in community. While spending time in Africa during and after the genocide Jessica Mathon learned about how to hold space, to hear people, and to hold people just as they are in community. She came back to the US and looked around at how we treat people who are suffering. And so began the journey that led us to Walk Intuit. Into a space of following our own intuition. A space where we held people in community. We choose to authentically show up for people who needed healing, people who needed to be seen. Walk Intuit is about offering the best care possible, honoring each individual, while being held in community. Welcome home. Welcome to Walk Intuit \"I have worked with local and international nonprofits for over 15 years, and I have never loved working anywhere as much as I have loved working with Walk Intuit. It is almost impossible to convey the magic of this organization, which is felt by almost every single client that encounters Walk Intuit. The founders, Jennifer and Jessica, have created a safe space of warmth and healing that feels like home to so many. Every therapist here shares a vision of a client-led model, where we meet the client where they are and allow them to guide us towards their own goals. We believe that the clients are the experts, and we are the shepherds that can lead them into their own light. \" \"Walk Intuit retreat greatly exceeded my expectations. It was by far the best retreat I have been to. The setting, the therapists, the activities all contributed to a very healing experience. I walked away with a deeper spiritual connection and inner peace. I highly recommend it.\" \"Amazing people! I'm grateful I got the opportunity to participate in this therapy.
