The name of the tea ceremony is traditionally called 'Cha Dao' \u2014 it's called 'the way of tea' or 'the art of tea,'\" said Tonic Herb Shop manager Silvy Franco, who began studying the practice three years ago in Colorado and then brought it to the East Coast. \"We sit in silence drinking tea, and I kind of guide the experience about the 'yin' and the 'yang' of how we hold the cup and what it means,\" Franco said, mentioning that, for each ceremony, she uses her empathic abilities to select the kind of tea she will pour and the variety of music playing in the background. \"It influences the journey a person goes through.\" The hour-long experience costs $15 per person. No prior meditation experience is required, Franco noted. And, while the ceremony is experienced by most participants as the Buddhist monks would have, by sitting on cushions on the floor, those with physical limitations are welcome to use the provided chairs or couch instead. After the ceremony is finished, participants are given enough time to share insights they gained from the experience, either with each other or through journaling. \"We focus on the nostrils and breathing to get really present,\" Franco said. \"The tea is actually a really gentle medicine, to help the person drop out of their headspace and more into their heart. The way that it links with the shop, is that tea is a Shen Tonic. In Chinese medicine, Shen Tonics help the person come back to their heart space, which is seen as the seed of the soul. So, oftentimes, when there are distractions in life, we lose touch with our higher selves, and Shen Tonics bring us back \u2014 especially when done in a ceremonial space \u2014 to your heart, so you might need guidance after the ceremony is over. \"Tea is a very gentle medicine. A lot of people are doing ayahuasca and mushrooms, and go through usually intense medicine experiences, whereas I feel tea called to me, because she's so gentle with the nervous system and not intimidating,\" Franco said. \"When we use the breath work, it relaxes the body so much that the tea can go in there and it starts shedding away the layers of inauthenticity. Through the breath work, the tea herself, which is a medicine, and the music, it just guides the person back home to the Shen space, which is the heart space.\" To participate in a tea ceremony at Tonic, "}
