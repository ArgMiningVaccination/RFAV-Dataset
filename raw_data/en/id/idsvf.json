At NIST I focus on development of approaches for characterization of the high order structure of biologics, so that these important therapeutics can continue to be safe and effective, and become more available and affordable. My areas of interest include multidimensional spectral processing and analysis, spectral fingerprinting, data visualization, and NMR homology approaches to biomolecular structure determination, and my work always includes the goal of producing practical, working software. In the NMR community, I'm best known as the developer of the NMRPipe software system ( [http://www.ibbr.umd.edu/nmrpipe/install.html](http://www.ibbr.umd.edu/nmrpipe/install.html)), which has been cited over 10,000 times in peer-reviewed literature, and has been used to help generate over 40% of protein structures ever measured by NMR.
