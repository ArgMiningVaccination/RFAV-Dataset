The gland is found behind the nose, connected to the base of the brain. It influences many different hormones which is why pituitary gland health is very important. While there are other important glands, the pituitary gland controls most hormonal function within your body, thus earning its nickname, the 'Master Gland.' Because the pituitary gland is connected directly to the brain, any fluctuations or disorders are immediately communicated to the brain. In response, the brain then adjusts the level of hormones your body makes. If there is a disorder with your pituitary gland, it has a ripple effect that impacts your entire endocrine system!

These hormone deficiencies can affect any number of your body's routine functions, such as growth, blood pressure or reproduction. Symptoms typically vary, based on which hormone or hormones you are missing.\" While Mayo Clinic goes on to note that, if diagnosed with hypopituitarism, you will need medication for the rest of your life, there are natural and holistic ways to treat your body's pituitary dysfunction.
