Pharm. (Pharmacology) Research Scholar, Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Meerut Institute of Engineering and Technology, NH-58 Baghpat Email: nimeshmiet@gmail.com Abstract The present study was based on Diabetes Mellitus, its cure using herbal drugs over allopathic drugs. According to the official World Health Organisation (WHO) data, India tops the list of countries with the highest number of diabetics; China, America, Indone sia, Japan, Pakistan, Russia, Brazil, Italy and Bangladesh follow. In the year 2000, the total number of diabetics in India stood at 31.7 million and is expected to rise by more than 100% in the year 2030 to account to a whopping 79.4 million. Despite the use of advanced Allopathic drugs for the treatment, use of herbal remedies is gaining higher importance because of Allopathic drugs have drawbacks and limitations. Natural herbs have been highly esteemed source of medicine throughout the human history. The y are widely used today indicating that herbs are a growing part of modern high -tech medicine. The herbal drugs with anti -diabetic activity are extensively formulated commercially because of easy availability, affordability and less side effects as compare d to the synthetic anti -diabetic drugs. The WHO has listed 21,000 plants, which are used for medicinal purposes around the world. A list of medicinal herbal plants with proven anti -diabetic and related beneficial effects and of herbal drugs used in treatme nt of diabetes is compiled. Thus, this review article undertakes the attempt for providing updated information on the type of diabetes and herbal formulations which will enhance the existing knowledge of the researchers.

Medicinal Herbal Plants and Allopathic Drugs to Treat Diabetes Mellitus: A al . 2 Introduction Many traditional medicines in use are derived from medicinal plants, minerals and organic matter [1]. A number of medicinal plants, traditionally used for over 1000 years named rasayana are present in herbal preparations of Indian traditional health care systems [2]. In Indian systems of medicine most practitioners formulate and dispense their own recipes [3]. The WHO has listed 21,000 plants, which are used for medicinal purposes around the world. Among these 2500 species are in India, out of which 150 species are used commercially on a fairly large scale. India is the largest producer of medicinal herbs and is called as botanical garden of the world [3]. The current review focuses on herbal drug preparations and plants us ed in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, a major crippling disease in the world leading to huge economic losses. Diabetes Diabetes is a chronic disorder of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism characterized by increased fasting and post prandial bloo d sugar levels. The global prevalence of diabetes is estimated to increase, from 4% in 1995 to 5.4% by the year 2025. WHO has predicted that the major burden will occur in developing countries. Studies conducted in India in the last decade have highlighted that not only is the prevalence of diabetes high but also that it is increasing rapidly in the urban population [4]. It is estimated that there are approximately 33 million adults with diabetes in India. This number is likely to increase to 60 million by the year 2025. Diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disorder resulting from either insulin insufficiency or insulin dysfunction. Type -1 diabetes is caused due to insulin insufficiency because of lack of functional beta cells. Patients suffering from th is are therefore totally dependent on exogenous source of insulin while patients suffering from type -2 diabetes are unable to respond to insulin and can be treated with dietary changes, exercise and medication (Figure 1) [5]. Type -2 diabetes is the more co mmon form of diabetes constituting 92% of the diabetic population. During diabetes, lipoproteins are oxidized by free radicals. There are also multiple abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism in very low - density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and hi gh- density lipoprotein in diabetes [6]. Lipid peroxidation is enhanced due to increased oxidative stress in diabetic condition. Apart from this, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed by non -enzymatic glycosylation of proteins. AGEs tend to accu mulate on long -lived molecules in tissues and generate abnormalities in cell and tissue functions. In addition, AGEs also contribute to increased vascular permeability in both micro -vascular and macro -vascular structures by binding to specific macrophage r eceptors. This results in formation of free radicals and endothelial dysfunction. AGEs are also formed on nucleic acids and histones and may cause mutations and altered gene expression [7]. As diabetes is a multifactorial disease leading to several complic ations, and therefore demands a multiple therapeutic approach. Patients of diabetes either do not make enough insulin or their cells do not respond to insulin. In case of total lack of insulin, patients are given insulin injections. Whereas in case of thos e where cells do not respond to insulin many different drugs are developed taking into consideration possible disturbances in carbohydrate -metabolism. For example, to manage post -prandial hyperglycaemia at digestive level, glucosidase inhibitors such as ac arbose, miglitol and voglibose are used. These inhibit degradation of carbohydrates thereby reducing the glucose absorption by the cells. To enhance glucose uptake by peripheral cells biguanide such as metphormine is used. Sulphonylureas like glibenclamide is insulinotropic and works as secretogogue for pancreatic cells. Although several therapies are in use for treatment, there are certain limitations due to high cost and side effects such as development of hypoglycaemia, weight gain, gastrointestinal dist urbances, liver toxicity etc (Table 1) [8]. Based on recent advances and involvement of oxidative stress in complicating diabetes mellitus, efforts are on to find suitable anti -diabetic and antioxidant therapy. The hypoglycaemic effect of some herbal extra cts has been confirmed in human and animal models of type - 2 diabetes mellitus (Table 2). The WHO Expert Committee on diabetes has recommended that traditional medicinal herbs be further investigated. Figure 1: Type -1 and type -2 diabetes mellitus.

Allium Sativum (Garlic) Garlic has been used in India for its anti -diabetic properties since ancient times [1]. In recent years, different in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated garlic's anti -hyperglycaemic effects [9]. Reviewed the effects of garlic on several cardiovascular -related factors and its adverse effects; after analysing 45 randomized trials; they observed no effects on glycaemic -related outcomes. In their conclusions, the authors recommend future studies with clear definitions of constituents and preparations, because in these clinical trials there are great variations of samples (oil macerate, aged garlic, and different kinds of extracts) and doses (from 10mg to 10 g) with mice, observed that gar lic extract antagonized LXR, an important regulator of cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose homeostasis, and increased LXR expression in the intestine. These effects could have an important role in the reduction of the lipid profile by garlic, which w ould justify the potential for this treatment of diabetes, but it should be demonstrated in humans [10]. Trigonella Foenum Graecum (Fenugreek) It is found all over India and the fenugreek seeds are usually used as one of the major constituents of Indian spices. 4 -hydroxyleucine, a novel amino acid from fenugreek seeds increased glucose stimulated insulin release by isolated islet cells in both rats and humans [11]. Oral administration of 2 and 8 g/kg of plant extract produced dose dependent decrease in the blood glucose levels in both normal as well as diabetic rats [12]. Administration of fenugreek seeds also improved glucose metabolism and normalized creatinine kinase activity in heart, skeletal muscle and liver of diabetic rats. It also reduced hepatic a nd renal glucose -6-phosphatase and fructose 1, 6 -biphosphatase activity [13]. This plant also shows antioxidant activity [14,15]. Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Anti -diabetic properties of Aloe vera selected a study with 72 diabetic women without drug ther apy, divided into two groups. They received aloe vera gel (15 g) or placebo for 42 days. Blood glucose levels subsequently decreased from 250 mg to 141 mg/dL in the experimental group. The same research team investigated the effects of aloe vera gel in com bination with a standard oral anti -diabetic therapy (2 \u00d7 5mg oral glibenclamide) and the subjects received either aloe or placebo as above. Results showed similar decreases in blood glucose in the actively treated group as described in the first trial. How ever, these studies were neither randomized nor blinded to patient or investigator [16]. Tinospora Cordifolia (Guduchi) It is a large, glabrous, deciduous climbing shrub belonging to the family Menispermaceae. It is widely distributed throughout India and commonly known as Guduchi. Oral administration of the extract of Tinospora cordifolia roots for 6 weeks resulted in a significant reduction in blood and urine glucose and in lipids in serum and tissues in alloxan diabetic rats. The extract also prevented a decrease in body weight [17]. T. cordifolia is widely used in Indian ayurvedic medicine for treating diabetes mellitus [18 -20]. Oral administration of an aqueous T. cordifolia root extract to alloxan diabetic rats caused a significant reduction in blood glucose and brain lipids. Though the aqueous extract at a dose of 400 mg/kg could elicit significant anti -hyperglycaemic effect in different animal models, its effect was equivalent to only one unit/kg of insulin [21]. It is reported that the daily adminis tration of either alcoholic or aqueous extract of T. cordifolia decreases the blood glucose level and increases glucose tolerance in rodents [22]. Allium Cepa (Onion) Dried onion powder shows anti -hyperglycaemic activity in diabetic rabbits. Allium cepa is also known to have antioxidant and hypolipidemic activity. Administration of a sulphur days) to alloxan induced diabetic rats significantly controlled blood glu cose as well as lipids in serum and tissues and normalized the activities of liver hexokinase, glucose 6 -phosphatase and HMG Co A reductase [23,24]. When diabetic patients were given single oral dose of 50 g of onion juice, it significantly controlled post -prandial glucose levels [25]. Thea Sinesis (Tea) Various studies report that polyphenolic compounds present in green and black tea are associated with Advances in Pharmacology and Clinical Trials Saurabh Nimesh , et al . Medicinal Herbal Plants and Allopathic Drugs to Treat Diabetes Mellitus: A al . 5 beneficial effects in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and anti -diabetic properties [26]. In th is direction, different studies have been designed in order to identify the effects of tea on glucose metabolism and insulin signalling as well as possible positive effects on patients with established diabetes. The Women's Health Study described that tea drinkers (drinking 4 cups of tea/day) had a 30% lower risk for developing Type II DM vs. non - tea consuming women [27]. In the Japanese, who consume 4 cups of green tea daily, there is a 33% reduced risk for diabetes, but no reduction was observed for r ed or black tea reported the positive effect of black tea intake on different biomarkers in the serum of patients with Type II DM (total antioxidant capacity, MDA, C-reactive protein, and GSH levels) [28,29]. The positive effect of green tea was correlated with the continuous ingestion of catechin -rich beverages. In effect, in a double - blind, controlled study, patients with Type II DM without insulin therapy received green tea (582.8mg catechins or 96.3mg of catechins /day for 12 weeks) and at the end of the trial, there was an increase in insulin and a decrease in HbA1c levels in the catechin group vs. the control [30]. Sage Officinalis (Sage) Leaves of Sage officinalis are used to treat digestive and metabolic disorders including Type II DM [31]. Their anti-hyperglycaemic effect has been studied in different animal model of diabetes and in a crossover trial with six healthy female volunteers as well as a 2 -month randomized, double -blind [32,33], placebo -controlled trial, but no glycaemia was assayed [34]. However, two years later, the last authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of a sage leaf extract in the treatment of 86 hyperlipidaemic Type II DM patients using a randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel group study with 42 treated patients treated wit h leaf hydroethanolic extract (500 mg/8 h for 3 months) and 44 as placebo groups. In this case, fasting glucose and HbA1c values were determined, together with the lipidemic profile. They described that the leaf extract lowered fasting glucose and HbA1c compared to the baseline at the endpoint with no adverse effects reported. Therefore, they concluded that sage leaves might be safe and have anti -hyperglycaemic effects in hyperlipidaemic Type II DM patients since the lipidemic profile also improved [35]. Psidium Guajava (Guava) Guava is a food crop and herbal plant from tropical countries whose leaves (water extract) are used to reduce hyperglycaemia in diabetic patients in Mexico. Many papers describing its pharmacological activities have been published, and Guti\u00e9rrez, et al. [36] reported two clinical assays. In one paper in China, a multicentric, randomized, controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of guava in diabetes management. After oral administration of 500 mg of aqueous leaf extract to 50 diabetic patients, they considered that guava could be used as a complementary therapy for preventing and treating diabetes mellitus, but not as a principal agent, since it is less effective than standard drugs. In the second trial, oral administration of 500 mg (f ruit) to 40 patients decreased glycaemia after 3 weeks of treatment compared to the diabetic control group. Gymnema Sylvestre (Gymnema) The leaf of Gymnema sylvestre is a reputed herb in both Ayurvedic and Western medicines. It shows positive effects on blood sugar homeostasis and controls sugar cravings [37]. It acts through the stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic cells, and some active compounds have been cited such as gymnemic acids and gurmarin, a 35 -amino -acid peptide demonstrated that Gymnema showed a limited effect on GLP -1 levels, although other effects, such as the interaction with glyceraldehyde -3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in glycolysis pathway, have been described [38]. Complementary mechanisms were described for this species, such as the modulation of the enzymes responsible for glucose utilization (increased phosphorylase activity and decreased activity of gluconeogenic enzymes and sorbitol dehydrogenase) and inhibition of glucose absorption in the bowel [39]. Other effects of Gymnema extract include a prolonged hypoglycaemic action of exogenous insulin in dogs without a pancreas, intensification of effects of insulin, and extended duration of reduced glucose levels. These effects were observed after administration of the extract, the saponin fraction, or isolated triterpene glycosides [40]. Some of these properties have been confirmed in different clinical trials conducted in the US with a patented preparation based on a standardized extract (400 mg/day), but 27 patien ts with Type I DM with insulin therapy were studied, and it was concluded that Gymnema increases the endogenous levels of insulin, possibly due to pancreatic regeneration [39]. However, two small, open -label trials have also yielded promising results after administration of Gymnema to patients with Type II DM In the first trial, patients that received 200mg daily for 18 to 20 months of an ethanolic extract significantly improved fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels. The second trial was uncontrolled, and patients that received 800 mg daily of a similar extract for 3 months reduced fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels; however, they used a mixed population of 65 patients Advances in Pharmacology and Clinical Trials Saurabh Nimesh , et al . Medicinal Herbal Plants and Allopathic Drugs to Treat Diabetes Mellitus: A al . 6 Type I and Type II DM. Gymnema reduced HbA1c levels and appears to improve glyca emic control, although complementary studies are necessary. In a later study, Type II DM patients received 500 mg herb/day for 3 months and the treated group reduced both fasting and postprandial blood glucose and HbA1c [40]. All together, these findings s uggest that Gymnema extract could be beneficial for the management of diabetes mellitus. Coffea Arabica (Coffee) A seed of coffee, Coffea arabica intake is associated with a reduced risk of Type II DM. To confirm this property examined the long -term relat ionship between the consumption of coffee and other caffeinated beverages and the incidence of Type II DM in a prospective cohort study (The Nurses 'Health Study and Health Professionals' Follow -up Study). They followed up 41934 men (1986 to 1998) and 8427 6 women (1980 to 1998) without diabetes, and 1333 new cases of Type II DM in men and 4085 new cases in women were documented. They found an inverse association between coffee intake and Type II DM, thus suggesting that long - term coffee consumption is assoc iated with a significantly lower risk for the disease [41]. This effect was associated with mineral and antioxidant contents, but the role of caffeine was not specified until the Pereira et al. study [42]. These authors demonstrated in a prospective analys is with a cohort of 28812 postmenopausal women free of diabetes of the Iowa Women's Health Study (1986 - 1997) that coffee intake, especially decaffeinated, was inversely associated with a risk of Type II DM. Azadirachta Indica (Neem) Hydroalcoholic extrac ts of this plant showed anti - hyperglycaemic activity in streptozotocin treated rats and this effect is because of increase in glucose uptake and glycogen deposition in isolated rat hemi diaphragm [43,44]. Apart from having anti -diabetic activity, this plan t also has anti -bacterial, of Eugenia jambolana is used as household remedy for diabetes. This also forms a major constit uent of many herbal formulations for diabetes. Anti -hyperglycaemic effect of aqueous and alcoholic extract as well as lyophilized powder shows reduction in blood glucose level. This varies with different level of diabetes. In mild diabetes (plasma sugar >1 80 mg/dl) it shows 73.51% reduction, whereas in moderate (plasma sugar >280 mg/dl) and severe diabetes (plasma sugar >400 mg/dl) it is reduced to 55.62% and 17.72% respectively. The extract of jamun pulp showed the hypoglycaemic activity in streptozotocin induced diabetic mice within 30 min of administration while the seed of the same fruit required 24 h. The oral administration of the extract resulted in increase in serum insulin levels in diabetic rats. Insulin secretion was found to be stimulated on incu bation of plant extract with isolated islets of Langerhans from normal as well as diabetic animals. These extracts also inhibited insulinase activity from liver and kidney [46]. Mangifera indica (Mango) The leaves of this plant are used as an anti -diabeti c agent in Nigerian folk medicine, although when aqueous extract given orally did not alter blood glucose level in either normoglycaemic or streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. However, anti -diabetic activity was seen when the extract and glucose were adm inistered simultaneously and also when the extract was given to the rats 60 min before the glucose. The results indicate that aqueous extract of Mangifera indica possess hypoglycaemic activity. This may be due to an intestinal reduction of the absorption o f glucose [47]. Momordica Charantia (Bitter Gourd) Momordica charantia is commonly used as an anti - diabetic and anti -hyperglycaemic agent in India as well as other Asian countries. Extracts of fruit pulp, seed, leaves and whole plant was shown to have hyp oglycaemic effect in various animal models. Polypeptide p, isolated from fruit, seeds and tissues of M. charantia showed significant hypoglycaemic effect when administered subcutaneously to langurs and humans [48]. Ethanolic extracts of M. charantia (200 m g/kg) showed an anti -hyperglycaemic and also hypoglycaemic effect in normal and streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. This may be because of inhibition of glucose -6-phosphatase besides fructose -1, 6-biphosphatase in the -6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities [49]. Ocimum Sanctum (Holy Basil) It is commonly known as Tulsi. Since ancient times, this plant is known for its medicinal properties. The aqueous extract of leaves of Ocimum sanctum showed the significant reduction in blood sugar level in both normal and alloxan induced diabetic rats [50]. Significant reduction in fasting blood glucose, uronic acid, total amino acid, total cholesterol, triglyceride and total lipid indicated the hypog lycaemic and hypolipidemic effects of tulsi in diabetic rats [51]. Oral administration of plant Advances in Pharmacology and Clinical Trials Saurabh Nimesh , et al . Medicinal Herbal Plants and Allopathic Drugs to Treat Diabetes Mellitus: A . 7 extract (200 mg/kg) for 30 days led to decrease in the plasma glucose level by approximately 9.06 and 26.4% on 15 and 30 days of the experiment respectively. Re nal glycogen content increased 10 -fold while skeletal muscle and hepatic glycogen levels decreased by 68 and 75% respectively in diabetic rats as compared to control [52]. This plant also showed anti -asthmatic, anti -stress, anti - bacterial, anti -fungal, ant i-viral, anti -tumor, gastric anti - ulcer activity, anti -oxidant, anti -mutagenic and immunostimulant activities. Anti -Diabetic Drugs Newer Anti -Diabetic Agents Insulin -obesity drugs, B -3 receptor antagonists Inhi bitors of intermediary metabolism: Anti - lipolytic and anti -hyperlipidaemic drugs, Fatty acid oxidation inhibitors - is third generation SU which binds to a 65 kd protein of the putative SU receptor different from the 140 kd protein targeted by other SU [53]. It has a 3 -fold faster rate of association and nine -fold faster rate of dissociation than glib enclamide and thus has rapid onset and prolonged duration of action, permitting once daily administration. Though its initial action is stimulation of insulin secretion, it has also an insulin -mimetic effect in peripheral tissues possibly mediated by GLUT -4 recruitment [54]. The extrapancreatic effects may explain lesser degree of stimulated hyperinsulinaemia. Unlike glibenclamide, this drug prevents post -exercise insulin release, thereby decreasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. It is absorbed completely in ei ther fasting or fed state. It does not accumulate in the body with reducing renal function (up to GFR 10 ml/min) and its hydroxy metabolite has negligible effects on blood glucose and is excreted equally by the liver and kidney. Hence it is safe in renal f ailure and in the elderly. It does not exhibit any drug interaction and because of its poor binding to extra pancreatic, myocardial, and vascular system ATP dependent K+ channels, the risk of coronary vasoconstriction and adverse cardiovascular events are reduced in comparison to other SU's. On a weight for weight basis glimeperide is the most potent SU with suggested doses between 1 -6 mg once daily, but doses up to 8 mg may give additional glucose lowering effect [55]. Repaglinide Repaglinide is a new che mical entity, a carbamoymethyl benzoic acid derivative which differs structurally from the sulphonylureas and belongs to the meglinitide group of drugs [56]. The insulinotropic action of repaglinide is mediated via the inhibition of ATP dependent potassium ion channels in the pancreatic beta cell membrane which results in the depolarisation of the cell membrane and an influx of calcium ions through voltage -gated calcium channels. Intracellular calcium concentration is therefore increased and along with it, the insulin secretion. Repaglinide binds with high affinity to a receptor which is distinct from sulphonylurea receptor. In addition, repaglinide binds with low affinity to the classic sulphonylurea receptor. This differential binding results in more poten t stimulation of insulin release. It is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract and has a half -life of less than 1 hour. It is metabolised primarily in the liver and is excreted predominantly in the bile thus, it is safer in renal failure and the elderly [57]. It is an effective post prandial glucose regulator and can be administered 3 times a day before meals for an effective glycaemic control. Doses may vary from 1 -4 mg twice or thrice a day. Adverse effects include GI intolerance and hypoglycaemia, though the latter is not prolonged as with glibenclamide Glucagon available are exenatide and liraglutide. These drugs exhibit increased resistance to enzymatic degradation by DPP4. In young patients with recent diagnosis of Type II DM, central obesity, and abnormal metabolic profile, one should consider treatment with GLP -1 analogues that would have a beneficial effect on weight loss and improve the metabolic dysfunction. GLP -1 analogues GLP -1, is currently approved for T2DM treatment as a single drug in the US and in combination with metformin \u00b1 sulfonylurea. Because of its half -life o f 2.4 hour, exenatide is advised for twice - daily dosing. Treatment with 10g exenatide, as an add - on to metformin, resulted in significant weight loss (2.8 kg) in comparison to patients previously treated with Advances in Pharmacology and Clinical Trials Saurabh Nimesh , et al . Medicinal Herbal Plants and Allopathic Drugs to Treat Diabetes Mellitus: A alone. Exenatide is generally well tolerated, with mild to moderate gastrointestinal effects being the most common adverse effect. Liraglutide Liraglutide is a GLP -1 analogue that shares 97% sequence identity to native GLP -1. Liraglutide has a long duration of action (24 h). Liraglutide ca uses 1.5% decrease in HbA1C in individuals with Type II DM, when used as monotherapy or in combination with one or more selected oral anti -diabetic drugs. Liraglutide decreases body weight; the greatest weight loss resulted from treatment with liraglutide in combination with combined metformin/sulfonylurea (3.24 kg with 1.8 mg liraglutide). Liraglutide also diminishes systolic pressure (mean decrease 2.1 to 6.7 mmHg). Liraglutide is well tolerated, with only nausea and minor hypoglycaemia (risk increased with use of sulfonylureas). Serum antibody formation was very low in patients treated with once -weekly GLP -1 receptor agonists. The formation of these antibodies did not decrease efficacy of their actions on blood glucose lowering [59]. Biguanides They were introduced in 1958. Following UGDP study, they were out of favour because of fear of lactic acidosis, but have bounced back as they are known to significantly counteract insulin resistance. Metformin is preferred to phenformin as it does not inhi bit mitochondrial oxidation of lactate and lactic acidosis with this drug is a rarity. Significant improvement in glycaemic control, lipid profile, and with no notable increase in plasma lactate, serum insulin, weight gain, and frequency of hypoglycaemia h ave been observed with this group of drugs [60]. Thiazolidinediones The discovery of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) and their subtypes have led to the discovery of a new generation of drugs. The two major PPAR receptors are & and b oth are expressed by obligate heterodimerisation with retinoic acid x receptor (Rx R and Rx R). The PPAR () is primarily responsible for lipolysis by activation of dehydrogenase. On the other hand, PPAR() is primarily responsible for the adipocyte differentiation and at the metabolic level, in FFA and lipid anabolism and storage. The pronounced hypoglycaemic effect seen by PPAR() agonists is attributed primarily to adiposite differentiation and/or activation [61]. Acarbose Originally developed in Germany, is being widely used for post prandial glucose regulation. It is usually used in type 2 diabetes either as a monotherapy or in conjunctio n with SU's or biguanides. The average decrease in post - prandial blood glucose during acarbose treatment in diet treated type 2 diabetic patients was 3 mmol/ 1 and maximal decrease in HbA1C was 1%. Acarbose is recommended thrice daily in doses of 50 -200 mg with the first bite of each major meal. Titration of dose is important to optimise benefits and minimise its side effects, which include flatulence, cramping, and diarrhoea [62]. Miglitol This is derived from 1 - deoxy nojiri mycin and is structurally similar to glucose. It is almost completely absorbed from GI tract, is short acting and hence is expected to have less GI side effects than acarbose. The usual dose is 50 -100 mg. daily [63]. Vanadium salts Vanadium is an such as vanadyle orthovandate, metavandate and peroxovandate have been shown to have insulinomimetic effects on adipocytes, hepatocytes, and the skeletal muscles as well as in hypoinsulinaemic animal models of the diabetes. They act by a mechanism independent of insulin and near euglycaemia is achieved in animal models within 1 -2 weeks. In animal models, vanadium salts induce decrease in body weight, attributed to its central anorectic effects. These salts act by increasing the phosphorylation of insulin receptor either by activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity or by inhibition of the phosphotyrosyl phosphatase that dephosphorylates the receptor and may also act on post receptor sites (mitogen activated protein kinase and cytosolic insulin independent tyrosine kinase). Importantly these compounds are effective even in situations where the insulin signal transduction pathway is defective. Usual dosage is 100 mg/day and the effect last for up to 2 weeks after discontinua tion. Major side effects are gastrointestinal; however, there are fears of its mitogenic potential, as it stimulates tyrosine kinase. A synthetic organic complex of vanadyl (bis maltatato) oxovanadium with high lipophilicity promising [64]. IGF -1 receptor agonists are also being developed for selective hypoglycaemic action, prolonged duration of effects, and perhaps for use by the oral route. Additionally, new drugs are being developed to counter complications in diabetes . These include Advances in Pharmacology and Clinical Trials Saurabh Nimesh , et al . Medicinal Herbal Plants and Allopathic Drugs to Treat Diabetes Mellitus: A AGE C inhibitors (LYS 333531, WAY 151003, and EL), nerve growth factors, octreotide, hismanal, topical clonidine, picotamide, and a lot of research is focused on antioxidants such as vitamin E and - lipoic acid [65]. Pramlintide Pramlintide is a synthetic amylin analogue that is indicated as an adjunct to mealtime insulin therapy in patients with Type I and Type II DM. By acting as an amylinomimeti c, pramlintide delays gastric emptying, decreases postprandial glucagon improves satiety [66]. Pramlintide is administered by subcutaneous injection and should be injected immediately prior to meals. When pramlintide is initiated, the dose o f rapid - or short -acting insulin should be decreased by 50% prior to meals to avoid a risk of severe hypoglycaemia. Pramlintide may not be mixed in the same syringe with any insulin preparation. Pramlintide should not be given to patients with diabetic gas troparesis (delayed stomach emptying) or a history of hypoglycaemic unawareness [67-85]. Conclusion Diabetes mellitus is a most common endocrine disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide. Increase in the number of diabetic patients, high cost for m edical treatments, unsatisfactory treatment response and mistrust of people in present day health care facilities signifies the still incomplete nature of the modern medicinal system.
