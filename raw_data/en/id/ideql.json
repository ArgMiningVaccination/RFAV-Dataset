This year's prize goes to, as their publisher says:](/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2011/mjs-pulitzer.jpg) - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: [Journal Sentinel wins Pulitzer in Explanatory Reporting](http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/120091754.html); Recognized were reporters Mark Johnson and Kathleen Gallagher, photographer Gary Porter, graphics editor Lou Saldivar and interactive producer Alison Sherwood. ; The paper's proclamation story is on a web page with links to its three part winning series on modern, DNA-driven medicine. This new brand of medicine is crystallized in the heart-grabbing story of a five-year-old boy with a horrific illness attacking his gut, and of the odyssey of research and daring that led a team at a local hospital to a treatment that, thus far, appears to be working. This site's previous posts on the series are, [here](http://ksjtracker.mit.edu/2011/01/06/milwaukee-journal-sentinel-immense-series-tells-tale-of-anguish-medical-mystery-hope-and-dna/) for the initial series that ran in December last year - which we called astounding - and [ here](http://ksjtracker.mit.edu/2011/03/03/milwaukee-journal-sentinel-forbes-a-big-seriess-update-clinical-customized-gene-sequencing-now-covered-by-some-insurance/) for a followup last month. This is just the most recent example of the strong medical reporting from this regional newspaper. It is to be congratulated for its devotion to nurturing that side of the newsroom and giving its reporters time and room to stretch their legs and to engage and educate their readers. Examples of other staff work include, with links to our previous posts: - John Fauber (Nov 29, '10): [Disjointed regulation](http://ksjtracker.mit.edu/2010/11/29/fauber-jaw-implants-a-long-road-to-hell/); About jaw implants - see also Paul Raeburn post here: [Fauber: Jaw implants a 'long road to hell'](http://ksjtracker.mit.edu/2010/11/29/fauber-jaw-implants-a-long-road-to-hell/). - John Fauber (Aug 28, '10) : [Bone-fusion protein raises questions about doctors' financial stakes](http://www.jsonline.com/features/health/101732913.html), followed by Part II [Complications rise along with off-label use of BMP-2](http://www.jsonline.com/features/health/101732923.html); Which Raeburn summarized under the tracker hed, \" [Fauber ...

A page devoted to that coverage, a series called [Chemical Fallout](http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/34405049.html), is here. The Pulitzer to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel was not the result of a one-time spike in brilliance or a riveting case of breaking news right under its nose, but one recognition for years of devotion to a powerful medical and environmental journalism team. Runners up were entries from the Wall Street Journal staff for reporting on Medicare fraud and abuse, and the Washington Post for reporting on battlefield trauma medicine.
