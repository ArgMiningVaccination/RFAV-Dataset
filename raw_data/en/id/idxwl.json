This style of yoga is founded on 4 principals: - Breath to help connection with one's own body - Integrity working with the edges of one's practice - Strength through long holding of poses/developing tools to go beyond fear & struggle - Spirit to create a sense of freedom and courage to walk as your spirit dictates. Challenged with skin issues and in a state of emotional distress, I had become obsessed with 'getting fixed' - running from practitioner to practitioner for answers. It was Tanya who opened my eyes and helped me reconnect with myself to access my inner wisdom and find that all the answers were already there. I was able to see and understand the patterns deeply rooted in my subconscious and with Tanya's gentle guidance and support laid the foundation for spiritual, emotional and physical healing. Tanya is a wonderful person and incredibly knowledgeable in all things body, mind and spirit. She carefully tailored the retreat to my (ever changing) needs - always with a great amount of love, thought and dedication. She inspired me on so many levels and I left the retreat with a new reading list, tips on nutrition, digestion and suitable supplements as well as a life long friend. Oh, and with beautiful skin Cuisine At Baja Cleanse we believe in a total body reset by leveling out your blood sugar level and pH by a one day fast followed by a Raw food and Ayurvedic way of enjoying food. Less is more and becoming more of a conscious eater instead of a habit eater. We offer organic raw fare through fresh salads and creative ethnic cuisine. Our Ayurvedic cuisine is satisfying savory broths and teas conducive for cleansing the body. Becoming a conscious eater... paying attention to our eating habits and thoughts while we are enjoying our food. We do things a little differently! We believe in a body reset which is listening to your body as to when it is hungry. A lot of times we mistake hunger for thirst. First we address the thirst and then we address the hunger in a healthy mental and physical way. Food is our companion. I am ready for a Baja Mexico Retreat!
