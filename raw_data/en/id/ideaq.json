S urveillance indicators suggest a plateau in activity levels compared to the prior week, requiring ongoing monitoring. Among influenza viruses typed at the BCCDC PHL since week 40, virtually all have been influenza A and, among those subtyped, more than 90 % have been A(H1N1)pdm09. Children under 10 years of age and non -elderly adults comprise 75% of all A (H1N1)pdm09 detect ions to date in BC, with children in particular disproportionately affected . Conversely, elderly adults comprise 62% of A(H3N2) detections thus far in BC . Since our last bulletin, 2 laboratory -confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreaks in long term care fa cilities (LTCF) have been reported. The cumulative tally of LTCF influenza outbreaks during this predominant A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic in 2018 -19 remains far below that of prior A(H3N2) -dominant seasons in 2017 -18 and 2016 -17 (19, 103, and 142 outbreaks, respe ctively). Interim estimates from Hong Kong for the 2018 -19 influenza season indicate substantial vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 92% (95% confidence interval: 82 - 96%) against A(H1N1)pdm09 hospitalisation in children (aged 6 months -17 years). These findings are consistent with earlier estimates from Canada showing vaccination reduced the risk of outpatient A(H1N1)pdm09 illness by 91% in children 1 -8 years of age.

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 5 Figure 4 Interior Fraser Vancouver Coastal Vancouver Island Northern BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 6 British Col umbia Laboratory Reports In recognition of expanded influenza testing by additional laboratories across British Columbia (BC), this section of the bulletin now include s respiratory specimens tested at sites beyond the BCCDC Public Health Laboratory (PHL) in deriving the test -positivity indicator. This change was implemented in the bulletin issued week 4 8 and represents a change from earlier bulletins of this and previous seasons. Type and subtype distribution will continue to be derived from the BCCDC PHL. Cumulatively, during the 2018 -19 season (since week 40, starting October 1, 2018), 3266 /13238 (25%) specimens tested positive for influenza at participating laboratorie s across BC (as su bmitted to FluWatch). In week 4, 329/972 (34%) specimens tested positive for i nfluenza at these laboratories , which represents a slight increase in the proportionate positivity from week 3 to week 4 (27% versus 34%) (Figure 5 ). Cumulatively, during the 2018 -19 season (since week 40, starting October 1, 2018), 2275 patients tested positive for influenza at the BCCDC PHL, of which 2265 (99.6%) were typed A viruses subtyped, 1884 /2027 (93%) were A(H1N1)pdm09. Of 183 typed influen za viruses in week 4, 180 (98%) were typed as influenza A and 3 (2%) w ere typed as influenza B. Among the influenza A viruses, 30 (17%) were identified as A(H3N2), 129 (72%) as A(H1N1)pdm09, and for 21 (12%) subtype was unknow n. In week 4, therefore , 129/159 (81 %) influenza A viruses subtyped were A(H1N1)pdm09 (Figure 6). Since week 40, approximately half (5 1%) of A(H1N1)pdm09 detections were among adults 20 -64 year s of age (Figure 8 ). Twenty -four percent of A(H1N1)pdm09 detections were observed among children 9 years who comprise about 10% of the BC population, suggesting they have been disproportionately a ffected. Children aged 10-19 years comprised a smaller proportion of cases (5%). Twenty percent of A(H1N1)pdm09 detections have been among elderly adults 65 years of age. Conversely , the majority ( 62%) of A(H3N2) detections have been among elderly adults 65 years of age, despite comprising about 18% of the population in BC1. Respiratory syncytial viruses (n=59) were the most commonly detected other respiratory virus (excluding influenza) at the BCCDC in week 4 (Figure 6 ).

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 9 BC Children's and Women's Health Centre Laboratory In week 4, 122 tests for influenza and 122 tests for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were conducted at the BC Children's and Women's Health Centre laboratory. Of these, 19 (16%) were positive for influenza A (not subtyped), 1 (1%) was positive for influenza B, and 30 (25%) were positive for RSV. Both influenza A and RSV test positivity are comparable to week 3 (Figure 9). Figure 9: Influenza and other virus detections among respiratory specimens submitted to BC Children's and Women's Health Centre Laboratory, 2018 -19 * Positive rates were calculated using aggregate data. The denominators for each rate represent the total number of tests; mult iple tests may be performed for a single specimen and/or patient. BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 10 Influenza -like Illness (ILI) Outbreaks In week 4, two laboratory -confirmed outbreaks of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 were reported in long-term care facility (LTCF) setting s. Since week 40, a total of 19 LTCF outbreaks (3 A(H3N2) , 10 A(H1N1)pdm09, and 6 subtype unknown) , 5 acute care facility outbreaks, and 28 school outbreaks have been reported (Figures 10 and 1 1). By way of comparison, between weeks 40 and 4 of the A(H3N2) dominant 2016 -17 and 2017 -18 seasons, 142 and 103 lab-confirmed LTCF outbreaks, respectively, were reported. Figure 10: Number of influenza -like illness (ILI) outbreaks reported, British Columbia 2018 -19 * School -based ILI outbreak defined as >10% absenteeism on any day, most likely due to ILI. Onset Facility -based influenza outbreaks defined as 2 or more ILI cases within 7 -day period, with at least one laboratory -confirmed case of influenza.

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 11 Emerging Respiratory Viruses Cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) - possibly associated with enterovirus D68 (EV -D68) Since September, the US CDC has reported an increase in paediatric cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a subset of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) (often referred to as \"polio -like illness\" in the media). As of January 18th 2019, the CDC has confirmed 201 cases of AFM across 40 states - predominantly affecting children under 5 years of age. A further 163 reports are currently under investigation. Patients have presented with neurological features, specifically single or multi -limb weakness, with most requ iring hospitalization. More than 90% of AFM cases reported a mild respiratory or febrile illness - consistent with a viral infection - in the weeks preceding symptom onset. AFM has a variety of possible causes, including non -polio enterovirus infection. Am ong 71 confirmed cases tested in 2018 , just over half (54%) tested positive for enterovirus or rhinovirus at the number of confirmed cases has surpa ssed that of their previous high in 2016 (when 149 confirmed cases were detected), and continues to increase. These reports indicate that 2018 represents another biennial peak, similar to that observed during EV -D68 epidemics in 2014 and 2016. The latter E V-D68 epidemics were noteworthy for including cases with severe respiratory manifestations (less prominently noted in 2018); however, neurological complications were also identified. Accordingly, the US CDC has escalated its response by establishing an AFM task force to aid investigation efforts. An increase in reported cases of AFP has also been detected outside of North America. Public Health England is currently investigating an apparent increase in reports of AFP in England (28 cases in 2018 as of Dece mber 19th, compared to an annual expected number of less than 10). The majority of these cases have been children and have arisen since September 2018. EV -D68 has been implicated in 8 (29%) of these cases. In Canada, a possible uptick in reports of AFP was also noted in 2018; as of December 31st, 47 confirmed cases have been documented with a further 2 9 cases under investigation. The annual expected number of cases reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada ranges between 27 -51 cases . While EV -D68 has been detected at low levels in BC this 2018 -19 autumn -winter period, we are aware of a single report of laboratory -confirmed EV -D68 infection associated with neurological features. This AFM report (a young child) presented in December 2018 with acute flaccid paralysis of an upper limb following a mild respiratory illness. General information related to AFP/AFM and EV -D68 is available from - flaccid -myelitis.html A summary of the 2014 experience in BC was published in Euro Surveillance, available from: https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560 -7917.ES.2015.20.43.30047 BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 12 National FluWatch (week 3, January 13 to January 19, 2019 ) Influenza continues to circulate across Canada ; however, Eastern region s are reporting higher levels of activity than the rest of the country. In week 3, 21% of laboratory tests were positive for influenza. To date, i nfluenza A is the most common influenza virus detected in Canada (99%) ; the vast majority of these viruses are A(H1N1)pdm09 (94% of subtyped influenza A viruses) . The majority (86%) of lab -confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 detections have been reported among individuals under the age of 65. Conversely , the majority (62%) of influenza A(H3N2) detections have been reported among adults 65 years of age and older. Details are available at: https://www.canada.ca/en/public -health/services/diseases/flu -influenza/influenza -surveillance/weekly (NML): Strain Characteriz ation From September 1, 2018 to January 31, 2019 , the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) has characterized 785 influenza viruses [ 66 A(H3N2), 701 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 18 B (15 Yamagata lineage and 3 Victoria lineage )] received from Canadian laboratories. Influenza A(H3N2): Twenty influenza A(H3N2) virus es were considered antigenically similar to A/Singapore/INFIMH -16-0019/2016, the WHO -recommended A(H3N2) component of the 2018 -19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine . However, 4 viruses showed reduced titer with ferret antisera raised against egg - propagated A/Singapore/INFIMH -16-0019/2016. Sixteen influenza A (H3N2) viruses belonged to genetic group 3C.2a1, 2 belonged to genetic group 3C.2a , and 5 belonged to 3C.3a. Sequencing is pending for the remaining isolate. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09: 686 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses antigenically characterized were found to be similar to the A/Michigan/45/2015 virus : the WHO -recommended influenza A(H1N1) component of the 2018 -19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. However, 15 viruses showed reduced titer with ferret antisera raised against cell culture -propagated A/Michigan/45/2015. Influenza B: Fifteen influenza B virus es antigenically characterized were considered similar to the B/Phuket/3073/ 2013 virus , which belongs to the B Yamagata lineage : the WHO -recommended influenza B component of the 2018 -19 northern hemisphere quadrivalent influenza vaccine. The WHO -recommended influenza B component of the trivalent vaccine is a B/Colorado/06/2017 -like virus of the B Victoria lineage. Three influenza B viruses characterized were antigenically similar to B/Colorado/06/2017. National Microbiology Laboratory (NML): Antiviral Resistance From September 1, 2018 to January 31, 2019 , the NML received influenza viruses from Canadian laboratories for drug susceptibility testing. Amantadine: Of the 311 influenza viruses [ 44 A(H3N2) and 267 A(H1N1)pdm09 ] tested against amantadine, all were resistant. Oseltamivir: Of the 601 influenza viruses [ 52 A(H3N2) , 533 A(H1N1)pdm09 , and 16 B] tested against oseltamivir, all were sensitive. Zanamivir: Of the 601 influenza viruses [ 52 A(H3N2), 533 A(H1N1)pdm09, and 1 6 B] tested against zanamivir, all were sensitive. BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 13 International USA (week 3, January 13 to January 19, 2019 ) Influenza activity remains elevated in the United States (US), with the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza observed to have increased in week 3 compared to week 2. I nfluenza A(H1N1)p dm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses continue co -circulate , with i nfluenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominating in most areas of the country ; however , influenza A(H3 N2) viruses have predominated in southeastern US. The majority of influenza vi ruses characterized antigenically and genetically are considered similar to the cell -grown reference viruses of the 2018 -19 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. All tested viruses showed susceptibility to zanamivir and greater than 99% of the viruses tes ted showed susceptibility to oseltamivir and peramivir. In week 4, t he proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza was above the system -specific epidemic threshold. Three influenza -associated pediatric deaths were reported during week 3 . The proportion of outpatient vis its for ILI increased slightly from 3.1% (in week 2) to 3.3%, and remains above the national baseline of 2.2 %.The US CDC has posted a summary of influenza activity in the United States and elsewhere for week 4, available at: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm WHO There have been no new WHO influenza updates since our last bulletin. Previous updates are available at: https://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/en/ BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 14 2018/19 Vaccine Effectiveness Estimates Canadian Mid -Season 2018 -19 Vaccine Effectiveness Estimates On January 24th, 2019, the Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network (SPSN) published the first midseason estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 2018 -19 season in the northern hemisphere. To date, the season in Canada has been characterised by dominant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity, with lesser influenza A(H3N2), and little influenza B contribution. The majority (about two -thirds) of participants contributing to VE analyses were working -age adults 20 -64 years -old. The Canadia n SPSN reported substantial VE of 72% (95% confidence interval (CI): 60 -81%) against medically - attended outpatient A(H1N1)pdm09 illness . This considerable vaccine protection was observed across all age groups, notably young children (91%; 95% CI: 67 -98), w ho also appear ed to be disproportionately affected by this year's A(H1N1)pdm09 -dominant epidemic. To illustrate, children 1 -8 years of age accounted for 28% of A(H1N1)pdm09 cases in this analysis, despite comprising approximately 9% of the underlying popul ation and 14% of the study controls. Greater involvement of children <9 years of age has also been observed in other surveillance systems (see page 6 of the current bulletin) and was also reported by Australia during its 2018 A(H1N1)pdm09 -dominant epidemic . This finding may reflect a greater proportion of children younger than 9 years in the current epidemic who were not yet born during prior recent H1 epidemics - notably the 2009 pandemic of 9 years ago - with fewer opportunities to have acquired immunity compared to older age groups. The Canadian interim estimate for 2018 -19 is comparable to preliminary estimates of vaccine effectiveness against A(H1N1)pdm09 using the same vaccine component reported from Australia (78%; 95%CI: 51 -91%) for their 2018 seaso n. It is substantially higher than reported for Canada during last year's A(H3N2) -dominant epidemic (for which vaccine effectiveness against A(H3N2) viruses was less than 20%). Consistent with global trends, sequencing analysis of viruses collected by the Canadian SPSN has revealed considerable genetic diversity among circulating clade 6B.1 viruses of A(H1N1)pdm09; however, a dominant drift (immunologic escape) variant has not yet been identified. The full report is available as an open -access publication in the online journal Eurosurveillance : https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560 -7917.ES.2019.24.4.1900055 Hong Kong Early Season Estimate s - 2018/19 Vaccine Effectiveness Against Pediatric Hospitalization On January 31st, 2019, interim vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates for the 2018 -19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine were reported from Hong Kong for prevention of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 hospitalization in children. Authors report substantial VE of 92% (95% confidence interval (CI): 82-96%) against A(H1N1)pdm09 -attributed hospitalisation in children (aged 6 months -17 years). As per above, this estimate is comparable to the VE estimate re ported earlier by the Canadian SPSN for the prevention of medically attended outpatient A(H1N1)pdm09 illness in children 1 -8 years of age (91%; 95% CI: 67 -98). Estimates from Hong Kong were not accompanied by the genetic or antigenic characterization of c ontributing A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses for context or comparison with findings from the Canadian setting.
