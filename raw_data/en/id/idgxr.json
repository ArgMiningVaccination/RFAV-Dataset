We have treated everything from chronic illnesses to preventive health and everything in between. The patient will complete a symptom survey online to provide us will a more knowledge of all symptoms, as well as any current medications and general health. Following this, we will conduct blood and hair testing. The results of these two tests most health issues can be identified and treated. Instead of treating with traditional medicine, we will recommend vitamins, minerals, herbal formulas, and other natural products. However, if we feel medicine is appropriate a referral to your primary care physician will be recommended. The goal is to get high or low values of the blood and hair within the healthy range. As that is accomplished the patient will begin to feel better, have more energy, and become healthier. Lifestyle and dietary recommendations based on the findings are include in the report as well as the individual's supplement recommendations. Questions? Get a free consultation. "}
