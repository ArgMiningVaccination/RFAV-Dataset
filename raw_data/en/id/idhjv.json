Robinson Beauty Do you feel beautiful? What happens when women do not feel attractive, beautiful, or self-connected? Yes, our self-esteem can take a hit. Some of us can obsess over the most minor things about ourselves, from our looks to the elasticity of our bodies and faces. We over-examine ourselves and become convinced that others notice the traits we dislike. Insecurities can make us cancel outings with friends or lovers because we don't look right in an outfit, we can't get our makeup to blend, or our hair is not behaving as we desire. Other beauty challenges create long-term self-esteem issues, social anxiety, and problems with intimacy (this is a big one). It is hard to become aroused when we don't feel beautiful. Within our Wellness Program, Her Mind Her Body provides various ideas and practices to connect you with yourself in your purest form. We redefine beauty and get your mind focused on accepting and developing who you are. Furthermore, our exclusive Her Mind Her Body app (coming soon) encourages women in the softest and most creative ways. It's time we break down the word beauty together. There is nothing wrong with putting makeup on your face, having nice clothes and hair, and an Instagram-ready image, but we challenge you to be comfortable with or without any of these external factors. After all, it's not the outward that drives the beauty but the woman behind the wheel. So, download our app (coming soon) and explore over 30 topics, especially for women, created by women! Also, if you live in Maryland, see how you qualify for a one-to-one service with our Holistic Life Coaches within our Wellness Program.
