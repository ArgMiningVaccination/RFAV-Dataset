Everything in the universe resonates energy. At Passport 2 Vitality we can measure your body's energy field and the signature that various elements such as foods, pathogens, chemicals, heavy metals, and scars can have on those fields. Sounds strange? Let us show you. Everything in the universe resonates energy. You resonate energy. Let us show you how it impacts your wellbeing. Most people are comfortable with the idea of transmitting energy through touch, prayer, and meditation. They get it. What they may not understand is that same energy surrounds their body at all times. Learning to harness that energy to protect and enhance it, is within our control. But first, you need to acknowledge it and trust that your energy fields can be restored when weakened by some of the stressors to which you are exposed. To achieve optimum health, Alexandria encourages clients to explore the holistic model of healing which addresses the physical, emotional, and energetic/spiritual states of wellness. Energetic Healing is a term used for any therapy that manipulates the energy circuits in our physical or subtle bodies to regain and facilitate the innate healing mechanisms of the body. Reconnective Healing Alexandria considers herself fortunate to have studied and been trained by [Dr. Eric Pearl](http://www.thereconnection.com/), in Levels I, II, and III in [Reconnective Healing](http://dev.graphicsofdistinction.com/ptwov/your-path-starts-here/reconnective-healing/) and The Reconnection, a subtle yet powerful healing modality that can activate profound changes on all levels. Emotional Freedom Technique and Quantum Coherence Integrator Two of Alexandria's favorite tools for quickly and effectively clearing emotional issues and \"re-polarizing\" the body's natural energy fields are Quantum Coherence Integrator and Emotional Freedom Technique. These two tools; QCI and EFT allow for full healing potential to be realized and maximum nutrient uptake. QCI is a powerful, bio-energetic, balancing technique that can rapidly \"repolarize\" the whole body to help re-establish its full healing potential. When the body's bio-field loses coherence due to various causes (such as trauma [emotional or physical], nutritional deficiencies, toxicity, infection, etc.), the body's internal operating system begins to weaken. QCI can be used to rapidly reset the weakened energy bio-fields using a small, unique QCI Vial which transfers high-frequency, beneficial earth fields to the body when it is placed in contact with the head for a few seconds. The body's internal operating system is like a sophisticated, interactive biological computer. The body contains a highly organized network of interconnected bio-energy pathways called meridians (which correspond to various organs and glands), first outlined in ancient acupuncture texts, and now verified by medical science. When an area of the body becomes weakened, it \"polarizes off\" and becomes much more difficult for the body to send healing energy or deliver nutrients to that area. This is because it is hard for the brain's internal monitoring system to \"see\" or recognize the weakened area due to its de-polarization. It's as if the area has been turned off. In addition, other areas of the body can also become deficient at the same time. Together, these areas can all work to negatively reinforce each other. The effect can be multiple areas of stagnation in the body that are energetically \"off,\" which decreases the ability of the body to return to health. Deficient areas that are often overlooked are scars or areas that have been previously traumatized (such as a fall or whiplash), even from years ago. Unfortunately, once an area has been deficient (or \"off\") for a long period of time, it becomes much harder for the body to heal it. Even if nutritional supplements are taken, the uptake of nutrients is poorer in the very area where it is needed most (the deficient area) since the internal monitoring system fails to \"see\" it. The Quantum QCIT Vial contains a unique blend of highly paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances sourced from all over the world. This blend is specially bio-energetically sequenced using breakthrough, new technology to achieve an extraordinarily high-spin energy state. The QCI Vial has the effect of combining maximum yin and maximum yang earth polarities which generate a concentrated, powerful natural biological healing field. When the vial is placed in contact with the external meridian flow on the head, the QCI Vial immediately begins to initiate a dramatic, healing, re-polarizing effect on the body's natural bio-field. Avoid placing the QCI Vial in water or in a microwave oven. Otherwise, the inherent, beneficial field effects of the Vial are stable indefinitely, provided the Vial is unopened. The contents of the QCI Vial are not for internal consumption. The minerals in the Quantum QCI Mineral Vial are whole, complex minerals, naturally occurring in nature, sourced from an ancient, pristine volcanic deposit. They are specially sequenced to re-modulate the human bio-field so it can rapidly restore its own normal functioning. These minerals are used as a base for their energetic signature rather than as a source of bulk minerals. To exit this downward cycle of failing energy bio-fields, the QCI procedure can be used to quickly \"turn on\" and stabilize the body's bio-energetic fields. When used several times per day, especially before meals, the body can begin to rapidly increase its nutrient uptake into those areas most needing it so the body can return to a state of health. In some cases, the body is able to return to a state of radiant health never experienced before, even when younger. The foundation of Emotional Freedom Technique or EFT is based on the principle that the cause of all negative emotions is due to a disruption in the body's energy system and unresolved negative emotions are major contributors to most physical pains and diseases. Alexandria has substantial experience working with the body's energy systems, meridian channels, and reflex points. A key component of EFT is in knowing the right question to ask to discover the underlying blockage causing the energy disruption. After many years of clinical experience and in-depth interaction with her clients, Alexandria has developed a strong intuitive sense and accurate insight into her clients' challenges and emotions. EFT is a complementary adjunct to her practice, modalities, and healing philosophy. EFT is based on a new discovery that has provided thousands with relief from pain, diseases, phobias, traumas, and emotional issues. Simply stated, it is an emotional version of acupuncture except needles aren't necessary. Instead, you stimulate well-established energy meridian points on your body by tapping on them with your fingertips. This common sense approach draws its power from (1) time-honored Eastern discoveries that have been around for over 5,000 years and (2) Albert Einstein, who told us back in the 1920's that everything (including our bodies) is composed of energy. These ideas have been largely ignored by Western Healing Practices and that is why EFT often works where nothing else will. As you will clearly see, conventional healing methods have overlooked the obvious. You will find that EFT is usually quite gentle and you can often achieve substantial relief with little or no pain. This is not true for everyone, however. Some people's issues are so intense that the mere mention of them causes emotional or physical pain. But, given time, even these are often resolved efficiently with EFT. Morphogenic Field Technique Morphogenic fields of the body are what some people refer to as your \"aura\". At Passport 2 Vitality, we understand that everything in the universe is made up of energy and has its own unique \"signature\". By studying the dynamic energy signature of clients, we can match their energy signature to the correct nutritional protocol for optimum health and wellbeing. Morphogenic fields are the energy signatures that help our bodies grow and heal. Our bodies constantly emit energy signals. Physicists and scientists are studying this to better understand these fields of energy that surround our bodies. These morphogenic fields, or M-fields, can be used to help our bodies grow and heal. Constantly changing, they reflect our bodies condition such as our hydration, nutritional needs, etc. Studies are finding that by measuring this field, we can get a good picture of our bodies needs and create a nutritional plan to meet those needs. We all know that diets don't work. Why? Are we all just so lacking in willpower that we can't stick to a plan? By better understanding your morphogenic fields, we can design a program that matches the energy signature of your body using organic whole foods and supplements. Chiropractic and nutrition specialist, [Dr Mark Goldhirsch](http://drmarkg.com/nutrition/morphogenic-field-technique.html) says, We know, from years of clinical success, that patients who are constantly tired, in pain or otherwise symptomatic have very \"small\" or unbalanced energy fields/ M-Fields. Conversely, people who are symptom-free and full of energy have very \"large\" and balanced M-Fields; [https://passport2vitality.com](https://passport2vitality.com/) [https://passport2vitality.com](https://passport2vitality.com/)Using MFT procedures, your health care provider can guage the \"quality\" of your energy field. With the information derived from the use of the MFT Testing Procedure, your practitioner can design dietary changes and whole food supplements that can \"amplify\" your M-Field. Over time, as you begin creating new cells and tissues with optimum nutrition, your enlarged M-Field can move you in the direction of improved overall health. Bria is trained to match your Morphogenic Field to a nutrition protocol designed specifically for you. Considered a revolution in modern nutritional healing, this technique works because by using a modified form of muscle response testing, we can get a picture of what nutrients your body needs and what toxins is your body holding on to that need to be released.

Alexandria is trained in the Morphogenic Field Technique (MFT) and can schedule an appointment to evaluate your M-field and design a plan exclusively for you. "}
