If you are not able to climb stairs please let us know before your appointment so we can set up the alternative access treatment room on the first floor. You must bring a filled out intake form to your first appointment or show up 15 minutes early and fill out an intake form in the waiting room. Your first appointment cannot start until this form is filled out and your appointment may be shortened if it is not completed by the scheduled start time of your appointment. If possible, please bring all supplements, medications, pertinent imaging/lab work, and insurance card (if we are billing insurance for you) to your first visit. This will help Doctor Kim in providing you the best care possible. "}
