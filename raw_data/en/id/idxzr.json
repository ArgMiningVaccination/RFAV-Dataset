At CHOC, aromatherapy is offered among our [integrative health services](/programs-services/integrative-health/). Our [licensed traditional Chinese medicine practitioner](/programs-services/integrative-health/#ruth) performs aromatherapy in private patient rooms to help patients and their families feel better. We use essential oils that have been approved for safety and are a standard of care. Different oils are selected for specific symptom management, including: - Pain: lavender, sweet orange, peppermint - Insomnia: sweet orange, lavender - Worries/Anxiety: lavender, sweet orange - Fatigue: lemon, peppermint. The oils are dripped lightly onto a cotton ball for a patient to hold to his or her nose. The scents also disperse into the air and benefit a patient's family if they are in the room. Evidence suggests that when a person breathes in fragrant air, the odor-sensing nerves in the nose are stimulated, sending impulses to the limbic system of the brain. "}
