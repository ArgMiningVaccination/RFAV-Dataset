Dizziness and a spinning sensation (vertigo) are symptoms of a vestibular balance disorder. Balance disorders can occur at any age. But they are most common as you get older. Your ear is a complex system of bone and cartilage. Within it is a network of canals. These are called semicircular canals. The canals are filled with fluid. The position of the fluid changes with movement. A sensor in the ear then sends the information to your brain to add to your sense of balance. These and other delicate pieces make up the vestibular system. Certain things can affect the signals from any of the parts of the vestibular system, causing symptoms. What causes vestibular balance disorders? Common causes of vestibular balance disorders include: - Medicines - Infections - Inner ear problems, such as poor circulation in the ear - Calcium debris in your semicircular canals - Problems rooted in your brain, such as traumatic brain injury What are the symptoms of vestibular balance disorders?
