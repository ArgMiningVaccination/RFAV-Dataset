Mills Governor Jeanne M. Lambrew, Ph.D. Commissioner October 22, 2020 The Maine Immunization Program is reaching out to provide information regarding the distribution of COVID -19 vaccine. During this pandemic, we recognize partnerships between vaccine providers and federal, state/jurisdictional, and local agencies are vital. Early in the COVID -19 Vaccina tion Program, there may be a limited supply of COVID -19 vaccine and vaccination efforts may focus on those critical to the response, those providing direct care, and those at highest risk for developing severe illness from COVID -19. This includes long -term care facility (LTCF) residents (i.e., nursing home, assisted living facility, and independent living facility residents). U.S. CDC is partnering with CVS and Walgreens to offer on -site COVID -19 vaccination services for residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities once vaccination is recommended for them. The Pharmacy Partnership for Long -term Care (LTC) Program provides end -to-end management of the COVID -19 vaccination process, including cold chain management, on -site vaccinations, and fulfillment of reporting requirements, to facilitate safe vaccination of this patient population, while reducing burden on LTC facilities and jurisdictional health departments. The services will be available in rural areas that may not have easily accessib le pharmacies. LTCF staff who have not received COVID -19 vaccine can also be vaccinated as part of the program. As part of this program, which is free of charge to facilities, the pharmacy will: Schedule and coordinate on -site clinic date(s) directly wi th each facility. Three visits over approximately two months will likely be needed to administer both doses of vaccine and vaccinate any new residents and staff. Order vaccines and associated supplies (e.g., syringes, needles, personal protective equipment). Ensure cold chain management fo r vaccine. Provide on -site administration of vaccine. Report required vaccination data (approximately 20 data fields) to the local, state/territorial, and federal jurisdictions within 72 hours of administering each dose. Adhere to all applicable Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) COVID -19 testing requirements for LTCF staff. If interested in participating, LTCFs should sign up (or opt out) starting October 19. Sign up will remain open for two weeks. Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) will make their selection through the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). An \"alert\" will be incorporated into the NHSN LTCF COVID -19 module to guide users to the form. Assisted living facilities (ALFs) will make their selection via an online REDcap (https://redcap.link/ltcf ) sign-up form. Facilities will indicate which pharmacy partner (one of two large retail pharmacies or existing LTC pharmacy) they prefer to have . Online sign -up information will be distributed through ALF and SNF partner communication channels (email, social media, web). Indicating interest in participating is non -binding and facilities may change their selection or opt in or out via email after the online survey closes. Once the sign -up period has closed, no changes can be made via the online form, and the facility must coordinate directly with the selected pharmacy provider to change any requested vaccination supplies and services. U.S. CDC will communicate preferences to C VS and Walgreens and will try to honor facility preferences but may reassign facilities depending on vaccine availability and distribution considerations and to minimize vaccine wastage. U.S. CDC expects the program services to continue on site at participating facilities for approximately two months. After the initial phase of vaccinations, each facility can choose to continue working with CVS or Walgreens or can work with a pharmacy provider of its choice.
