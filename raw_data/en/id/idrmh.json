A good height makes one look great, be confident, and have greater self-esteem. If you're feeling depressed or having a school or emotional problems related to delays in your growth and development, Ayurveda can help you get the height you always wanted. Different ayurvedic medicine for height increase naturally are available with any side effects Understand concept of Height Before using any ayurvedic home remedies to grow taller, first, we need to understand the concept of height. The human growth hormone is one of the solutions to the problem of how to increase height. The human growth hormone is produced in the anterior portion of the pituitary gland deep inside the brain. Production peaks at adolescence when accelerated growth occurs. But growth hormone levels fall steadily on reaching adulthood, and the body stops to increase height. Increase Your Height with AYURVEDA Methods Throughout our life, we constantly generate human growth hormones (HGH). Maintaining our body's chemical balance and cell rejuvenation are two main reasons our body generates HGH. There are a number of factors that, if manipulated correctly, will substantially increase growth hormone levels in your body and to achieve the right height, Ayurveda treatment can help to attain it A potted plant never attains its maximum height if the natural growth-promoting factors like water, sun-light or the rooting system is restricted. This is in analogy to human growth, says Ayurveda. Though genetically, every person has been pre-programmed to attain a certain height, most people never reach this height simply because they do not do everything necessary for their body to maximize growth. Identifying and correcting the inhibiting factors can achieve growth promotion, in most of the cases. Research On Increasing Height Factor According to the human growth medical research findings, human height is not determined by genetic factors alone but is strongly influenced by the effects of certain hormones on the development of the 26 skeletal bones and the cartilaginous portions of the 62 bones of the lower body. The stimulation of the pituitary gland would increase hormonal production, which would then spur the growth of the cartilaginous portions of the bones of the lower body, ultimately leading to a height increase. Intensive scientific research has also proven that most young adults can still grow a few inches taller even after the bones in their lower body have become ossified (commonly known as 'bone plate is fused'). This is because besides the length of the femur bone (thighbone), shinbone, and other bones in the lower body, the length of the spinal column in the upper body also significantly contributes to human height (about 35% of the total height). There are totally 25 non-fusible disks in our spinal column which can constantly grow thicker under the stimulation of growth hormone. Their combined length accounts 25% of our total height. The thicker those disks are, the longer your spinal column is and the taller you become. Even each disk grows only 0.25 cm (0.1 inch) thicker, you will grow 0.25 * 25 = 6.25 cm (2.5 inches) taller! Relation of Height with Age There is a certain age at which people usually stop to grow: men\u201425, women\u201421. It occurs shortly after puberty, but these numbers can be changed. Nevertheless, it is possible to continue growing until 25 years old for women and 27-30 years old for men. It is possible because of Ayurveda therapies, medicines certain exercises, physical activities, eating the right food with the right nutrients and vitamins. Of course, the older you are the harder it will be for you to gain height.
