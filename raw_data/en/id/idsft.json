Our publication embraces the entire holistic spectrum, from physical health issues to the emotional and spiritual well being of our animals. We welcome unsolicited articles and story outlines as long as they focus on holistic healing, whether physical, emotional or spiritual. Articles may range in length from 500 to 1,500 words. If you submit an outline for a story, please also send samples of your work. Before submitting to Equine Wellness, we ask that you familiarize yourself with our publication so that you have a strong sense of the type of articles we publish. Consider topics you know well and/or that will offer special interest and appeal to our readers. Please ensure that any health facts or statistics that might appear in your article are accurate and come from an accredited source. Please do not send multiple submissions (articles that have been sent to more than one publication) unless you have received confirmation that the story will not be used by another magazine.

Photographs, where applicable, are also encouraged. They may be submitted either digitally (at 300dpi) or as prints or slides along with your manuscript. Make sure the photos are labeled and include your name, address and phone number. Every attempt is made to return photographic material, but it is advised that you keep copies of your images.
