These holistic treatments offer unique benefits that heal the body from the inside out; when combined, the results are magnified. These practices help patients overcome physical difficulties and boost their overall quality of life. They are designed to correct imbalances within the body's supportive and structural systems and speed up the healing process. As a result, patients attain an improved nervous system, receive natural pain relief, and optimize their health and overall wellbeing. When it comes to ongoing pain caused by either an injury or chronic illness, you have to pinpoint what you need to relieve and find the optimal treatment for your condition. To help you understand how combining chiropractic care with acupuncture can benefit you, here are some facts you should know about chiropractor acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture vs. Chiropractor Treatment: How Do They Work? Acupuncture Acupuncture is one of the main components of traditional Chinese healing that dates back to over 2,500 years ago. This practice focuses on an energy force known as Qi, vital in maintaining proper bodily functions and health. The practice involves inserting thin needles through the patient's skin to stimulate strategic points in the body. In turn, this helps improve the flow of Qi, leading to reduced inflammation and boosted self-healing. Although it is mainly used as a form of pain relief, it is effective as an everyday means of elevating overall wellness and stress management. Chiropractic Care Chiropractic care is a drug-free, non-surgical treatment for back pain caused by skeletal irregularities like arthritis, disc problems, and muscle strain. Instead of needles, chiropractors apply hands-on manipulation and spinal adjustments to relieve pain and boost bodily functions. Along with complementary treatments like massaging and bracing, chiropractors align the body's musculoskeletal system and speed up the natural healing process. Chiropractic care is especially beneficial for pain relief and healing from injuries related to spinal conditions like shoulder pain, headaches, and migraines. Why Combine Chiropractic Care and Acupuncture? Chiropractic care is usually preceded by acupuncture when conducted by two different professionals. However, you can benefit best by considering these two practices as a dual-modality treatment. Using both simultaneously makes them more efficient at removing minute obstructions in the Qi flow, eliminating pain, and facilitating healing and natural balance in your body. Acupuncture also promotes the release and circulation of endorphins and blood throughout the body, relaxing and loosening the muscles. By receiving this treatment before chiropractic adjustments, long-term results are made easier to achieve, dramatically speeding up the healing process and reducing inflammation if not quelling it altogether. Despite differences in origin, they both use non-invasive and drug-free techniques to target specific injuries and facilitate holistic healing. When done right, chiropractor-aided acupuncture can create balance in the body, improve natural healing and energy levels, and allow the body to flourish. What Conditions Do Chiropractic Care and Acupuncture Treat? Acupuncture is applied to address musculoskeletal-related pain \u2014 an area specialized in by an expert chiropractor. These professionals are qualified to prevent, diagnose, and treat dysfunctions and disorders related to the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. In fact, acupuncture is one of the methods used by chiropractors to treat musculoskeletal-related pain as a form of compliance to the scope of practice applied in several provincial jurisdictions. For chiropractors to conduct acupuncture, they must complete additional training from a recognized educational institution. As part of the requirements set in their areas, chiropractors should successfully complete a minimum of 200 hours of formal training before being qualified to incorporate acupuncture in their practice. While acupuncture offers tons of benefits in chiropractic care \u2014 like treating nausea, compromised immunity, insomnia, arthritis, and hypertension \u2014 there are three specific areas that chiropractors pay attention to, namely: 1. Neck Pain Recent evidence shows that acupuncture treatment reduces chronic neck pain. Patients who experience this condition are treated with manual therapy combined with other modalities like acupuncture. The results showed that these individuals attained moderately improved pain reduction, better bodily functions, heightened strength, expanded range of motion, and greater overall patient satisfaction. 2. Headaches Acupuncture has been used to treat both short-term and chronic tension-induced headaches. In addition, combining symptomatic treatment with acupuncture can reduce the frequency of migraines. 3. Lower Back Pain A Cochrane review found that acupuncture can better help with pain relief and functional improvement from back pain than short-term sham treatments or no treatment at all. In addition, another study suggests that acupuncture can be a helpful additional treatment for lower back pain therapies. When coupled with traditional therapies, acupuncture offers amplified results for pain relief than conventional treatments alone.
