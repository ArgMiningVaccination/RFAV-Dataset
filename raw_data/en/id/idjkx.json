I work with plants as botanical ingredients to support emotional healing, including grief work and rituals for self care. I share information about healing and the value of nature, through workshops, services and ceremony. The artistry I share is expressed through the writing and illustration of story, the blending of botanical oils, and photography. The foundation for my practice is based on Animism, it is the root from which my art, voice and services grow. Appointments are taken using digital platforms with facetime & zoom. Some services are available in person. [Workshops and Training ](https://www.kristinaldaniels.com/workshops) Professional training with topics ranging from ceremonies for self care to empowered natural beauty, making smoke bundles and talking about Animism. Information can be customized for any size group, presented digitally or in-person. [The Art of Storytelling](https://www.kristinaldaniels.com/projects-6) Through the adventures of a cat named Avery Finn, we gently explore ways to talk about death, make new friends and have adventures. Schedule an in person reading or a digital story hour using the book online tab. Ponder the beauty of the natural world through my lens. I create an annual calendar and post on Instagram @ five28_hz. [Ministry & Ceremony](https://www.kristinaldaniels.com/services-1) I teach workshops about the practice of Animism and use of ceremonial plants. I also provide support for life/death transitions with ceremony and ritual. My passion for plants and their healing abilities drive the alchemy for infusing aromatic and botanical support for skin and soul. Hand blended herbs soaked botanical oils are shared seasonally. Information & Workshops about plants we use to heal can be scheduled thru the Book online tab. Nature is a teacher of mine and I often work with her tools (plants) to unite healing with ceremony. The chemistry plants produce for health and healing is what we use in aromatherapy as medicine to heal our body, mind and spirit. Our breath connects us intimately with plants, through the exchange of oxygen & carbon dioxide. Plants and fungi share their bodies with us both as food and medicine, and if to complete a cycle, our flesh is returned to nature in death. The more I observe plants and ecosystems, the more I believe we humans might learn from their 700 million years of successful evolution on this planet. EXPLORE Seasonal Oils and Serums A couple of times a year, I like to share the botanical oils I create. Small hand blended batches are created with care. Avery Finn Adventures Avery Finn is a cat on an Adventure. Join us to read about his adventures, or schedule a personal reading. Workshops and Training Workshops and training on the safe use of essential oils, or their numerous uses! Ministry, Endings & Beginnings I am an Ordained Animist Minister. I am able to officiate weddings and host ceremony for spiritual transition. Follow on IG @ five28_hz My practice uses skills from aromatherapy, esthetics, animist ministry, artistry, death midwifery, social justice and environmental advocacy. Services and workshops use our senses to refocus our attention on nature as a means to help heal our Selves & each other. The journey we all will take, to heal our communities and planet, begins by looking within. "}
