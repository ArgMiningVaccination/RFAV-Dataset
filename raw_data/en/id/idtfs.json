Pursu- ant to the order of the House of Janu-ary 5, 2011, the Chair will now recog-nize Members from lists submitted by the majority and minority leaders for morning-hour debate. The Chair will alternate recognition between the parties, with each party limited to 1 hour and each Member other than the majority and minority leaders and the minority whip limited to 5 minutes each, but in no event shall debate continue beyond 11:50 a.m. f WE NEED A REAL JOBS AGENDA, NOT ANOTHER ROUND OF NAFTA-STYLE DEALS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. K APTUR ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, you want to know why we have a budget deficit? We have a budget deficit because we have a jobs deficit, and we have a jobs deficit because our Nation has been outsourcing millions of jobs for over a quarter century. White House after White House and Congress after Con-gress have allowed our manufacturing and jobs base to be whittled away through a trade regimen that outsources U.S. production and Amer-ican jobs, financed by the same big Wall Street banks that caused the fi-nancial meltdown. Year after year the United States continues to rack up enormous trade deficits with nation after nation. The numbers don't lie. They tell us that over 2.7 million manufacturing jobs alone were lost just during the Bush administration. Washington must fi-nally confront our so-called free trade failed policies if we are going to be se-rious about creating jobs in order to balance the budget. Last year, the trade deficit was an- other astonishing half a trillion dol-lars. Imagine a half a trillion, plus a half a trillion, plus a half a trillion, plus a half a trillion year after year after year. That equaled, just for last year, 7 million American jobs that were not created here because of our job-killing trade policies. Rather than stopping this enormous outsourcing of America, we're being of-fered up more of the same, more failed free trade agreements, this time with Korea, Panama, Colombia. Has Washington learned nothing, or are the economic powers that outsource these jobs bearing down on Washington so greatly that the Amer-ican people can't be heard? The public's interest is being suppressed. These agreements are another expan- sion of the same policies and processes that were enacted with NAFTA. We were all told in 1993 that NAFTA would create millions of jobs. Instead, we have seen exactly the opposite, mil-lions of jobs decimated. Our trade deficit with Mexico last year was over $66 billion in the red. In 1993, proponents of NAFTA, like Gary Huffbauer and economist Jeffrey Schott, promised we would have, and I quote them, ''an annual current ac-count surplus with Mexico of about $10 billion through the 1990s.'' That was an absolute falsehood. Obviously, they were all wrong, dead wrong. Instead, we saw over a third of all manufac-turing jobs in the United States dis-appear since we signed that agreement and $1 trillion accumulated trade def-icit with Mexico. Not a single year since NAFTA's is passage was the U.S. in the black. We heard the exact same fairy tale regarding China's Permanent Most Fa-vored Nation Status. We were told that that agreement in 1998 would create millions of jobs in America. Instead, the result has been a cumulative $2 trillion trade deficit with China alone. When you think about the budget deficit, you'd better think about the trade deficit because they are abso-lutely interlinked. You're not going to balance the budget until the American people go back to work, and they can't go back to work when their jobs are being sent elsewhere. If you always do what you have al- ways done, you will always get what you always got. The Economic Policy Institute's analysis predicts that the agreement that's proposed with South Korea will cost us an additional 159,000 jobs in our country. Since this January, we have already rung up, look at the numbers, over $7 billion trade deficit with South Korea. With passage of the proposed agreement, do you think it's going to make the job situation better? If you want to see just how poorly ne- gotiated the Korea deal is, take a quick look at the auto provisions. There's no reciprocity. Last year, Korea sold near-ly half a million cars in our country; 500,000 cars. The United States, you know how much we sell to them? Six thousand. What kind of deal is that? And we'll be lucky if, under this agreement, where there's a hope that we might sell perhaps, 75,000 cars to Korea, so, they get a half a million, we get a handful? How's that a credible plan to create jobs in our country? VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep \u2014 HOUSE H6142 September 14, 2011 And then there are the other two pro- posed agreements with Panama and Co-lombia, the latest NAFTA expansion. What are the major commercial inter-ests there? The Government Accountability Of- fice has identified Panama as a major haven for, guess what, tax avoidance. Panama is a popular destination for the very same multinational corpora-tions that want to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes by creating off-shore subsidiaries. And how about Colombia, which is the most dangerous country in the world if you care about labor rights, and no free country in the world does not have labor rights. Over 2,000 trade unionists, 2,000 have been assassinated there since 1990. What a pleasant place to do business. And there has been no justice for their victims and their fam-ilies in the majority of those murder cases. And what is the largest economic in- terest we have with Colombia? It has three letters. It isn't a place to export U.S.-made goods. Rather, it's more oil imports. How can those that support these failed trade agreements want more? We need to create jobs in this coun- try again because, in order to balance the budget, you have to put the Amer-ican people back to work, and you can't do that when you're outsourcing more of their jobs and importing more into our nation than we export. f PASS E-VERIFY TO CREATE AMERICAN JOBS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. S MITH) for 1 minute. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, for 2 years, 14 million Americans have been out of work. Yet illegal workers hold 7 million jobs. It is inexcusable that American workers have to com-pete with illegal immigrants for scarce jobs. Congress has the opportunity to open up millions of jobs for unemployed Americans by requiring all U.S. em-ployers to use E-Verify. This program checks the Social Security numbers of new hires. E-Verify is free, quick and easy to use. Individuals eligible to work in the U.S. are confirmed 99.5 per-cent of the time. The public also supports E-Verify. According to a recent Rasmussen poll, 82 percent of likely voters think busi-nesses should be required to use E- Verify to determine if a new employee is in the country legally. This is one of the most important job creation bills Congress should pass and the President should sign. f JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE ON DEFICIT REDUCTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. H OYER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this week the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction began work on a roadmap to bring down our Nation's deficit and re-store our fiscal health. They heard from Doug Elmendorf, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, who reit-erated once again what we already know, our Nation's current fiscal posi-tion is not sustainable. We also know that the problem we're facing stems, in part, from buying things without paying for them, in-cluding two wars, tax cuts for the wealthiest in America, and a prescrip-tion drug program. But what matters now is taking action. b1010 Over the month of August, we heard very clearly from the American public that they want us to work together on the issues they are most concerned about: jobs and the deficit. Action on one issue will directly impact on the other. Creating jobs and growing the econ- omy is one of the most important things we can do to bring down the def-icit. And getting a handle on our fiscal situation will give confidence to en-courage economic growth and job cre-ation. Both the Bowles-Simpson and Domenici-Rivlin fiscal commissions supported this tenet by calling for im-mediate action to boost the economy while laying out a plan to reduce the deficit over the long term. This is why the joint select committee must suc-ceed. We have a responsibility to show Americans and the international com-munity that we can meet the chal-lenges we face, that we can join to-gether and make the tough decisions necessary to spur growth and to bring our debt under control. I believe the committee must go be- yond the $1.5 trillion target in the def-icit reduction bill if we hope to strengthen our economy and seriously change our Nation's fiscal outlook. Over 60 economists and former Mem- bers of Congress signed a letter encour-aging the joint select committee to reach the biggest agreement possible, and I want to join with them in that request. In their letter, signed by co-chairs of both the Bowles-Simpson and Domenici-Rivlin fiscal commissions, among others, they state, ''We believe that a 'go big' approach that goes well beyond the $1.5 trillion deficit reduc-tion goal that the committee has been charged with and includes major re-forms of entitlement programs and the Tax Code is necessary to bring the debt down to a manageable and sustainable level, improve the long-term fiscal im-balance, reassure markets, and restore Americans' faith in the political sys-tem.'' I am in absolute agreement with that proposition. As the letter I just quoted indicates, the committee must also put all options on the table. That's a chal-lenge on the Republican side; that's a challenge on the Democratic side. But it must be done because we cannot get to where we need to get without doing so. The math is irrefutable. We cannot get to where we need to go if we ignore revenues or if we fail to ensure our safety net is sustainable for genera-tions to come. A balanced approach that looks at defense spending, reve-nues, and entitlements is the only real way we're going to put America's fiscal house back in order. A balanced approach is also key to making sure everyone pays their fair share. We cannot ask the middle class families and seniors to bear the entire burden of balancing the budget. The most well-off among us, which is most of us, by the way, in this body must also contribute to that objective. But as we focus on ways to restore our budget balance, we cannot and must not forget the immediate jobs cri-sis that too many families face. Any plan to bring down the deficit must start, as Bowles-Simpson and Domenici-Rivlin both observed, with getting people back to work. That is why I hope Republicans and Democrats will work together to bring the Presi-dent's proposed American Jobs Act to the floor for a vote without delay. As the President said, we have 14 months to wait until the next election. People without jobs, people's whose homes are underwater, people who have lost their homes, they don't have 14 months to wait. The jobs program suggested by the President mirrors many components included in the House Democrats' Make It In America agenda and will help create jobs in the short term. All of us, Democrats and Republicans alike, must be invested in the commit-tee's success. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to be committed to the success of reaching agreement in this committee of 12. This is a time to put partisan politics aside and do the hard things, very hard things, the cou-rageous things that we have to do for our country. I believe we're equal to the task. And I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, if we are not equal to the task, then all of our citizens will right-fully be extraordinarily disappointed, as they are today, in their elected rep-resentatives on both sides of the aisle. Success of this committee, success of this House and the Senate in reaching and meeting the challenge that con-fronts us is essential if the confidence level of our own citizens and the inter-national community is to be raised and given the level necessary for future success. f AMERICAN LAND ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. P OE) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, many, many years ago the second American Revolution took place when Washington, D.C., was invaded by the British in the War of 1812. Many forget that the Capitol, the White House, and Washington, D.C., were burned to the VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6143 September 14, 2011 ground by the British. And after the War of 1812 was over with, America found itself in a situation that's not unfamiliar with us today. America was out of money. So what did people decide to do here in this body of Congress about how to get more money into the Federal Treasury? They thought of a unique approach that maybe we ought to think of and do today. Right now we talk about raising taxes, cutting spending, and we need more revenue. Maybe we ought to think outside of the box when it comes to revenue instead of more government taking from the people and giving it to its special groups. Let's do what they did at the end of the War of 1812. The Federal Government decided that it would sell some of the land to Americans\u2014what a novel thought\u2014and let Americans own America. They could produce that land, and then they could pay more taxes. And that's what they did at the end of the War of 1812. We talk about the land in America. Who is the biggest landowner in this country? Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam owns 27 percent of the land mass in the United States. This poster here shows the land area in red, including Alaska, that is owned by the Federal Govern-ment, Uncle Sam. Twenty-seven per-cent of the land! Half of the land west of the Mississippi, or in the West, be-longs to the Federal Government. Those folks in the West, half of it be-longs to Uncle Sam. He's their neigh-bor in every western State. It's dif-ferent in the East because much of that land was sold at the end of the War of 1812. Now, 27 percent, what does that mean? That's really hard to understand how much that is. If you were to super-impose the 27 percent of the land mass in the United States into Europe, you would find that Uncle Sam would own almost all of Europe. Western Europe is about 27 percent of the land mass of the United States. And of course that includes the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzer-land, Germany, Austria, Italy, Poland, and even Spain. Now, we're talking about a lot of land. Does Uncle Sam really need all of that land? Much of it's unproductive, not paying any taxes, not paying any revenue to local and State govern-ments. So maybe we should do something that our forefathers, our ancestors did\u2014sell some of that land to Ameri-cans and allow that revenue to come into the Federal Treasury so we can pay off all of our debts that we have ac-cumulated over the years. Twenty- seven percent of the land mass is 623 million acres in this country. Ronald Reagan tried to do that when he was President, but it did not go very far at all. You know, even President Obama mentioned about a month ago that there's 300 acres in Los Angeles County that's owned by the Federal Government. We could sell that for $2 billion. So maybe we need to think outside of the box. I've introduced the American Land Act. We talk about the American Jobs Act. The American Land Act would require that the Federal Govern-ment sell a portion of that land over a period of years. Now, I want to be careful to state we're not talking about the national parks. We're not talking about Yosem-ite. We're not talking about the marshes and environmentally sensitive areas in this country. We're talking about unused land by the Federal Gov-ernment. And then we could raise some revenue. I believe that this could be up to about $200 billion of revenue that would be brought into the United States. Sell it to Americans and that will bring revenue into our treasury. When Americans own America, they can also develop that land. Then they can be productive and then they can pay even more taxes. b1020 When people own land, they pay property tax. That tax primarily goes to local and State governments, which pays for our school systems. So that undeveloped land, that unused land, some of that should be sold to Ameri-cans. Let Americans buy American. Real property in the hands of real Americans. What a novel thought that is. Uncle Sam, the Federal Government, is all about power and control over ev-erything. Loosen up a little, and let Americans buy part of America. Uncle Sam shouldn't prevent Americans from having a real stake or share in our country, the United States of America. It doesn't belong to Uncle Sam\u2014at least it shouldn't. It should belong to Americans. The United States owns most of the grand estate in this coun-try, and it's time to let more Ameri-cans own it because America should be-long to Americans. And that's just the way it is. f A REFLECTION ON THE COLLEC- TIVE BARGAINING SYSTEM AND LABOR UNIONS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. B LUMENAUER ) for 5 min- utes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. It is unfortunate there is an attempt to scapegoat Amer-ica's unions for the economic problems that beset us. After all, it was not America's gro- cery clerks, nurses, teachers, postal workers, and electricians who nearly caused the meltdown of the economy. It wasn't America's labor unions that were pushing for tax loopholes that made our revenue system a hopeless, inefficient mess. It wasn't unions that pushed for shortcuts for worker safety that produced the tragedy that we've seen in our mines. America's working men and women didn't engineer poor loans, systematically cheat consumers, and transform financial institutions into giant casinos. No doubt there were some consumers who took unfair advantage as well as others who were not as vigilant as they should have been in the financial melt-down; but the truth is they were part of an unprecedented economic scheme that played on those weaknesses, the gullibility and some individual greed to make it into a vast industry. Are there some areas where unions are too effective in securing benefits for their members? That probably de-pends on who you ask about the give and take of the collective bargaining process. The leadership of unions are, in fact, much more democratic than their corporate counterparts. Union of-ficials are routinely challenged for re-election. There are insurgents even in the most powerful and entrenched unions, something one seldom sees on the boards of public corporations. How many business directors are defeated? It's not easy to even have opposing nominees through today's shareholder democracy. It's pretty sketchy com-pared with what happens with unions. There is a very direct remedy for union power in the negotiation process. For 18 years, I was a local elected offi-cial, part of that time responsible for a collective bargaining program. I like to think that I bargained tough but that I bargained fair\u2014but I bargained. I've supported collective bargaining rights for public employees since I was first in the Oregon legislature and still believe that honest, tough, principled negotia-tions will lead to the best results. Having someone attempt to dictate working conditions unilaterally is not calculated to produce enhanced produc-tivity. It matters how people are treat-ed and how they feel. Employee-owned corporations illustrate this principle in spades, some of which are not only em-ployee-owned but have unions in addi-tion. One of the best performing of the world's economy is Germany, where they still manufacture and have a huge export market for high-value products. The Germans work hard to integrate labor and business with government in the decision-making process, some-thing that is, sadly, too rare in the United States. Unions are not the answer for every employee and every company, but every employee and every company ought to have that option. Even com-panies that are nonunion benefit. I've had executives from successful compa-nies candidly tell me that they treat their employees right because they don't want them to unionize. Even these nonunion company employees benefit from higher wages, better bene-fits, and a system that respects worker rights because of the competition with the unions. Instead of treating employees fairly by allowing them to organize, far too many corporations have chosen instead to attack the fundamentals of collec-tive bargaining. It is today an art form in some companies to stall, delay, in-timidate, even to flagrantly violate the VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep \u2014 HOUSE H6144 September 14, 2011 laws of collective bargaining in this country, weak as they are and as inef-fectively as they are enforced. Collective bargaining has been sys- tematically under attack by my Re-publican friends in Congress as Repub-lican administrations have fought to make a National Labor Relations Board that is toothless, passive and un-able or unwilling to protect the rights of employees to organize. This is not calculated to produce a spirit of co-operation. It is not clear that people need to cheat in order to avoid any ex-cesses of collective bargaining. I would argue the opposite. It's not just workers in companies, union and nonunion, who benefit from unions. American society benefits. It was organized labor that spearheaded the effort for a 40-hour workweek. It is not just rhetoric that unions brought you the weekend. Unions have played a key role in extending security to mil-lions of Americans in the workplace, in consumer safety and in environmental protections. Again I don't pretend unions are per- fect and I've had some differences with them over the years. But make no mis-take: Unions are amongst the few who stand up to some of the more egregious economic follies, for justice in the workplace, for protecting the unorga-nized, fighting for a minimum wage, even a living wage. It's important to reflect about our collective bargaining system. I'm all for fine tuning, but I am adamantly op-posed to gutting rights and protection of workers. I think we all should start by ac- knowledging the debt we owe to unions and work to stop this wholesale assault on America's workers. f THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, ''THE SINGLE BIGGEST IMPEDI-MENT TO JOB GROWTH'' The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. B ROUN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BROUN of Georgia. A legendary Georgia businessman recently called the Obama administration ''the single biggest impediment to job growth.'' That same man, Mr. Bernie Marcus, also says the business that he founded would have never succeeded if he were trying to start it today. Home Depot, his Georgia-based company, currently has more than 2,200 stores all across the United States. They support more than 300,000 American jobs, and they generated $68 billion in revenue just last year. Now, imagine the impact on our country if companies that start out like Home Depot\u2014which started as an individual store\u2014or other small busi-nesses weren't able to flourish. That is what the Obama administration is try-ing to do to the American Dream today. By creating a huge bill with ObamaCare and a failed stimulus bill and by piling thousands of new govern-ment regulations onto the backs of small businesses, it is no wonder that job creators are afraid to expand and hire new people. And so, after 2 12years of growing the Federal Government and $4.5 trillion in spending later, the Obama administra-tion has given us another proposal of the same old failed policies. Unfortu-nately, their latest solution to our 9 percent unemployment rate comes with a price tag of almost a half tril-lion dollars, money that we just simply do not have. So to pay for the Amer-ican Jobs Act, as I like to call it ''stim-ulus part II,'' our Democrat leaders want to hike taxes on families and job creators. We've been down this road before. The stimulus did not work 2 years ago, and it will not work today. Hiking taxes in the middle of a recession will make our economy worse, not better. When will this administration learn that more of the same just simply isn't good enough anymore? Jobs will come when government gets out of the way\u2014 by getting rid of ObamaCare, by stop-ping the reckless spending here in Washington and the threat of higher taxes, and by ending the uncertainty in the marketplace. b1030 Congress needs to pass my jobs bill, which would immediately and perma-nently lower the corporate tax rate to zero, and it will permanently lower the capital gains tax to zero. This will stimulate our small businesses so that they can do what they do best, grow, expand and to thrive. In the words of Mr. Marcus, the founder of Home Depot, ''It's time to stand up and fight.'' The free enterprise system has made this country what it is today, and we must have policy that makes it pros-per. f CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS FOR PUERTO RICAN CIVILIANS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. G UTIERREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask us to take action on a scathing Department of Justice inves-tigation of a police department that ''regularly violates the constitutional rights of civilians through illegal searches, detentions, and arrests,'' that ''continues to demonstrate a deliberate indifference to the public's safety and the civil rights of individuals engaging in protected speech activities during protests,'' a police force where ''offi-cers engage in a pattern and practice of unreasonable force and other mis-conduct to suppress the exercise of pro-tected First Amendment rights.'' The report details the abuse against the people of Puerto Rico that they are facing by the Puerto Rico Police De-partment. Underscore, I said, ''I rise to bring the urgent attention of the U.S. House of Representatives to a human rights and civil rights crisis.'' I further stated, ''where the right of students to protest and speak their minds is being denied with clubs and mace and pepper spray.'' I spoke those words 7 months ago on this floor. The DOJ report states that the Governor of Puerto Rico has ''su-preme authority'' over the police. Did he use that supreme authority to re-spond to Puerto Ricans who asked for help? Yes, he did. The Governor's ruling party took im- mediate action after I detailed the abuse. The ruling party was outraged. It was outraged at me. Facing a civil rights crisis, the ruling party of Puerto Rico acted without hesitation, con-vening the legislature to urgently pass legislation to censure me for speaking out. In part, the censure reads: ''Congress- man L UISGUTIERREZ made false allega- tions about a supposed human rights crisis in Puerto Rico; he expressed him-self in a denigrating and malicious manner about the honorable body of the Puerto Rico police; all of which tends to hurt the good image and good name of Puerto Rico.'' Here's the problem: The ruling party of Puerto Rico has made clear time and time again they are not concerned about the abuse of their people, only that the world might notice that abuse. They don't seem to understand that if you love people, you stand up and you speak out, not pretend that ev-erything is all right. For standing up, the Government of Puerto Rico gave me a 600-word cen-sure. But the government didn't give one word, not one word of censure, to what happened to Rachel Hiskes. Here's what the DOJ describes hap- pened to her: ''A student journalist, Rachel Hiskes, entered the Capitol with other individ-uals and attempted to access the sen-ate chambers. ''Puerto Rico Police Department offi- cers, who had been dispatched to the capitol earlier in the day, stopped Hiskes and hit her. ''She was not resisting or combative. Hiskes then sat in the hallway with other visitors in protest. A capitol em-ployee then sprayed Hiskes and others with chemical irritants. ''As Hiskes tried to get up, an officer hit her across the back with a baton, causing her to fall. An officer contin-ued to push and strike her with his baton, driving her toward the doorway. ''When she reached the door and had her back to the officer, the officer shoved her out onto the concrete stairs using his baton and hitting her in the neck. ''Hiskes was never arrested or charged with any crime.'' Instead of protecting people like Ra- chel, the government derided the peo-ple. This Governor's chief of staff, a man he has absurdly tasked with responding to the Department of Justice report, said protesting workers would be treat-ed as ''terrorists'' and boasted he would VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6145 September 14, 2011 personally kick protesting students off campus. This government cannot fix a prob- lem they helped to create and expand. The students, bloodied with batons, deserve more. The workers beaten and the journalists pepper-sprayed deserve more. And, to be clear, the many honorable and brave Puerto Rican police officers, men and women who are incorruptible, who do their jobs right and risk their lives every day, they deserve more too. When crimes like these are brought to light, we expect criminal indict-ments. I want to see a special prosecutor ap- pointed, the grand jury seated, the trials begun and see those responsible, not just the police officers following orders but those who directed the po-lice to systematically suppress free speech, sent to jail. The goal must be to reestablish the rule of law and to reestablish a police department in Puerto Rico that pro-tects and serves the people. The goal must be a police department fighting crime, not committing crime. The goal must be that no government can act with impunity against its own people. And I have one last recommendation. The Governor of Puerto Rico should apologize to his people. Puerto Ricans have called out for help. In response, the Governor and the ruling party have led an effort to demonize them for standing up for their civil rights. Governor, the Department of Justice of the United States of America has just made clear that your people were right and you were wrong, and it is time for you to say you're sorry. f HONORING MAJOR GENERAL THEODORE MALLORY III The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. W ESTMORELAND ) for 5 minutes. Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, there are men who watch life go by as a spectator, and then there are the Ted Mallorys of the world. In one of life's greatest mysteries, Ted Mallory's time on Earth came to an end June 26 after a late diagnosis of stomach cancer. Major General Theodore ''Ted'' Mal- lory III had embraced his many gifts and lived one of the fullest lives I have ever been privileged enough to encoun-ter. The Bible says: As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another. Ted made it his personal mission to sharp-en the lives of those men and women around him, and he pushed people to their highest potential. After attending Auburn University, Ted entered into the U.S. Air Force Of-ficer Training School in 1965 and grad-uated with the U.S. Air Force Out-standing Graduate Officer Award, among many other awards that he ob-tained while in training. These were the first of many commendations Ted would receive throughout his 36-year military career. A recipient of the Dis-tinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal, Na-tional Defense Service Medal with one bronze service star, Republic of Viet-nam Gallantry Cross with Palm, and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. Ted truly embodied the ideal airman. He was also awarded the Daughters of the American Revolution Medal of Honor. I would need an hour on this floor, Mr. Speaker, of time just to list all the rest of Ted's accomplish-ments. His education did not stop at Auburn University. In addition to the military professional education programs of-fered through the Air Force, Ted is also an alumnus of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard Uni-versity. After he left active duty service, Ted entered into the Air National Guard, where he served for 30 years and held the roles of group commander, wing commander, and chief of staff. He was promoted to major general in 1997 and retired in 2001 as commander of the Air National Guard/Air Education and Training Command. While serving in the Air National Guard, he remained active in his com-munity, serving on the Fayette County school board for 10 years as chairman, and on the Georgia School Board Asso-ciation as president in 1986. Ted served on several additional boards, including my academy nomination board, and was president of the Joseph Sams School board of directors, a school serving the needs of children with men- tal and physical disabilities, and Ted took me on a tour of that facility about 2 months before he passed away. His accomplishments reach far be- yond military service, though. Ted was also a very successful businessman in the aviation industry. His focus was al-ways on safety and flying, where he was training new pilots, or as a senior vice president of Flight Operations and chief safety and security officer for ASTAR Air Cargo. b1040 General Mallory is now flying sorties far above us all, watching down on his loved ones left behind. My wife, Joan, and I will continue to pray for Alice, his wife of 44 years, his soul mate; his children, Teddi and T.J. and their fami-lies; his grandchildren, Mallory and Thomas; and his sister and brother-in- law, Molly and Tom. May all those who have been touched by Ted's life find comfort knowing that his legacy will live on in both our lives and our memo-ries. So Ted, until we meet again one day, I want to thank you for everything you did to better our lives and our country. I miss you, Teddy. We all miss you. f A COST-EFFECTIVE CIVILIAN SURGE FOR AFGHANISTAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. W OOLSEY ) for 5 min- utes. Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, yester- day the U.S. embassy and NATO head-quarters in Kabul were attacked. The Taliban, which we know has exerted its influence in many of the remote re-gions of the country, is now flexing its muscle in the supposedly secure cap-ital. It's just the latest piece of evi-dence that the military occupation of Afghanistan is having exactly the op-posite of its intended effect. Nearly a decade after we allegedly defeated the Taliban and drove them from power, they remain as fearless and undaunted as ever. The longer we have boots on the ground, the more we prop up the very enemy we are supposed to be fighting. And for this, the American people have the privilege of shelling out $10 billion a month. I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle, the ones who are lecturing us every day about cutting spending, isn't there something better we can do with the taxpayers' money? Well, it turns out there is, and it would do more to promote security and counterterrorism than waging a bloody and violent war. For years now, I've been promoting a platform I call ''SMART Security.'' SMART Security represents a whole-sale change in the way we protect our country and promote our values abroad. It puts us in a position of part-ner, not invader. It's smart because it treats warfare as a very last resort. It's smart because it uses different tools to engage other nations and resolve global conflicts. It's smart because it empha-sizes diplomacy, pursues multilateralism, promotes democracy, and respects human rights. And it's smart because it would dramatically increase our investment in inter-national development projects that will lift people up instead of tearing their country down. What we need in Afghanistan and poor countries around the world is a ci-vilian surge, one that will rebuild in-frastructure, power lines, schools, hos-pitals, economic opportunity, and much more, whatever that nation would find useful that we could help with. You think it sounds expensive? It's a drop in the bucket. I'm talking about pennies on the dollar compared to a 10- year military occupation. In fact, The Washington Post noted last week that civilian efforts in Afghanistan have cost the United States about $1.7 bil-lion over the last 2 years. Let's com-pare $1.7 billion over 2 years to $10 bil-lion a month in Afghanistan. And even that level of funding is now facing tough scrutiny here on the Hill. Are you kidding me? Let's put this into perspective\u2014$1.7 billion, we spend that much on the war in Afghanistan in less than a week, and that's what we invest in 2 years of civilian efforts. If we ended this war, we could rein- vest the money in the bigger, bolder surge that we really need and still have plenty left over to create jobs right VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6146 September 14, 2011 here at home and meet other impor- tant obligations. But right now, Mr. Speaker, our priorities are completely distorted. We are sacrificing the lives of our troops in a morally reprehen-sible war that is fiscally reckless and strategically an epic, historic failure. After 10 years, it's time to bring our troops home, make the change we so desperately need. Embrace and adopt the principles of SMART Security. f TEXAS LEGISLATURE CALLS ON CONGRESS TO PASS BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. M ARCHANT ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, in the last few weeks as I traveled across my district, the 24th District of Texas, it became very obvious to me that the number one issue on the minds of my constituents is out-of-control Federal spending. In the last legislative session in Texas, my former colleagues in the Texas legislature passed a resolution addressing this out-of-control Federal spending. The resolution requested that the Congress pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and send it to the States for ratifica-tion. This is the resolution I have in my hand that was sent to me by the State representatives and the senators in my district that I represent. By over-whelming votes in both houses, the house and the senate, the Texas legis-lature passed this resolution that I'm holding right here in my hand. The Texas House of Representatives ap-proved this bill by a vote of 115-17 on April 13, and the Senate adopted the bill on May 19 by a vote of 28-3. This resolution calls on Congress to enact the best measure to stop run-away Federal spending. We can best en-sure our future prosperity by passing a balanced budget amendment. I would like to personally thank the members of the Texas legislature that represent parts of my district, the 24th District of Texas. I applaud them for sending this resolution urging us to take ac-tion. My sincere thanks go to State Senator Jane Nelson, State Senator Chris Harris and State Senator John Carona, and to State representatives Vicki Truitt, Burt Solomons, Linda Harper-Brown, and Todd Smith. These brave men and women have taken a courageous stand on this issue, and I feel it's my obligation to follow through with their request. The Federal Government must end sustained deficit spending. In fiscal year 2010, the Federal Government ac-cumulated a deficit in excess of $1.3 trillion, an annual deficit that exceeds the entire gross State product of Texas. In order to finance our current deficit, we borrow 40 cents of every dol-lar we spend\u201440 cents on the dollar\u2014 money that could easily go to pay our national debt down. The longer we wait only results in more debt, debt that we will pass along to our children and to our grand-children. Our national debt currently stands at $14.7 trillion, which equals a debt per taxpayer of $131,288. This is a problem we can no longer ignore. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Texas legislature's re-quest for prompt passage of a balanced budget amendment. THESTATE OF TEXAS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 18 Whereas, the gravity of federal debt and federal obligations was established early in American history, with deficit occurring only in relation to extraordinary cir-cumstances, such as war; yet for much of the 20th century and into the 21st, the United States has operated on a budget deficit, in-cluding the 2010 budget year, which sur-passed an astounding $1.3 trillion, an annual deficit that exceeded the entire gross state product of Texas; and Whereas, the federal debt is greater than $14 trillion, a sum that if shared equally by each person in America would be a burden of over $45,000 per person, and yet the federal government continues to accrue debt; and Whereas, the higher the deficit, the more the government must spend on paying inter-est on the debt; compounding the problem is the use of deficit spending, which becomes a responsibility for future generations of Americans to assume without their consent; and Whereas, Congress has attempted to set budgetary restraints for itself in the form of a balanced budget amendment; the proposal won wide support in 1995, failing by only one vote in the senate; and Whereas, many states have previously re- quested that Congress propose a constitu-tional amendment requiring a balanced budget, but Congress has proven to be unre-sponsive; and Whereas, this growing burden of public debt is a threat to the nation's economic health, and action must be taken to restore fiscal responsibility; a balanced budget amendment would require the government not to spend more than it receives in reve-nues and compel lawmakers to carefully con-sider choices about spending and taxes; by encouraging spending control and discour-aging deficit spending, a balanced budget amendment will help put the nation on the path to lasting prosperity; Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the 82nd Legislature of the State of Texas hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to propose and submit to the states for ratification an amendment to the United States Constitu-tion providing that except during a war de-clared by the Congress of the United States pursuant to Article I, Section 8, Clause 11, United States Constitution, or other na-tional emergency, the total of all federal ap-propriations for a fiscal year may not exceed the total of all estimated federal revenue for that fiscal year and providing for a spending limitation; and, be it further Resolved, That the Texas Secretary of State forward official copies of this resolu-tion to the president of the United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives and the president of the senate of the United States Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to the congress with the request that this resolution be officially entered in the Congressional Record as a me-morial to the Congress of the United States of America. UNDERAGE DRINKING AND FTC WE DON'T SERVE TEENS INITIA-TIVE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. D AVIS) for 5 minutes. Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the topic of under-age drinking. It is an issue that chal-lenges every generation of public offi-cials, parents, educators, law enforce-ment, industry members, and con-cerned citizens. But through bipartisan leadership and almost three decades of public and private effort, our Nation has made some substantial progress. I mention ''bipartisan'' because it was President Reagan who teamed up with Democrats in Congress to enact the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. b1050 At the signing ceremony, the Presi- dent's remarks are a great lesson in federalism and national leadership that remains very important today. He said that underage drinking is a problem that is ''bigger than the individual States.'' He called underage drinking a ''grave national problem'' that ''touch-es all our lives.'' President Reagan con-cluded, ''With the problem so clearcut and the proven solution at hand, we have no misgiving about this judicious use of Federal power.'' I said that this was a bipartisan ef- fort. Our colleague from the other body, Senator L AUTENBERG from New Jersey, was instrumental in guiding the measure through Congress, and he continues to be a forceful advocate for young people today. According to the National Highway Safety Administration, the number of fatalities in teen drunk driving crashes has declined 74 percent since the early 1980s. Studies from the Department of Transportation and Government Ac-countability Office indicate that the 21-year-old drinking age has saved tens of thousands of lives. Most government measures of underage drinking have also declined. Parents, educators, and other adults who have influence on young people need to recognize that older teens are still capable of making youthful mis-takes, and some of these mistakes can be fatal. We should not do anything that allows our young people to obtain alcohol before they reach the legal drinking age. We need to remain in-volved in their lives and do everything we can to encourage and insist that they make responsible decisions. Back in 2006, our colleague L UCILLE ROYBAL -ALLARD led the effort to enact the Sober Truth on Preventing Under-age Drinking Act, better known as the STOP Act. The law established a framework for cooperation among Fed-eral agencies with responsibility to ad-dress underage drinking. In mid-July, we received a report from the Federal Interagency Coordinating Committee that was formally established by the STOP Act. It documents Federal Gov-ernment prevention initiatives across VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep \u2014 HOUSE H6147 September 14, 2011 17 agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, which created the We Don't Serve Teens program as a public education and outreach initia-tive. The 2011 launch of We Don't Serve Teens occurred last week in Chicago and throughout the Nation. One pur-pose of the We Don't Serve Teens ini-tiative is to inform parents and all adults that teen drinking is not inevi-table. Crown Imports and MillerCoors, the number two and number three American beer suppliers, are both headquartered in the district I rep-resent in Chicago. Both companies have supported the We Don't Serve Teens program since it began in 2006. I am pleased that these two compa- nies have joined the FTC, Members of Congress, Chicago officials, and thou-sands of concerned citizens to support We Don't Serve Teens. We need every-one at the table. Industry members have a unique ability to reach out di-rectly to local stores, bars, res-taurants, and other places where alco-hol is served. The We Don't Serve Teens message is reinforced. I commend these efforts. I especially commend the distributors of these alcoholic beverages in their ef-fort to make sure that teens handle al-cohol responsibly. The best way is to not drink at all. f POVERTY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L EE) for 5 minutes. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the founding member and a cochair of the Congressional Out of Poverty Cau-cus. The 42 members of the caucus work every day to ensure that we meet our economic and, yes, our moral obli-gation to the most vulnerable across this Nation\u2014those people facing or liv-ing in poverty. Yesterday, the United States Census Bureau released data showing that 2.6 million more Americans fell into pov-erty, making it 46.2 million people liv-ing in poverty in America. This is the highest number since the Census Bu-reau started keeping these records in 1959. Fifteen percent of Americans lived in poverty last year. The poverty rate among African Americans in 2010 was 27.4 percent; for nonwhite His-panics it was 26.6 percent; for Asian Pa-cific Islanders it was 12.1 percent; and for non-Hispanic whites it was 9.9 per-cent. Digging deeper into the disparities, the data reveals that the real median income declined for white and black households between 2009 and 2010. Real median income for each race and His-panic-origin groups have not recovered to the pre-2001 recession all-time highs. According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, the Census data reveals that both the number and per-centages of people living in deep pov-erty hit record highs, meaning that some 20.5 million Americans had cash incomes below $11,000 for a family of four. In addition, the Census reports that the median household income fell 2.3 percent, or $1,100, in 2010. Those at the bottom of the income scale have lost far more ground than those at the top. Income inequality continues to grow at alarming rates. We know that this crisis is even worse in communities of color. The national average of children liv- ing in poverty in America is 20 percent. That's outrageous. For African Amer- ican children, it's 36 percent; for Latino children, it's 31 percent. That's hard to believe. The median net worth of white families in 2009 was 20 times greater than that of the average black family, and 18 times greater than the average Hispanic family. These are not just statistics. These are real human beings who deserve an opportunity to live the American Dream, which to our dismay, unfortu-nately, has turned into a nightmare for millions. So the Out of Poverty Caucus cochairs, Congressmen B ACA, BUTTERFIELD , C ONYERS , H ONDA , and myself, sent a letter to the President asking him to address our Nation's job crisis, which is a national emergency, through a bold package of direct in-vestment which is aimed at our Na-tion's most vulnerable\u2014those facing or living in poverty. We asked that he consider including programs like the TANF Emergency Contingency Fund, which gets money out of the door across the country efficiently and ef-fectively, and it puts people to work. We asked for job training at commu-nities affected by the Great Recession, which of course is the depression for these communities, and we asked for programs that will help train and put our Nation's young people to work. We are pleased and thankful that in the President's jobs bill he did embrace some of our suggestions, including building on programs like the TANF Emergency Contingency Fund and on the job training, youth employment, extension initiatives, and extending unemployment compensation, but we also still believe that unemployment compensation must be extended to those who have exhausted their bene-fits after 99 weeks until we create these jobs, because there are four individuals looking for one job. After 99 weeks, these individuals are no longer eligible for unemployment compensation. So we're asking that H.R. 589 be consid-ered, which is a bill by Congressman B OBBY SCOTT and myself, to extend this unemployment compensation by 14 weeks. That's the least we can do. Make no mistake about it, people are suffering. Children don't have enough to eat. People want and need jobs, as we saw during the Congressional Black Caucus' very important and successful jobs tour and the Congressional Pro-gressive Caucus' Speak Out for Jobs Now tour. People want our economy to grow, but they know that they need a job to do this. Our country needs full employment for people to turn the economy around. More and more people are falling into poverty than ever before\u2014from all walks of life and educational back-grounds. The Out of Poverty Caucus will con- tinue to sound the alarm about the growing crisis of people living in or facing poverty. I want to remind every-one that many middle-income people are on the verge of falling into poverty. As we say, many are one paycheck away from poverty. It is critical that America returns to the land of oppor-tunity for all. f b1100 STOP MILITARY RAPE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. S PEIER ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as I have done virtually every week, to tell a story of a man or a woman in the military who has been raped. Nineteen thousand are raped every year in the military. Only 13 per-cent report the rapes because there has been such an ineffective addressing of this issue. So today, I rise again to tell another story. I hear from victims who have been sharing their stories with me by emailing me at stopmilitaryrape@mail.house.gov. It is time for us to act. We have known of this problem for over 16 years. We have had 18 hearings and reports on this issue, and yet nothing changes. So today I'm going to tell you about Darchelle Mitchell, an airman. And she writes: ''I never thought that I would be a victim of such a horrible and trau-matic event, nor did I believe that it would occur under the blanket of free-dom I swore to fight for. I decided to serve my country as an example for my two boys and to do my share to better my Nation. ''In my first year, I began to accept the unwanted comments of my shape, size and looks as though it was part of something to deal with when working and living with men on a ship. It esca-lated to the uncomfortable motions by a superior trying to pull me into a two- manned rack that was in the office. I reported the incident to my immediate supervisors requesting that they speak with him, and the responses were al-ways that the superior meant no harm and that he was just being playful. This led to my superior grabbing me by the top of my head and pushing it into his genital area, stating, ''I bet I can make you say 'oh, God.''' ''After the reporting of this incident, I suffered the backlash of being black-balled. My job assignments became very difficult, and I bounced around from command to command until someone was willing to take the chance to allow me to perform as an airman trying to advance. ''I worked very hard to remove the negative light that was cast upon me. I went on to advance to a dual-qualified VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep \u2014 HOUSE H6148 September 14, 2011 second class petty officer in less than 3 years. Despite my efforts of advancing and volunteer services, the stigma re-mained with me. ''I decided to take orders to Italy and move my family to another country in an attempt to step away from the neg-ative light. Within the first 3 months of my tour in Italy, I was raped by an-other servicemember. I did everything in accordance to the training provided by the military. I reported the incident to NCIS and suffered through a rape kit. My children were present and had to experience something that no parent could ever dream of allowing their chil-dren to go through. ''With his DNA found in my rape kit, his fingerprints found throughout my room, and ripped clothing, the service-member was found not guilty. The ex-planation given to me was, 'It is no question that his genitals touched your genitals, but it is reasonable to believe that he thought he had your consent.' From that, I was expected to return to work as if tomorrow was just another day. My superiors continued to treat me as if I brought shame to their com-mand. The trauma was so over-whelming that I attempted to take my life on two occasions. ''Despite the constant reminder that the military is a man military, I grad-uated with my master's in business ad-ministration, volunteered at numerous organizations, and regained some con-fidence in my safety around people. This was not supposed to be the in-tended meaning of the sacrifices that veterans go through to serve their country. ''I pray that my experiences are not completely in vain and that one day no one will ever have to suffer what my family and I are still suffering.'' For Darchelle and every other serv- icemember, we must take steps to pre-vent this crime from happening and punish the perpetrators when it does. We should not be a country in which it is more likely to be taken into some-one's room to be violated, to have vio-lence committed against you by an-other member of the service, more likely than by the enemy. f RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 11 o'clock and 4 min- utes a.m.), the House stood in recess until noon. f b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. f PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Loving and gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Bless the Members of this assembly as they set upon the work of these hours, of these days. Help them to make wise decisions in a good manner and to carry their responsibilities steadily with high hopes for a better future for our great Nation. Deepen their faith, widen their sym- pathies, heighten their aspirations, and give them the strength to do what ought to be done for this country. Give them the wisdom and perseverance to work together constructively to ad-dress the pressing issues facing our Na-tion. May Your blessing, O God, be with them and with us all this day and every day to come, and may all we do be done for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. f THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has exam- ined the Journal of the last day's pro-ceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour- nal stands approved. f PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentle- woman from Massachusetts (Ms. T SON- GAS) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Ms. TSONGAS led the Pledge of Alle- giance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter- tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute speeches from each side of the aisle. f FREE STUFF (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Ron and Cynthia Barrs from Texas sent me this email: ''The folks who are getting the free stuff don't like the folks who are pay-ing for the free stuff because the folks who are paying for the free stuff can no longer afford to pay both for the free stuff and their own stuff. And the folks who are getting the free stuff want even more free stuff on top of the free stuff that they're already getting. So now the ones who are forcing the peo-ple to pay for the free stuff have told the people who are receiving that free stuff that the people who are paying for the free stuff are mean and greedy. So the people who are getting the free stuff have been convinced they need to despise the people who are paying for the free stuff. And they are promised more free stuff if they vote for the ones who force others to pay for the free stuff.'' Mr. Speaker, there's just not enough stuff for free. And that's just the way it is. f AMERICAN JOBS ACT (Mr. BACA asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, last week President Obama laid out a plan of action to create new jobs and strengthen our economy. Now the American Jobs Act has been sent to Congress, and it is up to us to catch the ball and run it into the end zone. The American people are suffering. They are in pain. They are hurting. They need and deserve our help now, not tomorrow. They don't need more excuses. The American Jobs Act contains tax incentives, Federal incentives that will give our economy an immediate boost. Ninety-eight percent of businesses will have payroll tax cut in half. The new tax credit will encourage businesses to hire returning veterans, and 280,000 teachers will be saved from being laid off. New investments will help build our roads, our bridges, our airports and rail systems, and not the bridges to no-where. Let's invest in the American people and work together to build our econ-omy. This is not about allowing Presi-dent Obama a win. This is about the American people, people who need jobs now, and building our economy. Let's work together. Let's help the American people who are suffering. f A JOBS PLAN THAT WORKS (Mr. FLEMING asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FLEMING. Madam Speaker, in- stead of President Obama's no-jobs plan, which is just more of the same, I'd like to give my 2 cents worth on what it takes to create jobs right here in America. Why? Because I know what it's like to take a risk and open a busi-ness, to hire someone and make a pay-roll. Putting a moratorium on all new reg- ulations would be a good start. Repeal-ing the job-killing ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank financial reform laws\u2014 which are actually no reform at all and are already decimating our economy\u2014 and putting forth a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. If President Obama adopted these ap-proaches, immediately capital would start flowing, which would then create jobs. What we can no longer afford are the current, Big Government, socialist policies that will only put us further into debt and hurt job creation. I have created hundreds of jobs in my district in Louisiana. How many jobs has the President created in his 2 12 VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, HOUSE H6149 September 14, 2011 years? I would say net negative on that. f THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE (Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, on January 21, 1990, over 300,000 Ukrain-ians joined hands to create a 300-mile human chain from Kiev to Lviv in a show of unity and support for Ukrain-ian independence. One year later, on August 24, 1991, Ukraine rose from under its Soviet yoke and declared its independence. I stand here today to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Ukraine's inde-pendence and to commend them on their many democratic achievements over the last two decades. Yet as we celebrate Ukraine's severing of its So-viet chains, we must be aware of new restraints, for new shackles in the form of press crackdowns and opposition in-timidation threaten to re-enchain Ukrainians and reverse their many hard-fought freedoms. I have faith in the spirit of the Ukrainian people and hope they will join hands again, as they did 20 years ago, and continue to stand strong for freedom and democracy, knowing America will always be standing beside them. As they say in Ukraine: Together we are many. We cannot be defeated. f HONORING CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER DAVID R. CARTER (Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado. Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor a soldier who made the ultimate sacrifice and laid down his life for our freedom: U.S. Army Warrant Officer 4 David R. Car-ter. Chief Warrant Officer Carter dedi- cated himself to over 24 years of mili-tary service. As a member of the Colo-rado Army National Guard, he de-ployed to Afghanistan this summer. On August 6, 2011, he was piloting a CH-47 helicopter on a mission to reinforce a unit under attack in Wardak province. On that tragic day, he was one of 30 Americans who lost their lives when their helicopter was brought down by enemy fire. David Carter was regarded as one of the most highly trained aviators in Colorado, with multiple combat de-ployments and over 4,000 flight hours. He is also remembered for the tremen-dous impact he had on his family, friends, and community. Friends recall that he was never too busy to help out with a problem. Chief Warrant Officer David Carter personified the honor and selflessness of service as a citizen soldier. His brav-ery and dedication to duty will not be forgotten. As a Marine Corps combat veteran, my deepest sympathies go out to his family, fellow soldiers, and all who knew him. f b1210 WORK TOGETHER TO PASS AMERICAN JOBS ACT (Ms. HAHN asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. HAHN. Madam Speaker, the American people have waited too long for this Congress to put the focus where it belongs\u2014on creating jobs and getting the Nation back to work. Now we must boldly make up for lost time. We need a plan as serious as the chal-lenges we face. The American Jobs Act is that plan. We will harness the industry and en- ergy of the American people. We will give small businesses, the backbone of our economy, the incentives and assist-ance that they need to hire and to grow. We will put people to work build-ing a transportation infrastructure worthy of the 21st century. We will stop teachers from being laid off and help end the outrage of our crumbling schools. The American Jobs Act is good news for veterans, construction workers, teachers, firefighters, the long-term unemployed, and good news for all Americans who can look forward to a stronger economy and a more competi-tive Nation. Let's work together to pass this bill and get the American people the help they need and the sup-port they deserve. f TIME TO GET AMERICA WORKING AGAIN (Mr. BUCHANAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, there are 14 million Americans out of work. We have a record 30 straight months of unemployment at 8 percent or above\u2014the longest stretch since the Great Depression. That's simply unac-ceptable. The President and the Con-gress must work together to grow the economy and create jobs. As a busi-nessman for over 30 years, I have seen firsthand that the government does not create jobs. The private sector does. Small business does. My jobs plan would expand overseas markets for U.S. goods and services, lower taxes on business, eliminate friv-olous lawsuits, and abolish unneces-sary regulation. We need to get our fi-nancial house back in order and move towards a constitutional balanced budget amendment. It's time we work together to get America back to work. f INVESTING IN CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES (Ms. TSONGAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Speaker, we need to put people back to work, and it is past time that this issue is finally getting the national attention nec-essary to get something done. As we work to finally enact a jobs plan, we should be investing not only in our workforce, but also in our future com-petitiveness, which is why we should invest in the next revolution\u2014clean en-ergy technologies. We export billions of dollars each year to import the energy that powers our country. If we can har-ness the power of clean, renewable en-ergy, we will not only create high-pay-ing jobs but we can begin to address the real threat of climate change as well. By investing in clean energy tech- nologies, such as wind and solar, we can begin to replace many of the manu-facturing, construction, and high-tech jobs lost during the recession. We should take advantage of this unique opportunity to immediately create good jobs here in America while safe-guarding the future of our children and grandchildren at the same time. f PRESIDENT'S SCORECARD ON JOBS (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, the Nation's unem-ployment rate is a gruesome 9.1 per-cent. This marks the largest period of high unemployment since the Great Depression. More than 14 million Americans are unemployed. More than 25 million Americans who want a full- time job don't have one. In today's Po-litico, Josh Boak reported that ''Long- Term Jobless at 50-year Record.'' The State's front page revealed the Na-tion's poor have swelled to a sad record of 46.2 million people. The Democrat chairwoman says the President ''owns'' the economy. The President's policies are sadly failing. He's on the wrong track, as evi-denced in New York. He needs to change course with a bipartisan tax cut in the tradition of Presidents Kennedy and Reagan. The President's proposal for a second half-trillion dollar stim-ulus is a repeat of failure. Out-of-con-trol borrowing and spending and the failed stimulus have aggravated unem-ployment. Tax increases destroy jobs. House Republicans will continue to lead bipartisan efforts of creating an environment for job creation that pro-motes small businesses. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. f PASS THE AMERICAN JOBS ACT (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, H6150 September 14, 2011 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak- er, despite the fact that we face per-sistent unemployment and slow eco-nomic growth, Republicans would rath-er waste time with debt ceiling dis-approval resolutions and risk default again than come up with real answers to our most pressing problems. Demo-crats want to pass the American Jobs Act right now to get people back to work. We want to offer payroll tax breaks to small businesses that create jobs, not continue corporate welfare to major oil companies. We want to create infrastructure banks to repair and re-build our communities, not delay these highway projects to score political points. Monday, in Politico, a senior Repub- lican aide was quoted as saying he ''didn't want to hand Obama a win'' on jobs legislation. It's clear that Repub-licans care more about beating the President than beating unemployment. The jobless of this country cannot wait another 14 months. Pass the American Jobs Act today. f COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS FOR JOBS (Mr. FLORES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, our country is facing record deficits, high unemployment, and stagnant economic growth. Yet President Obama is dou-bling down on the triple threat of tax-ation, regulation, and spending that is crushing job growth. This week, the President has been touting his so- called ''jobs plan.'' But his detrimental policies have forced a power generation company in Texas to close five facili-ties and sacrifice 500 middle class jobs. The impact of this EPA shutdown will reduce generating capacity in Texas by 1,300 megawatts, a move which the Electric Reliability Council of Texas says could spur future power outages. These regulations hurt middle class jobs and harm electric reliability in Texas with no scientific evidence that power generation in Texas is causing nonattainment of clear air standards in other States. Not only are this admin-istration's disastrous policies pre-venting future job creation; they're de-stroying existing jobs. Instead of pro-posing the same failed idea that Wash-ington can create jobs, we need to get Washington out of the way and rely on commonsense Main Street solutions that put Americans back to work. f NASA ANNOUNCEMENT ON SLS (Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, this morning, NASA announced the design of a new space launch system which will be the basis for future exploration beyond low Earth orbit. It is a critical step, but one among many we need to take. Although I am pleased this deci-sion was made, it is long overdue since it was mandated by the NASA author-ization bill passed in the last Congress. This announcement combines existing technologies while enabling new ones, all the while attempting to maintain the most skilled and dedicated work-force in existence in human space flight. NASA's plan still lacks the des-tination focus I would like to see, and we must be diligent in keeping costs manageable, especially in these dif-ficult economic times. But the invest-ment in our Nation's space program en-ables men and women like those at the Stennis Space Center to do what they do best\u2014test rocket engines for space flight. America is the leader in human space flight. Today's decision helps continue that leadership role. f b1220 DISASTER RELIEF SUPPLEMENTAL (Mr. SIRES asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, 2 weeks ago, Hurricane Irene ravaged the east coast, including the State of New Jer-sey. Earlier this year, tornados leveled parts of the Midwest, and now Texas is experiencing one of the worst wildfires in its history. Furthermore, on the heels of Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee hit New Jersey, causing more damage and forcing more people from their homes. Homes have been de-stroyed, businesses are suffering, and many areas are still covered in water. While many major disaster declara- tions have been made, the availability of Federal assistance remains uncer-tain. Today, I rise to ask my colleagues to work in a bipartisan manner to im-mediately pass emergency disaster re-lief legislation to support recovery ef-forts. Communities across the country have witnessed unthinkable destruc-tion and endured great loss, and it is the Federal Government's responsi-bility to replenish the Disaster Relief Fund to ensure that these communities receive help in their time of need. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting supplemental disaster re-lief. We must come together now to provide disaster assistance to these devastated areas. f PRESIDENT OBAMA'S JOBS BILL (Mr. SOUTHERLAND asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SOUTHERLAND. Madam Speak- er, I rise today with great disappoint-ment in the President's most recent proposed bill to create jobs. I was hope-ful that the President would offer a commonsense, pro-growth agenda. Un-fortunately, the House continues to stand ready without a proposal that is acceptable. But this administration continues to offer the same tired, Big Government proposals. One example is the section that creates, in 17 pages, a wholly gov-ernment-owned corporation\u2014that's right, government-owned corporation\u2014 complete with a chief financial officer, chief risk officer, chief compliance offi-cer, chief operations officer, chief lend-ing officer, general counsel, board of directors, and billions of dollars in new taxpayer money. It appears once again that this ad- ministration is more focused on grow-ing government than it is on growing jobs. f AMERICAN JOBS ACT (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker and Members, jobs are the issue, and the American Jobs Act is the solution that this House should con-sider on the floor immediately. This bill will help reverse the flow of jobs overseas and will help rebuild the man-ufacturing base in America, providing good jobs for hardworking Americans. Make It In America creates jobs in America. This bill builds America. The long-term FAA reauthorization will create 150,000 jobs, and reauthorizing the surface transportation bill will sup-port 134,000 projects around the coun-try, 5,000 mass transit projects, and nearly 1 million jobs over the next year. The national infrastructure bank proposal would combine public and pri-vate resources to build, rebuild, and re-pair the country's key infrastructure. This bill also helps create jobs through the Tax Code. The proposal cuts the payroll tax in half for 98 per-cent of businesses on their first $5 mil-lion in payroll; it offers a $4,000 tax credit to employers for hiring long- term unemployed workers\u2014get them on the tax rolls and not on the unem-ployment rolls\u2014and it starts a ''Re-turning Heroes'' hiring tax credit, be-tween $5,600 and $9,600 for firms that hire unemployed veterans. We have the responsibility to help our country climb out of this tough economy, and this bill is a proposal that deserves bipartisan support to help accomplish that. f REGULATIONS DON'T CREATE JOBS (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. YODER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to join the chorus of Americans asking Washington to stop damaging the economy with job-killing regula-tions. Small businesses don't thrive when they're hit with additional bur-dens from the Federal Government. As unbelievable as it sounds, some in this body actually believe that new regulations create jobs because they force businesses to hire people to com-ply with the new mandates. Madam VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6151 September 14, 2011 Speaker, this defies common sense. And that's why I am introducing two bills: one which would pause all new regulations for a year so that busi-nesses would know the rules they are to live under, and another that would require Federal regulators to analyze the impact of their new rules on jobs and to find the least costly alternative for each new business mandate. Madam Speaker, let's come together and agree that regulations don't create jobs. And let's pass commonsense legis-lation to get America working again. f THE URGENT NEED FOR JOB CREATION IN AMERICA (Mr. M CNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. M CNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the urgent need to create jobs in America. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, and finding a job now is as hard as it has been in generations. Our country needs decisive action, and we need it now. Earlier this week, the President sub- mitted the American Jobs Act to Con-gress, and I ask my colleagues in both parties to put partisanship aside and work together to create jobs our coun-try desperately needs. Many of the pro-posals included in the American Jobs Act enjoy bipartisan support, and I call on Speaker B OEHNER and Leader C AN- TORto work together in good faith to bring forward good jobs proposals from both parties to Congress. We won't have an economic recovery without putting people back to work. f AMERICAN JOBS ACT (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, too many people in America are out of work, and as the President said in his speech last week, too many people are living day to day, paycheck to pay-check, struggling to find work. That is why we need to pass the American Jobs Act now. A consequence of such high unem- ployment is poverty. Yesterday, the Census Bureau reported that our coun-try's poverty rate last year was an as-tonishing 15.1 percent, the highest it has been in almost two decades. With 22 percent of our children living in pov-erty, this report makes clear who has borne the brunt of our country's eco-nomic woes. I believe that all of my colleagues share a strong love of this Nation and its children, but in order for them to succeed, we must ensure that they have access to health care, housing, modern classrooms, and qualified teachers. We must also put their par-ents on a path back to work. Madam Speaker, it is a travesty to have even one child living in poverty in this country, let alone one in five of our children. It is also unconscionable to allow our actions, or inactions, to affect their future prosperity. Let's work together in a bipartisan way now to pass the American Jobs Act today. f HOUSE RESOLUTION 352 (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of Cali- fornia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of Cali- fornia. Madam Speaker, 53 years ago, China declared ownership of the islands in the Eastern Sea, which include the Spratly and the Paracel Islands. On September 14, 1958, then-Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of North Vietnam issued a diplomatic note af-firming the declaration from China re-garding the Chinese ownership of those islands. When this decision became known, Vietnamese students and bloggers organized unprecedented pro-tests in Hanoi and in Saigon against China's violations of Vietnam's sov-ereignty in the Eastern Sea. The Viet-namese security police were ordered to end the public demonstrations regard-ing the issue of the Spratly and Paracel Islands and detained over 40 activists who were involved in this pro-test. Since early August of this year, at least 13 young patriots have been ar-rested by police and the Ministry of Public Security in Vietnam, and sev-eral of these activists are prominent bloggers, such as the Vinh Diocese of the Congregation of the Most Holy Re-deemer, for this same issue. As a cosponsor of House Resolution 352, I call for a framework in accord-ance with the United States Conven-tion on the Law of the Sea for a peace-ful resolution to this conflict. Furthermore, I urge the Vietnamese Government to unconditionally release all advocates who were exercising their rights as citizens to call for social jus-tice and protesting the sovereignty of Vietnamese territories from China. f AMERICAN JOBS ACT (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, as I traveled throughout my district these last few weeks, one issue dominated all conversations\u2014jobs. As my colleagues on the other side created the default crisis this summer, the American people threw up their hands in disgust and dismay, and I don't blame them. Our constituents know the number one issue facing this country is jobs, and they know this Congress must take concrete actions to grow our economy, and it must take them now. The good news is we have a plan. The American Jobs Act is a commonsense, bipartisan plan to put Americans back to work and strengthen our economy. It keeps teachers in the classrooms and cops and firefighters on our streets. It rebuilds our crumbling roads and bridges, modernizes our schools, and rehabilitates our neighborhoods. It cuts taxes for small businesses, work-ers and their families. The time for political games\u2014which are costing jobs and creating economic uncertainty\u2014has passed. I urge the House leadership, help us pass the American Jobs Act, and let's pass it now. f b1230 AMERICANS LIVING IN POVERTY (Mr. MORAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MORAN. Madam Speaker, today we learned that 46 million Americans are living in poverty. More people are suffering economically than at any time since the Great Depression. But we learned from an excellent article by Scott Lilly of the Center for American Progress that history may be repeating itself. In 1937, conservative Republicans succeeded in virtually eliminating the Federal jobs programs of the New Deal, so as to eliminate the Federal deficit. But the results were catastrophic to America's economy and society. Half of the 8 million jobs that had been cre-ated by the New Deal were lost, and un-employment went over 19 percent. Economists generally classified the economic reversal in 1937 and 1938 as a second depression. Not until military spending began to revive activity in 1940 did unemployment again drop to less than 15 percent. That was a long and painful experi- ence. It would be tragic if we permitted the new conservative crowd in Wash-ington to repeat it by killing President Obama's jobs act and sending us back into a double-dip recession. Those who don't learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. f JOBS IN AMERICA (Mr. OWENS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the all-important issue of jobs in America. As I travel around my district, I fre- quently hear discussions about jobs. But more importantly, I hear discus-sions about jobs that have gone un-filled. In my district alone, that is 2,600 jobs. In America it is 3.2 million jobs that are ready to be filled today. We must come together, as Members of Congress, to provide assistance that helps us train people, relocate them, or do whatever is necessary to bring peo-ple to jobs; 3.2 million people back to work, that's significant. I hope that my colleagues in Congress will work with me to put 3.2 million Americans back to work. VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6152 September 14, 2011 This is not a situation where there are not jobs. This is a situation where there are unfilled jobs. f INVEST IN DETROIT (Mr. CLARKE of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CLARKE of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I offer this Congress and this country a simple, yet powerful, way to create new, good-paying manufacturing jobs in the United States, and that's by investing in Detroit, by allowing the tax dollars that Detroiters pay to be invested back in Detroit; invested to help make the streets of Detroit safer, to help improve Detroit schools, to help train Detroiters for jobs, to help rebuild our city. You see, this type of investment will definitely create jobs in Detroit. But more importantly, Detroit's manufac-turing know-how, our trained work-force, investing in Detroit will help put Americans back to work. So by helping put Detroiters back to work, you're going to help put this country back to work. f ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. EMERSON ). Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair will postpone further proceedings today on the motion to suspend the rules on which a recorded vote or the yeas and nays are ordered, or on which the vote incurs objection under clause 6 of rule XX. Any record vote on the postponed question will be taken tomorrow. f UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REFORM AND REAU-THORIZATION ACT OF 2011 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. S MITH) and the gen- tleman from California (Mr. B ERMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. GENERAL LEAVE Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their re-marks and to include extraneous mate-rial on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, first of all, let me thank I LEANA ROS-LEHTINEN , the chair- woman of our committee, and H OWARD BERMAN for their fine work in helping to bring this very important legisla-tion to the floor today. I want to thank especially Congress- man F RANK WOLF, the author of this legislation, who is also the author of the original International Religious Freedom Act that was passed back in 1998, against considerable odds, opposi-tion from the Clinton administration, for example, opposition from a number of people on both sides of the aisle. But at the end of the day, that legislation, historic, was signed into law and was signed by President Clinton. So he came around and actually put his sig-nature on that historic legislation. So I again want to thank Mr. W OLF for his famous leadership. He has been a leader on human rights and on reli-gious freedom in particular for more than 30 years. And that culminated, at least on the religious freedom side, with the enactment of the Inter-national Religious Freedom Act. Madam Speaker, religious freedom, the right to worship and practice one's faith according to the dictates of one's own conscience, is a foundational human right. Not only is it an essen-tial element in our Constitution; it is intrinsic to the human dignity of every man and woman on this Earth and was enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights. But it is a right denied or curtailed for millions, really billions, according to some estimates, even a majority of the people living in the world. For Copts in Egypt, for Christians, Bud-dhists, and Uighurs in China, Montagnards, Evangelical Christians in Central Vietnam, Jews in Baha'i in Iran, many Buddhist monks in Burma and, of course, this rising pernicious tide of anti-Semitism, not just in the Middle East but in many parts of Eu-rope, and even in the United States, the ability to live their faith without threat of persecution is a distant and unrealized promise. I was pleased to work with Mr. W OLF years ago, as I mentioned, on this leg-islation. And I actually chaired the hearings on the legislation. And again, there was considerable opposition that was turned around, and at the end of the day this legislation did become law. The U.S. Commission on Inter- national Religious Freedom was an im-portant part of this effort. It was cre-ated as an independent body of experts to review the facts and make policy recommendations from a vantage point outside of our diplomatic corps, where bilateral and other concerns had some-times resulted in the soft-pedaling of severe ongoing violations of religious freedom around the world. Even today, when the quality of State Department reporting on reli-gious issues, while it's improved, the commission continues to serve as a critical role and a sounding board and a catalyst. One indicator is the fact that the commission's list of rec-ommended, what is called ''countries of particular concern'' for severe viola-tions of religious freedom, remains larger than the number actually des-ignated by the State Department. They ought to be the same, but they are not. Just yesterday, Secretary Clinton rightfully designated the People's Re-public of China, Burma, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Uzbekistan as countries of particular concern. But the State Department's list does not add any new countries from last year, and one of the most glaring omissions of all is Vietnam, whose policies have more than earned that badge of shame. Secretary Clinton did not designate Egypt either, or Iraq, Nigeria, Turkmenistan and Pakistan, as rec-ommended by the commission. So, un-fortunately, their recommendations went unheeded. But it does provide an important backdrop and framework to review and to look at what it is that the State Department is doing. We need, Madam Speaker, this com- mission more than ever. Already in the Congress, we have had three com-prehensive hearings on religious free-dom: one in the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission in January regard-ing the religious freedom of minorities in the Middle East; one in the com-mittee that I chair, the Africa Global Health global Human Rights Com-mittee, regarding the prioritization of religious freedom in U.S. foreign pol-icy; and one just last month in the Hel-sinki Commission on the particular plight of Coptic Christians in Egypt. That hearing brought to light an egre-gious policy that is acted out in Egypt each and every day, where young Cop-tic Christians girls, some as young as 14 and 15, are kidnapped. They are forced into Islam, and then they are, at age 18 or thereafter, given in marriage forcibly to an Islamic man. b1240 That is an outrage against women's rights, human rights, and religious freedom as well. The Commission has been an invalu- able resource to Congress as we mon-itor the protection and promotion of religious freedom around the world and the response of the administration on this very important issue. They have also a resource to governments seeking to remedy religious freedom abuses within their own borders. For instance, in Indonesia, the Commission worked with members of the Indonesian House of Representatives and civil society groups and introduced measures to strengthen provisions in the criminal code regarding attacks on religious gatherings and amend the law gov-erning the building of religious venues. The Commission also continues to help network human rights and legal advocates in Indonesia and elsewhere around the world working to defend in-dividuals accused of blasphemy and re-ligious minorities facing intimidation and violence from extremist groups. The Commission's work in Indonesia will have practical impact on the exer-cise of human rights and the preserva-tion of peace in that country. Other governments have looked to the Commission as a model for their own religious freedom commissions. The bill before us today includes a number of bipartisan reforms to the Commission authorities and operations to make their work even more effec-tive. Again, I want to thank Ms. R OS- LEHTINEN , the chairwoman, and thank HOWARD BERMAN for their leadership in ensuring the bill came to the floor today and for their support for the bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2867, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Re-form and Reauthorization Act of 2011. I would like to thank the sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. W OLF), who has been a leader on this issue for, as my col-league Mr. S MITH pointed out, well over a decade on the question of inter-national religious freedom. We're fortunate to live in a country that was founded by religious refugees on principles of tolerance. We strive to adhere to article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that ''everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and re-ligion. This right includes freedom to VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6154 September 14, 2011 manifest his religion or belief in teach- ing, practice, worship, and observ-ance.'' But elsewhere around the globe, reli- gious freedom and human rights are routinely violated. Countless men, women, and children face violence, per-secution, and discrimination because of their faith. Violent extremist attacks have taken place in the Middle East and South Asia. The regimes in North Korea and Iran actively repress reli-gious freedom. Apostasy and blas-phemy laws have fueled discrimination against religious minorities in Afghan-istan, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. Other religious minorities like Ti- betan Buddhists, Uighur Muslims, Ahmadis, Baha'is, Assyrian Christians in Iraq, Copts in Egypt face violence and government restrictions. And anti- Semitism is still prevalent around the world. Just yesterday, Secretary Clinton designated Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Uzbekistan as countries of particular concern that have ''engaged in or tolerated particularly severe vio-lations of religious freedom.'' While these may be the worst offend- ers, we have serious concerns about re-ligious freedom in many other coun-tries around the world. More than ever, we need the U.S. Commission on Inter-national Religious Freedom to con-tinue its important work. The bipartisan bill before us today reauthorizes the Commission, also known as USCIRF, which is set to ex-pire at the end of the month. The bill also contains some sensible reforms that will strengthen USCIRF's efforts to monitor and report on the status of freedom of religion abroad. These re-forms include the process of selecting the chair, terms of service for members of the Commission, and a GAO study on improving the effectiveness and co-ordination of all U.S. Government bod-ies that focus on international reli-gious freedom. In particular, I would like to thank Mr. W OLFfor agreeing to include a pro- vision that clarifies that USCIRF is subject to the same workplace restric-tions and civil rights laws as the rest of the Federal Government. Congress has long provided that the Federal Government, including the ex-ecutive and legislative branches, is subject to laws intended to keep the American workplace safe and free from discrimination, including the Family and Medical Leave Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, OSHA, and workplace protections for veterans. However, under current law, it is un- clear whether USCIRF's employees could resolve disputes over workplace protections through the procedures de-signed for executive branch workers or under the procedures that apply to leg-islative branch employees through the Congressional Accountability Act. This legislation will ensure that all claims will now be resolved under the proce-dures created by the Congressional Ac- countability Act. USCIRF supports this clarifying position. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, it is a distinct privilege to yield such time as he may consume to the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, the au-thor of the original International Reli-gious Freedom Act, an historic piece of legislation and today's reauthoriza-tion, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. W OLF). Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, before I begin, I want to thank Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman R OS-LEHTINEN ; ranking member, Mr. B ERMAN ; the Human Rights Committee chairman, Mr. S MITH, who's been a champion on all of these issues from the very first day he got in here; and their staffs. The staffs have made all the difference in the world. I want to particularly thank the chairman's staff, Yleem Poblete and Doug Anderson, for their help, and also the leadership on both sides and my side, and the leadership staff who have really tried to work this and get this thing through. I'm going to say some things that hopefully are not too con-troversial, but I do want to thank them for getting this thing out and getting it moving because, if it didn't move today, it may very well come to an end. I rise in support of this critical legis- lation to reauthorize and reform the U.S. Commission on International Reli-gious Freedom. The sad truth, though, Madam Speaker, this bill has been held hostage by the other body\u2014and keep the word ''hostage'' out there as we think in terms of what this bill would do and what's taking place around the world. And if we do not pass this bill in this form today, the likelihood of this Commission shutting down is very, very high. I wish I could name\u2014I know the House rule\u2014and I would name the members over there if anyone asks me, but it's being held hostage. Some in the other body are now saying that even these are not the changes that they would like to see to the Commis-sion. And, quite frankly, I believe that some over there and this very adminis-tration would not mind seeing this Commission shut its doors. This was a bipartisan issue for years. Scoop Jackson, the leader, Jackson- Vanik, President Reagan. To my side, Reagan said the words in the Constitu-tion were a covenant to the entire world, not just to the people in Phila-delphia in 1787 but to the entire world. And yet religious freedom, often re-ferred to as the first freedom, is central to our American values and should be featured prominently in foreign policy. But, sadly, the constituency for human rights and religious freedom issues is growing smaller and smaller in Washington and in this Congress. These issues have become second-class citizens in this Congress and in this town. There are no big law firms down-town. They're representing the Saudis. They're representing the Chinese. They're representing filth and garbage in certain cases, but no one represents human rights and religious freedom. So there are all the Members who have agonized and pushed and pulled and want to kill this. I'm concerned be-cause as we stand here today and de-bate, and you've got to know this, Iraqi Christians are being killed. People who speak the same language as Jesus, the Aramaic language, and more biblical activity took place in Iraq than almost any other country other than Israel, they're being killed; and Iraqi women are being forced to do terrible things in order to keep their families. And there are some who don't want this bill to pass. They never talk about the Iraqi Christians. Yet many of them supported the Iraqi war and yet they say nothing. The Baha'is in Iran and Egypt are being marginalized, and I never hear a word said. Chinese Bishops. I can remember Congressman S MITH took Holy Com- munion from Bishop Su. Bishop Su was arrested and has never been seen since, maybe once being forced into a public security police car and taken away. b1250 Protestant pastors are being arrested today as we speak in China, and yet this doesn't really seem to bother this place. It's almost like, Well, you know, what are we going do? You know, man does not live by bread alone. These are important issues. Go back to Scoop Jackson. Go back to Ronald Reagan. Go back to the Constitution. Go back to the Declaration of Independence. Shabaz Bhatti, the Christian min- ister in the government, was gunned down because of his faith, because he was a Christian. The Ahmadiyya Mus-lims in Pakistan are being persecuted. They're going through a very, very dif-ficult time. There are the Coptic Chris-tians. I was in Egypt in July, and the Coptic Christians\u20148.5 million\u2014are going through a very difficult time. As Mr. S MITH just said, anti-Semi- tism is running rampant. Anti-Semi-tism is running rampant in this world, and yet there are some who are trying to kill this Commission, for some rea-son, over in the other body. We're hav-ing such a hard time. The Buddhists in Tibet, they can't even have a picture of the Dalai Lama. Hu Jintao, who is the current Presi-dent of China, was the one who cracked down on Tibet and raided all those monasteries, and yet, with this bill, some are just saying, Well, you know, I don't know, and I don't know, and I don't know. Though this bill is not what we origi- nally planned, the Commission has said they can live with these provisions so that the Commission may remain a re-liable voice for the world's persecuted VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep \u2014 HOUSE H6155 September 14, 2011 people. As Mr. S MITH said, there prob- ably is not a time that you do need this Commission more than now. Since the passage of this legislation, religious freedom has been elevated at times in U.S. foreign policy, but it still does not enjoy the preeminence it deserves. Sadly, a strong U.S. voice on these critical issues has arguably never been more needed. The Commission faces ex-tinction at the end of the month. Mem-bers of Congress know, if you knock this bill down, if you want to kill this Commission and if they vote ''no,'' it will go out of business by the end of this month if the Congress fails to pass it. Just yesterday, as Mr. S MITH said, the State Department released its an-nual International Religious Freedom Report. In the report, several chal-lenges to religious freedom were pin-pointed. People around the world con-tinue to face violent extremist attacks, apostasy and blasphemy laws, repres-sion, and anti-Semitism. According to a Pew Research Study released in 2009, one-third of all nations, containing 70 percent of the world's population, se-verely restrict religious freedom. I want to thank again Ms. R OS- LEHTINEN and Mr. B ERMAN and my good friend Mr. S MITH and their staffs. I don't know what we would say to the Christian community around the world and to the Baha'is and to those concerned about anti-Semitism and the Buddhist community in Tibet and the Uyghurs in China if this thing fails to pass. They would say, What's taking place in Washington? Why is this no longer an issue that this Congress and this administration care about? So I would hope we should pass it. I think we should have a roll call vote. Every Member should stand up and explain what they're going to do. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman R OS-LEHTINEN , Ranking Member B ERMAN , Human Rights Sub- committee Chairman S MITH, and their staffs for working tirelessly in a bipartisan manner to continue to fight for those who are persecuted for their religious beliefs. I would like to par-ticularly thank the chairman's staffers, Yleem Poblete and Doug Anderson, for their help. Thank you also to our leadership for bringing this bill to the floor. I rise in support of this critical legislation to reauthorize and reform the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF). The sad truth is that this bill has been held hostage in the other body, and if we do not pass this bill in the form it is in today, the commission will shut down. Some in the other body are now saying that even these are not the changes they would like to see to the commission, and quite frank-ly, I believe that some over there and this very administration would not mind if the commis-sion were to shut its doors. Religious freedom, often referred to as the first freedom, is central to our American values and should be featured prominently in U.S. foreign policy. Sadly, the constituency for human rights and religious freedom issues is growing smaller and smaller in Washington and in Congress. These issues have become second class citizens in this Congress. I am deeply concerned because, as we stand here and debate this bill, Iraqi Christians are being killed, Baha'is are being marginalized in Iran, Chinese bishops and Protestants pastors sit in jail, Christian and Ahmadis continue to be repressed in Pakistan, Coptic Christians are having a difficult time in Egypt, and anti-Semitism is growing around the world. Though this bill is not what we originally planned, the commission has said they can live with these provisions so that the commis-sion may remain a reliable voice for the world's persecuted people. Recognizing that this critical issue and other human rights related issues are often rel-egated to the sidelines within the State De-partment, I authored legislation more than 10 years ago, in 1998, to establish the Inter-national Religious Freedom Office at the State Department, headed by an ambassador at- large, and to create the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF)\u2014 an independent, bipartisan Federal Govern-ment commission, charged with monitoring the status of freedom of religion or belief abroad and providing policy recommendations to the President, Secretary of State, and Congress. Since the passage of this legislation reli- gious freedom has been elevated within U.S. foreign policy. But it still does not enjoy the preeminence it deserves. And sadly, a strong U.S. voice on this critical issue has arguably never been more needed. USCIRF faces ex-tinction at the end of this month if Congress fails to pass the bill before us today and it is not signed into law. Just yesterday, the State Department re- leased its annual International Religious Free-dom Report. In the report, several challenges to religious freedom were pinpointed. People around the world continue to face violent ex-tremist attacks, apostasy and blasphemy laws, repression, and anti-Semitism. According to a Pew Research Study released in December 2009, one-third of all nations, containing 70 percent of the world's population, severely re-strict religious freedom. This legislation will reauthorize the U.S. Commission on International Religious Free-dom until September 30, 2013. USCIRF, un-like the State Department, is unencumbered by the impulse to maintain good bilateral rela-tions above all else . . . an impulse which sadly can result in critical issues of religious freedom being sidelined in the pursuit of broader foreign policy goals. USCIRF regularly holds briefings and hear- ings on and off the Hill and is frequently called upon to provide expert witness testimony to Congress. Just in the last year the commission has taken a leadership role on a series of key issues. It was quick to recognize the strategic importance and courageous voice of the late Shabaz Bhatti, Pakistan's federal minister of Minorities Affairs, an outspoken critic of his nation's draconian blasphemy laws. During a critical time for the people of Sudan, the USCIRF issued special rec-ommendations on the implementation of the historic Comprehensive Peace Agreement. It made a series of policy recommendations aimed at preserving and protecting Iraq's be-sieged religious minorities. It has actively worked with dozens of Hill of- fices on combating the ''defamation of reli-gions'' resolution before the United Nations. In short, ensuring that the commission is re- authorized is of paramount importance. In a Constitution Day speech, President Ronald Reagan famously described the United States constitution as ''a covenant we have made not only with ourselves, but with all of mankind.'' Passage of this legislation will go a long way in helping us keep that covenant. I urge my colleagues' support. We must let the world know that the U.S. Congress continues to be-lieve in the importance of protecting the first freedom for every person in this world. Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I yield myself the balance of my time. I just want to again thank Congress- man F RANK WOLF, Chairman W OLF, for his eloquence and for his passion for those men and women and children of faith who suffer terrible, terrible injus-tices around the world, including perse-cution. There were two books that got me in- volved, in all candor, in religious free-dom issues\u2014there were two incidents in my first year in Congress in 1981\u2014 ''Tortured for Christ,'' by Richard Wurmbrand, who was a great evan-gelical pastor who spent years being tortured by the Securitate in Romania because of his faith. He made an ap-peal, and he said, Do not sit idly by while men and women of any faith are being tortured and persecuted because of that faith, because it's not just the individual who suffers; the entire fam-ily suffers; and very often they're in-carcerated and tortured as well. The other was the trip to the Soviet Union with the National Conference on Soviet Jewry in 1982, January. It was 10 days in Moscow and Leningrad, meet-ing Soviet Jewish refusniks who were persecuted, who were put into psy-chiatric prisons simply because of their faith. A couple of years later, Mr. W OLFand I went to Perm Camp 35 in the Ural Mountains. It took years to negotiate our way in. This was in 1987. We met with persecuted Jewish refusniks and Christians and political prisoners who were there simply because of their faith. It was where Natan Sharansky had spent a number of his years incar-cerated by the cruel dictatorship of the Soviet Union. In China today, the believer Chris- tians, Uyghurs, Tibetans, and Bud-dhists are tortured beyond anyone's imagination. It's real. It's happening today. In Vietnam, there has been a backlash against people of faith ever since they got trading benefits and the bilateral trade agreement and MFN were extended to them, or PNTR. They have done a backlash to men and women of faith that is unprecedented, and ought to be on the CPC list of the International Religious Freedom Com-mission. I hope people will go to the Web site. Check out this wonderful Commission, which if it is not renewed by the end of this month, goes out of business. I would call out our Members on the other side of this Capitol, the other VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6156 September 14, 2011 body, to pass this legislation imme- diately. We ought to be strengthening and significantly expanding it, not doing less than status quo, which is what we're doing today because of some budget concerns that people have. This is the quintessential watchdog agency in this town. It doesn't get the big press, as Mr. W OLFsaid. It doesn't have the big bucks\u2014no K Street lobby-ists\u2014but it is a wonderful and a very important and effective Commission that keeps track of religious persecu-tion globally, that keeps us in line in the House and the Senate and also the State Department. I read their reports. I read them from cover to cover. Please, I would ask the Members of this body to support this legislation and call on our friends in the Senate to do likewise. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2867, ''United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Reform and Reauthoriza-tion Act of 2011.'' This legislation mandates the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (Commission) compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws, restricts the Commissioner to two consecutive terms, and requires the Commissioner to attend 75 percent of Commission meetings. H.R. 2867, extends the Commission's sunset date by two years, and appropriates $4.29 million for FY12 and FY13. In addition, H.R. 2867 requires study to determine the Commission's effective-ness to ensure that the act is being imple-mented properly. As a senior Member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees, I understand the importance of protecting the religious rights of men, women, and children throughout the world. By advocating for religious stability, we in turn decrease the likelihood of religious extremism and advance the growth of healthy nations. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom serves as an essential fact finder and impartial advisor on these matters. The 18th District of Texas is home to many different faiths and religious backgrounds and welcomes a variety of views on religion. This reflects the principles of freedom of religion upon which our nation was founded. The founding fathers understood the importance of freedom of religion and the perils of religious persecution. Respect for the religious prac-tices of others is woven into the very fabric of the United States. The United States Commission on Inter- national Religious Freedom is an independent, bipartisan commission. The Commissioners are appointed by the President and Congress. The Commission's core mission is to review international violations of religion freedom and make policy recommendations to the Presi-dent, the Secretary of State and Congress. These recommendations impact the lives of millions of people of faith around the world. I believe in the importance of protecting those who are being persecuted based upon their religious beliefs. According to a Pew Research Study re- leased in December 2009, 198 countries, con-taining 70 percent of the world's population, severely restrict religious freedom. The study found that 101 governments used force against religious groups or individuals. Chris- tians and Muslims, who make up more than half of the world's population, were harassed in more countries than other religions, al-though the study does not reflect the intensity of the persecution. This study was conducted prior to the Arab Spring. Many of the nations with increasing religious restrictions are the very nations that have seen popular uprisings and subsequent crackdowns\u2014among them Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Libya, a clear indica-tion that we need this Commission more than ever. I firmly believe that the Commission has a positive impact on the lives of millions of peo-ple of faith throughout the world, especially at a time when many governments continue to repress religious freedom and persecute per-sons on the basis of their religion. Such re-pression only stands to marginalize vulnerable populations, emboldens extremists, fuels sec-tarian tensions, and robs societies of the moral and charitable contributions of faith communities. Repression of religious freedom runs con- trary to shared universal values and under-mines genuine stability. In the words of Sec-retary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton ''Reli-gious freedom provides a cornerstone for every healthy society. It empowers faith-based service. It fosters tolerance and respect among different communities. And it allows nations that uphold it to become more stable, secure, and prosperous. The Commission monitors religious freedom through the lens of international human rights standards, such as those found in the Uni-versal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Forty-five years ago the nations of the world signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which codi-fied in international law the right to religious freedom. The ICCPR affirmed under Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that ''everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or be-lief and freedom, either individually or in com-munity with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, ob-servance, practice and teaching.'' The Commission is not a tool to advance re- ligious beliefs or any specific values. It is fo-cused on addressing the religious climate in each country based upon the ICCPR. By rely-ing on international human rights standards as specified in ICCPR, The Commission guards against any attempts to impose American val-ues on other nations, but rather examines the actions of foreign governments against these universal standards and by their freely under-taken international commitments. This Com-mission is a vital resource in learning to ad-dress conflicts between religious groups, es-pecially in the wake of the Arab Spring. As the Commission serves to address the violations of religious freedom abroad, Con-gress is charged with ensuring the Commis-sion itself is in compliance with laws that pro-tect the rights of workers and those they serve. H.R. 2867 reflects the principle that dis-crimination has no place within our govern-ment and will ensure that the commission itself complies with all federal anti-discrimina-tion laws. This is an essential distinction from the current law, which lacks these robust dis-crimination protections. This legislation further underscores the importance of this Commis- sion by expending the sunset date of the Commission by 2 years to September 30, 2013. Lastly, the amount of appropriations al-lotted for the Commission would be amended by striking $3,000,000 for the fiscal year 2003, to $4,291,000 for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. I firmly believe that H.R. 2867 will allow the Commission to continue to address inter-national religious persecution, provide much needed discrimination protections, and will garner the appropriate amount of oversight to ensure that the Commission operates as ef-fectively. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. S MITH) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2867, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this question will be post-poned. f DISAPPROVAL RESOLUTION RE- LATING TO DEBT LIMIT IN-CREASE Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution 392 and as the designee of the majority leader, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Reed moves that the House proceed to consider the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 77) relating to the disapproval of the President's exercise of authority to increase the debt limit, as submitted under section 3101A of title 31, United States Code, on August 2, 2011. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to section 3101A(c)(3) of title 31, United States Code, the motion is not debatable. The question is on the motion. The motion was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the title of the joint resolution. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: H.J. R ES. 77 Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress dis- approves of the President's exercise of au-thority to increase the debt limit, as exer-cised pursuant to the certification under sec-tion 3101A(a) of title 31, United States Code. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to section 3101A(c)(4) of title 31, United States Code, the joint resolu-tion is considered as read, and the pre-vious question is considered as ordered on the joint resolution to its passage VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6157 September 14, 2011 without intervening motion except 2 hours of debate, equally divided and controlled by the gentleman from New York (Mr. R EED) as the proponent and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. L EVIN) as the opponent. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. b1300 Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I also ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their re-marks and to include extraneous mate-rial on the subject of the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. REED. I am pleased to offer this resolution of disapproval of the request from the President of the United States to borrow an additional one-half trillion dollars. Dealing with this na-tional debt is one of the primary rea-sons why I ran for Congress. It is to stop the endless borrowing of Wash-ington, D.C. on the backs of our chil-dren and our grandchildren. I am also pleased to offer it in the House as the demonstration of a commitment to ending the decades-old borrow-and- spend practices and mentality that runs rampant here in Washington. Our national debt has reached its breaking point. The need to make seri-ous decisions to get our spending under control has never been more urgent. We have all heard the words of Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. When asked what is the most direct threat to our Nation, his immediate and clear response was that our national debt is the greatest threat to our national security. The recent downgrade of our national credit rating by S&P further demonstrates the ne-cessity of making significant struc-tural changes to the way we spend money in Washington, D.C. My focus here today, because we know the Senate has acted and this resolution did not pass the Senate\u2014and is likely not to result in the borrowing of the President getting the additional half a trillion dollars of borrowing\u2014but it's to send a message to the Nation that we need to act proactively in this Chamber and in both Chambers of this House. We need to recognize the na-tional debt. And rather than deal with it in a crisis situation, we should be mindful of it in a proactive, strategic, open and honest manner so that we have good, sound policy responses to the issue that we face and finally tame this beast known as the national debt. We have spent over $15 trillion of money we did not have. That national debt is growing at the rate of $58,000 per second. That's $55,000 owed by every man, child and woman in Amer-ica. That level of borrowing, that level of spending is just not acceptable be-cause it jeopardizes our Nation and, more importantly, jeopardizes our Na- tion for the generations yet to come. The American people have made it clear. They spoke loudly in November 2010, and we are listening. More bor-rowing won't solve the problem. In fact, it will dig the hole even deeper. Borrowing even more before we can enact significant spending cuts to begin dealing with the root problem is a foolish errand. We have a responsi-bility to future generations to take im-mediate action. I will continue along the path of working on both sides of this Chamber to try to identify common ground to solve this crisis on the national debt. The continuing resolution last spring and the Budget Control Act, which re-quires this vote, are only the begin-ning. This war on our national debt is going to go on for many years to come; but we need to take those first steps because with every journey it takes the first step to get us on the path too suc-cess. I know the battles ahead will not be popular, and there will be tremen-dous political pressure on all of us to continue to borrow and spend as usual, but we must stand up to that political pressure. We must honor our oath to do our duty and do our job in this Cham-ber, and that means standing up and changing the path of Washington, D.C. Making difficult decisions now is the only way we can win this war on what is a common enemy we all face, our na-tional debt. It is my hope this resolution con- tinues to show the President how seri-ous we are about this issue and at the same time that we are dealing with this issue we will focus on jobs, we will focus on the economy. We, in the United States Congress, have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We are competent men and women in this Chamber who love our great Nation. We must come together on all fronts at all times, not only on the national debt but on our economy, on getting Americans back to work. And I think, with that bipartisan attitude, it will be amazing what we can accomplish in order to achieve all those goals, the na-tional debt being one of the critical ones that we must face head on today. With that, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, we should not even be considering this resolution. I repeat, we should not even be considering this resolution. We should be moving for-ward, not backwards. This resolution is a dangerous distraction from the un-precedented challenge before us. Fourteen million Americans are looking for work. The Census Bureau reported just yesterday that the pov-erty rate is higher than it's been in 17 years, and median income in this coun-try is at 1996 levels. The President has proposed a jobs bill that one knowledgeable observer, Mark Zandi, estimates would create 1.9 million new jobs and add 2 percentage points to GDP growth next year. We need action to spur economic growth and job creation. That's what we should be considering today. Instead, through this resolution, Re- publicans want to prolong the agony of the debt limit debate and take us back to the brink of default, which would be where we would be if you succeeded. This bill can pass the House only if Members who voted ''yes'' in August on this issue decide in essence to vote ''no'' in September. ''Yes'' in August, ''no'' in September. This Nation wants us to be guided by the needs of the Nation, not the inter-nal politics of a caucus or a conference. We have seen the consequences of that kind of Republican brinkmanship. Standard & Poor's said, in downgrading our credit rating: ''It involved a level of brinkmanship greater than what we had expected earlier in the year.'' In August, consumer confidence dropped by the largest amount since the peak of the financial crisis in 2008, and the conference board noted a direct link between the fall and the debate over default. I think we need only to check 401(k) statements from August to remember the precipitous drop in the stock market. Were this resolution to become law, all those who speak or vote for it have to understand that the U.S. would de-fault on its obligations for the first time in our history. This would throw our economy back into deep recession, trigger $400 billion in immediate job- destroying cuts, and call into question our ability to pay earned Social Secu-rity and Medicare benefits. Madam Speaker, we should not be considering this resolution today. We should be moving forward on the Presi-dent's plan to jump-start our economy and create jobs for American workers. b1310 The American Jobs Act will put more money in workers' pockets through a temporary tax cut, saving the average family $1,500. It would also keep over 6 million workers from losing their un-employment benefits while they con-tinue searching for work and provide new employer incentives to help get them hired. If we don't act on these issues, over a million people will lose their unem-ployment benefits in January and over 2 million in February. So we need to act. We need to look ahead, not just try to go backwards. So I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ''no'' on this resolution so we don't waste one more minute on a re-newal of Republican brinksmanship. Fourteen million Americans who are looking for a job and 43 million Ameri-cans who are living in poverty cannot afford to wait 1 minute longer. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gen-tleman from Florida (Mr. M ACK). VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6158 September 14, 2011 Mr. MACK. I thank the gentleman. Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup- port of this resolution of disapproval because Washington will continue to have a deficit spending problem until we say enough is enough and we put a stop to it. The gentleman across the aisle would like to say this is going backwards. Every time I hear someone on the left speak, it ends up costing us more money. We need to stop the in-sanity here in Washington. We need to stop this overspending. It seems like the only proposals that are coming our way are more spending and more taxes, so I strongly support this resolution. I opposed the debt deal because we can no longer wait to make deep spend-ing cuts and balance our Federal budg-et. We need to act now. Today we have an opportunity to prevent some of the debt deal from going into effect and disallow the government from bor-rowing another $500 billion\u2014borrowing another half trillion dollars. Recently, we heard the President keep saying on his new proposal: Pass this bill now. Pass this bill now. Pass this bill today. I'm saying and the American people are saying: Stop the spending now. Stop the spending today. Stop putting this burden on our chil-dren and grandchildren. Yet the Presi-dent wants to continue to go out there and sell a jobs plan that is more of the same, and he wants to pay for it mys-teriously, shockingly, by raising taxes that will do nothing but kill jobs. So his own proposal that he wants the Congress to take up, in effect, will de-stroy jobs. Somehow we have to convince the people here in Washington and the President that it's not the government that creates jobs. It's the individual. It's the entrepreneurs, the people will-ing to take risks. But they are not willing to take risks in an economy where the President continues to try to push more regulation and more laws and more taxes. It just doesn't make sense, and the American people are fed up. They've had it. Enough is enough. We've spent way too much money. During the August district work pe- riod, over 500 people showed up to my town hall meeting in Fort Myers, Flor-ida. And do you know what I heard over and over again? ''Hold the line on government spending.'' this not your money; it's my money.'' See, only in Washington do the people in this room look at it as their money. They look at your money as their money. It's not. It's the people's who have earned it. Now a comment was made by a con- stituent of mine, Edward Benet, which I think speaks directly to this issue. He said: ''We have to reduce the size and scope of government. I'm unemployed, but just because I don't have a job doesn't mean my neighbor should have to pay for me.'' And then he continued on: ''The best way for government to help is to step aside, get out of the way, and let individuals and businesses do what they do best.'' He and his family are willing to sac- rifice to preserve the economic freedom for Americans. We must cut spending now. That's why I introduced the 1 Per- cent Spending Reduction Act, com-monly known as the Mack Penny Plan. With this plan, we can balance the budget in 8 years by capping spending at 18 percent of GDP in the 7th year and cutting 1 penny out of every Fed-eral dollar for 6 years. One penny. Ev-erybody at home, every business, every individual has had to take more than 1 penny out of their home budget or 1 penny out of their business budget over the last 4 to 6 years. And for the Fed-eral Government to instead be talking about spending more money every year, we need to cut spending. We need to balance our budget. My plan will balance the budget in 8 years. And for those people who might want to say we're not for just across-the- board cuts, great. What we've said is Congress decides where the 1 percent comes from. But if the Congress fails, then we're going to require an across- the-board cut. So we can either work together, or one way or another we'll get the 1 percent across the board. The deficit spending has to stop. Like I said before, enough is enough. I sup-port this resolution, and I would en-courage all of my colleagues, Demo-crats and Republicans, to join me in supporting this resolution. Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to say to the gen-tleman, working together won't work if you undo the work that we did to-gether. I now yield 5 minutes to the ranking member of the Financial Services Com-mittee, the gentleman from Massachu-setts (Mr. F RANK ). Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I'm a great fan of the tradition of comedy in America, and I want to salute my Republican col-leagues for this tribute to one of our great comedians who died tragically early, Gilda Radner, who in the early days of ''Saturday Night Live'' in-vented the character of Roseanne Roseannadanna, who would get on the news segment and say something out-landish. And then when she was cor-rected, her response was, ''Never mind.'' This is the ''never mind'' resolution that the Republicans have brought for-ward. People should understand what this says. It says that the bill that we passed that kept the government from shutting down\u2014and I didn't like the bill, but I liked the part of it that kept the government from shutting down. I was ready to vote just for an increase in the debt limit. Singling out the in-crease in the debt limit and canceling it, that's what this does. What this says is\u2014and here's the problem. We have a majority that has a problem with reality. They have a problem with reality in the field of science. They have a problem with reality in the field of the economy. One of the manifestations of that is their objection to raising the debt limit that was in large part necessary because of debt they incurred. You know, when the debt limit came up, it struck me: It wasn't my debt limit; I didn't vote for the war in Iraq at a cost of a trillion dollars; I didn't vote to give millionaires a tax cut that they didn't need and that had no beneficial effect on the economy. But I did, out of a sense of responsibility, vote to raise the debt limit. Now, I voted against one of them, but I voted for several others. What this bill says is this: Yes, we had to, because we were getting a lot of pressure, vote to raise the debt limit, but now that that is safely behind us, we're going to pretend that we were really against it. So this is the ''never mind'' resolution. People should under-stand this. What this resolution would do would be to undo what just hap-pened. So we have Members on the majority side who have trouble explaining to their primary voters why they had a temporary embrace of reality. Now they're not comfortable with that. Their primary voters aren't com-fortable with that. So having done what they had to do, they now want to pretend that they're going to undo it. The Senate has already killed this. They don't want it to pass because, un-derstand what it would do, it would put us right back in the debt limit situa-tion crisis. And, by the way, these are people who are putting this resolution forward who purport to believe that a major concern with the economy today is the uncertainty that faces investors. So what do they do? They bring up a reso-lution today that would re-create\u2014if anyone took it seriously, and I will give them the credit of saying that they don't. But if anyone took it seri-ously, it would re-create the greatest source of uncertainty we've seen in a long time, whether or not the Federal Government was going to shut down. So that's the phoniness of this. b1320 Now let's talk about the substance. My colleagues claim to be against spending. Apparently, in their world, the nearly $700 billion that is spent an-nually by the Pentagon isn't spending. I don't know what it is. We have a situ-ation in which this year in the budget the Republicans brought forward a bill to increase military spending by $17 billion while funds for local police and funds for local street repair were cut. So that's the problem. Yes, I am for reducing spending. I am for reducing a swollen Pentagon budg-et. We had the President reduce by 10,000 the troops in Afghanistan. Many on the Republican side, including their leadership, criticized him for that. Do they think 10,000 troops in Afghanistan are paid for with ''funny'' money? The fact is that while on the one hand we hear these complaints about spending, we have people who are push-ing for more and more spending. And I VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6159 September 14, 2011 have to say here that I would include my administration in this. And I think if the President expects us to go along with certain restraints elsewhere, add-ing billions of dollars to what we have already wasted in Iraq by keeping thousands of troops in Iraq beyond this\u2014and, by the way, why are we keeping troops in Iraq? One of the lead-ing advocates for keeping troops in Iraq, a leading Republican Senator, Senator G RAHAM , said we must keep our troops in Iraq because we have to police the border between the Arabs and the Kurds, that at a time when we are denying funds to our cities to po-lice their own areas. So, let's be clear. First of all, this sham says, You know what? We had to vote to raise the debt limit. We're now going to engage in this mock exercise of taking back what we did. If anybody takes it seriously, it will send waves of uncertainty back into the economy. But, secondly, going forward, yes, join us. And that includes some on the Re-publican side\u2014unfortunately, a small minority. Don't give more and more and more for the military not to defend America, not to fight terrorism. Those things are not in controversy, but to subsidize the wealthy European na-tions. Madam Speaker, the NATO nations outside the United States spend an av-erage of 1.7 percent of their gross do-mestic product on the military. We spend 5.4 percent\u2014more than three times as much. And my Republican col-leagues have resisted reducing that. What they want to do is subsidize the social safety nets and the spending of Western Europe at the expense of spending here. And how do we do that? By allowing them to hold down the military. So people who want to keep troops in Iraq; people who objected when the President began a withdrawal that was too timid, in my judgment, from Af-ghanistan; people who want to con-tinue to spend unnecessarily and un-wisely not to defend America but to keep America the worldwide policemen have no credibility in complaining about spending. Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to my col-league from Tennessee (Mr. D ESJARLAIS ). Mr. D ESJARLAIS. I thank the gen- tleman. For too long, the Federal Govern- ment has been allowed to engage in an irresponsible spending spree that has resulted in the accumulation of over $14 trillion of debt, and $3 trillion of that debt occurred in just the last 3 years under President Obama. Does anyone really believe that the American people have received a good return on their investment? I know that many of my constituents in Ten-nessee's Fourth District don't. Unem-ployment is still above 9 percent, and our economy is still not creating jobs. And now this President claims to need a $2.4 trillion blank check to continue with his failed policies. That means our national debt would be close to $17 tril-lion by the end of next year. Enough is enough. The latest assessment of our debt in- dicates it will reach 109 percent of GDP in the next decade. That will only fur-ther degrade employers' confidence in our economy and hinder their ability to create jobs. We cannot allow that to happen. I was elected by the people of Tennessee's Fourth Congressional Dis-trict to come to Washington to finally make the Federal Government learn to live within its means. No more bor-rowing 40 cents out of every dollar, no more trillion-dollar deficits, no more stimulus spending, and, most impor-tantly, no more expecting our children and grandchildren to pay for all of this. The debt limit debate provided us with a real opportunity to put our Na-tion back on a fiscally sustainable path by finally forcing the Federal Govern-ment to make difficult, but badly need-ed, spending decisions\u2014decisions that I am more than willing to make. I be-lieve that we missed an opportunity to open up the books and do something that should have been done years ago\u2014 prioritize our spending. It is hard to believe that with all the waste, fraud, and abuse that occurs within the Federal Government that we would have any problem cutting enough spending so that raising the debt limit would be unnecessary. When families in my district have spent more than their budget allows, they look to how they can cut back, not how they can borrow more money. Maybe they don't take a vacation that summer. Maybe they go out to eat less often or hold off on purchasing a new car. The point is they know that the answer to getting back on the right fiscal track is spending less, not borrowing more. The same should hold true for the Fed-eral Government. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this joint resolution of disapproval. Mr. LEVIN. I yield 3 minutes to an- other member of the Ways and Means Committee, the gentleman from Se-attle, Washington (Mr. M CDERMOTT ). Mr. M CDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution be-cause it is in favor of the United States defaulting on its debts. The Republican Party is calling for the United States to default, to tell the whole world: we don't pay our debts. That's what this is about, and it doesn't do one single thing to help American workers or businesses with jobs. Now, make no mistake: The House of Representatives is being used by the Tea Party as an attack machine on the President. They will delay action on anything that helps the economy. The President came up here on Thursday with a plan. Where's the schedule for bringing it out on the floor to create jobs? No, we have to come up here with this resolution. For the majority, de-laying economic recovery is a small price to pay if they can win an elec-tion. They don't care about ordinary folks, working people. They only care about people on the top. Instead of doing something to help create jobs, they have brought up this bill to gin up their extreme base that thinks the only thing Americans should build to-gether are roads and a Defense Depart-ment. That is what the U.S. Govern-ment is all about. Nothing else makes any difference. We don't need to invest in health or science. What do we need science for? It will work out. Don't worry. In this resolution the Republicans are voting for the United States not to pay its bills. That's what we're spend-ing time on. Today is just another day in the Alice in Wonderland of the Re-publican House. Pure politics and noth-ing to help the American people get jobs. This whole Republican Congress is about the Presidential election. It has been from the beginning back in January. Not helping the middle class. What have they done for foreclosures in this country? What have they done for youngsters trying to go to school? What have they done for anything ex-cept try and get the President? They are trying it by stopping the economy from moving forward. I urge my colleagues not to just vote ''no'' on this but for the majority to withdraw it and bring up the American Jobs Act. The President brought it up here. It deserves to be brought up to the floor and debated and amended and passed. I sometimes wonder when I listen to the discussion about this doing stuff to pay someplace down the road, some long-term investment, if a Republican has ever bought a house. I remember when I bought my first house in Se-attle. I was 25 years old. I was a med-ical resident. I paid $16,400 for it. And I wondered if I would ever be able to pay for it, because I wasn't making that much money in those days. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman 1 additional minute. Mr. M CDERMOTT. Lo and behold, I bought the house. And you know what? Thirty years later I paid off that house. That's what investment is about. What the President is saying is that we have to invest in this country if we're going to bring it out of the problems it's in. And that means infrastructure on the ground and it means in human beings in education. b1330 If we don't invest, as the Greatest Generation did after the Second World War\u2014here came Eisenhower and said, hey, we've got to build roads. Nobody said, well, you know, we can't go in debt for all that. Nobody said we can't invest in human beings. We did the GI Bill of Rights, and that's what made us the strongest country in the world. We took every veteran who came back from the war and said here's a college education; get VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 \u2014 HOUSE H6160 September 14, 2011 it and take it out and make this coun- try work. That was investment. But not today's Republican Party. Oh, no, we can't, we mustn't. Don't you understand investment? Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gen-tleman from Louisiana, Dr. B OUSTANY . Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the gen- tleman from New York for yielding time to me. Madam Speaker, it's been said that leadership is willing to make hard choices, fact-based choices to come up with solutions to solve problems and deliver results. Now, we gathered here last Thursday in this Chamber to hear the President, with a much-touted plan beforehand that he was going to bring forth to the American people that was going to help solve the high unemployment in this country and get our economy back on a competitive basis. I can tell you, Madam Speaker, I sat there and I lis-tened very intently, and I left this Chamber with great disappointment because it's not enough. Furthermore, he is proposing taxes, new taxes, taxes on energy production, American energy production. Now, let's look at the facts of what hap-pened. Yes, we had an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and it was dealt with. It was a tragic situation, but it has been dealt with. The fact of the matter is we need American energy production to move this country forward. And now what we're seeing with the lifting of the moratorium is this continued de facto moratorium because of slow-walking of exploration plans and permits. Now, what does this mean? If we brought back the permitting process to the same timeframe we had before\u2014 without sacrificing safety\u2014bring it back into a reasonable amount of time, let's say 30 days to take care of these permits, in 1 year, the year 2012, 230,000 jobs would be created, new jobs, good, high-paying jobs. And not only that, a third of those jobs would be beyond the Gulf Coast States around this country, in California and Florida and in the central part of the country. This would add $34 billion to our GDP. And that's just getting things back to where they were. That's not even talking about ex- panding exploration in these shale for-mations or looking at the east and west coast where we can do more or Alaska. These energy jobs are good- paying jobs. And not only that, it would bring in, in 1 year, $12 billion more into the Treasury and reduce our bill on foreign oil by $15 billion. And that's just getting us back to where we were. Now, I stood here and listened to the President. Instead, he offers taxes, $45 billion more in new taxes on inde-pendent oil and gas companies. That's going to hurt American energy produc-tion, it's going to kill American jobs, and it's going to do nothing to help solve our economy. Furthermore, he chided us about the trade agreements. We have three trade agreements sitting there. They've been there for 3 years. They've been nego-tiated. They're ready to go. And he said Congress needs to pass them. Well, Mr. President, the answer is: Send them to Congress and we'll pass them. That's the process. And beyond that, what is our trade policy? This country is losing credi-bility globally and it's losing its lever-age because we have no trade strategy, a strategy that's going to promote American-manufactured goods, Amer-ican farmers and their commodities so that we can sell these around the world to open markets. That will get our economy going. If we want to solve our debt problem, yes, we've got to balance our budgets, yes, we've got to deal with the debt problem\u2014we've taken some steps\u2014but I saw nothing that the President of-fered. That's why I'm here supporting this resolution, to push this President to consider the steps that need to be taken to promote American competi-tiveness, private sector job growth. That's what we need in this economy. Now, the President had the answer. He was standing here at this podium and he had the answer right up there on the wall of the House behind him. There is a plaque up there, and it's a quote from Daniel Webster. And that first sentence of the quote says, ''Let us develop the resources of our land.'' What's wrong with that, Mr. President? For God's sake, we need American energy production, and it's simple. With the stroke of a pen, he could solve this permitting problem and at least get us back to where we were, create 230,000 jobs next year and add to our GDP growth. And this would be a start, a down payment to a comprehensive energy strategy for this country. This is a no-brainer. We need natural gas as part of our transition strategy. His policy is going to lock out natural gas production in this country. Ninety-seven percent of it is done by small domestic companies here in the U.S., and these taxes will put many of these companies out of business. Mr. President, read the plaque. Let's develop our natural resources. Let's do what we have to do. Let's promote a very aggressive, export-oriented trade policy. And we need a willing partner to move forward with tax reform. We're getting half-hearted signals. This coun-try needs fundamental tax reform. We want to do it on the House Ways and Means Committee. We're ready. We stand ready as willing partners, but yet we're getting signals\u2014mixed signals. This administration has not shown a serious intent to move forward with fundamental tax reform that will un-leash American ingenuity and entre-preneurship in this country. And that's what I heard all through August when I was back home in my district when I talked to folks. They want to see an energy strategy. They want to see comprehensive tax reform that simplifies our Code and lowers rates and clears up some of the loop-holes. They want to make sense out of this Tax Code. And they want to see us selling goods overseas, letting our ports expand. He didn't even mention maritime in- frastructure. We've got bills right now that would improve our maritime in-frastructure without costing one penny more in deficit spending. Why aren't we acting on these things? We're tired of rhetoric. We're tired of political talking points. And what we need is action. The American people have had enough. And I say let's get to work. Let's get this House moving on fundamental changes that will improve this economy and create private sector jobs. Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. I want to say to the gentleman from Louisiana, I listened intently, and I don't understand how he could have voted ''yes'' to raise the debt ceiling in August and now, in essence, he's going to vote ''no'' and bring this country back to the brink of chaos. I now yield 3 minutes to the very dis- tinguished gentleman from Massachu-setts, a very active member of our committee, Mr. N EAL. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I'm fas- cinated by this argument, for the peo-ple that are viewing it, largely because this is not an argument about new spending; this is an argument about paying for past spending. So when Bill Clinton said ado, said goodbye to the American people on January 19, 2001\u2014 this is fact, not opinion\u2014America was staring at a $5.6 trillion surplus. On January 20, George Bush took the oath of office, and when he left 8 years later, we were looking at a $10.6 trillion def-icit. Let's recount those years: Two wars, $2.3 trillion worth of tax cuts, and a prescription D benefit that was un-funded. And all of the money they ap-plied to those arguments\u2014and I am very pleased by the fact I voted against those tax cuts, spoke against them, and voted against the war in Iraq. But all of the money that I've just ref-erenced was borrowed money by the Republican Party. They borrowed all of the money for it\u2014fact, not opinion. And now the bill has come due, and they're on the floor talking about fis-cal rectitude. Now, here's what I think is impor- tant: The gentleman from Florida opened this debate, my friend, Mr. M ACK, by talking about our money and how that money is utilized. Well, guess what? The veterans hospitals, 35,000 men and women wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, is he saying that that's not our money that ought to pay for those hospitals? b1340 Joe Stiglitz has estimated that the cost of disability for the war in Iraq will be between $500 billion and $900 bil-lion. VerDate Mar 15 2010 \u2014 HOUSE H6161 September 14, 2011 I hope people pay attention to what I'm about to say. Almost one out of two people who have served us honor-ably in Iraq and Afghanistan, they're coming back with a long-term dis-ability. Those VA hospitals are going to be stretched for years to come. Now, whether you were for Iraq or against it, our responsibility is to pay for those men and women who served us honorably: 20 years old, life expect-ancy of 80, they're in our care for the next 60 years. I would note with some humor that the Republican leadership did not send out, today, people that were here for the tax cut vote or for the vote on the war in Iraq. Remember weapons of mass destruction and how that vote was to take place? Friends, this is about paying our bills. This is not about new spending. And I hope there's no confusion in the hinterlands. Today, because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, every Amer-ican citizen has a bill of $17,000. They helped bring us to this path of fiscal irresponsibility during their years of borrowing and borrowing and borrowing, and they ask the American people to embrace amnesia. They set the fire, and now they're calling the fire department. This is a very simple vote. It's about paying our bills. Mr. REED. I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Indiana (Mr. S TUTZMAN ). Mr. STUTZMAN. Madam Speaker, I'd like to thank the gentleman from New York for yielding on such an important subject that we're talking about today. I would like to make a couple of points in reference to what the gen-tleman from Massachusetts just made regarding the Republican Party. And I would say that the Republican Party did make mistakes at the beginning of this decade. I would say the Democrat Party has made some mistakes in the last several years. I think there's plen-ty of blame to go around for both par-ties in Washington. But there's a new crew in town. There's 87 new Republicans that were elected last November from all across this country who have joined those in our party who are saying stop the spending. Stop the madness. We're working against ourselves, folks. Madam Speaker, I would say that we wouldn't have to continue having this discussion if we would stop spending, stop borrowing, and then we would focus on the economy. It's going to take both sides to come together to fix the problem within our economy. We're going to have to control our spending. We're going to have to help those Americans who are out there and those who are actually establishing jobs, those who are creating jobs. It's not the U.S. Government that is going to create the jobs for those who are un-employed. I believe that we have a great oppor- tunity right now to again say, let's stop this sort of spending binge in Washington, D.C. We're passing on debt to our kids and our grandkids. This is an opportunity for us to come to-gether, both parties, and say, let's for-get about the sins of the past. Let's pay those bills. But let's not continue to spend the way that we're spending today. From a debt of $79 million when the Revolutionary War ended, the United States has racked up a debt of nearly $14.6 trillion. It would take nearly ev-erything that Americans produced in all of last year to pay off the existing national debt. Right now I see two competing vi- sions in Washington and across this country, Madam Speaker. The first vi-sion is the ''business as usual'' vision. And we see a lot of that right here in Washington. It says we need to blindly increase our debt; and if people com-plain, call it investment instead of debt. In May, President Obama called for a no-cuts-attached increase to the debt ceiling. He didn't give up his call for a blank check until his request had failed here in this House by an over-whelming and bipartisan vote of 97-318. The second vision that I hear a lot about back in Indiana is the same vi-sion and the same work that families do every year. You figure out how to live within your means. You have real cuts, not budgetary gimmicks. You don't fool yourself when you're sitting around the kitchen table trying to fig-ure out the mess that you find yourself in. It's based on the truth. Families sit down at the kitchen table and have the heart-to-heart talks about the situation that they're in. Two conclusions that they usually come to are, we have to cut spending, and we're going to have to figure out how to bring more dollars in. It accepts the challenge, Americans accept the challenge, knowing that these things are not easy. We know that the ''business as usual'' vision, it's broken, and it will inevitably lead us to ruin and more ruin. This vote is a vote against that vision. I come to the floor to support the second vision, the vision that Ameri-cans across this country support, a vi-sion that is shared by the men and women of northeast Indiana. It is a vi-sion of prudence, honest conversations, and optimism. When we get pulled into these discus- sions because of the continual discus-sion about more spending, we cannot focus on the important part of getting people back to work and growing our economy. Government doesn't create jobs. Governors don't create jobs. Americans create jobs. I believe in the American people, and that hope is still a part of our vocabulary. I believe that we're also changing the discussion here in Washington. Career politicians have had their day in Wash-ington, and it's time to talk about cuts. And since we've talked about cuts, the sky has not fallen. Optimism is a part of what the American fabric is built upon. I believe that this Joint Deficit Committee needs to find com-mon ground for actual cuts and that the Senate will pick up the job growth bill that we passed right here on the floor of the House of Representatives this Congress. We all knew that this debt ceiling de- bate was never going to be our final battle in a struggle for balanced budg-ets and fiscal responsibility. It gives us the chance to continue to talk about it. And if we want to continue to raise the debt, if we want to continue to in-crease spending, we'll continue to talk about why we need to restrain Wash-ington politicians. I'm going to continue the dialogue. I believe it's crucial. It's an important part of saving this country's economic future for my kids, for our children and for our grandchildren across this coun-try. Government has, for too long, contin- ued this business as usual and the sta-tus quo vision that I talked about ear-lier. Americans are going to have to pay back all of this debt. This may not be a tax increase, but inevitably and indirectly it is. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. REED. I yield the gentleman an additional minute. Mr. STUTZMAN. So, Madam Speak- er, I come to the floor in support of this resolution because I believe that we need to all agree, Republicans and Democrats, that we're going to limit spending, we're going to stop bor-rowing. We can pay our bills back. But at the same time we're going to focus on job creation, getting people back to work, as the gentleman from Louisiana men-tioned, the energy jobs that were talked about. That was one of the things the President didn't discuss in his address the other night is he didn't talk about energy. We are the leaders in the world on production. I come from a district of a lot of manufacturing; and I believe that if we would focus on energy, cut spending, we need to reform govern-ment. That's what's going to get people back to work. The economy's going to grow. We will still be number one in the world. Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 30 seconds. This resolution isn't about a new vi- sion. It's really about blind rage. There may be a new crew in town; but if this were to pass, it would be a wrecking crew because, essentially, we would be back on the edge, once again, of de-fault. I now yield 2 minutes to the very dis- tinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. J OHNSON ). Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, America was united in its dis-gust at the spectacle in Washington during the debt ceiling fiasco. The Re-publican threat of default ranks among the most reckless and destructive po-litical stunts in modern American his-tory. It undermined the fragile, but re-covering, economy and reduced faith in VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6162 September 14, 2011 the United States of America. It has also undermined the American people's trust in its government. There's no reason to have a debt ceil- ing at all. It doesn't restrain spending since the spending has already been committed. It just threatens our cred-it, and it weakens our country. That's why I, Representative N AD- LER, and Representative M ORAN intro- duced this morning the Full Faith and Credit Act, a bill to do away with the debt ceiling once and for all. b1350 But if we are going to have a debt ceiling, the threat by Members of Con-gress to refuse to raise it is an outrage. We've already made these commit-ments; yet some would have us default. Some would undermine the full faith and credit of the United States. Some would do irreparable damage to our economy and our standing in the world. It's a disgrace. It's a total dis-grace. And the American people see it for what it is: part of a concerted effort to undermine this economy in order to undermine the President and fulfill the congressional Republicans' Inaugura-tion Day vow to do everything within their power to ensure that President Obama would be a one-term President. Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gen-tleman from Kansas (Mr. H UELSKAMP ). Mr. HUELSKAMP. I appreciate the gentleman from New York yielding to me. I do support this resolution. Here in this Chamber\u2014actually, here in America\u2014we often talk about achievements in terms of metrics: the larger, the better. For a private com-pany, it's impressive when it has a large budget, a large workforce, and a large profit and a large presence. The Federal Government, as an insti- tution, should not talk this way, even though similar assertions would all be true. Washington spends too much, em-ploys too many people, and is too in-trusive in the lives of all Americans. The major difference is that private business makes investments that de-liver returns, and failure to do so is the demise of the business. The Federal Government's spending, though, often fails to deliver real results. But the Federal Government does not meet its demise; rather, the all-too-often nega-tive consequences fall on taxpayers and usually result in a new government program or one or dozens more. But if we were thinking like a busi- nessperson, we would consider the re-sults that have come from past invest-ments before making another. Two-and-a-half years ago, the pre- vious Congress and this current Presi-dent implemented a stimulus that ulti-mately will cost Americans more than $1 trillion. This mega-investment was supposed to create 3.5 million jobs. This investment was supposed to bring an unemployment rate of 6.4 percent last month. But what has actually hap-pened? The President is more than 6 million jobs short and unemployment stood at 9.1 percent last month. That's not even counting the millions of Americans who are underemployed. The Budget Control Act, which the President signed, was supposed to be about putting an end to Washington's business as usual: spend and borrow, spend and borrow some more. Yet when the President came before us here in this very room a week ago tomorrow, all we heard was a recycled idea: an-other stimulus, another $450 billion ex-ercise in excessive spending that will underperform and underdeliver. Spend, spend, spend, raise taxes and borrow more to pay for that spending. Raise those taxes from the very indi-viduals and businesses that can actu-ally create jobs that will get the econ-omy out of this rut and put millions of Americans to work. And along the way, let's demonize job creators. That's what happened in this Chamber. I believe the Federal Government should function as efficiently and as ef-fectively as a private business; but it, by no means, should be able to brag about a large budget that fails to de-liver and which only adds to the red ink each year. Before adding to the $15 trillion in debt this country already has or sus-taining more years of trillion dollar annual deficits, we have no choice, and the American people expect no less, cut current spending and cap future spend-ing obligations and pass a balanced budget amendment. I support this resolution. Mr. LEVIN. It is now my privilege to yield 3 minutes to another active mem-ber of our committee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. D OGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. I thank the gen- tleman. I think it's clear that this resolution is just not my cup of tea, but I can tell you if we followed the path that was just recommended, Republicans could drive us deeper into recession or even depression. It's as if the Republicans who are here today wanted to start Halloween early because they keep trying to bring back to life, as if it were some zombie, the specter of debt default that has al-ready caused us so many problems. Building on their earlier success in sowing panic and reaping fear in our global financial markets that contrib-uted to the first-ever downgrade of our Nation's credit rating, these profes-sional obstructionists are determined to keep trying to wreak havoc. As families are demanding action on the economy, a response to jobs, the Republicans instead are focusing on pandering to a small group of people for whom reality doesn't seem to make much difference. The problem is reality has a Democratic bias when it comes to this question of the economy and job creation. I think if the Republicans really want to help us close the debt gap, the best way to do that is to get this econ-omy moving. An increase in economic growth will do more than any of the things that he just mentioned\u2014some amendment that might be approved years from now\u2014will do more to help us get the debt under control than most anything else. Of course, how did we end up with the debt that we have today? Much of it is directly related to the policies of the Bush-Cheney years when Republicans were totally ignoring the issue of debt: unpaid wars, tax cuts based on the my-thology that they would pay for them-selves when they just dug us deeper into debt. And now we face the need to try to get our economy moving again. Their solution? Do less. Jeopardize the full faith and credit of the United States. I think one of the problems that we have here, and it afflicts the Demo-cratic Party to some extent as well as the Republicans, but especially with our Republican colleagues, is that we've just got too many certified smart people here in Washington. They're so smart they know what they know; they just don't know what the American people are experiencing. You don't have very many people advising about this economic recovery. Whoever had to drive a truck for a living? You don't have people who even had to worry about whether they could make their next truck payment. And you sure don't have people advising who've had their house foreclosed and had to move their family into a truck. But that's the plight that too many Americans face today, and we need to be responding to their legitimate con-cern that what we need to do is focus on the demand side of the equation and help improve demand and get this economy going again. I like the idea of focusing on our roadways, our trucks, our crumbling bridges and the like, building the infra-structure that will help American busi-ness as well as the people who would do that construction work. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman an additional minute. Mr. DOGGETT. I believe that focus- ing on our infrastructure, our roads, bridges, our schools, focusing on what is happening inside our schools with so many teachers threatened with dis-missal around the country with the cutback in State and local budgets, that's the kind of focus that can help get America moving and address the debt issues at the same time. I would urge my colleagues to vote ''no'' on today's empty political resolu-tion so we can focus on what really makes a difference to working families across this country. Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. It is now my privilege to yield 3 minutes to the very distin- guished gentleman from New York, C HARLES RANGEL . (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re-marks.) VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:32 Sep \u2014 HOUSE H6163 September 14, 2011 Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise against this resolution. I had thought that the Congress had already passed this very, very embar-rassing experience. When you read the papers today and see the pain that exists throughout these United States, it is not Repub-lican or Democratic pain. It's pain that they're feeling as a result of the lack of economic growth in our great country. And when you see the number of years and decades that this Congress has approved the President's authority to increase the debt ceiling for the pur-pose of maintaining the fiscal integrity of our country and, therefore, the de-mocracy-loving countries that depend on the credibility of our fiscal condi-tion, I would have hoped that we would think of this issue not in terms of the political implications, but how does the world perceive us to be. Quite frankly, without being polit- ical, in watching the debate the other night, it wasn't that it annoyed me, but I was just so embarrassed that the world might think that that rep-resented the principles of my country, people laughing about execution and laughing about people dying. I'm certain nobody in this body takes pride in that type of thing. But to go against the President's ability to main-tain the integrity of the United States of America, I think it is just so wrong. There are good reasons that we can't challenge as to why our polling as a body is so low. b1400 I don't think anyone can walk away feeling proud\u2014liberal, conservative\u2014 about what's going on. The reason is because people don't go to sleep at night worried about what we're doing and debating on the question of revok-ing, of giving the power to the Presi-dent to protect the integrity of our great Nation. No. They're going to bed at night having hope that maybe to-morrow they'll get a job, that maybe they'll be able to guarantee their health insurance, that maybe their kids will have a better life, that maybe we'll stop fooling around, playing poli-tics with the future of this great coun-try, that just maybe, one day, we'll be more concerned about the lack of de-fault and the credit of our country than our own reelections. I know it seems absurd that we can wish that; but if you think about it, they're not talking about Democrats' polls being low, and they're not just talking about Republicans' polls being low. They're talking about all of us. The greatest thing about America, far beyond our military and economic wealth, is the trust that people used to have in government. Once they lose that, whether they're poor or whether they belong to that small number of people who hold the Nation's wealth, then the country is in desperate trou-ble. So I hope that people who witness this debate recognize that the opposi-tion is not speaking for the country or the Congress, but probably for the Re-publican National Committee. Mr. REED. I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to another member of our committee, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. B LUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. This pointless exercise that the House has embarked upon here today illustrates the chal-lenge that we have to try and deal meaningfully with the very real prob-lems that America expects us to make progress on. This resolution has al-ready been laid to rest in the Senate. It has been defeated. Ain't going to hap-pen. So, no matter what the result of the hours of debate that we have here today, it will make absolutely no dif-ference. It is an extension of what happened with the totally manufactured crisis surrounding the debt ceiling earlier this year. The debt ceiling increase was to deal with bills that we had already incurred, for which Congress over the years had already approved the spend-ing, and we'd borrowed the money for it. It made no difference about future debt. It made no difference about the spending commitments that had al-ready been made. Yet we watched tremors go through international mar-kets, not because America couldn't pay its bills, but because some politicians, for their own purposes, were willing to risk that America didn't pay its bills. Unprecedented. We've raised the debt ceiling over 100 times. There was no doubt that we would, in fact, honor our commit-ments; but there were people talking crazy enough that cast doubt. That, I think, at least in part, is why we have seen the markets in the United States be on a roller coaster and people watch their 401(k)s maybe become 301(k)s one afternoon before they go up a little again and then go back down. It doesn't have to be this hard if, in- stead of a pointless exercise, we would spend some time on areas where actu-ally Congress could come together and cooperate on dealing with the infra-structure crisis in this country, where there is broad support from the busi-ness community, organized labor, con-tractors, local government, environ-mentalists to move forward to rebuild and renew this country, putting not tens of thousands but millions of Americans to work in strengthening our country and our economy. We could be dealing with something like this, but we're not. We could deal with reforms in agri- culture that would put more money in the hands of America's farmers and ranchers, less in mega-agribusiness. We'd save money, and we'd improve the state of agriculture. While we're at it, we could probably improve the health of our children in school with their nu-trition, but we're not dealing with that. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. S IMPSON ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Most tellingly, we should be accelerating the reforms that the last Congress enacted. When they started, most of them were bipar-tisan ideas that have been imple-mented, in some cases, by Republican Governors. The difference between what America spends on health care this year and what the second most ex-pensive country, Switzerland, spends is $3,000 a person, $3 trillion over 10 years. If we could just spend as much as the second most expensive country in the world. We ought to be working on things like this that will make a difference for America, put them back to work, have fiscal stability\u2014and maybe regain a little confidence in the political proc-ess instead of pointless exercises like this. I hope\u2014I hope\u2014that we will get this out of our system, get down and get to work. America deserves our best, not our worst, which is on exhibit here today. Mr. REED. I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-ginia (Mr. C ONNOLLY ). Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia. I thank my good friend from Michigan for yielding. Let me take this opportunity to thank the 174 Republican Members of this House who voted with us in a bi-partisan fashion just last month to avert the first Federal default in the Nation's history. It may not have been an easy vote for some, but it was the right thing to do to prevent a catas-trophe that would have certainly shak-en further our fragile economic recov-ery. Today's vote is no different. I urge my colleagues to not give in to the political gamesmanship that Standard & Poor's cited as the very reason for its bleak downgrading of the United States' credit rating. We must reaffirm our commitment that Amer-ica will meet its obligations, and we don't want to find ourselves politically explaining how we voted for it before we voted against it. Make no mistake that voting in favor of this resolution will, in fact, lead to the very default we voted to avoid with the Budget Control Act. You cannot now be for default after having just voted against it. We must reject this resolution and move on to the real challenge of working with a bipartisan supercommittee to restore fiscal re-sponsibility, revive our economy and, most importantly, re-instill confidence in the American citizen and the Amer-ican business community. Mr. REED. I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. Does the gentleman from New York have any more speakers? Mr. REED. I have one additional speaker, and then I am prepared to close after that, I believe. VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6164 September 14, 2011 Mr. LEVIN. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G OHMERT ). Mr. GOHMERT. I know of the inten- tions of my colleagues across the aisle. You want to try to make America a better place. We had the prior speaker indicate that tremors were sent through the fi-nancial markets because some politi-cians, for their own purposes, put the financial integrity at risk. The Demo-cratic speaker before that indicated that we should not go against the President's ability to protect the integ-rity of the United States. The Demo-cratic speaker before that said that no one was apparently advising Repub-licans who had missed a truck pay-ment. Things like that. Guess what. I know that was not in- tended to be misleading. I know the in-tent was not that, but the fact is some of us go home as we did in August. b1410 Some of us get out into the far reaches, the most rural areas of Amer-ica, our districts. We talk to those peo-ple. They're struggling with gas prices. They are having all kinds of trouble making ends meet, and they cannot un-derstand how the people that are sent to Washington as representatives don't get it, how we could come up here and we can't control our spending. So I wanted to help illuminate those friends who are mystified as to what our own purposes were in opposing a debt ceiling bill that jacked up the debt ceiling and then says, you know, we are going to cut 1, maybe 2, 2.5 tril-lion over 10 years when everyone in this body either knows or needs a good education to know that there is not a court, there is no way in the world you can bind a future Congress into making cuts that they have not agreed to. You can't do that. It's not enforceable. So the trick here in Washington is to back load all of the massive cuts, have a lit-tle trickle of cuts now. So our own purposes boil down to this: I didn't deserve to be born in America. None of us that were born here did. We weren't born here because in the womb we did something deserv-ing of being born in America. We are the most blessed nation in the history of the world, and it's not because of what anybody living today has done. We were blessed. We were born here. So many have been able to immigrate here and be blessed because of what prior generations have done: the re-sponsibility, putting their lives on the line in war, struggling through depres-sion to be accountable, struggling through the earliest days when they pledged their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor. Those people are the reason we have been blessed. So to make clear about what our own purposes were in opposing that debt ceiling, that didn't really do any kind of significant cuts in the next year, 2 years, back loaded them for 10 years, because that's irresponsible. And if fu-ture generations have any hope at all of being blessed as we have been, it's up to us. We can't repay the people that paid the ultimate price and that scraped and saved and were responsible in Congresses for 200\u2014well, not 200, but 150 years or so that lived within their means. We can't repay them, but we can repay them by being responsible for the future. So to come in and to have a debt ceil- ing increase time after time after time is not a real debt ceiling. And it is not an adequate defense to say, well, Bush did it; well, Clinton did it; well, Bush did it before him or Reagan did it, and just go on down, Carter did it. At some point we have to be responsible for our own actions and quit playing the point-ing game and say, look, our time is now. We are elected to be responsible now. Our own purposes are to be re-sponsible for the debt that we are in-curring now. The $4.5 trillion more than has been brought in is pretty irre-sponsible. That's no way to go. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. REED. I yield the gentleman 1 additional minute. Mr. GOHMERT. But if you want the numbers, if we are only able to save a trillion dollars over 10 years, which is quite possible under the debt ceiling deal that passed, then it will take 150 years before the budget balances if we continue to cut 1 trillion every year, and it will only add about $120 trillion to the 14 trillion we have now. If we could save 2 trillion every 10 years, then we are looking at 80 years before we balance the budget and only adding 72 trillion to the debt that we have. That's irresponsible. This country won't be around in this form, this Con-gress, and therefore that is our special purpose for doing this. That is why we say it's time to stop the debt ceiling bill from where it was, get responsible, and propose real cuts so this Congress does what the people who are missing payments are trying to do\u2014live within their means. Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 30 seconds. I want to say to the gentleman from Texas I disagree with his position, but I respect it. I can understand that those who voted ''no'' will now vote ''yes.'' What is not understandable is that those on the Republican side who voted ''yes'' are now voting ''no.'' I yield 4 minutes to our distinguished whip, the gentleman from the proud State of Maryland (Mr. H OYER ). Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. The previous speaker voted to go deeply into debt. Frankly, I voted for some of those programs myself, two of which were to support the efforts in Af-ghanistan and Iraq. We didn't pay for them. As has been said, I didn't vote for it initially, but I think it's a good pro-gram. We have made it better for the prescription drug program, and the gentleman wasn't here when we passed that, but we didn't pay for it. He is cor-rect: It doesn't matter which side didn't pay for it; we haven't paid for it. This bill is about whether or not we are going to stand up and say, yes, we voted to pay for it but, guess what, we had our fingers crossed; we are not going to do it. We said we were going to do this. We took some tough action. Both sides joined together, both leader-ships joined together and said we are going to do this. Now, this bill is a phony. This is pos- turing. This is politics. This is pure politics because the United States Sen-ate has already rejected this bill and only one House needed to reject it. We are going to have an extension of the debt. The extension of the debt will simply mean that those items that we all voted on will be paid for, that we won't welsh on our debts, that America will pay its debts. Now, this bill is about, oh, no, let's not pay our debts. Let's pretend that they don't occur, that we really don't have to pay them. America's welshing on its debts really won't have much consequence; although the over-whelming majority of people believe that if we welsh on our debts it will have extraordinary consequences. In fact, it's having extraordinary con-sequences on our economy right now, as we speak. It's undermined the con-fidence in America that we had this confrontation about whether America was going to pay its bills. I rise, Mr. Speaker, to urge my col- leagues to vote down this resolution of disapproval which is transparently po-litical and which will do nothing to se-cure our Nation's fiscal future. In fact, this resolution is premised on the as-sumption that the American people are ignorant\u2014I don't believe that\u2014igno-rant about the nature of our debt ceil-ing and the sources of America's fiscal challenges. As often as some in this House at- tempt to falsely persuade the American people that raising the debt ceiling means taking on more debt, we will be here to repeat the truth. This is about nothing more than paying the bills we have already incurred. The American people understand that fact, as evi-denced by their disgust with the par-tisan brinksmanship that almost brought America to the brink of de-fault. What Americans want to see is us coming together to take real action on two issues they are deeply concerned about: jobs and our mounting deficit. One of the most important things we can do to reduce the deficit is to create jobs, grow our economy, get people back to work. The President has put forward the American Jobs Act, which incorporates many elements of House Democrats' Make It in America agenda to create jobs. I hope my Republican colleagues bring it to the House floor for a vote as soon as possible. VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6165 September 14, 2011 Over the long term, though, we must lay out a path to restore fiscal sustain-ability. And the only path that is fea-sible fiscally, politically, and morally is one that is balanced and asks every-one to pay their fair share, not let some of the special interests and fa-vored few be left out of the obligations to bring fiscal responsibility to this Nation. All of us need to be included. A balanced solution is favored by an overwhelming majority of Americans and even three-quarters of Repub-licans. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman 1 additional minute. Mr. HOYER. The Joint Select Com- mittee on Deficit Reduction must put aside partisan politics and put some hard choices on the table, choices that encompass both spending and revenue, and we must support their efforts to reach agreement. b1420 That's what the American people de- serve. That's the difference between posturing on our fiscal future, as this vote today does, and leading on our fis-cal future. I urge my colleagues, let's vote down this empty resolution which is a pretense, a pretend, a statement that we don't like debt. Nobody likes the debt we've incurred, and everybody ought to join together in paying it down. Ladies and gentlemen, this is an issue of responsibility. It's not easy. It's not always politically popular. We've incurred a debt. It is our respon-sibility collectively, not as Repub-licans or Democrats, but as Americans to come together and pay down this debt and not pretend that simply by defeating a resolution, or passing a res-olution of so-called disapproval\u2014which is already a dead letter, and everybody on your side of the aisle knows it's a dead letter because the Senate has al-ready voted. This is just a statement that I don't like debt. None of us like debt. Let's join together and reduce it as we did in the nineties. Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G OHMERT ). Mr. GOHMERT. I just wanted to make sure the record was clear. My dear friend from Maryland said there were those on this side who want-ed to welsh on our debt, and that's not the case. The thing that we want to do is stop incurring debt. We are all about being good for the debt we incur. We don't want to welsh on any agree-ments. I didn't ask my friend for time, so my time is very limited. I just want-ed to correct the record. We're not out to welsh on anything. We're here to say, let's quit incurring debt. That's the whole point. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I think we have already set the parameters for this discussion. We can see by the throngs that are on the floor of the House how keenly impor-tant this is to the American people. The reason why I say that is because important discussions draw Members even away from their duties elsewhere. But we know that the reason why we are speaking to empty seats is, one, be-cause the other body has resoundingly denounced and voted this particular provision down because we have reached a compromise, a respectable compromise that we realize we have to pay our bills. But of course those who believe that they are not in the people's House, they can put this resolution on the floor because if they look to what the people want, 46 percent of the Amer-ican people believe that jobs are more important than reducing the deficit. More than 65 percent believe we should be doing a jobs bill. We have the great-est poverty among children of all sec-tors in all areas of the country right now as I speak. And the new population of the impoverished are those recent college graduates. All of the stars in the eyes and excited parents who've paid large amounts of dollars to ensure that their young ones have an oppor-tunity for a college education, there are no jobs. Now, I don't concede to the fact that the only initiative that should come about should be from the government, but we are the umbrella on a rainy day. This is a small measure that the Presi-dent has offered, a small, constructive measure, his jobs bill. It is balanced across the board. It provides relief for small businesses. It provides the jobs that they will create. It gives incen-tives to hire someone. It works with our larger companies as well. And, of course, it puts back to work what has been a devastating phenomenon in our communities, taking away firefighters, police and teachers. You're going to feel the pinch when your young chil-dren are in classes that are 50 and 60 persons. So this is realistic. It also addresses the question of the 46.2 million Americans who are living in poverty. As I indicated, a dispropor-tionate share of those are children. So what we are doing today goes smack against what the people want, and this is the people's House. I am concerned that we are not only being redundant, but we're saying to the world: smack us as irresponsible. We have the money to pay our bills, but we want the word to go out: we are irre-sponsible. We're not paying any bills. We're not Greece, we're not Spain, we're not Italy. We are Americans, and we have the know-it-all and the com-mitment to be the greatest country. I've never taken seriously the pun- dits about America's decline; but it is a decline if we get on the floor of the House and ignore the needs of our brothers and sisters, ignore the needs in the Northeast where there's been a devastating hurricane, ignore those in the Southwest where 1,400 homes have been burned to the ground in Texas. Who is going to help those folks besides their private insurance? They need the Federal Government, the rainy day umbrella on a rainy day or when a fire is there, the hose for the fire. So I ask my colleagues to consider being realistic and rational. Vote this down. Put a jobs bill on the floor and do what the people want, create jobs now. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposi- tion to H.J. Res. 77, a Resolution of Dis-approval intended to prevent President Obama from raising the debt ceiling by $500 billion as he is authorized to do by the debt ceiling agreement reached last month. This resolution will obstruct the federal government from meeting their financial obligations; measures like this one have already failed in the Senate. This is a colossal waste of valuable legislative time. The message has been heard loud and clear, we must address the debt limit; however another message is being muffled\u2014the need to focus on jobs. Here we are once again with another proposal before the House that ap-pears to throw caution to the wind. This joint resolution is gambling on our financial future, if this amendment passes then we will fail to raise our nation's debt limit and will allow our nation to default. We should have learned a valuable lesson from what happened the last time my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle tried to suggest that we should allow our nation to de-fault. The stock market reacted immediately and a well known credit company lowered our nation's credit rating. We need to maintain our creditworthiness to meet the needs of the very people we have been sent here to serve. I am disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are more interested in playing political games than creating jobs or improving the economy. Attempting to prevent the President from raising the debt ceiling to pay for the needs of the country and functions of the government will only lead us to the brink of another crisis. This is a continued effort by my Republican friends to ransom the American economy in order to extort the American public. Instead of working toward a bipartisan job creation bill, congressional Republicans are at-tempting to constrain the ability of Congress to deal effectively with America's economic, fis-cal, and job creation troubles. There has been a consistent theme this Congress of failing to bring forward measures that will create jobs. My Republicans col-leagues have set the agenda. They seem fo-cused on cutting programs that benefit the public and those in need, while making no concrete attempt to focus on job creation and economic recovery. This bill is wasting a tre-mendous amount of time when we should be focused on paying our nation's bills and re-solving our differences. In my district, the Texas 186, more than 190,000 people live below the poverty line. We must not, we cannot, at a time when the Census Bureau places the number of Amer-ican living in poverty at the highest rate in over 50 years, cut vital social services. Not in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and per-sistent unemployment, when so many rely on federal benefits to survive, like the Supple-mental Nutrition Access Program, SNAP, that fed 3.9 million residents of Texas in April VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6166 September 14, 2011 2011, or the Women, Infant, and Children, WIC, Program that provides nutritious food to more than 990,000 mothers and children in my home state. In 2010, there were 46.2 million Americans living in poverty nationwide. According to the 2010 Federal poverty threshold, determined by the US Census, a family of four is considered impoverished if they are living on less than $22,314 per year. Children represent a disproportionate amount of the United States poor population. In 2008, there were 15.45 million impover-ished children in the nation, 20.7% of Amer-ica's youth. The Kaiser Family Foundation es-timates that there are currently 5.6 million Tex-ans living in poverty, 2.2 million of them chil-dren, and that 17.4% of households in the state struggle with food insecurity. Attempts to prevent President Obama from raising the debt ceiling threaten our ability to keep paying for programs that benefit the least among us, and I for one, will not turn my back on the Americans who are the most in need of compassionate leadership and responsible governing. Threatening an increase in the debt ceiling threatens our ability to pay for Medicare, which guarantees a healthy and secure retire-ment for Americans who have paid into it for their entire working lives. Protecting Medicare represents the basic values of fairness and re-spect for our seniors, including the 2.9 million Texans who received Medicare in 2010. Yes, we must take steps to balance the budget and reduce the national debt, but not at the expense of vital social programs. It is unconscionable that in our nation of vast re-sources, my Republican colleagues would pass a budget that cuts funding for essential social programs. Poverty impacts far too many Americans and social safety nets provide these individuals with vital assistance. Perhaps my friends on the other side of the aisle are content to conclude that life simply is not fair, equality is not accessible to everyone, and the less advantaged among us are con-demned to remain as they are, but I do not accept that. That kind of complacency is not fitting for America. Prior to the existence of the debt ceiling, Congress had to approve borrowing each time the federal government wished to borrow money in order to carry out its functions. With the onset of World War I, more flexibility was needed to expand the government's capability to borrow money expeditiously in order to meet the rapidly changing requirements of funding a major war in the modern era. To address this need, the first debt ceiling was established in 1917, allowing the federal government to borrow money to meet its obli-gations without prior congressional approval, so long as in the aggregate, the amount bor-rowed did not eclipse a specified limit. Since the debt limit was first put in place, Congress has increased it over 100 times; in fact, it was raised 10 times within the past decade, and last month, we were able to ne-gotiate another compromise, and keep the country from default. I urge my colleagues not to undermine the agreement that was reached by attempting to block the President's ability to raise the debt ceiling. Once again, the American economy hangs in the balance as the act of the President rais-ing the debt ceiling becomes an irrelevant spending debate that is as unnecessary as it is perilous, as increasing the debt ceiling does not obligate the undertaking of any new spending by the federal government. Rather, raising the debt limit simply allows the govern-ment to pay existing legal obligations prom-ised to debt holders that were already agreed to by Presidents and Congresses, both past and present. This resolution is a petulant attempt to un- dermine President Obama. The bill itself says it is a joint resolution ''relating to the dis-approval of the President's exercise of author-ity to increase the debt limit''. Exercise of au-thority. It does not say unlawful exercise of au-thority, or unconstitutional exercise of author-ity. The language of the bill itself makes it clear the President has the authority to raise the debt ceiling as indicated in the agreement reached on August 2. Passing this resolution will not decrease spending; it will merely compromise our ability to pay for spending already authorized. This bill does nothing to reduce the deficit, or ad-dress the budget, it only risks our economic standing and ability to pay our nation's bills, while simultaneously hurtling the nation toward another debt ceiling crisis. Instead of spending time on resolutions de- signed to cast the President in a negative light, it is time for this Congress to come to-gether, and pass meaningful legislation that will benefit the American people. In his ad-dress to a joint session of Congress last Thursday, President Obama gave this body a great opportunity to achieve bipartisan, job creating legislation that will invest in small business, help families that have been strug-gling with chronic unemployment, assist vet-erans in finding jobs, and invest in our infra-structure. It is time for a new sense of bipartisanship. It is time for Congress to work together to ag-gressively take on job creation. It is time to end these divisive tactics and compromise to encourage the rapid job growth the American people deserve. I urge my colleagues, Demo-crats and Republicans alike, to stand up and vote no on this partisan resolution; we can, and we must take this opportunity to declare our intent to do what is right, face what is hard, and achieve what is great. Instead of attempting to embarrass the President, I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to come together, and focus on pass-ing legislation that will help the American peo-ple by improving the economy and creating jobs. Now is not the time for partisan malice, now is not the time for H.J. Res 77; now is the time for this Congress to do all it can to usher in a new age of American ingenuity and pros-perity. H.J. Res. 77 is simply a way to engage in past battles, and I am voting against it in order to focus on the future. Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colo-rado (Mr. L AMBORN ). Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the great State of New York, Representative R EED, for recognizing me, but most of all for bringing this resolution. I support it, and I urge everyone here to support it. As you may remember, it was a two- step process when the debt ceiling was increased: an initial $400 billion imme-diately to avert the possibility of a de-fault. That has been done. But an addi-tional $500 billion will not go out if this resolution passes. I think we need to slow down and take a look at our spending before we commit another trillion dollars of debt. We did reduce next year's budget by, I believe, $31 billion over last year. That's a good step. That's a step in the right direction, but it's only a small step when you realize that this year's deficit is $1.3 trillion. So $31 billion is only a small step in the right direction. So this would give us more time and seriousness of purpose to look at addi-tional savings. So with that prospect in mind, I would urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Let's slow down the adoption of an additional half trillion of debt. I urge support. Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself the bal- ance of my time. Very briefly, in one sense this is a meaningless resolution. My guess is that opinion makers in this country and I think abroad will consider it not meaningful, that it's going through the motions. But there is a real danger here, and that is what it says about the dynam-ics on the majority side. That's the worrisome thing. It isn't that we would slow things down. If this were to pass and become law, indeed, the ceiling would fall. We would go into default very soon. And I guess what this resolution being allowed to be brought up says is that there's a feeling within majority ranks that we have to let some bring this up, and perhaps a lot who voted ''yes'' now in essence vote ''no'' in order to bring some kind of peaceful equilibrium within the ranks of the majority. The problem is that we need to be able to reach across the aisle. Having set up a select committee, it says we need to worry less about the dynamics within our caucus or conference and more about reaching common ground. b1430 That's why this exercise isn't mean- ingless. The danger is that it will be-come very meaningful and that we will become\u2014this Congress\u2014essentially handicapped, if not imprisoned, by the inability of the majority on this side to step up to the plate and realize that in order to solve our problems there needs to be a balanced instead of imbalanced approach; that we have to look at reve-nues as well as spending cuts. That's the significance of this being brought up here. I think all of us need to take another look before we essentially change our votes. And, essentially, it would mean ''signaling.'' It will be still more dif-ficult than the present perilous path to make meaningful our effort to move ahead in this country to address the job needs in this country, and yes, to address the deficit, but mainly or es-sentially to get our economy growing again. If we don't send that right sig-nal here today, and send the wrong sig-nal, I'm afraid this vote will become too meaningful. VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6167 September 14, 2011 I strongly urge that people vote ''no.'' I strongly urge on the Repub-lican side that those who stepped up to the plate last time, step up to the plate this time and not duck for what is es-sentially an internal political dynamic. The dynamics of this country in terms of jobs and job growth, those dynamics are too essential for partisan internal politics to reign supreme on this floor at this time. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self the balance of my time. I truly appreciate the sentiments of my colleague from Michigan, and I truly appreciate the debate that we've had today on this resolution. It is time that we come together. As a member of the freshman class that's come to Washington, DC, I can tell you it is not a group of radical extremists, but men and women who have left their families, who have left their busi-nesses, and have come down here to Washington, DC to accomplish what needs to be accomplished, that is, to get the fiscal house of Washington in order; it is to have the ability and skill to deal with the economy and put peo-ple back to work. We have the energy, we have the de- sire to reignite this country so that generations of our children and grand-children will be able to enjoy the bene-fits that we have all benefited from. We come here sincerely to reach across the aisle to have an open and honest dia-logue with each and every one of the Members of this House, and that is why this debate is such a positive thing, in my mind. Because we are now starting down the path of recognizing that the debt has to be dealt with once and for all, but at the same time we must work together to heal our country, to re-ignite our country's economy so that people can afford the American Dream that they so deserve and as each and every one of us has always benefited from. So I come here this afternoon and offer this resolution to send a message to the President, to the world, to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that we cannot take our eye off the ball. We have to do all things. Because we are in a historic time when the issues we face can no longer be pushed down the road. It is now time to lead. It is now time to come together and act for this great Nation, the United States of America. In this vote, I urge all my colleagues to support the passage of this resolu-tion to send that message that we will deal with the debt, we will deal with the economy, we will deal with the jobs, and we will create an environ-ment upon which the private sector will blossom again and people will ben-efit for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 77, a resolution dis-approving of President Obama's exercise of authority to increase the debt limit. The recent decision by the President to raise the debt ceiling was not one made in haste or taken lightly, but rather it is one that absolutely must be made. The consequences of not acting are so grave that we could not let it be an option as it would do great irreparable damage to our economy. We played with fire last month, and although we ultimately approved an increase, we spooked world markets and caused an un-precedented downgrading of our country's heretofore sterling credit rating. In brief, we must raise the debt ceiling to prevent a default on our Nation's obligations, avert an inter-national economic crisis, and prevent further harm from being visited upon middle class families. My colleagues have failed to recognize the damage their political posturing is doing to our economy. We have wasted plenty of floor time on theater, and in the meantime have let our Nation dangle on the precipice of default. In-stead of rehashing old arguments and playing the same political blame games, we should come together and focus on the main problem facing Americans today: jobs. When I was back home in Michigan during the August re-cess, I heard firsthand from my constituents about the urgent need to create jobs, regen-erate our economy, and get America going again. People across our Nation are hurting and are sick of the inaction in Washington. President Obama should be commended for taking the initiative on this important issue by unveiling the American Jobs Act. While we may disagree on the specifics of his proposal, it should be considered on merit alone and Congress should come together to reach con-sensus on what can be done to improve the economy. Resolutions such as this one are nothing but a distraction from this important mission, which is why I am voting against it today. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.

HONORING CUMBERLAND AMERICAN LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the Cumberland American Little League team from my home State of Rhode Island. Cum-berland American reached its first Lit-tle League World Series after winning the New England Regional Champion-ship. It was one of 16 teams out of 6,800 Little League All-Star teams that made it to the World Series in Wil-liamsport, Pennsylvania. Congratulations to Cumberland American for working so hard and for showing such great sportsmanship in the World Series. In my record book, Cumberland American is a champion, not because it drove in the most runs or caught the most fly balls, but be-cause of the dedication and respect and sportsmanship they showed while play-ing this great game. Little League baseball is more than a game. It's an enrichment activity that fosters community spirit and helps young people develop critical skills. The coaches, sponsors, Little League officials, and parents who cheered from the stands all played valuable roles in making Cumberland American a suc-cess and providing a safe and nurturing environment for these young people to grow. Thank you to all who made this pos- sible. Again, my congratulations to each of our Cumberland American Lit-tle League Baseball players. CUMBERLAND , RHODE ISLAND McCormick. Coaches: Dave Belisle; Chris Gold; Matt Wright. f AMERICAN JOBS ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WEST). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 5, 2011, the gen-tleman from California (Mr. G ARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 min- utes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I suspect that all of us, all 435 of us, went back to our districts during the August recess. Now, I would suspect that most every Member of this House heard what I heard. I suspect that all of us who were listening heard the same message: When can I go back to work? When will there be a job for me? I'm going to lose my house because I lost my job. I can't afford to put my kids through school. You guys have got to get the job engine working once again. You've got to get Americans back to work. Well, we are back here at work, and we're probably at the 257th day of this Congress, and yet the Republican ma-jority has yet to put one jobs-creating bill on the floor. Now, they put a lot of bills on the floor, all of which would actually reduce employment. You cut the budgets, you're cutting somebody's job. Fortunately, last week, the President of the United States came before this Congress, stood there where the Speak-er is now standing, and presented to the American people an answer to the question that all of us heard during the recess. And he said: We can and we will put Americans back to work when Con-gress acts on this jobs act. The American Jobs Act is now before the United States Congress and the United States Senate, and it's time for us to act so that Americans can go back to work. Some say we could delay until after the next election. It will be 17 months\u2014just short of a year and a half\u2014before the next Congress will be in session and we will be able to pass legislation. There is not an unem-ployed American in this Nation that can or wants to wait 17 months to get a job. We have the opportunity today to put Americans back to work with the American Jobs Act. The American Jobs Act works. It works. Americans can immediately go back to work as soon as that legisla-tion is passed by this House and the Senate and put on the President's desk. This afternoon, we're going to take maybe an hour with my colleagues to talk about various parts of the Amer-ican Jobs Act, and we're going to start right now with the Representative from Illinois. J AN, if you would join us, you talked earlier about this very eloquently on the steps of the Capitol. Please share with us. b1510 Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Let me add a personal twist to all of this about jobs. When I grew up in Chicago\u2014I was the daughter of a furniture salesman and a Chicago public schoolteacher\u2014the American Dream was alive and well. On my dad's modest income, we could afford a little house in a quiet, middle class neighborhood. Back then, a man could work in the steel mills on Chicago's South Side\u2014 one good union job with family health care benefits and a decent pension\u2014and really live a middle class life. The fam-ily could own a home and buy a car and even send the kids to college. That was the 1950s, and anything seemed possible if you were willing to work hard. In-comes were going up for everyone. In-come inequality was shrinking, and Americans were experiencing the greatest growth in living standards in history. For most working families, that American Dream was in reach, and that was the normal. But today, after decades of attacks on organized labor, the passage of tax policies that favor wealthy individuals and corporations, the growing dis-parity of income, the squandering of a VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6169 September 14, 2011 budget surplus, and the turning of a blind eye to Wall Street greed and recklessness, that dream is drowning in a sea of joblessness. I feel like the Re-publicans are pushing this as the new normal: that the rich get richer and the rest of the country gets poorer. Fortunately, our President, President Barack Obama, has made it perfectly clear that we are not helpless in the face of our daunting but man-made economic challenges, and he has pro-posed a jobs bill that will immediately improve people's lives and jump-start the economy. The answer to this jobs crisis is sur- prisingly simple. If you want to create jobs, then create jobs, good jobs\u2014jobs that can provide people with a middle class life, that can rebuild our middle class, jobs like the 35,000 schools that under the President's bill will be re-paired. There are children all over this coun- try right now who are sitting in class-rooms where the ceilings are crum-bling, that have dangerous asbestos in them, that are leaking energy, that don't have the wiring for the new tech-nologies that our children need to suc-ceed in this world and to get those 21st century jobs. We don't have the kind of schools and classrooms in which our children are going to be able to com-pete in this 21st century world. At the same time, we have hundreds and thou-sands of construction workers and elec-tricians and boilermakers and mainte-nance workers who are jobless right now, who are sitting home, unem-ployed, who are more than willing to roll up their sleeves and give our schoolchildren the kind of classrooms that they deserve. So here we have a tremendous need, and we have the people who can answer that need. Not only will they be back to work, but it will jump-start our economy and be good for everyone. It is not rocket science. We can do this, and we need to do it now. As the President said, the election isn't until 14 months from now. The Republicans seem to want to adjudicate this issue at that time, but this isn't about politics. This is about all those families who simply want a job. They don't want to be re-ceiving unemployment benefits. As a matter of fact, they want to pay taxes. If we want to reduce the deficit, jobs are the answer once again. Jobs equal deficit reduction. That's why we can't wait to pass this American Jobs Act. We need to enlist the help of all Ameri-cans to call their Members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats\u2014I'm talk-ing about the people out there regard-less of party\u2014to say, ''We need to pass this right now.'' This is the way that we can get back to what the normal was when I was growing up, when there was opportunity. People lived a middle class life. Instead, we're watching that middle class disappear and that Amer-ican Dream slip through our fingers. The economy needs to be revived. The President has the answer. We need to do it now. Mr. GARAMENDI. I thank the gen- tlelady from Illinois who speaks so elo-quently on this. As you were talking about the schools, 44 percent of the principals across this Nation say clearly that their schools are not up to the standard that they want to have their own chil-dren in. In the classrooms, paint on the walls is falling off and bathrooms are inadequate, playgrounds and the like. There are 35,000 schools across this country that can be repaired, that can be rebuilt\u2014new classrooms, science classrooms, upgrading the Internet sys-tems in these schools, and the play-grounds. All of that is possible. How correct you are when you say there are men and women out there who are ready to do that work. These are a lot of jobs. This isn't heavy equipment work. This is heavy ''person power'' work. Let's put these people to work. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. May I say one more thing about it? Mr. GARAMENDI. Please. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. These are jobs that can be created right away. I'm from the Midwest, so we actually have a construction season; but for fixing schools, you can do that around the year, around the calendar. We can put these people to work within a few months. They can be on the job, earn-ing money. This is such a sensible pro-gram. Mr. GARAMENDI. Actually, in dis- cussing this with the administration, the day the bill is signed, the schools can begin the work because the admin-istrative process is very straight-forward. This is a very, very important one. We're talking 35,000 schools, per-haps several hundred thousand or a couple hundred thousand men and women going to work immediately to repair our schools. Wouldn't that give us community pride? My school is get-ting repaired. It's getting a paint job. The toilets are getting fixed and the classroom, the science classroom. This is community pride. This is American pride in our most basic of in-vestments\u2014the investment in our chil-dren. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. The sign you have there says that poor conditions of their schools interfere with students' learning. So we are also depriving our children of that sense of pride that will motivate them to be good students, to learn, to be ready to take over in this 21st century job market. Mr. GARAMENDI. One of my favorite subjects is Making It In America. The way the legislation is written, when that gallon of paint, when that heat-ing/air-conditioning system or the playground equipment is brought to the school, it's going to be made in America. It's going to be made in America because the legislation that the President brought to us says that the money will be used to buy equip-ment made in America. I notice that our colleague from Maryland, D ONNA EDWARDS , has joined us. I know we were talking earlier about some of your favorite subjects. I be-lieve it was infrastructure. So please, if you will, D ONNA , join us in this con- versation. Ms. EDWARDS. I want to thank the gentleman because I think that we've received some rather sobering news about the state of America and the state of American workers\u2014the state of Americans. It is that here we are at a time when we've reached the highest poverty rates in 52 years in this country, where median incomes are down lower than they've been in a generation\u20147 percent less, in fact, than what median incomes were even in 1999\u2014where nearly a third of African American families in this country live in poverty, where millions upon millions of children in this coun-try go to bed hungry because they live in poverty, because their families\u2014 their parents\u2014don't have a chance for a job and an opportunity. I think that that should be sobering news for us, not as Democrats and Re-publicans; it should be sobering news for us as Americans. That's why, when I heard President Obama in this House speaking to the American people about the need to create jobs right now, I know what I heard was a message that said: I suppose with the politics we could politic this out for 14 months, that we could fight amongst ourselves as Democrats and Republicans for 14 months, that we could in the political arena just raise millions and millions of dollars to run campaign ads and make annoying phone calls to people across this country for 14 months\u2014or we could take a different path. b1520 We could take a path that's really about creating jobs and opportunities for people who are living in poverty, for Americans who want to work right now. I had a really interesting experience for me over the break that the Con-gress had. I visited the new Martin Lu-ther King, Jr., memorial with my mother\u2014my mother, who was born at the beginning of the Depression, my mother, who lived in a community in North Carolina where she would visit the local town and had segregated water fountains, where people really struggled. They were farmers who struggled greatly to put food on the table. On the way to the Martin Luther King, Jr., memorial, we passed the me-morial to FDR. I saw there the statues representing people who were standing in employment lines and in food lines, and I saw the words of that wonderful President who recognized that he had to get beyond the politics to a point where we were creating jobs, not just meaningless jobs, but jobs that were about rebuilding the Nation's infra-structure, that were about putting peo-ple to work so that they could put food on their tables so that they could make a contribution to this country. VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6170 September 14, 2011 So as I walked, as we walked from the FDR memorial over to the Martin Luther King, Jr., memorial, I said to myself that the United States right now, in this time of great need, with 14 million people unemployed, that we need an FDR moment, that the Amer-ican people need an FDR moment and that that moment has to be about cre-ating jobs for people right here in America, for rebuilding our manufac-turing sector, for investing in research and development and innovation and creativity, for taking those 150,000 bridges across this country that are falling apart. And I know when I drive over a bridge, I don't say, Is this a Republican bridge or is this a Democratic bridge? What I say is, Is this a bridge that I can get my car over that waterway safely? And when I look at that bridge and I see the steel beams, I know that those are steel beams manufactured by people right here in the United States. When I look at the asphalt and the cement that covers that bridge, I see work that took place right here in the United States. When I look at those bridges and these 150,000 bridges all across the country that need to be re-built by hardworking Americans, what I see are the light posts up by the bridge with the electricity running through them or the solar panels on them that are put there and built there by American workers. So when the President says to pass the American Jobs Act right away, the reason he is saying that is because those are jobs right now for hard-working Americans who actually want to work hard, building things in this country, rebuilding all of our infra-structure, our bridges, our roadways, our water and sewer systems that are falling apart. They want to do this. I think it's really incumbent on us to do it, and I think that the American people ought to hold each and every one of us to account for failing to do it. I note, as Mr. G ARAMENDI is showing here and that we will see, that nearly 2 million construction workers across this country are unemployed. When our colleague, J ANSCHAKOWSKY from Illi- nois, talks about the 35,000 schools that need to be reconstructed for the 21st century so that our young people can learn in a 21st-century learning envi-ronment, it is not just because it feels good but because it will make a dif-ference to our own competitiveness for the 21st century. What I know is that those are those 2 million construction workers who are unemployed across this country who can do that work in our schools, in their communities. So I think that this is a real impera- tive, and I would just urge our col-leagues to look beyond the D and an R and look to a job for the American peo-ple who are asking us to do this for them, but also to do this for us. I don't know how it is that we survive in a global economy when we are not pro-ducing anything, when we are not put-ting our people back to work, when we are not engaged in rebuilding all of our infrastructure that was decades in the making from FDR and beyond and is now falling apart. I owe that to my mother and my grandmother and my grandfather for the generation that did all of that for us. We owe it to them not to allow it to fall apart. So I say, yes, let's pass the American Jobs Act now. Mr. GARAMENDI. Representative E DWARDS , thank you so very much for your compassion and passion for these issues. Bringing FDR, the monument, and Martin Luther King together around this set of issues is really im-portant. This is the worst economy since the Great Depression, and I remember on one of those plaques at the FDR memo-rial\u2014and I may get this wrong a little bit\u2014but he said, we measure our progress not by those who have much could have more, but by those who have little have enough. He had the compassion. Last week, the President brought to us an answer to the compelling ques-tion that we hear\u2014what are you going to do about jobs?\u2014the American Jobs Act. You spoke so eloquently about the infrastructure\u2014the streets, the bridges, the schools\u2014and that 2 million construction workers are out of jobs. The President has proposed a $50 bil-lion immediate infusion of money into America's infrastructure\u2014into our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our airports. There is $50 billion avail-able this year to put Americans back to work. It's not just the construction workers that will have those jobs, because these people will be able to keep their homes. They will be able to buy their food; they will be able to bring that money back into their economy with what is called the multiplier effect. And so that $50 billion may run through the economy three times, two and a half times, so that instead of 2 million, maybe it will be 3 million that will get their jobs. I know that you want to add to this, Ms. E DWARDS . Ms. EDWARDS. Thank you for that. I just want to remind our colleagues that for every $1 billion, $1 billion that we invest in repairing the Nation's in-frastructure, we create 35,000 jobs: $1 billion, 35,000 jobs. So the multiplier effect is really tre- mendous. It is the construction worker on the site, but it's also the canteen truck that drives up\u2014that's the small business person at that site. It's the en-gineers and all of the technicians who develop that amazing engineering for these construction sites. It's the archi-tects who are designing a revamped school in a neighborhood to educate our children to compete in the 21st cen-tury. So $1 billion equals 35,000 jobs. Mr. GARAMENDI. There you have it. That's when we have the opportunity if we act now. If this Chamber, empty but for three of us and our staffs here and the desk crew, were to act tomorrow on the legislation that the President has brought before us\u2014it's in proper form; it's before us\u2014we could take it up, and these people, all that you talked about, could be at work in the next couple of weeks. That's the possibility. Ms. E DWARDS , thank you so much for joining us and for your eloquence and for your determination to make this happen. Our friend from Tennessee (Mr. C OHEN ) has joined us. Please share with us your thoughts from middle America. b1530 Mr. COHEN. Thank you, and I appre- ciate your leading this hour. Just last week, the President stood just behind where you're standing and addressed this Congress\u2014bipartisan, bi-cameral, Senators and House Mem-bers\u2014and laid out a plan to fix this economy. Pass this bill, he said. And we need to pass the bill. The President and his team have put a lot of work into it. People want jobs. They want to work. In my district, there are more unem- ployed. Every weekend when I go out in my district, people come up to me and tell me they are either looking for a job, have lost their job and are look-ing for a job. We need to find ways to put those people to work. We are work-ing on ways to make schools better. Building infrastructure which is so im-portant to Memphis, Tennessee, where we have rails, roads, rivers, and run-ways, the distribution center of Amer-ica, is so important. And if you put the money in infrastructure, which this plan plans on, Make It In America, if you do infrastructure, it's got to be made in America. You can't export those jobs overseas, and you put people to work immediately. What they are building are avenues that make com-merce move and work. Federal Express moves more pack- ages around the world than any other American company, and Memphis International Airport is the largest American cargo airport in the world. We create jobs by putting money into infrastructure. Teachers, policemen, and firefighters, 3 million kept their jobs because of the recovery bill that we passed that did successfully help this country stay out of a great depres-sion. Sometimes, Mr. G ARAMENDI , I'm amazed at the rhetoric that you hear from some people, particularly from the other side, who blithely tell people that the American Recovery and Rein-vestment Act was $770 billion that didn't make a difference. The fact is that 40 percent of the American Recov-ery and Reinvestment Act, so as to pass the Senate where we needed Sen-ator C OLLINS ' and Senator S NOWE 's votes, were the Republican endorsed and loved tax cuts. How can they talk out of both sides of their mouth and say that a bill, 40 percent of which\u2014 which means over $300 billion of tax VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep HOUSE H6171 September 14, 2011 cuts\u2014didn't do any good, because now all they talk about is tax cuts. But when the President of the United States proposes and the Congress with him in a bipartisan effort passes tax cuts\u2014and I'm not sure that the Amer-ican Recovery and Reinvestment Act was bipartisan. That was strictly Democrats. But when we passed tax cuts with a few Republicans in the Sen-ate, in their minds, it didn't create any jobs. But when they propose tax cuts, this is Christopher Columbus' new way to find the New World. Well, it's hypo-critical. We need to support our President be- cause he is the President. There isn't a red America and a blue America. There is, as he said in his speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention, the United States of America. People need to un-derstand that. We need to be here for that red, white, and blue flag, for this country, to put this country back to work, to keep it as the most competi-tive country in the world so we don't fall behind China and India in engi-neering and science, and coming up with programs that give our children an opportunity to be able to fill the jobs of the 21st century\u2014the green jobs that the President has proposed that are the jobs of the 21st century, and the technology jobs that we haven't done a good enough job in filling, giving money to colleges to do the research for industry to create jobs. In our caucus yesterday, we had Jo- seph Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize winning economist. I read Krugman a lot, a Nobel Prize winning economist. Both say basically the same thing: The aus-terity programs proposed by the other side don't work. They've used them in Japan; didn't work. Greece, England, didn't work\u2014unless you're in the upper 1 percent. If you wear a crown and you're the queen or the prince or the leaders of whatever, it works. But in this country, we don't have that kind of royalty, but we're starting to have a separate society with the upper 1 per-cent who the Republican Party won't raise their taxes no matter what, and the rest. The President is right. We need to think about the whole country. We need to come together as a United States of America, not a red, a blue, a Democrat or Republican, and create jobs. The President's plan, over half of it, is tax cuts. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle say we can go for what we like there even though they said it didn't work when the President and the Democrats passed it in the Recovery Act, but they can't go for the infra-structure jobs that, of course, help businesses\u2014trucking businesses, the airline industry, and the transpor-tation industry. Automobiles and trucks have to have highways. So we need to pass this. I support the President. I took an oath to do what I could to make this country better. We need to come to-gether now because this is a crisis time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. C OHEN , thank you so very much. Your experience from the great Midwest, along Amer-ica's great river, is really important for us to understand. We really have an opportunity here right now. This legislation is before Congress and the Senate, and we have an opportunity for a better deal for America. It's an investment in Amer-ica. We talked about the infrastruc-ture. That's an investment that will last for 50 to 100 years because it's in the ground. It's the roads, the sanita-tion system. It's also a critical invest-ment in tomorrow's workers, in our children. The American Jobs Act has money for 280,000 teachers; 280,000 teachers will be able to stay on the job. Right now in California, teachers are getting laid off as they are in most other States of this Nation. That means that classroom sizes are going up, and the educational opportunity for our chil-dren is diminishing. We have no more important investment. Roads are im-portant and bridges are important, but the most important investment in any society, in any economy is the invest-ment in education, in the children, in tomorrow's workforce. 280,000 teachers will be able to stay in the classroom. This money flows directly to the school districts, not a big administrative task at all but one that goes there directly. Small businesses. Our Republican colleagues love to talk about small businesses, and they say, correctly, most jobs are created by small busi-nesses. That's true. That's accurate. Sixty-four percent of the new jobs over the past 15 years were created by small businesses. But what are they doing for small businesses? Cutting the con-tracts that the small businesses depend upon as they push an austerity budget. The American Jobs Act takes a dif- ferent path. It tells small businesses: You get an immediate tax break; 3.1 percent of your payroll tax will be eliminated in the next year. That's a lot of money, and I'll explain how much it is. In addition to that, if you hire a long-term unemployed worker, your entire payroll tax will disappear. Let me tell you what that means. Let's take a warehouse. You've got warehouses in your dis- trict? Mr. COHEN. We've got lots of ware- houses. They're full of goods ready to go on Federal Express planes and serv-ice the rest of this Nation. It all starts in Memphis, Tennessee, and goes out from there. Mr. GARAMENDI. I thought they might have some of that Tennessee whiskey in them. Some of that, too? Mr. COHEN. Some of that, too. Mr. GARAMENDI. So a warehouse with a payroll last year of $7 million that this year hires 40 new workers, it would add $2 million to its payroll. It would get a full refund of the 6.2 per-cent payroll taxes paid on the $2 mil-lion of payroll. How much is that? That's $124,000 that goes immediately to the bottom line of that warehouse. In addition to that, they have already seen a 3.1 percent reduction\u2014actually, it's a 50 percent reduction in their pay-roll tax for workers who were already there, and that's another $155,000. So we are looking here at $279,000 of re-duced expenses, taxes, to that com-pany. That means that they can im-prove the warehouse. That means they can expand or hire more workers. This is in the President's American jobs pro-gram specifically for small businesses. Listen up, America. Listen up busi- nesses out there. There is an oppor-tunity here for you to immediately ex-pand your business, reduce your pay-roll taxes, hire new workers, bringing a new worker on that has been on long- term unemployment and paying no payroll taxes for the next year. This is very, very important and very big, and it is immediately available as soon as the leadership, the Republican leader-ship in this House, brings the American jobs bill to the floor. Mr. C OHEN , if you would like to carry on here, I know you have some more thoughts. b1540 Mr. COHEN. Well, just the whole prospect. Jobs are so important. I was thinking back about Stiglitz. I think you were there at the caucus. He and Krugman say the same thing, that there's several ways you can get your-self out of this deficit. He went back into a little bit of history about how during the Clinton years we had a big deficit from the Reagan-Bush years and that President Clinton, with a bill that was passed in this Congress with all Democrat votes in about 1994, I think, put us on a road to balance the budget, and got us a surplus. It got us a surplus by the time President Clinton left of-fice. Stiglitz said, which is so true\u2014it's a factoid\u2014the surplus was lost because of two wars, one of which was a volunteer war, not related to 9/11\u2014Iraq\u2014and Af-ghanistan, that were both passed through these Congresses, which were Republican-controlled, Republican Congresses, without being funded. Then the Bush tax cuts giving the wealthiest people the largest tax cuts and contrib-uting to the largest disparity in wealth that we've ever had in this Nation. Now, the wealthy can only spend so much. There are only so many Chanel purses a woman can buy. There are only so many Rolex watches a guy can have, but we are losing a middle class. Then we put all this wealth through these tax cuts on the richest, making their tax rates the lowest since the 1950s, and then extended it for 2 years, the inheritance tax, to where the wealthy get to keep more and more in perpetuity. The middle class is disappearing in this country. Jobs are being shipped overseas. Taxes stay high on them. They're living paycheck to paycheck. They've got their children in school. Pell Grants are in danger. They almost VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6172 September 14, 2011 were reduced in the last month or two, but we salvaged them in the final bill. People are having trouble making ends meet, and the middle class has got to be there to be a consumer group. If you don't have consumers, you can't have an economy to service people who are making goods and services. You've got to have a customer. We're losing the customer base. We can ship all the jobs we want off to Southeast Asia and China, where they don't pay any salaries and don't give any benefits; but those people aren't our market, and if our people can't buy goods, then we're not going to have any manufacturing base and the opportunity to make it in America. So we've got to build up the middle class. We've got to produce jobs, and we've got to see to it that the middle class is given priority and not the rich-est 1 percent. The President's plan, which is so great, is it's all paid for. It's paid for. But paid for by a tax that's appropriate for the people who can afford it. Tell us how we can deal with that and keep this as a paid-for program. Mr. GARAMENDI. I've been kind of shuffling the boards down here because you went through several subjects along the way, and each one is so ter-ribly important and pertinent to the issue. But I think I can wrap it all up in this, and that is, America lost about 50 percent of its manufacturing jobs in the last 20, 25 years. We went from 20 million, 21 million manufacturing jobs to just over 10 million today, but we can once again rebuild the American manufacturing sector. That's where the middle class jobs are. You had talked about tax policy, that the tax policy has shifted from one that was broad based and which the wealthy and everybody participated in in a progressive mechanism in which now the wealthy\u2014and Warren Buffett has said it so very well\u2014he actually pays a lower tax rate than does his sec-retary. He said, This is wrong. This is upside down and wrong. And he's quite correct. But if we take a look at the manufacturing sector of America and we apply a couple of principles, that is, that we're going to buy American\u2014and this has to do with our policies here. Trade policies. We've been giving it away in these international trade deals. On the taxes, we just talked about that. The tax burden has shifted from the wealthy down to the middle class, further eroding the purchasing power and the status of the middle class, so much so that just yesterday the Bureau of Labor Statistics came out with a report that the poverty level in America has reached the high-est level in 52 years. That's the pushing down of the American middle class so that those at the bottom have been pushed out of the middle class into poverty. Mr. COHEN. Out of six adults\u2014think about that\u2014one out of six adults. Now this body of which I am extremely proud to be a Member is not represent-ative of America. Because if it were, one out of six, or 74 people, would be earning $22,000 a year or less for a fam-ily of four. So that doesn't happen. One out of five children in this country is now living in poverty\u2014they're in my district\u2014and people can't get along without having a job. Mr. GARAMENDI. Exactly right. Twenty-two million children living in poverty, not knowing where their next meal is going to come from. At the same time, they're cutting the food programs. This is our program. This is the President's program. Every one of the things that is in the American Jobs Act is here. Taxes. There are tax breaks for businesses. And this entire program is paid for by ending the give-away of our tax money to the oil com-panies. That's $4 billion a year\u2014$40 bil-lion over the next decade\u2014of our tax money going to support the oil indus-try, the wealthiest industry in this world. Mr. COHEN. How about the hedge fund guys? There's another Steve Cohen. There's the one in New York that's got all the money, the hedge fund guy, billions and billions of dol-lars. What does he pay on his income? Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, he pays 15 percent. Somehow or another they got into the law. The hedge fund folks that are making hundreds of millions of dol-lars a year\u2014in some cases, billions\u2014 are paying 15 percent on their income. Now they've got it classified as capital gains when, in fact, it's their labor. That is, it's their work. As you and I are working here and as people are working in the manufacturing plants, it's their work, but it's taxed at 15 per-cent, not at 35 or 38 percent. What's that all about? Where are we going to end that tax break? That's about $17 billion over 10 years. Mr. COHEN. And that shouldn't exist. That's absurd. There's another Steve Cohen, the magician, and appar-ently he had something to do with the Tax Code when they took care of the other Steve Cohen. Mr. GARAMENDI. So taxes are part of it. The energy policy, we haven't talk about that. We talked about labor\u2014putting men and women back to work. And the education system, 280,000 new teachers or teachers in the classroom. Research and infrastruc-ture, this is part of the Make it in America agenda which can be carried out with the American Jobs Act. So, if we pass the American Jobs Act, we've got a really good opportunity to once again make things in America, because the legislation calls for about $50 billion in infrastructure and the es-tablishment of an infrastructure bank for sanitation, water systems, Internet, high-speed cable, and all of those kinds of things in the infrastructure bank. So we may be looking at $60 billion, $70 billion a year of investment in these infrastructure projects. Coupled with that is Buy America, Make it in Amer-ica. Buy American-made buses, Amer- ican-made locomotives. The concrete and steel in the bridges, that's going to be American made. I can tell you one of the greatest hor- ror stories about infrastructure. It's right in San Francisco, just outside my district. The San Francisco Bay Bridge, a multibillion-dollar rebuilding of the Bay Bridge because it falls down in an earthquake. It did once. We don't want it to happen again. Multibillion dollars. To save 10 percent, the con-tract went to Chinese steel companies. All of the steel manufacturing in that bridge comes from China. Thousands of jobs in China. And to make things worse, the inspectors were over there, and they didn't do a good job. Beyond that, when the bridge parts came over here, Chinese workers came with the bridge. No more of that. We're going to make it in America. I've got a bill in\u2014others are working on this\u2014and that is, if it's American taxpayer money, by God, it's going to be used to buy American taxpayer goods and services. We can do this, and the first step is the American Jobs Act. Mr. COHEN. You mention on there\u2014 I looked at your chart\u2014education. Part of the American Jobs Act is to rebuild our schools and to go to work and make them structurally sound and also energy efficient. When you look at labor, it's work. The labor movement has been attacked all over this coun-try, and it's labor who's created the middle class and seen to it they got good jobs and opportunities and wages and benefits. In my community, we just had a gro- cery store taken over by a large na-tional grocery store. A grocery store from another city had come in and taken over some local owners. One man worked there for 44 years. He'd been making $9.85 an hour and working 40 hours a week. They came in and said, You can work 16 hours. You'll get $7.50 an hour. You won't get your benefits that you had accumulated, and you'll go to another store. He quit. They did a lot of employees that way. What happened yesterday? Help in- form me. Because I heard this, and it's difficult to believe: Bank of America, did they make something like $7 bil-lion last year? And how many people did they lay off yesterday? b1550 Mr. GARAMENDI. They're talking about laying off 40,000 people across America in the next year. Mr. COHEN. So how does that jibe with what we hear from the other side about just trust business to hire peo-ple, that the jobs come from business and the private sector? They're making $7.8 billion. They benefited from the TARP\u2014a President Bush/Secretary Paulson plan that I supported in a bipartisan manner that kept Bank of America alive. I think they're on the hook, maybe, since some Federal recent action considering their loans and all. But $7 billion, and VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep HOUSE H6173 September 14, 2011 they're laying off 30,000 to 40,000 peo- ple? Those people are going to need un-employment benefits, and it's not be-cause they don't want a job. They've been put out. A lot of qualified people who can do jobs and are intelligent don't have jobs because they are not there. But the people at the top are making more money than ever. They're eating at Masa in New York. They're eating the $500 dinner at the Japanese restaurant and not thinking twice about it, and they're firing people right and left. The limousines are still moving. The wealthy are still doing whatever they've been doing. They've got their jets\u2014not the football team\u2014their pri-vate jets. They're living great, but the American Dream is disappearing. The American Dream disappeared for my grocery workers. It's disappearing for Bank of America employees. It's dis-appearing for a lot of people. Mr. GARAMENDI. The American public, through the TARP program, bailed out Wall Street, bailed out the banks, and the banks have done noth-ing. The big Wall Street banks have done nothing except enrich themselves at the expense of the American tax-payer. Those days should be over. We need to move in a different direction. One of the groups we really need to help are those men and women that have been fighting the wars. Now, my personal view is that the war in Af-ghanistan ought to stop tomorrow. We ought to bring that $120 billion a year that we're spending in Afghanistan, bring it back here, invest it in America in education and bridges, infrastruc-ture and debt relief; 120 billion a year in Afghanistan, and we're still spend-ing a vast amount of money in Iraq. End those wars, bring that money home. Bring the soldiers home. And when we do, we're bringing home a lot of wounded Americans, wounded Amer-icans who need our respect and who need jobs. In the American Jobs Act there is a special place for veterans, special ad-vantage. They deserve it. They're the ones that have sacrificed. They're the ones that took time out of their lives to fight those wars. Whatever we may think about those wars, we can only think good thoughts and honor the vet-erans, and here's a way to do it. There are 877,000 unemployed vet- erans in America today\u2014nearly 1 mil-lion; 877,000 looking for work. In the American Jobs Act, there is a very spe-cial tax credit available to any em-ployer who hires a veteran. You can re-duce your taxes by $5,600 right off the bottom, $5,600 tax credit\u2014not a deduc-tion, but a credit. And if you happen to hire one of those wounded vets\u2014and we know them, we've seen their pictures, we know what post-traumatic stress syndrome is all about\u2014hire a wounded vet, and it's a $9,600 tax credit to every employer, whomever it happens to be, across this Nation. Now that's what we need to do. All the talk about balancing the budget, all the talk about a deficit hasn't put one person to work in Amer- ica; in fact, it has laid off hundreds of thousands of people. We need to put America back to work. The American Jobs Act does that, and it does it in a very special way. For those Americans that have been out there sacrificing in Iraq, in Afghanistan it gives them an opportunity. It gives every employer an incentive to hire those workers. We owe it to these men and women. And when these men and women go back to work, they become taxpayers. And when men and women in America go back to work and become taxpayers, then the deficit will be resolved, then we will solve the deficit. We need to make cuts, we need to do those things, but those are in the out years. Right now, it is about jobs. The President has given us the legislation. The question for our Republican lead-ership here is\u2014they control this House; they're the ones that set the agenda; they're the only ones that can bring a bill to the floor\u2014When will you bring the American Jobs Act to this floor so that we can put Americans back to work? Mr. C OHEN , I know how deeply you feel about this. I know that in your dis-trict your people that you represent are hurting. They want jobs. We're going to wrap this up in just a few moments. So for our closing re-marks, go for it. Mr. COHEN. Thank you, Mr. G ARAMENDI . Every weekend I'm home\u2014and the weeks that I'm home, because we're home many weeks now, this Congress doesn't work them very much. We spend a lot of time at home. And that's a beautiful thing for us, but not a great thing for America because we need to be here, working on trying to get a jobs bill passed, which hasn't been intro-duced by the majority yet. But Professor Stiglitz talked about the causes of the loss of the surplus that President Clinton and the Demo-cratic Congress got in the late part of the 20th century. It was the two wars\u2014 voted for by this Congress, supported by President Bush, the Bush tax cuts\u2014 passed by this Congress, proposed by President Bush; and Medicare part D, President Bush's Medicare plan to take care of the insurance companies. That's what did it. Those were the causes. Professor Stiglitz, and he has a lady that works with him\u2014I think her name is Linda Bilmes\u2014they've studied what it's going to cost in America in the years to come with the veterans. Now, the ones we can employ, we need to employ. But 1 to 2 percent are going to come back disabled, and they're going to need veteran services and they're going to need money for the rest of their lives. So these wars, particularly the Iraq war\u2014President Bush and the Republican Congress' war\u2014is going to cost this country for another 70 years, at minimum; and we need to be pre-pared for that. We need to come together. And there's no question that when Pro-fessor Stiglitz said, when you can bor- row money at like 1 or 2 percent and make a greater percentage on it, this is the time that you borrow because rates are so low. And the top people in eco-nomics say this whole idea of the aus-terity and the cut is wrong. What does it do? It helps the wealthy because they're immune to it. The benefit for the low-cost labor they get overseas and the salaries they get here, they get great tax rates, helps them. But what else does it help? It helps what Senator M CCONNELL said was the number one job of this Congress the first day after President Obama was elected, to defeat President Obama. That's what Senator M ITCH MCCONNELL said was the number one priority that he had. He's a focused man. I admire him for the fact that he gets an issue and he stays on it and he's focused. And he thought that and thinks that when he works on the debt ceiling, when he works on the deficit, when he works on the American Jobs Act. It's all about one thing\u2014not employing Americans, but taking two Americans, Barack Obama and J OEBIDEN, and making them unemployed. That's not appropriate. Mr. GARAMENDI. We have a dif- ferent view here. I'm confident that the President will be reelected because he understands very clearly that we need to put Americans back to work, And he has given us the American Jobs Act\u2014 complete legislation. All the sections are there. All the writing is done. All the legal work is done. It is now before the United States Congress and the Senate, and it's up to us, 435 of us in this House. Are we ready to act? Are we ready to do what Americans want us to do? And that is to put them back to work. Mr. COHEN. Pass the bill. Mr. GARAMENDI. Pass the bill. Pass the bill. Put Americans back to work. I'm going to quickly go through some of the parts of this bill and the way in which they affect Americans. It's about investment, investing in our infrastructure: $50 billion directly available for the transportation sec-tor\u2014rail, high-speed rail, intercity rail, bridges, roads, $50 billion available this year to put men and women back to work repairing our transportation in-frastructure. Another $10 billion for an infrastructure bank in which the pen-sion funds of America, the public pen-sion funds, could invest. And perhaps another $20 billion or $30 billion in that infrastructure bank to once again aug-ment the development of the infra-structure that we need\u2014water systems, sanitation systems, all of those com-munications systems that we des-perately need. b1600 That's on the infrastructure side. On the education side, repairing our schools: Thirty-five thousand schools to be re- paired, repainted, classrooms, science laboratories, as well as the play-grounds; 35,000 schools out there. Your VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6174 September 14, 2011 neighborhood school, the opportunity for it to have a new paint job, a new bathroom, whatever is needed; 280,000 teachers. You could fill the entire stadium in Ann Arbor, Michi-gan, football, 100,000, and still have a third game with only 80,000 people. 280,000, think of it. The Ann Arbor, Michigan, stadium filled 2.8 times over. Teachers in the classroom. This is ex-citing. Veterans, a very powerful incentive where a business can reduce its tax burden. That is the bottom-line tax re-duced by $9,600 when you hire a dis-abled veteran. That man, that woman is going back to work, becoming a tax-payer. Once again, pride in our Nation. This is powerful. For the unemployed, an extension of unemployment benefits, and we didn't even get to that today\u2014and all of this in the context of rebuilding the Amer-ican manufacturing sector. More than 10 million American man- ufacturing jobs have been lost in the last two decades. We can put them back to work if we use our public pol-icy, use our tax money that's going to build those bridges or those roads, buses and locomotives, use our tax money to buy American-made, Amer-ican-made equipment. All it takes is a law, and it works. Sacramento, California, near where I live, has built\u2014or Siemens, a German company, has built a major manufac-turing plant in Sacramento, California, to manufacture light railcars and Am-trak locomotives. Why did they do that? They did that because the American Recovery Act, the stimulus bill that our Republican colleagues like to trash, said that the money for transportation systems\u2014 buses, light rail, and trains\u2014must be spent on American-made equipment. So Siemens said, well, if that's the law, we want the business. They built the plant, and they're manufacturing light rail cars and locomotives today in America, using American equipment, using American workers. That's what we can do if we are willing to pass the laws to make it in America. Photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, all of these things supported with our tax dollars. Why not use those tax dol-lars to buy American-made solar cells and wind turbines? The President has given us the oppor- tunity to do what we should do, as rep-resentatives of the American people. Put Americans back to work. Pass the American Jobs Act. Pass the American Jobs Act. Mr. C OHEN , wrap this up for us. Mr. COHEN. I just thank you, Mr. GARAMENDI , for the leadership and for putting this hour together and allow-ing me to join you. And let's say it to-gether. Pass the bill. Mr. GARAMENDI. Pass the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f OUR COUNTRY IS IN TROUBLE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of Jan-uary 5, 2011, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G OHMERT ) is recognized for 60 min- utes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it never ceases to be an honor for me to be able to speak on this floor. The freedoms we have, the blessings, we've received be-cause of those who've gone before us. The country is in trouble. People around the world cannot believe that the greatest nation in the history of mankind just cannot make itself live within its means. So businesses, manu-facturing have flocked away from America. I know there are some who believe that the greatest thing that can hap-pen for America is for those manufac-turing jobs to leave America because they believe, gee, they hurt the envi-ronment because they pollute, so just as well they go to some other Third World country or China or other place, when the truth is, apparently, when those same manufacturing companies leave the United States, they go to na-tions that, on average, pollute, depend-ing on the nations, 4 to 10 times more than we do here in the United States. For those that understand the way the world turns, as pollution goes up in Asia, we usually breathe it here in the United States. So that hasn't worked out so well for the environment of the planet. We're hurting the planet as we drive manufacturing jobs out of Amer-ica. This administration has used the EPA as a sword, as a tool to drive more and more manufacturing and produc-tion out of the United States, hurting the country more and more, not be-cause, necessarily, they want to inten-tionally hurt the country. I'm not say-ing that. They just think we're better off. If they're not willing to have a draco- nian EPA being, as the President said in his speech, working side by side with them in private business, good rid-dance. Go somewhere else. Because, in the President's own words, that's what he said, and it was the scariest thing I heard that the President said last week, standing right here at the second level in this Hall, the line, and I'll read from his speech directly. He said, ''We need to look for ways to work side by side with America's businesses.'' America's businesses do not need a government that wants to be their partner. The government in this coun-try, according to the Constitution, metaphorically speaking, is supposed to be a referee\u2014keep the playing field fair, keep it level, make sure every-body has a chance to compete and com-pete fairly, and stay out of the way. Do not interfere. Don't try to be a partner with business. Stay out of the way and be a referee. It's when this United States Govern- ment has tried to be a partner that so often it gets in trouble, and it kills businesses and it kills jobs, and people flee and go to some other country where they're allowed to produce things without the government trying to be their partner. Anybody that wants the government to be their partner should go to Ven-ezuela or Third World nations. They're more than happy to partner with those businesses. But some years back there was a group of us that went to China, and we met with a number of CEOs of inter-national corporations that have taken their American jobs by the thousands, taken their businesses, their manufac-turing production and gone to China. I had the feeling that when we talked to them and asked them the question, ''Why did you move all these jobs to China?'' that they would say, well, they just couldn't work with the labor unions. The price of labor was too high. Regulations were too much. But the number one answer was because of the corporate tax. The corporate tax in America, in the United States, is the highest corporate tax in the world. b1610 Now corporations, those that under- stand business law, corporations, direc-tors, and officers, have a fiduciary duty to their stockholders to try to make as much money as they can. Unless some, Mr. Speaker, do not know who the stockholders are, more and more they're union workers; they're Amer-ican workers across their business owners and op-erators, franchise operators; they're the rank and file across the country\u2014 State employees, local employees, Fed-eral employees. But more than that, businesses across America, they have retirement accounts that invest in these companies. Those companies' officers and direc- tors have a fiduciary duty that they have to\u2014or they could be sued\u2014have the best interests of the company and the stockholders at stake in the deci-sions they make. If you go to law school\u2014I hopefully have saved some-body a lot of money\u2014that's it in a nut-shell. So, when a group of corporate leaders is trying to decide how can we avoid being sued by the stockholders by doing the best thing to help them cre-ate the most revenue for their stock\u2014 what can we do? What will enhance their dividends?\u2014they have to look. When they see the United States of America is taxing corporations at 35 percent and they see that China taxes at 17 percent, you would think it was pretty much a no-brainer. That's basi-cally what they said. I was gratified to hear that, whether it's union labor or nonunion labor, across the board, the experience that the corporate leaders that I talked to in China say really their best workers are right here in the United States\u2014 union workers, nonunion workers\u2014and that, generally speaking, they have better quality control over products produced here in the United States of America. So, when they move plants from here in the United States to other VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6175 September 14, 2011 places like China, they have wonderful workers, but the quality control is not as good as what they have here. But if you think about it and you re- alize, gee, they would pay half the cor-porate tax in China that they pay here by the billions, then they could afford to build state-of-the-art facilities, where facilities here in the United States, their manufacturing plants, may be falling apart and getting older. Well, you could go build a state-of-the- art facility in a place like China, and because of the tremendously reduced corporate tax, by the time you really get around to paying much tax, you've paid for the plant. I was advised privately that it was possible the Chinese Government would make deals with some companies if they were big enough, and it might be, for example, they would say, Look, you move your manufacturing plant, hire these thousands of employees here in China instead of in the United States, and we'll make a deal with you. No cor-porate tax for 5 years. Then, depending on the company and the negotiations, they might say, And then for the next 5 years, maybe 5, 7 percent, maybe 10 percent. Maybe then it goes to 17, or maybe by 15 years you get to the 17 percent rate. But in those kind of scenarios, they say, We paid for a state-of-the-art fa-cility by the time we ever get around to paying corporate tax. Whereas, if we kept those jobs in America, facilities getting older, we just can't produce dividends and returns on money for stockholders. We're just treading water. Here, because the corporate rates are half as expensive, then we can produce, we can compete anywhere in the world. Our goods are that much cheaper. Now, it is true our labor is more ex- pensive, but, in general, we have good laborers in this country, and there are Americans that are willing to work, willing to do the jobs. From talking to employers, though, we could use a lot more people willing to be employees who can pass a drug test. That's kind of important. Now, I have had so many constitu- ents say, Look, you have to pass a drug test in order to get employment for most important jobs nowadays, wheth-er it's with a grocery company back home or a small operator. I was talking to an independent oilman this after-noon that drills wells from Longview, Texas, and he was saying, We have to give people drug tests. He was telling me, because of the drilling that's currently going on in east Texas, he's having trouble finding enough workers right now, today. While people are unemployed around the country, he's having trouble right now, today, finding enough people who can pass a drug test and are willing to work hard on an oil well, and he would put them to work. In fact, he was telling me this after- noon, they'd start out at $50,000 a year. They'd have health care. It's hard, dirty, long hours, tough work, but it's a good living. But so many of the peo-ple that apply can't pass a drug test. And because it's such difficult work physically and it requires that you be alert because all of the other people on the rig have to count on each other, kind of like in a military operation, the equipment is so dangerous, if some-body has taken drugs and is not at peak performance, they can get some-body killed. It's happened far too many times. They have to have people pass a drug test. That's just this afternoon. Well, think about it. If we had manufactur-ers coming back into America because the corporate tax rate was less than 17 percent, then the manufacturing jobs show up like crazy. Now, I realize from hearing all of the news, apparently the big emphasis of the national union leaders, who sure don't seem to be speaking to all of the union folks I know, but their emphasis seems to be basically we're not doing very well getting union members from private corporations. So they've gone all after government employees: Let's try to unionize government employees because maybe we can pick them up. And what I think eventually rank- and-file union workers for private com-panies will begin to understand is it seems that they're being thrown under the bus. The concentration seems to be for more government workers, less pri-vate workers, which means they're driving for more jobs in the govern-ment sector, which kills off the private sector, which will kill off those jobs for the union members who have jobs in the private sector. So, as I sat back here listening to the President's speech last Thursday night and as I struggled with what the Presi-dent was saying\u2014because some of it didn't seem to me that it was going to create the jobs he was promising, but I was willing to wait for the bill and not judge from a speech, because it's been said around here before that CBO can-not score a speech. Well, that was be-fore, a couple years ago, when the ad-ministration got on to them, and basi-cally they did score a speech, but that's because the White House is able to exert pressure on CBO that the Re-publicans have not been able to see fit to do. I know Mr. Elmendorf was not happy with my reference, but the fact is, after Mr. Elmendorf met with the President in the woodshed, or the Oval Office, he came back and was able to bring down the scoring of ObamaCare by about a quarter of a trillion dollars or so. Then after ObamaCare passed, they said, Whoops, looks like maybe we under-estimated by about a quarter of a tril-lion dollars. That makes for a pretty big plus-or- minus margin of error when CBO can't do better than that, but CBO and the rules were created by the most liberal Congress in history until about 5 years ago. They created CBO. They created the rules for scoring. They yanked us out of Vietnam without a chance to make sure our allies there would not be killed, so most of them were. They also created an automatic baseline for gov-ernment budgets that increases every year. They created a formula. It in-creases every year. b1620 Now, I was here in '05 and '06, and I am embarrassed that, as Republicans, our party did not have the nerve to eliminate the CBO, to eliminate the ri-diculous rules by which bills are scored. The actual reality and history and recurrent numbers of what hap-pens\u2014when you do this, you get this ef-fect\u2014you can't consider that. They have to use rules that don't apply in the real world and without taking into consideration the effects that have been had when an action is taken every time. So we get terribly inaccurate scoring from a government entity, and we also have this automatic baseline that in-creases every year. There is not a busi-ness or home in America that can plan a budget by saying, We're automati-cally going to increase our budget every year from now on. No matter how much income or revenue we have each year, we're going to keep increas-ing our budget. That is what has been happening for 37 years, since 1974. The Budget chairman back in '05 and '06 was not willing to do it, but I am extremely gratified that our bright chairman of the Budget, this Budget chairman, is going to do it, in that this year he's going to take up a zero base-line budget. I filed one in my first Con-gress back in '05 and '06, in my second Congress in '07 and '08, in my third Congress in '09 and 2010, and in this Congress. I am delighted. I don't care whose name is on the bill; but when we finally eliminate the automatic in-creases in the Federal budgets every year, that's going to be huge, and it's going to be better than anything that the President has proposed by way of producing revenue and balancing the budget. I do appreciate the White House emailing their version of the American Jobs Act. PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY Mr. GOHMERT. If I might inquire of the Speaker, a parliamentary inquiry: If there are charts around on the floor, can anybody use those? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman is free to use charts in debate. Mr. GOHMERT. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, because I saw my friends across the aisle using a chart that said the ''American Jobs Act.'' It makes a wonderful chart if it's still on the floor, because that's what we're talking about, an American Jobs Act. The President kept saying, Pass it right away. Act now. Pass this jobs bill. Pass it right away. Pass it again right away. Pass the bill right away. They'll get back on their feet right away if we pass the bill. Anyway, just on and on\u2014pass the bill, pass the bill, VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6176 September 14, 2011 pass the bill. So I heard the speech. I got a copy of the speech, and I like to highlight stuff where I can find it easi-er. So we've got all this ''pass it now,'' ''pass it right away'' stuff highlighted. Where is it? We were told to pass it now, to pass it right away. We heard the speech Thursday night. We didn't get a bill Friday. We didn't get a bill Saturday. Obviously, it can't be filed Saturday or Sunday if we're not in ses-sion. We didn't get it, though, through email. They send the stuff when it's needed, but nothing Saturday, nothing Sunday. On Monday, we were inquiring of the White House by email, by phone, Look, when are you going to let us see what this bill we've got to pass last week is? We finally got a copy, and I was up until 5 a.m. on Tuesday morning going through it\u2014tagging it, highlighting it, being staggered by the stuff in here that will kill jobs instead of create them\u2014oh, other than the jobs that are created for the government that will help kill the economy. I couldn't be-lieve this was being called an American Jobs Act, but it was not a surprise to me even at noon today when we in-quired and found that no one had been willing to file an American Jobs Act in the House of Representatives. It had been available. The President had been talking about it since last Thursday, but nobody had been willing to actu-ally file that bill in the House. I have been through the President's American Jobs bill, and I am abso-lutely convinced\u2014absolutely no ques-tion\u2014that this will hurt our economy. It creates massive, bigger government intrusion. If you like Freddie and Fannie Mae, you will love the new American Infrastructure Financing Au-thority. What a wonderful government creation that is. We're going to provide billions and billions of dollars to create this new government entity. But not to worry\u2014these are people who will be running it who really know what they're doing\u2014right?\u2014because the Sec-retary of Transportation is going to be in charge. I do know the Secretary of Transportation right now, and I like him very much. He's a good guy. None-theless, we're creating another govern-ment nightmare called the American Infrastructure Financing Authority. Unbelievable. You would have thought we would have learned a lesson\u2014but not to worry. These are people who will be ap-pointed by the President. Some other people here in Congress can throw in some recommendations, but they're ap-pointed. The seven voting members are appointed by the President. So that will be wonderful. They'll run all our infrastructure requirements for us, and of course the President will appoint the chief executive officer. Having been a history major in col- lege, I do believe that the best indica-tion of future performance is past his-tory, past performance. With the auto czars and the private committee com-posed of a bunch of auto czars, I read somewhere that not any of them had ever worked in the auto industry at all, and most of them didn't even own a car. Nonetheless, they had put them in charge of our auto industry. That kind of scares you when you think about it and when you think this is the same guy who's going to appoint all these people to run the brand-new American Infrastructure Financing Au-thority. That's AIFA, and it is just an-other nightmare. It's going to help bankrupt America quicker than this administration has already been doing. I know people like to throw blame around. There is plenty of blame to go around because I know, in 2006, I was on this side of the aisle, hearing people stand up at the Democratic micro-phones, saying what I knew to be true. They were right. We had no business spending $160 billion more than we took in. That was un-American. It was outrageous. This body had no business authorizing expenditures of $160 billion more than we took in. They were right. The Democrats were right when they said we should not spend in a year $160 billion more than we took in. Nowadays, people like to say, Well, it's Afghanistan and Iraq that have broken this country and have made us bankrupt. That's not the case. We were in Afghanistan; we were in the worst part of the expenditures in Iraq during those days, and we overspent what we had coming in by about $160 billion. If anybody back then had told me that within 4 years those same people who condemned this side of the aisle for overspending by $160 billion would be just fine with overspending by $1.6 tril-lion, I would never have believed it. b1630 There is no way, with the speeches that were given here in '05, '06, '07 about the Republicans' irresponsibility in '05 and '06, my freshman year, over $160 billion more being spent than we brought in, that they would have any nerve or ability to stand up and say I'm voting to spend $1.6 trillion more than we're going to take in. I just didn't think, I wouldn't have believed that anybody would be willing to do that. Well, they have, and we as a country have. But I went through the President's bill. Yesterday I went through much of it, but there is a little more that needs to be said, for example, to illuminate the President's comments about he wants to go after the profits of Big Oil; and he does that in his bill, we were told. He was going to fix it for Big Oil. Well, I was a little cynical, I was a little leery, because I have heard the President call the Wall Street execu-tives fat cats. He has called them names, said we wouldn't be letting them do that, that we ought to go after them, that kind of stuff. Yet I knew that, while he was calling them names, at the same time his gov-erning made sure that an entity like Goldman Sachs made more money than they've ever made in their history. They should have had to file for bank- ruptcy. Instead, now they're making more money than they've ever made in history, and this President is presiding in such a way it's bad for America, but Wall Street is doing great, and some would say that doesn't make sense be-cause we know that Wall Street is mainly Republicans. But if you look into it, as the Herit- age Foundation has\u2014my friend Mike Franc there has done the research\u2014you found out that, in essence, corporate executives on Wall Street, when you include their immediate family that donates with them, donate about 4-1 or donate about 4-1 for Obama over M CCAIN. And Mike had said, when he first saw that, he thought, wow, that's intriguing. That may be different from prior years, But as he checked on it, it wasn't that different from prior years, donations from Wall Street. Then you get to realizing, wait a minute, Democratic Presidents, Mem-bers here in this body are constantly deriding these greedy, evil people on Wall Street; and yet they're generally giving 4-1 to Democrats over Repub-licans. There are 4-1 Democrats on Wall Street in executive positions than there are Republicans. Well, no wonder. It starts making more sense that they would do much better under Demo-cratic administrations since it helps to know people in those kinds of posi-tions. But we were told by the President he's going after Big Oil. The provisions in this President's bill\u2014it's at page 151\u2014repeal the deduction for intangible drilling and development costs in the case of oil and gas wells. Now, the bill has a dishonest word here. It says re-pealing oil ''subsidies.'' A subsidy, you can look it up, Web- ster, wherever you want to, but the def-inition will basically be the same wher-ever you look it up. A ''subsidy'' is a grant or a gift of money. There are no grants or gifts of money, and there wasn't anybody that wanted to go after British Petroleum more than I did around here when we found out 800 vio-lations or so and when all the other majors were having maybe one or two in the gulf. Yet they were involved in crony cap- italism. So the administration looked the other way over and over and over again until the Deepwater Horizon blew out. People were killed, you know, not only lives lost but fortunes lost. The Gulf of Mexico was dev-astated all because this administration and those inspectors that were sent looked the other way to all of this piti-ful way that drilling was done because they were buddies, crony capitalism. So when you look here at what the President actually has in his bill, who it's going to help and who it's going to hurt, what you see are these deduc-tions here that he's repealing\u2014the re-peal of deduction for tertiary injectants, the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas wells. Section 199, the deduction attrib-utable to oil, natural gas or primary VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, \u2014 HOUSE H6177 September 14, 2011 products thereof, the repeal of oil and gas working interest exception to pas-sive activity rules. I read through these, checked with experts and find out, CPAs, people that do the tax returns for independent oil companies, and I was reminded, this stuff basically applies only as a deduc-tion for an oil company that produces less than a thousand barrels of oil. All of the majors that this President says he wants to go after and go after their profits, they're majors. All of the deductions that he is try- ing to repeal, they're not going to af-fect, they're not really going to hurt the major oil companies. They're going to devastate the independent oil com-panies. That will be the result here. So he says he wants to go after the majors, but that's just not what he is doing in his bill, and I know that, being a community organizer, he's not that well up on what he's going to hurt and what he's going to help. But the fact is there are figures that indicate Amer-ican production activities are domi-nated by independent producers, who drill 95 percent of the Nation's natural gas and oil wells, accounting for 67 per-cent of total U.S. natural gas and oil production. That's the independent oil companies of America. Ninety-five per-cent of the drilling, 67 percent of the production is not ExxonMobil. It's not Shell. It's not British Petroleum. It's the independent oil companies in America. And who are they? They're people that cannot go to the banks, for the most part, to get a loan. Any bank that would loan an oil company money to drill a particular well is probably going to get shut down because the chances are, in most cases\u2014certainly in the in-vestments I have had\u2014you are more likely to have a dry hole than you are to hit anything that's really going to be of a sufficient, productive nature. So, of course, once you have estab- lished a field, the odds go up dramati-cally, but most of these wells, when it's not an established field and it's just helping produce more from a known field, you can't get loans. The only way independent oil companies have to be assured of being able to drill oil wells is not to go get a loan, and they also know that if they invest and pay all of the 100 percent of their own drilling and they hit a few dry holes in a row, they're going to be bankrupt, if there were so many of them. What most independent oil compa- nies do, they do studies geologically. They have to hire geologists most of the time. I am told they were inde-pendent geologists. I know a great number of those. They do great work. They will study an area, and they will hire a landman to come in and study who owns what interests in the min-erals, who owns what rights that they're going to have to acquire in order to do drilling, and then they hire people that are involved in drilling. They're not like the majors where they've got all they need to go do all the drilling. They hire independent mud companies, independent wire line companies. They will often have to have people come out and feed them, and if they don't, they're going to have people who need to go eat somewhere. It is hard, nasty, 24-hour-a-day work. You don't stop 8-5. You have to do shifts because you can't afford to get somebody too tired for staying on a rig too long. But they employ millions of people. They cause the employment of millions around America even though there aren't that many that actually work on the wells, themselves. b1640 They create jobs. They don't just save them like this President says he's been doing. And so what's the Presi-dent doing? He, in his bill, is not touch-ing, he's not going to hurt the Big Oil companies. They're going to appar-ently do as well as his good friends at General Electric. So what we have seen is, if you're really friends with this administration, or to be fair, the parties in power, then odds are you're going to get your tax bills through and you are going to be like General Electric, you're going to be like Warren Buffett, and you're going to be able to skate through with-out paying virtually any tax. I loved the way Art Laffer explained to it me in his living room after a Sun-day lunch one day last year. We talked about these taxing concepts. I just love the guy. He is so brilliant. He's charm-ing and funny. He sure got us out of a mess back in 1980-1981 because he was the adviser to Ronald Reagan. Art Laffer was his economic adviser. Many people have heard about the Laffer curve because for people in gov-ernment who want to maximize the amount of revenue to the Federal Gov-ernment so they can spend more, how do you do it? Well, if you don't have any kind of tax at all, the government has no tax at all, then the revenue of the Federal Government would be zero on this end. If the government taxed a 100 percent tax, very, very quickly no-body would work. Nobody's going to work to produce 100 percent revenue for the Federal Government unless the whole Nation is enslaved, and God for-bid that that will happen. So on the two ends of the graph, you have zero revenue to the Federal Gov-ernment, if it is zero percent tax alto-gether, and on the other end you have zero revenue to the Federal Govern-ment if there's 100 percent tax. So somewhere in between, you reach the maximum efficiency for bringing in revenue to the Federal Government. If you tax too high, then you start hurt-ing the amount of revenue percentage- wise coming in, and so you actually get less revenue when you pass that max-imum point. Before that point, you can continue to raise taxes and actually in-crease revenue. Beyond that, the rev-enue starts coming down. So as Art has described it, you need to cut taxes 30 percent, and you will get us out of this horrific doldrums of an economy. I was back at Fort Benning, Georgia, at the time, and things were not good. The military was not respected at all. I liked Ronald Reagan a lot. Of course, when you're in the military, you can't say anything negative about the Com-mander in Chief or you've committed an offense under the UCMJ. You can't criticize someone in your chain of com-mand, including the Commander in Chief. So we just had to bite our tongues, but we could see Jimmy Car-ter was doing such damage to this country economically and in the for-eign arena. It was just tragic. I liked Ronald Reagan. He said he was going to be able to help bring down double-digit inflation, double-digit un-employment and double-digit interest rates. As much as I liked him, I recall telling my wife, Kathy, back at Fort Benning, I like him, but I don't care who the President is, there's no way a President can actually help do all that, really have that kind of effect. He proved me wrong. With Laffer's guidance, taxes were cut 30 percent, and the economy took off. Because the economy took off and there were more jobs, unemployment dropped dramati-cally. Interest rates were able to come down dramatically. We had a 12 14per- cent or something loan on our first home in Georgia just off post in Fort Benning. It may have been 12 34per- cent. Some folks told me that was crazy\u2014it was too high\u2014but it wasn't long before interest rates some places were 18 percent, so 12 wasn't so bad. Now, interest rates came down under Reagan, but it was Laffer who said bring down the taxes by 30 percent, and you'll do dramatic work on creating a better economy. I love the story Art Laffer tells about getting a call from President Reagan. He said, Art, great news. We got your tax cut. Art said, in essence, this is my para- phrase: That's great, Mr. President. Congratulations. Art, you don't seem excited. Why aren't you excited? This is great news. We got the tax cut with the Demo-cratic House and Senate. They're going to cut it 30 percent. He said, Congratulations, Mr. Presi- dent. That's great. President Reagan said, Why aren't you more excited? He said, Mr. President, I understand you're going to cut it like half a per-cent the first year, 10 percent the next year, and another 20 percent the third year. He said, Well, that's the deal we had to cut with Congress. We couldn't get all 30 percent at once. As I recall, he said something like, Mr. President, if you were going shop-ping and the place you were going to go shopping had a half of one percent sale this month and then 10 percent sale next month and then 20 percent sale the next one after that, when are you going to go shopping? He said Reagan was quiet for awhile and then finally said, Are we going to have a couple of bad years? VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep \u2014 HOUSE H6178 September 14, 2011 He said, Yes. Now it's going to be 3 years before the economy heals. We could have had it this year. President Reagan got the best he could in 1981 and 1982, and those were not good years. In 1983, the economy surged, and more money was brought into the coffers. The problem, though, is that the Democratic Party got so excited con-trolling the House and Senate\u2014Reagan and Laffer had set up such a situation here, and there was so much more money coming into the coffers, the Federal revenues\u2014that they started spending like never before. They can blame Reagan, but the Constitution makes very clear, Congress spends the money. So really, this year, we are still working off of what Congress did or didn't do last year under Speaker P ELOSI . Next year, beginning October 1, will be the first full year we are back at least as Republicans being in control of one House. So I think it is very, very important what we try to do to gen-erate jobs and when you know that these provisions are going to devastate independent oil companies that do 95 percent of the drilling in continental America and won't hurt Exxon, British Petroleum, and, in fact, because 95 per-cent of the drilling will not get done in the continental United States. I guess that's why the President was trying to do this. They apparently don't like drilling. They don't like mining. They don't like any of this stuff occurring on our soil. They would rather it go somewhere else where they pollute a lot more. But we are talking about millions of jobs that will be lost because of the devastating effect of de-stroying independent oil and gas busi-nesses\u2014and all of that when we've got-ten such great news over the last few years. We went from having basically no natural gas reserves to having 100\u2014 some say 200, some say 300\u2014years of natural gas reserves. Some fleets of trucks are starting to convert to natural gas. If we converted cars and trucks\u2014you can't order them from Detroit yet that come equipped with natural gas. You can get them done after they leave the factory. But if we started getting natural gas vehi-cles like some fleets have done, travel is a lot cheaper. You don't have the pollution you have with gasoline. It burns clean. You do have CO 2. So look out. We're going to grow more plants, because plants have to have CO 2in order to have photosyn- thesis, in order to produce O 2as a by- product from growing as a plant. So, gee, if we use more natural gas, we may end up with more healthy plants. So that may be a difficult thing if peo-ple don't like green plants. I couldn't help but notice on page 155\u2014and I have read through here\u2014the President has things like eliminating deductions. He says this bill is paid for. In his speech he says\u2014and I want to read it correctly. He told us back 2 years ago during his health care speech, if you misrepresent my bill, I'm going to call you out. So let me read what he says. He says, ''And here is the other thing I want the American people to know. The American Jobs Act will not add to the deficit. It will be paid for.'' That's what he said. What he's counting on, what he ref- erences on page 4 of his speech\u2014and it's on page 155\u2014yes, there is elimi-nation of deductions. In reality, it's going to cost this government revenue. It's not going to create more Federal revenue. b1650 It's going to cost jobs. There will be fewer people paying as much income tax. That will hurt the Federal coffers more. We'll have more deficit spending. We can't get that under control. But we just passed a deficit bill I didn't support because it didn't have adequate cuts in there. There was no restraint on spending that was really adequate. If you only cut $1 trillion over a 10- year period, and we all know\u2014every-body in here knows\u2014you can't bind fu-ture Congresses. So all the cuts that do not occur within the next year or year and a half, there's no reason to think that they will happen. You can't bind future Congresses. Anyway, even if we did cut $1 tril- lion\u2014not much the next year, but it gets heavier toward the end of the 10 years. If we were to cut $1 trillion over 10 years and we were to do that every 10 years, within exactly 150 years we will finally balance the budget, and we will have only added $120 trillion to the $14.3 trillion or $14.6 trillion that we've run up in deficit spending now. If we were able to reach this wonderful goal of $2 trillion in cuts in the next 10 years and do that ever 10 years, then we can balance the budget in only 80 years. We'll only add around $72 tril-lion in additional deficit spending to our deficit. So the joint committee was charged: Find $1.5 trillion somewhere between now and basically Christmas, the end of the year. Actually, we found out today they're really going to need to find it by the 1st of November. This is how the President pays for his $450 bil-lion spending spree, where we create the American Infrastructure Financing Authority\u2014a new Fannie and Freddie on steroids. We create a new massive government bureaucracy. The FCC wanted to have a fairness doctrine and control what people said on the airwaves. They want to dictate everything that gets done in the media on the airwaves, but they were real-izing more and more people are going to broadband and less and less to the airways. They're losing control of things. So the President addresses that. It's not a jobs bill in the private sector, but it creates a brand-new au-thority, government entity. Well, actu-ally, he describes it in his bill as a pri-vate nonprofit group. He appoints the directors, of course, and it's called the Public Safety Broadband Corporation. Wow, it's going to kill the private sec-tor. But more government jobs. Good news there. And here's the pay-for. If we had a drum roll, Mr. Speaker, we could ask for it. The Budget Control Act of 2011 is amended by striking $1.5 trillion that they have to find in cuts in the next month or so and inserting $1.95 trillion in cuts. That's it. Magically, he just found $450 billion in cuts, but it's be- cause he told the supersubcommittee: Go find this extra money. What a great revenue-enhancing deficit spending cut that is. This bill is a disaster. It sets up a program that will allow people who have their hours reduced by 10 percent to start collecting unemployment com-pensation. It requires State agencies to start mandating that those employers involved certify that even if they cut an employee's hours, they're going to still have the same health care bene-fits, retirement benefits. I talked to some employers today about it. They said, We'll have to give up providing health care and retirement benefits be-cause we need the flexibility. If we're all taking a cut, then let's take a cut. I want to challenge my own Repub- lican leadership, Mr. Speaker. Most of America is not even aware that this year we put our mouth where our money is, and we actually voted to cut our own budgets by 5 percent. And next year we're cutting our own budget by 6 percent. Well, we haven't done enough with that. I would challenge our own leadership, and I hope that we'll seize the day\u2014seize the moment\u2014and be able, because we would have the right to do this since we're cutting our own budgets. America doesn't know that, but we are. Okay. All Federal Government, here's the deal. We're cutting our own budget in Congress by 5 percent this year, 6 percent next year, and we're doing it to every department In the country. We have the moral authority to do that since we're cutting our own. We should do that. Let's get spending under control. But the President uses, apparently, Rahm Emanuel's own phi-losophy about: Don't let a good crisis go to waste. So he's got this 155-page bill that he finally made available Monday night but that nobody has filed here in the House. We need American jobs. We need American jobs now. I am convinced that if we eliminated the corporate tax altogether, you would hear a gigantic sucking sound, I believe Mr. Perot used to say, of manufacturers leaving other countries and flocking back to Amer-ica, making more income than they had in the past, because for the first time\u2014Donald Trump is a sharp man. He has made a lot of money. He has ad-vocated that we put a 25 percent tariff on everything we buy from China. If you studied the situation and un- derstand the treaties\u2014I don't like most of them, but if you look at what we've done, if we set a 25 percent tariff on ev-erything America buys from China, we VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:59 Sep 15, HOUSE H6179 September 14, 2011 have violated a number of contracts and agreements. There's penalty phases to that. We start a trade war. I don't think China wins, but I know we don't either. I don't think anybody wins a trade war that that would start. So inspired by Donald Trump saying, Why don't we put a 25 percent tariff on everything we buy from China\u2014and I've talked to Art Laffer. He likes the idea. He's got some other alternatives as well, but one of them is you elimi-nate the corporate tax altogether. I really think it's one of the most insid-ious taxes in America because people have had to be sold a bill of goods to believe that you won't have to pay it. We're going to make these evil, greedy corporations do it. And I will admit to you, sometimes unions are very helpful because greed does take over. But the thing is, if you eliminate the corporate tax, who's been paying that? The consumers and lower wage earners in those corporations. In some cases, there are studies that have indicated that. But it's the consumers that have to pay the corporate tax. If a corporation doesn't pass that tax on, they can't stay in business. If you eliminate the corporate tax, you'll have jobs flooding back into America, and you'll have more people paying income tax. The Laffer curve won't be zero taxes on this side with zero revenue. It will be zero corporate tax. But even at the same tax levels, you will have dramatic increases in the Federal revenue because so many more people will be employed, things will be going well, and the economy will have a jump-start like we've never seen be-fore. So after nobody else would file an American Jobs Act, as the President proposed, and having examined it over and over in the last couple of days, having checked today at noon to see if anybody had the nerve to file this dis-astrous bill that will kill jobs, run up the price of gasoline and oil and make everybody's life more miserable, more government intrusion into broadcast, more government intrusion into fi-nancing things\u2014not Fannie or Freddie because we've still got them around, but a new infrastructure financing au-thority\u2014I realize this is a disaster for America. So I filed not a 115-page bill but actu- ally a 2-page bill today at about 1:20, and it says: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the cor-porate income tax. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America and Con-gress assembled. This Act may be cited as the ''American Jobs Act of 2011.'' It repeals the corporate income tax, re-peals the alternative minimum tax, and there will be so many more people paying income tax, people will not be-lieve the kind of money that will flow into the Federal Government, not that that's a good thing, but we can at least pay down our debt if we're responsible. b1700 I'm so excited that the Tea Party is getting fired up. I see people from all races, all walks of life in the Tea Party. The one thing they seem to have in common is they're paying in-come tax, and they're tired of carrying half of the country on their backs. So this is a start, I believe\u2014it is a jobs bill\u2014and you will see jobs flood this country, and we'll get on track. In the few minutes I have left, let me just tell you about a man that prob-ably had the most influence on my life behind my father. His name was Sam Parker. There have been wonderful men in my life, women in my life, teachers in my life that affected me. Sam Parker was hired by the Mount Pleasant School Board in 1952 to be a coach and to teach history. He was the head coach of the Mount Pleasant Ti-gers football team. In 2 years' time, in 1953, he had led them to being undefeated after the first nine games. He turned the program around. He was a devoted Christian, belonged to the Methodist church there, started teach-ing Sunday school. His wife, Norween, was the librarian at the junior high. After nine games, we went to play Sulphur Springs, and people were say-ing, This looks like the best team in 3A, in Texas; they very well could win the State. They went to Sulphur Springs. Some team members told me it was their fault; they didn't take it serious enough, and they lost by one touchdown. That was Friday night. Monday morning, the school board fired Sam Parker. Then he and his wife had a tough de- cision. They believed that God had called them to Mount Pleasant to plant their roots, invest their lives, and change America from that small place. Well, he did the unthinkable. He stayed and taught American history after being fired as head football coach. And 7 years later, I met him in a park recreation program he put on for young kids in the public park down there each summer. I worked with him one summer as a teenager with the kids. He taught more kids how to play baseball in Mount Pleasant during those years than anybody else in town. He was my scoutmaster. He had a troop there. He was my scoutmaster through my becoming an Eagle Scout there at Mount Pleasant, and he taught me American history. He continued to teach Sunday school. The man that coached 2 years at Mount Pleasant High School changed Mount Pleasant in an incredible way. He was still alive in 1991. Before he died, they renamed the football field Sam Parker Field. He taught me Amer-ican history. He served in World War II. He loved this country. His son was my best friend\u2014is still a dear friend. Those are the kinds of people that have changed America. Those are the kinds of people who are the reason we have been blessed like we've been blessed, And if we don't have more peo-ple willing to put pettiness aside, goofy ideas that enrich their cronies, goofy ideas that increase power for some peo-ple and get back to what made America great, we're going to lose this country. As Ben Franklin said in 1787, we will become a byword down through future generations because we had the great-est country ever given to mankind, and we became irresponsible and lost it. It's time for major changes. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. f RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FARENTHOLD ).

G ILLIBRAND , a Senator from the State of New York. PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of- fered the following prayer: Let us pray. As we come into Your presence today, O Lord, we, like Isaiah of old, need to be cleansed from our sinful-ness. Forgive us for our failures and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Today, use our lawmakers so that their actions will help provide for the security and well-being of all people. Sustain our Senators with the protec-tion of Your providence and give them Your peace. Give them also a spirit of unity and the wisdom to have respect one for the other. Lord, thank You for the redemption You provide for Your people. Holy and awesome is Your Name. Amen. f PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The Honorable K IRSTEN E.

Mrs. GILLIBRAND thereupon as- sumed the chair as Acting President pro tempore. f RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The majority leader is recog-nized. f SCHEDULE Mr. REID. Madam President, fol- lowing leader remarks, the Senate will be in morning business for 1 hour. The Republicans will control the first half and the majority will control the final half. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.J. Res. 66, which is now a resolution regarding Burma sanctions and the legislative ve-hicle for additional FEMA funding. We expect to be in consideration of this legislation today. We also hope to con-sider the FAA and highway extension, which was received from the House yes-terday. Senators will be notified when votes are scheduled. f FEMA VICTIMS Mr. REID. Madam President, the House sent us a package, and I appre-ciate that very much. It funds the highway bill for 6 months, and it funds the FEMA bill for 4 months. That is terrific. We should move to this as quickly as we can; however, we are told it is going to be held up by the Repub-licans. If someone wants to have a vote on an amendment as it relates to this, I will be happy to discuss this with the Republican leader and see if we can work something out. In the instance I am talking about, however, the Sen-ator said he doesn't want to vote; he just wants to hold up the bill. He said if we put in what we got from the House and stuck his provision in that, then he would be happy. Well, I guess anyone would. It is a pretty good way to legislate around here\u2014just be a dic-tator and say: Either take this or leave it. That isn't the way things work around here. We have to have votes on issues to find out how people feel. I am convinced his issue would lose overwhelmingly, but he is holding up this legislation, and we are in a posi-tion now legislatively that I can't get to this bill. We cannot get to this bill prior to Friday, when the FAA expires. So it is unfortunate that is the posi-tion we are in. One Senator is holding this up, and what it will do is\u2014the highway bill does not expire on Friday; FAA does. But they are a package. If this continues, we will have about 80,000 people out of work by Saturday, 4,000 who work for the FAA and about 70,000 or 75,000 who are working on air-port construction jobs. In Las Vegas, for example, there is a new tower being built because of McCarran Field being overwhelmed\u2014the old tower can't han-dle things well\u2014and those people will be laid off. That is the way it is all over the country. That is very unfortu-nate. I really appreciate, Madam Presi- dent, and I have tried to say individ-ually\u2014I have been to each Republican Senator\u2014the Senators who have voted to help us move forward on funding for FEMA, I really appreciate it. As you know, we have a majority, but it is not a huge majority, and to get things done on issues that are specialized, we need seven Republicans, and we have eight Republicans in this instance who helped us pass this legislation. All the Democratic Senators voted for this, and we got those Republicans. This al-lows us now to fund FEMA. I have told my friends on the Repub- lican side of the aisle, if it is some-thing that\u2014if they want to change the VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5588 September 14, 2011 numbers around, let's have a discussion on that. But right now, people are des-perate. Last night around 6 or 6:30, I spoke to the man who is in charge of FEMA, and he said we are spending money every day on Lee and on Irene. These are not a couple of women; one is a tropical storm, and the other is a hurricane. They are not spending money other places. Why? Because they don't have the money. As the Presiding Officer knows, there are people in her State who have lost their homes. This is all up and down the coast, from the coast of Florida up to Maine, and even places inward. As we talked about yesterday, some of the very severe damage was not on the coastline but, for example, in the State of Vermont, the worst storm likely they have ever had, and those people are trying to get from one place to the next, but they have scores of bridges that are inoperable. And that money\u2014 what money they have left in FEMA\u2014 will run out I think he said on the 25th. If things keep going the way they are, on the 25th of this month, they will be out of money\u2014no money. So we need to get this done. Proce- durally, we are on this, and I can't move to the highway bill and the FAA bill. And, I repeat, the FAA bill ex-pires. So I hope we can have something worked out with this Senator so we can get this bill done. The disasters facing this country are untoward. Forty-eight States have al-ready had emergency declarations. Some States have had multiple emer-gency declarations. Only two States\u2014 West Virginia and Michigan\u2014have not had emergency declarations. We have had in the State of Texas, as an exam-ple, 20,000 fires since the first of the year; on Sunday alone, 19 fires. Mil-lions of acres have burned, and 2,000 homes have burned to the ground. That is what FEMA is all about. FEMA is an organization that is rel- atively new, but as a country we have been helping people who have experi-enced disasters since we have been a country. In the early 1800s, there was a big fire in the State of New Hampshire. I be-lieve the date was 1813. The Federal Government stepped in to help with the rebuilding there. That is the way it should be. That is what our country is all about. I am sorry, Madam Presi-dent, it was 1803. In 1803, the Federal Government played a role in rebuilding after a calamity in New Hampshire. Congress passed legislation that year to help New Hampshire recover from the devastating fire they had. FEMA was established in 1979. To this point, it appears this could very likely be the worst disaster year in the history of the country. Irene alone is one of the five worst disasters mone-tarily we have had in this country. So I hope my Republican colleagues will work with us and help us move these things along. It is important that we do that. It is important that we do that as quickly as we can so that peo- ple in Joplin, MO, and other places in the country that have been devastated can receive the help they deserve from the Federal Government. f RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved. f MORNING BUSINESS The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Under the previous order, the Senate will be in a period of morning business for 1 hour, with Senators per-mitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, with the time equally di-vided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with the Re-publicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the final half. f MEASURES PLACED ON THE CAL- ENDAR\u2014S. 1549, H.R. 2832, AND H.R. 2887 Mr. REID.

The Senator from Nebraska. f ORDER OF PROCEDURE Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be al-lowed to engage in a colloquy with my \u2014and in the event the minority leader does appear to offer comments, that we interrupt our colloquy for the minority leader to speak. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. f TRADE AGREEMENTS Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise today with my colleagues to talk about trade and the importance of trade and specifically to talk about three pending trade agreements. And when I say ''pending,'' man alive, am I emphasizing ''pending.'' These agree-ments have been around a very long time. And I am referring to Korea, Panama, and Colombia. We all know the benefits of trade in the United States. In Nebraska, my home State, more than 19,000 jobs and more than $5.5 billion in revenue were directly tied to exports last year. In trade discussions, we often hear about the need to level the playing field. Well, these agreements do ex-actly that. They eliminate tariffs and a whole host of other barriers on most agricultural products, including prod-ucts that are important to my State: beef, corn, soybeans, and pork. No doubt about it, they increase the eco-nomic opportunities for Nebraska farmers and ranchers, for businesses and for workers. Well, for 3 years, we have heard the President say the right thing. In fact, every time he would say something about this, I thought, finally, the trade agreements are going to bust loose and we are going to have an opportunity to vote on them. He said in last year's State of the Union: If America sits on the sidelines while other Nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores. Then again in May, the President called for a ''robust, forward-looking trade agenda that emphasizes exports and domestic job growth.'' Just last week, the President noted that now is the time. He said, of ''a se-ries of trade agreements that would make it easier for American companies to sell their products in Panama, Co-lombia and South Korea,'' now is the time. If now is the time, why is the ad-ministration continuing to fail to act? It has been 1,538 days since the Korea agreement was signed. It has been 1,540 days since the Panama agreement was signed. It has been 1,758 days since we completed negotiations with Colombia. As I said, I have colleagues with me today who are in a much better posi-tion than I would be to explain the positive impacts of these trade agree-ments. I am going to ask that Senator R OBERTS speak first, Senator P ORTMAN , Senator H OEVEN Senator B LUNT , and Senator I SAKSON . It is my hope that if there is time permitting, I will wrap up. I ask Senator R OBERTS , as former chairman of the House Agriculture sub-committee and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee today, how important are these agreements to agriculture and job creation in the United States? Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I thank my colleague and dear friend from Nebraska for the question. In the end, the biggest consequence for inaction that is now facing our Na-tion, our biggest challenge, is jobs. In regards to his question, the three pend-ing trade agreements add up to $13 bil-lion in additional exports and an esti-mated 250,000 jobs. From the agricul-tural perspective, the three pending VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 SENATE S5589 September 14, 2011 trade agreements represent $2.5 billion, if they are ever implemented. The estimates are that the three agreements in total are expected to in-crease direct exports by $129.5 million just for Kansas farmers and ranchers and an additional 1,150 jobs for our State. For folks on the farm, these ex-port markets are absolutely critical. Approximately one-third of our crop production is exported. For wheat, that number jumps to one-half. The administration's prolonged delay is causing U.S. businesses and pro-ducers to simply lose market share. We are losing out. Other countries are not waiting. They are enacting trade agree-ments without the United States. Let me give a very good example. The Colombia-Canada trade agreement went into force on August 15 of this year. Already, Nutresa, the largest food processor in Colombia, has an-nounced it will source all of its wheat from Canada to take advantage of the lower duties the Canadian wheat will receive from the trade agreement. Nutresa's wheat demand alone rep-resents 50 percent of all wheat imports to that country. Our Kansas Farm Bu-reau estimates that Kansas farmers stand to lose $21 million from lost wheat sales alone and $38 million from all agricultural exports just by doing nothing on the trade agreement. Soon after the United States nego- tiated the trade agreement with Korea, the European Union followed suit. In July, the Korea-European Union trade agreement went into effect. According to Korean customs, within the first 29 days of July, I say to my friend, the European exports were up 34 percent. Get this one: Notably, aerospace equipment increased by a whopping 1,693 percent. That is astounding. Kan-sas is a major player in the aviation sector, exporting $2.7 billion in trans-portation equipment last year. As the aviation capital of the world, Wichita's aviation companies and 17,000 workers have much to lose in trying to compete against the European Union. It is long overdue time for the Presi- dent to put some action behind his words. Send the three trade agree-ments to Congress immediately. I am going to make a statement that I regret to say. Trade assistance not-withstanding, I am very sad to say that I do not believe we are going to see any trade agreement this year or the next. I hope my prediction is not correct. This is ridiculous. Every third foggy night, the Presi- dent makes a speech and says: We need these trade agreements. We are losing market share. Well, I don't see the trade agree- ments. These are not the trade agree-ments. Maybe somebody can find them here on the floor or in the House. Maybe they are somewhere. But I think they are in the White House, and until we get the politics out of this and the President sends the trade agree-ments here, what on Earth is he doing saying we should be passing these trade agreements? We don't have the bill. Send us the bill, Mr. President. As the administration delays moving forward on these export agreements with Korea, Panama, and Colombia, what is happening to American exports to these important markets? Senator P ORTMAN is an expert on this issue. There is not anybody in this Sen-ate who is more of an expert on trade. If you apply the administration's own metrics, how many jobs will be cre-ated\u2014I am not talking about lost but will be created by these pending agree-ments? Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my colleague from Kansas, who has just made the case eloquently as to why we need to move forward. To answer his question, when you apply the metrics the President of the United States and his administration have used for these three trade agree-ments alone, they would create 250,000 new jobs. I ask my colleagues, with 9 percent unemployment and continued bad economic news, can't we use those jobs? By the way, jobs that are related to trade tend to be higher paying, tend to have more benefits. This is exactly what we need to do in this Senate and in the House and here in Washington\u2014 put the partisanship aside and move forward on what makes sense to create jobs. I can't think of anything that would have a more immediate impact on those exporters Senator R OBERTS talked about, who right now are seeing their market share eroded because the United States is sitting on its hands. In 2006, the Colombia agreement was fi-nalized. It has been tinkered with since then, but we are talking 5 years ago. It is unbelievable. When we have sat on our hands and not moved forward with giving our farmers and our workers and our service providers the chance to go into that Colombian market, you are exactly right, they have gone ahead and made trade agreements with other folks. Colombia is a great example. Back when we negotiated this agreement and completed it\u2014and I was the U.S. Trade Representative then, as the Senator in-dicated, and I negotiated with the then-President of Colombia, President Uribe, who made lots of concessions, including on manufacturing and agri-cultural services. At that time, we had a 71-percent market share in terms of exports of agricultural products\u2014 wheat, corn, and soybeans\u2014into Co-lombia\u2014a 71-percent market share. Today, that market share is about 26 percent. Why? Because after we com-pleted our agreement with Colombia, they engaged with other countries, in-cluding the Mercosur countries of Ar-gentina and Brazil, and now they are buying their products instead from those countries that got their act to-gether and moved forward with trade agreements that this President will not get his act together on and send to us. As Senator R OBERTS said, just re- cently, in August, this summer, they completed an agreement with Canada. Guess what the Canadians love to ex-port\u2014the same kind of wheat we love to export. So the Senator is right, they are going to take the wheat market away from Kansas and North Dakota and other States that really need those jobs and need those exports. We have to move forward. It is really a crime that we have not been able to provide our farmers, workers, and serv-ice providers these opportunities. Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield for one quick question? Mr. PORTMAN. Yes. Absolutely. Mr. ROBERTS. The Senator has been there and done the negotiating. He knows these trade agreements not only apply to our exports but our national security. What has this continued delay done\u2014what does it do to the credibility of the people who are actu-ally negotiating, our trade representa-tives? Mr. PORTMAN. Unfortunately, I think some of these countries\u2014all three of which are great allies of the United States: Panama, Colombia, and South Korea\u2014feel as though the United States has let them down. We are going to move forward here, I believe. I am more optimistic than the Senator from Kansas. I believe the President will finally send these for-ward. He has to. The logic is difficult to escape. Why wouldn't you? And that is good. We will be able to move for-ward, I hope, with not just opening more markets but helping on our rela-tionships with these incredibly impor-tant allies. But in the meantime, there has been damage done. The Senator is absolutely right. I think they believe in some respects that the rug has been pulled out from under them. They made huge concessions and commit-ments to the United States and politi-cally took great risks. Frankly, in Colombia and Panama, where they moved forward imme-diately to ratify these agreements in their legislature, it wasn't just the ad-ministration, it was the elected rep-resentatives of the people, as we are, who took risks to say: Yes, we want to be a partner with the United States of America, the greatest economy on the face of the Earth and this beacon of hope and opportunity, and here we are in America letting them down. So in both its commercial impacts on the United States\u2014we have lost mar-ket share, we have lost jobs because of it, but it also has had an impact, as Senator R OBERTS says, in terms of our standing in the world. We have to move forward not just with these three, but the important point is that we have to move forward with additional agreements. There are over 100 trade agreements being nego-tiated right now around the world, and because the United States does not have a trade promotion authority, the ability for the President to negotiate and bring an agreement back here for an up-or-down vote, we are not engaged in these agreements. We are engaged in VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5590 September 14, 2011 one, which is a regional one\u2014the trans- pacific partnership\u2014but none of these bilateral ones, which is where you are really going to get these trade open-ings and new exports and, therefore, new jobs. This is a bigger issue that must be addressed. This Congress, I hope, will address it in the context of the votes we are going to have in connection with the trade agreements. We are going to promote getting the United States back in the game of expanding our trade and helping U.S. jobs. By the way, it was mentioned earlier that it is not just that we have the op-portunity to create over 200,000 jobs. It is also that if we do not move forward on these three agreements, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has done some analysis showing we would lose 380,000 jobs. This sort of goes both ways. There is a cost to not moving forward, and that is also hundreds of thousands of jobs we desperately need in States such as Ohio and the States represented by the Senators who are here with us on the floor today. The International Trade Commission now says these three agreements alone would expand exports annually by $13 billion\u2014again meaning jobs and opportunity. It is time for us to move forward. Senator R OBERTS has talked about what is happening with the European Union, which actually negotiated its agreements after we completed ours. In the auto sector, by the way, there is an EU-Korea agreement that says the 8-percent tariff on imported cars has already started being reduced. That has resulted in the companies sending UK cars, including Hondas that are being produced in the United King-dom\u2014they are being exported to South Korea. We have a Honda plant in Ohio. I visited it recently. There are 4,200 Ohio workers there. We want to export Hondas from Ohio to Korea. We can do that with these export agreements. It is time for us to move forward. It is not the time for us to play politics. We have to move forward because we need these jobs and because, again, the United States should be at the fore-front of these agreements in order to not just protect the market share we have but expand it. Ninety-five percent of the consumers live outside of our borders, and we need to access those consumers. I now ask, if I could, one of my col- leagues to talk a little about his expe-rience in his State. J OHNHOEVEN was Governor of North Dakota, so he was like the trade rep-resentative from North Dakota. He was out there promoting trade as Governor, and North Dakota is a State that has a lot of exports, including wheat, as we talked about earlier, so they are being hit by what Senators R OBERTS and JOHANNS talked about in terms of what is happening in Colombia today with the Canadian agreement and also the EU agreement with Korea. I ask Senator H OEVEN if he would talk a little about why these agree-ments with Colombia and Panama are so important to his State. Mr. HOEVEN. I thank Senator PORTMAN , and I thank Senator JOHANNS for organizing this discussion on a very important issue, a timely issue. It is good to be here with Sen-ator R OBERTS , with Senator B LUNT and Senator I SAKSON . I think, coming from our different States, we show how im-portant these trade agreements are not only to our individual States across the country but how important these trade agreements are to our Nation right now. When we are talking trade, we are talking jobs. We need to create more jobs in this country, and it is the pri-vate sector that creates jobs. It is busi-ness investment, it is companies that create jobs. Our job, our task, our role is to create an environment where our companies and our entrepreneurs and American ingenuity that built the greatest economic engine in the his-tory of the world\u2014this country, this economy, this U.S. economy\u2014we have to create that environment so they can invest and create those jobs. One of the important ways we do that is with good trade agreements. Let's make sure our companies can export their great products and services all over the world. We have to compete in a global, high-tech economy, and these trade agreements let us do it. That is why it is so important that we move forward. Today, we are on the floor of the Sen- ate saying: Why do we have these trade agreements? Thursday night, we heard from the President that we need to move forward with these trade agree-ments. We want to move forward with these trade agreements. We are ready to go. We have been for some time. In fact, the Senators here on the floor and others have been working very hard to do everything we can to make sure we have cleared the path so these trade agreements can come to the Senate floor. It was not too long ago that Senator J OHANNS , myself, and Senator P ORTMAN went with Senator M ITCH MCCONNELL and Senator M ORAN over to South Korea to meet with President Lee. He wants the agreements. He is ready to go. As a matter of fact, he said, please ratify the agreements in your country, get them over to me, because I am ready to take that to my legislators and get this approved. Second, our President said there are some concerns we need to deal with as part of these trade agreements. He said we need to address TSA, trade assist-ant adjustment. We said we will work with TSA. We will make sure we have enough Senators so it is squared away. We have it covered. That has been com-municated. So the question is: Why at this point don't we have the trade agreements? That is the question I think that has to be asked. Where are they? Why aren't they here on the Sen-ate floor so we can move forward with them? In our State, as others men-tioned in their States, they are incred- ibly important. A few big stats to follow on what Senator P ORTMAN mentioned a minute ago. For every 4-percent increase in trade, we create a million jobs in this country. For every 4-percent increase in trade, a million jobs in this country are created. How important is that? The United States-South Korea free trade agreement alone means more than a quarter of a million jobs, more than $10 billion in increased U.S. ex-ports to that country alone. I cannot think of a time when it is more impor-tant to create those jobs than right now when we have more than 14 mil-lion people out of work and many more who are either not working because they have not been able to get a job or who are underemployed. Unemploy-ment is more than 9 percent. This is one of the ways we create that environment that gets our people back to work by empowering the pri-vate sector to make that investment and create those jobs. I was just back in North Dakota, and one of the many events I went to was an expansion of one of the Caterpillar company's locations in West Fargo, ND. They remanufacture a lot of their equipment in West Fargo, ND. This equipment goes all over the world. It is part of the huge machines that Cat makes. They use these machines for ex-cavating, for mining, road building, for all these things all over the world, and they are the technology leader in the world in this huge equipment. They bought Bucyrus, which is huge in min-ing, so now they are big in the mining business. Getting into places such as Colombia and Panama is incredibly im-portant for Caterpillar. It is not just about creating jobs in North Dakota, but think of the impact throughout the heartland in Indiana or in Illinois or, as Senator R OBERTS talked about, agri- culture. In North Dakota we have more cattle than people. I think we have more than 3 million cattle. Right now to send them to South Korea, we pay more than 40 percent tariff. How do we com-pete with Argentina or Australia in that situation? This is an opportunity. This is absolutely an opportunity. We need to reach out and grab it with both hands. We have the President right now saying, pass those trade agree-ments. Absolutely. Please get them down here to us. We have worked so hard to make sure we have cleared all the hurdles, TAA, or whatever else is required. Bring those trade agreements to us. We stand ready to pass them. Mr. PORTMAN. Would the Senator yield for a second? The Senator talked about being at home and talking to his constituents about this, and I am sure all of us have stories like this, but I will tell you this morning we had one of our weekly coffees and the Ohio pork producers came. There were about 12 pork producers from around the State of Ohio. Do you know what the No. 1 issue was they raised with me? Trade VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 \u2014 SENATE S5591 September 14, 2011 and getting these trade agreements done. Why? Because it affects their prices directly. They have to have these international sales in order to make ends meet. Particularly with the price of feed going up, they have to have these foreign markets. It was in-teresting that of all the issues they could have raised with me, the one they are most concerned about is to make sure we get these three agree-ments done, and then move forward with the additional agreements. It is our job to provide the environ- ment for success. Part of that environ-ment is to give our exporters the abil-ity to have a level playing field to ac-cess these markets. They are the best farmers in the world. We have some of the most productive land in the world. They just need a fair shake. Mr. HOEVEN. It is absolutely true. In handing off the ball in this discus-sion, I want to go back to the trade ad-justment assistance, which I men-tioned earlier. There were a number of things the administration wanted to see before bringing these trade agree-ments forward to us for ratification. Senator B LUNT and Senator P ORTMAN were instrumental\u2014and along with these two, Senator J OHANNS , myself, Senator I SAKSON , and others. We even signed on to a letter not once but I think twice, to make sure we got it right. Senator B LUNT 's leadership in making sure we had taken all the nec-essary steps so the administration was prepared and willing to bring these agreements to the Senate floor has been covered. I thank the Senator for that leadership. He may want to touch on that, but I know how important the trade agreements are to the State of Missouri. But I also thank the leader-ship of Senator P ORTMAN , as well, in making sure we addressed TAA and all of the issues that needed to be ad-dressed as part of moving forward with these trade agreements. Mr. BLUNT. I think what Senator P ORTMAN and I thought when the Presi- dent said for these three trade agree-ments to be voted on, we had to have trade adjustment assistance. We looked at the negotiated package. It was not exactly what any of us who signed the letter would have negotiated. We said, look, these are the jobs that are the low-hanging fruit of job creation if we get these three trade bills. We are will-ing to look at the Baucus camp-nego-tiated TAA, and support it in a way the White House can sign it and send these agreements up. Senator H OEVEN mentioned, as he and I and all of us were sitting in the House Chamber last Thursday night, listening to the President's remarks when he said we need to pass these three trade agreements, I was almost sure the next sentence would be: And so tomorrow, I am sending these trade agreements up. That next sentence did not occur. Just like the week in Au-gust where the President was on his bus tour and every single day on the bus tour he said Congress can do some-thing right now that would create more American jobs if they will pass these three trade agreements. Every time he said that, even though I was hearing it on the TV, I could not help but talk back to the television or the radio and say: Well, we cannot pass them unless you send them up. You are absolutely right, this is one of the easi-est things we could do to create jobs, Mr. President, but we have to have the agreements from you before we can vote on them. Don't tell the American people all we have to do is pass the bill when you know that you have to send the bill up before we can pass the bill. We need these three agreements. As Senator P ORTMAN has pointed out, we need more agreements, but that is not happening right now. We do need the President to have the authority that I, and I think all of us, would be more than willing to give him, but that is not part of this package, the trade pro-motion authority we wish to see ex-tended into the future. Right now we have three agreements that have been negotiated for a long time, and whether it is the Missouri and North Dakota beef industry or the Missouri and Ohio pork industry or the grain industry that we all are impacted by, there is a real opportunity here and these markets are waiting for us. To look at our State, since 2002, ex- ports have increased more than three times faster than the State domestic product has grown. So for those who say, well, exports cost American jobs or Missouri jobs, they clearly provide those jobs. U.S. farm exports reached an all-time high in 2010, amounting to more than $115 billion in sales. For every $1 billion worth of agricultural exports, there are an estimated 8,000 jobs. So these countries are waiting for agreements that will increase trade in soybeans and beef and corn and pork and dairy products and processed food; in fact, in processed goods of all kinds. We cannot get to those markets until we pass these trade agreements. All of us are eager to work with the President to get that done. All of us are eager for him to send us those trade agreements. Since these agree-ments were negotiated, others have ne-gotiated agreements and launched them\u2014and it may have been mentioned already this morning, but if it has not, it is important to understand that on July 1, the European Union trade agreement with South Korea went into place and they had a 1-month, 38-per-cent increase year over year the first month of that trade agreement. The Canada-Colombia agreement went into place on August 15. Having been to Colombia and worked on this for some time, there is no question there is a preference for our goods, but once they start buying these other products, then you have to convince them you need to come back to the product you would rather have had to start with if that product had had an even shot at the marketplace. Panama is negotiating all kinds of work agreements and expansion agree-ments on the canal we are disadvan- taged in because we have not passed that agreement. Let's get these three agreements done. Let's start creating the private sector jobs these agreements clearly will lead to. As we have talked to the White House and the President about that, my good friend from Georgia, J OHNNY ISAKSON , has been in the mid- dle of all of those discussions. We know what can happen. For it to happen, we have to get these agreements sooner rather than later. Let's get them up here. Let's get them passed. Let's get them back in the hands of our new trading partners and see these jobs in-crease. I am pleased to recognize and encour- age the ongoing efforts for this effort with my good friend, Mr. I SAKSON . Mr. ISAKSON. I thank Senator BLUNT . I thank Senator J OHANNS for orga- nizing this colloquy. I represent a State that is home to the second largest port on the eastern seaboard in the United States of Amer-ica. The port is Savannah. We are talk-ing about creating jobs in America. The port of Savannah directly employs 300,000 people in the southeastern United States. Can you think of what an impact this is going to have to in-crease that employment if we get these free trade agreements? Let me give you an example that is amazing. South Korea surpassed Japan in 2010 as the second largest Northeast Asian destination for South Atlantic exports behind only China\u2014second largest in all of Asia behind only China\u2014most of that going out of the port of Savannah, most of that being agricultural products from your State and from your State and from mine. Senator P ORTMAN talked about pork. In Georgia it is all about chickens and cattle. We are No. 1 in poultry, and South Korea is a huge importer of our poultry. They would be a lot bigger with a free trade agreement. Let me give another number that is chilling. South Korea's imports from South Korea into the United States went up by 26 percent last year. Our ex-ports to them went up by 15 percent. That is an 11-percent negative in the trade deficit, which causes us tremen-dous problems. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask for unanimous consent for 5 addi-tional minutes to close. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. Mr. ISAKSON. So my point is very simply this: We can help to balance our trade deficit. We can help to increase employment in the southeastern United States. We can help poultry, we can help pork, and we can help beef. It has been 968 days since the President could have sent us these free trade agreements, and he has not. My point in this debate is very simple. There is VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5592 September 14, 2011 one person in the United States of America standing between us and more job creation, and it is the resident of the White House, President Obama. I wish to turn it over to the organizer of this event, Senator J OHANNS . Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I end my comments today by saying to all of my fellow Senators, thank you so very much for coming to the floor today and making the case. There is an old saying in a profession I used to be engaged in: I rest my case. Well, after hearing from these fine gentlemen about the importance of these agree-ments and why we need to have the President send them here, I rest my case. It is going to improve job cre-ation. It is going to improve our oppor-tunity to export our products. It is going to level the playing field. It is going to give our producers the oppor-tunity to reclaim market share that has been lost while we have been wait-ing for these agreements to come here. The final point I wish to make is this. I come from a State where unem-ployment is right above 4 percent. In this recession in Nebraska, unemploy-ment never went over 5 percent. In fact, as I was doing my townhall meet-ings across the State, I had members of my business community coming to me and saying: One of the challenges we are facing is finding the workers for the jobs we are creating. Therefore, in my State, trade adjustment assistance would not be the high priority it is in many States. Notwithstanding that fact, when Senator B LUNT came to me and said, look, the President is insist-ing on trade adjustment assistance as a condition to move these agreements and would I sign on to a letter that will back trade adjustment assistance, I said I would. Why? Because the trade agreements are important to us. It is my hope that after the many speeches we have all given\u2014the many speeches I have given on the impor-tance of these agreements not only on the Senate floor but across this coun-try\u2014the President is listening and will finally send us these agreements so we can work with the President. We can join forces on these agreements and do everything we can to get the votes in the Senate and in the House to pass them and to put them on his desk and create 250,000 new jobs. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The Senator from Connecticut. f DISASTER RELIEF Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi- dent, over the past 2 weeks, I have traveled the State of Connecticut, as the Presiding Officer has done in the State of New York, and she has de-scribed eloquently the damage she has seen in her State. I have seen much the same in mine. I have seen the destruc-tion of small businesses, of homes; riv-ers swelling, flooding of historic di-mensions causing significant destruc-tion; the wind and rain striking Con-necticut with a fury, its ferocity vir- tually unmatched in recent memory. I met with families and community leaders, farmers and small businesses, about the help they will need to rebuild their homes and their businesses and their lives and their livelihoods. It is a powerful and moving struggle. The citi-zens of Connecticut, similar to the citi-zens of New York and others struck by this storm, have acted with determina-tion and resolve, not with desperation or despair. They are determined and dedicated to rebuild and recover from this storm, but they need the help that is provided by FEMA. We are here, hopefully in a bipartisan effort, to make sure these communities and oth-ers like them throughout the North-east and throughout the United States have the help and the real consequen-tial aid they need to make this recov-ery in rebuilding their lives. The early estimates suggest that the damage caused by Irene could reach more than $10 billion, making it one of the 10 costliest disasters in U.S. his-tory. The suffering and real sadness of Connecticut citizens gives us a bond and a cause in common with millions of other Americans who have suffered from hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and other natural disasters across the country. This year alone, we have seen flooding on the Mississippi and Mis-souri Rivers and other rivers in the Midwest, devastating tornadoes in the South, wildfires in the South and West, and now Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. In times of natural disaster, Ameri- cans come together. In times when they face crises, Americans rally as neighbors, as a community. Regardless of specific States where they live, they come together to rebuild their homes, to make common cause, to recognize our bonds as a nation. The spirit of our Nation is that we put people above pol-itics every time, without exception; that we provide disaster relief for vic-tims, such as Connecticut residents now, and with the resources they need to rebuild. Currently, FEMA is funding disaster relief for over 550 disasters, including 29 in Oklahoma, 21 in Kentucky, 17 in Texas, 19 in Mississippi, and 18 in Kan-sas. Yet 2 weeks ago, House majority leader E RICCANTOR stated that relief funds for Hurricane Irene would need to be offset by savings found elsewhere in the Federal budget. I reject that contention and so should this body and my colleagues from those States I have just named and all the other States in the Union. In fact, all but a handful or less have received and are receiving disaster relief just since January of this year. We need to do everything we can to put Connecticut and America back to work, to make sure our economy moves forward again, to create jobs, and to reduce the deficit. Yes, we need to reduce the deficit and the debt and cut unnecessary and wasteful spending. However, we cannot permit Wash-ington politics to create a legislative logjam and gridlock that bogs down these efforts for disaster relief. The need is too urgent for thousands of families and businesses in Connecticut and around the country that have been devastated by these unprecedented floods and other natural disasters, such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and tornadoes. Turning disaster assistance into a po- litical football is unacceptable and un-conscionable. It is a recipe for gridlock and it is just plain wrong. It is wrong and a disservice to the men and women whose homes and businesses have been hit by the forces of nature that are un-predictable and unpreventable. Now they are attempting to rebuild their lives, and we owe it to them to match their courage and resilience with ef-forts from FEMA. We can't prevent those hurricanes or tornadoes or wildfires, but we can step forward when these disasters occur and lend a hand to our neighbors, as we have done throughout our history, and we can provide these communities with the real resources they need to recover, without distinguishing between what State or what part of the country. There is one story from Connecticut which I think tells a lot about the choices we face right now. Mel Gold-stein and his wife Arlene, whose home was completely destroyed by flooding caused by Hurricane Irene, are being told their homeowners insurance will not cover the damage. Their only hope of recovery is FEMA flood insurance and other FEMA assistance. Right now, they are using their savings to stay in a hotel while they rebuild their lives. Mel is one of the best known weathermen in the State of Con-necticut. He is an icon in the broad-casting world and a hero to many of us for his struggle against cancer. His treatment in this unstable environ-ment at this point in his recovery adds an unnecessary toll and stress to their lives. As we have in the past, we must come together to help folks such as Ar-lene and Mel Goldstein move on after the unthinkable happens in their lives. The unthinkable happened to them and to many of their neighbors in East Haven along the shores of Connecticut. I have heard their voices and seen their faces throughout our State, in communities big and small, where flooding has put a small business out of business and where homes have been destroyed and people are living in shel-ters or with their neighbors or were for awhile. These kinds of human stories are part of the fabric of the larger story we need to recognize. I hope my colleagues will come together, as we did on the vote yesterday, to approve this measure. The vote yesterday sig-naled perhaps a return to the biparti-sanship that should prevail when the Nation confronts crisis and disaster. Our No. 1 goal, which should be a bipar-tisan goal, must be to deliver help to our fellow Americans as quickly as pos-sible. VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 \u2014 SENATE S5593 September 14, 2011 Thank you. I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. B LUMENTHAL ). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee left a trail of devastation across New York State. I saw firsthand the impact they left on our communities: hundreds of families living in shelters, complete homes destroyed, belongings piled up on people's front yards, small businesses uncertain whether they would even reopen and worrying about whether they could hire back their em-ployees, farms that had no feed for livestock for days, crops and liveli-hoods vanishing without any trace in a single day, crumbling bridges, washed- out roads, heating oil soaking into buildings and the ground. I was born and raised in upstate New York, and I can say we have never seen this kind of devastation\u2014certainly not in my life-time. America has always stood by those who have suffered greatly from disaster and we have always helped them to re-build. We have an obligation to these families, businesses, and farmers to help them rebuild today. This picture is of downtown Bing- hamton. I met with hundreds of fami-lies displaced and placed in a Red Cross shelter at the University of Bing-hamton. They were on day four at the shelter, unclear if they would be able to see what was left of their homes. I can't fully describe the worry and fear in the eyes of parents who are in a shelter with their children. I talked to one mother who has 10 children, the youngest of whom was 2 years old, try-ing desperately to keep them fed, keep them safe but literally having no sense of when she could return to her home and what it would look like when she returned. I talked to one father whose daughter turned 13 years old that day in the shelter and his worry was mostly: I don't know what is in front of us. I don't know when we will be able to go home. I don't know how much has been destroyed, and I don't know how I will rebuild. One parent I talked to was a young mother. She held a 6-week-old infant in her arms, and she said to me: I have ev-erything I need right here. That exem-plified the courage of Americans when they fight through suffering\u2014the strength of New Yorkers that they will pull themselves up by their own boot-straps and make the difference. But we in Washington must help. In Schoharie County, on the main street of the villages of both Schoharie and Middleburgh, every single home was flooded. The water mark was at about 7 feet. As you drive down the main street and begin to talk to the business owners and the families, you can see there was not one left un- touched. Every piece of these families' belongings is literally on the front lawns of these homes and businesses. But I watched these business owners begin to rebuild. I could see them lit-erally bringing the mud from the base-ments, bringing the mud from their ground floors, pulling down all the drywall because obviously the damage was so great it would cause long-last-ing damage. People are very worried about how they can make sure their business is safe. This is just a snapshot right here in this picture of the town of Middleburgh. This is the farming com-munity within Schoharie County. These farmers have lost everything. I can tell you, the water was so strong, the surge was so great, it literally took trees out of the ground, completely up-rooted and overturned. The crops that we could see on this farm\u2014they were so covered with silt from the river, we could not even recognize what kind of crops they were. I saw potatoes that had been uprooted from the ground all over the road. That farmer could sal-vage nothing of their farm. We had one farmer who came down to meet with me because her cows were stranded. They had 800 cows stuck be-cause the roads had been completely washed out. They had no way to get feed up to those cows. They had no way to deal with manure and dump all the milk that had to be destroyed. They needed a rescue effort. Because of the efforts of our Governor\u2014he reacted quickly\u2014our National Guard got up there, got food and water up to those farmers, they fixed the road, and the feed was delivered. But this is the kind of reaction we need from government. This is why the Federal Government must be there to help and protect these families and businesses. Our next picture is of Greene County. In Greene County, waters rushed down the main street of Windham\u2014this is a picture of Windham\u2014and destroyed all businesses in its wake. The homes of families were also destroyed. There was absolute destruction throughout Greene County. I talked to just one business owner, and she had a business for children's clothing, children's needs, children's toys. She had just a couple employees, but she said: I have nothing to rebuild. I have no way that I can rebuild my business. I don't think I could rehire those employees. So there is the feeling of hopelessness and worry and dread and concern on top of a very tough economy anyway. These are the businesses and families and farmers we need to help because we need them to rebuild. We need them to have the ability to rehire those em-ployees, to produce food for our fami-lies, to make sure we have thriving communities once again. The last picture I wish to show is of Keene, up in the North Country. In Keene, the river rose 22 feet above the flood stage, washing out roads and bridges, and it left much of the town actually stranded for days. Half the town's firehouse was ripped apart and swept away by the river. Up in the High Peaks, the rain came down so hard it brought huge chunks of the mountainside with it, creating slides that have changed the face of the Adi-rondacks for generations. As you can see, this is just four com- munities. Throughout New York State\u2014the North Country, the Capital Region, the Mohawk Valley, the Hud-son Valley, the Southern Tier, and Long Island\u2014no one can question the absolute devastation that these storms have left in our communities. We must stand with them in their greatest time of need. Federal assistance is essential to help these families, these farmers, these businesses, and communities not only recover but rebuild and be strong-er than they were before. We need immediate funding for FEMA and the USDA disaster assist-ance to provide relief for these commu-nities all across New York and for all the other States that were affected by these storms. f SYRIA SANCTIONS ACT OF 2011 Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I would now like to address a second issue that is causing me very grave concern. I would like to talk for a mo-ment about a piece of legislation I have introduced with Senators K IRK and LIEBERMAN to toughen the sanctions on Syria. Syrian President Assad has killed over 2,000 of his own people in an alarming torrent of violence from one of the world's most repressive re-gimes\u20142,200 people are estimated to have died so far. Assad's aggression against the Syr- ian people is matched by his subversive aggression abroad. His regime is a state sponsor of terrorism, one of Iran's closest allies, and a key backer of Hamas and Hezbollah. Assad's re-gime has for years helped foreign fight-ers enter Iraq and kill our U.S. sol-diers. In response to this violent crack- down, I introduced the bipartisan Syria Sanctions Act of 2011 to hold Assad's regime accountable. This legislation would block access to the U.S. market for companies that invest in Syria's en-ergy sector, purchase the county's oil, and sell gasoline to Syria. This sanc-tion is critical, since Syria's energy sector accounts for one-third of that state's revenue. I ask my colleagues to sponsor S. 1472 and send a clear message to Syria that until the Assad regime responds to the democratic urging of its people, halts its nuclear development, and ends sup-port for terrorism, Syria will not and should not have access to the global economy, and any company that does business with Syria will no longer have access to the global economy. VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5594 September 14, 2011 This legislation is very clear and simple: that no company should be al-lowed to put their profits before our national security.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.J. Res. 66, which the clerk will report by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to the consideration of a joint resolution (H.J. Res. 66) approving the renewal of import restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise to speak about the need to have a disaster assistance effort to support those in New York, your State, as well as across the country and the tremen-dous needs we have as a result of what has happened regarding the weather. This year we have seen a terrible string of natural disasters that have shut down businesses, farms, and left fami-lies homeless all across our country. As chair of the Agriculture Committee, I am particularly focused, of course, on what has happened to our farmers in America. I am concerned about the flooding along the Mississippi and Missouri Riv-ers, the record droughts that have dev-astated the livelihoods of men and women who grow our food all across America. Earlier this year we had the worst drought in recorded history in Oklahoma, with about $1.6 billion in crop losses. In Kansas I have had the opportunity, and my staff has, to join with my ranking member, my col-league, Senator R OBERTS , to talk with folks and a chance to see that the drought had wiped out about $2 billion in crops. Floods in the Mississippi River Val- ley washed over 3 million acres\u20143 mil-lion acres\u2014of farmland. Hurricane Irene destroyed more than 450,000 acres of cotton and 300,000 acres of corn in North Carolina. In New York we have seen similar damage to corn, soybeans, alfalfa, fruits, and vegetables. In Vermont crop losses are estimated at more than $5 million. All across our country we have seri- ous challenges that are creating hard-ships for our businesses, our farmers, and our families. We need to respond. That is our responsibility. Right now the droughts are worse in Texas where the damage is also in the billions of dollars. We have more than 1,000 homes that have been lost. Already this year there have been natural disasters in 48 of our States\u201448 out of 50 States have had natural disas-ters. Michigan, thank goodness, is one of the two States that has not been af-fected by the weather. But throughout our Nation's history when men and women in one part of the country were hit with a natural disaster, all of America came together to support them and to help rebuild. That is what this effort is about, coming together as Americans. That is who we are as Americans. We stand with each other in times of trouble. This is not the time to play politics, not when hundreds of thousands of families, farmers, and businesses have been devastated by an unprecedented string of floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, and other natural disasters. Already, FEMA has had to halt re- building efforts in 41 States. So it is critical that we get this done. This leg-islation in front of us needs to pass, and it needs to pass quickly. But I also want to tell you about an- other emergency that has taken place in my State and in too many other States. It is called a jobs emergency. We may not have been affected by the natural disasters of the weather, but as we look over the last decade in a global economy, as the economy has changed we have been through the same kind of devastation\u2014over a longer period of time, but our people are affected as much as any other State disaster. We have 14 million people out of work in this country\u201414 million people out of work. We have a huge national deficit. We will never get out of debt with more than 14 million people out of work. We have to make smart decisions on cutting what is not important, and we have to grow. We have to create jobs for people and support the efforts of the private sector to create jobs. For each and every one of those fami- lies, their job search is an emergency. It is an emergency every time they think about how to put food on their table. It is an emergency every month when they have to scrape together money for the rent or the mortgage. It is an emergency every minute of every day when those men and women are filling out applications, going to job fairs, trying their best to get back to work. So I find in the middle of all of this, in the middle of support for all that is going on around the country in terms of natural disasters, it is extremely concerning\u2014and in fact outrageous to me\u2014that the House Republicans have proposed a job-killing offset to pay for the help that is critically needed for natural disasters; that would pull the rug out from under businesses and fam-ilies all across our country and put up to 50,000 American jobs at risk. That is what they are proposing. I absolutely oppose this. They pro- pose paying for this critical disaster bill by taking dollars out of a very suc-cessful advanced manufacturing retool- ing program that we passed in the 2007 Energy bill\u2014and it took a while to get it up and going. The previous adminis-tration never administered it. I thank the Obama administration for coming in in 2009 and beginning the process of putting it together and all of the rules it took, and so on. So it took a while to get up and going. It has not moved as fast as I would like at all. But, thank goodness, the Obama administration saw it as a priority and has moved for-ward to put it in place. So what has happened already? Well, these retooling loans have meant 41,000 jobs in Tennessee, California, Indiana, Michigan, Delaware, Illinois, Ken-tucky, Ohio, and Missouri. These re-tooling loans have helped companies retool older manufacturing plants to build the products of the future in America rather than shipping those jobs overseas. It has been extremely successful. In Michigan retooling loans made it possible for Ford Motor Company to save 1,900 jobs at the Michigan assem-bly plant in the city of Wayne so they could build the all new Ford Focus and the battery-electric Focus in America. In the process of that, as we partnered with them on battery funding as well\u2014 in the process of that, with the help of these retooling loans they are bringing jobs back from Mexico to support the work they are doing on the new vehi-cles. I do not know how many economic development efforts we can stand on the Senate floor today and talk about in the Senate or House that are actu-ally bringing jobs back from overseas. This is the program that the House Re-publicans want to cut. This loan\u2014and it is a loan, so it has to be repaid\u2014is allowing them to be able to have lower costs to be able to do the retooling on those older plants, to be able to make these new high-tech vehicles. As I said, in the case of the Ford Motor Company, they have saved 1,900 jobs and are bringing jobs back from Mexico. Another Michigan company, Severstal North America, was able to secure a retooling loan to retool an old steel mill, the Rouge steel mill in Michigan, into a cutting-edge plant building advanced, high-strength steel for automotive production. Jobs here. That does not count what is happening in States across America. That loan, along with private loans and a billion-dollar investment from the company, will help create over 2,500 constructive jobs and will bring the total number of permanent manufac-turing jobs at that plant, again, to VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5595 September 14, 2011 1,900. That is a pretty good investment from a loan that is going to be paid back while creating jobs. These are the kinds of things that we need to be doing\u2014we need to be doing\u2014 to address the jobs emergency that Michigan and States all across the country are feeling and have been feel-ing. Right now there are 35 to 40,000 jobs at stake in this proposal by the House Republicans. We have other companies that want to use the retooling loans to make things in America\u2014in Michigan, Illi-nois, Ohio, Indiana, Louisiana, and Florida. These loans are expected to be approved in the next few months. They are very close, and we would see 35 to 40,000 jobs disappear\u2014the opportunity for those jobs to disappear\u2014if we were to accept the House proposal. After the next round of manufac- turing retooling loans, we could see an-other 10,000 jobs created across the country. But if these retooling loans do not happen, those jobs will not happen either. To add insult to injury, these companies have been working closely with the Department of Energy, in some cases for several years, in order to qualify for these loans. They have had to undergo the must rigorous screening to make sure the products and companies are in sound fi-nancial shape, as they should. We need to make sure they are going through rigorous screening not only so they can be successful but to make sure that we are making products in America. It is an important project and partnership. These companies have invested countless hours and, frankly, a lot of money to get these projects off the ground and to get to this point. As I in-dicated, we have a number of compa-nies in States around the country that are within a month or 2 months or 3 months from being able to complete the deal and create the jobs. We are so close, and the rug will be pulled out from under not only the companies but the communities and the families who are affected. These businesses are America's job creators. They are doing the right thing. They want to invest in America. While oth-ers have been on the sidelines waiting, they have jumped in. They are com-mitted to creating jobs. They want to make things here, and they have moved through a process, spent time, money\u2014a tremendous amount of time. In fact, in my judgment, it hasn't moved as fast as it should. But they are now at a point to actually make it happen. I am outraged that we would see an effort to end the creation of these jobs. There is no question, as I said, that we have had a series of natural disasters, and families, businesses, and farmers who are affected across this country. Even though those natural disasters, fortunately for us, did not come to Michigan, I support the effort to ad-dress them. We are all in this as Ameri-cans. But I will not\u2014I will not\u2014sup-port an effort that, in the process, takes tens of thousands of jobs away, because the crisis for Michigan is a jobs crisis. We were the first ones in it. We have been in it the longest. We are coming out of it now but way too slow-ly. We are coming out of it because we have been creating partnerships to sup-port the private sector to make things in America again. I strongly urge everyone involved not to come forward with something that will in fact jeopardize these jobs. It makes absolutely no sense to me, and it is certainly something I will strong-ly oppose if it does. I yield the floor and suggest the ab- sence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore.

Madam President, there is a tax scam that is going on in this country for which you certainly have to give some creativity to these thieves and robbers\u2014and that is exactly what they are. I first started to get wind of this when people in the Tampa Bay region of my State called in saying an inter-esting thing happened. They had sent in their income tax return, and they got back a notice from the IRS that their return had already been filed. What they found out was that some-body had stolen their Social Security number, had in their name filled out a tax return, and then, guess what. It showed they had a tax refund due. When I started hearing from about 25 or 30 people, I knew there was some-thing going on. Sure enough, law en-forcement in the Tampa Bay region\u2014 the sheriff's office, the city police, combined with the State attorney and the U.S. Attorney\u2014a couple of weeks ago had a bust and arrested 49 people who were in a scam whereby they pro-cure people's Social Security numbers. What is unbelievable is the amount of money they were getting back, esti-mated at being, just in the Tampa Bay region, something like $100 million in refunds. That is a rip-off of the Amer-ican taxpayer because that is their money. But the story doesn't stop there. Oh, if you were one of the victims whose Social Security number had been sto-len and you wanted to file your tax re-turn, the IRS is telling you you can't do it because you have already filed a tax return. Guess what a nightmare that is for the legitimate taxpayer. So we have filed legislation. A num- ber of Senators have joined me. No. 1, one of the unbelievable things was that it was difficult to get the IRS to co-operate with the local and State law enforcement agencies, because the IRS is prohibited because of privacy from sharing any of this information. And, of course, we want to protect the pri-vacy of people, but we also want to go after these crooks. We had done it a few years ago with regard to inmates in the Federal prison system by allowing the IRS, under the law we passed back in 2008, to cooper-ate with the Federal prison system in order to get the inmates who were fil-ing false tax returns to get tax refunds. That was extended administratively into the State prison system with the IRS. But then this has been taken to a new level, one in which it is a great rip-off of the taxpayers. What was incredible is when the Tampa police department and the sher-iff's department ended up arresting some of these people, it was as if they didn't know they had done anything wrong. What is going on? They did not know they had done anything wrong, and they are driving around in BMWs, with Rolex watches and gold chains all over them. It is the use of tools in the elec-tronic age just the same as yesterday, when the thief used a crowbar to break in and steal somebody's possessions. This has to stop. What we do not know is the extent to which this is all over the country. So the first thing we have to do is get the legal ability for the IRS, without di-vulging people's private financial infor-mation, to be able to cooperate with local and State law enforcement and the U.S. attorney to be able to go after these people, to identify them so the U.S. attorney and the State attorney can prosecute. Additionally, we have to help the vic- tims. In this legislation we filed, we say the IRS will give the victims a spe-cial PIN number so they can file a re-turn and that PIN number will identify them as a victim and it will not be kicked out of the system. Additionally, since so much of this is being done electronically, we have to give the taxpayer the option to file what we called in the old days a paper tax return and in the process see if we can stop this; otherwise, if $100 million has been stolen from the American tax-payer just in the Tampa Bay region of Florida, you can imagine how exten-sive this crime probably is across the entire country. It is important we act and that we get to the bottom of it. If we pass a law, a crook will try to figure out a way to get around it. But when some-body in this electronic age can just sit at a computer, steal a Social Security number and then file a false tax return, enough is enough. VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5596 September 14, 2011 It is my delight to see my colleague from Maryland. It looks as if he has some good stuff to tell us. I yield the floor. Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I am not sure it is good stuff, but it is what has happened in our State. I thank the Senator from Florida for his leadership on so many of these issues and his com-ments on the floor of the Senate. About 2 weeks ago, right before Hur- ricane Irene struck, I was at the Mary-land Emergency Management Center located in Reisterstown, MD. I was with Governor O'Malley, the Governor of our State, and other leaders. I saw our team there to prepare the people of Maryland for the onslaught of Irene and later from Tropical Storm Lee. I saw Maryland preparing the best it possibly could to minimize the risk to the people of our State from a natural storm. I saw the local officials do the right thing and tell people in our coast-al areas to evacuate their homes be-cause of the potential risk to life and property from this massive storm. I also saw another agency that was located right there, side by side with the Maryland agencies, and that was FEMA, the Federal officials. These were people I met for the first time. They were not from Maryland. They had come in from other States to help the people of Maryland and provided the expertise to our State officials so we could properly prepare for this storm that was potentially damaging to the people of Maryland. They were there. I thank President Obama for declar- ing, before the storm hit, emergency declarations to Maryland so we could utilize Federal resources and we could take maximum steps to minimize the loss of life and property. It was the right thing to do. I take this time on the floor\u2014I am going to talk a little bit about the damages that occurred in my State\u2014to point out that we have always come to-gether as a nation to stand by those who have been devastated through these natural disasters. This has been a particularly rough year. We have seen hurricanes and storms and tornadoes and flooding and even an earthquake on the east coast of the United States. This has challenged our ability to re-spond in a timely way. We have a re-sponsibility to make sure our Federal agencies have the resources to re-spond\u2014how they were able to be about Maryland before the storm, during the storm and after the storm and they are there now to help the people of Mary-land. Our governments\u2014our local gov-ernments, our businesses, and our resi-dents are counting on that continued Federal purpose to get us through this very difficult period. Hurricane Irene caused severe storms, flooding, and strong winds in the State of Maryland. It was followed by Tropical Storm Lee, which aggra-vated the flooding and other damage throughout the State, including dam-age to roads, water treatment plants, and agriculture. Our agricultural com- munity was hit hard. Our water treat-ment facilities, the plants we depend upon to keep our waters clean and to keep our neighborhoods safe, were damaged severely by this storm. I have talked to our transportation people. Roads were knocked out. Damage was caused. On the Eastern Shore of Maryland, as I have already indicated, there was a mandatory order for evacuation of Ocean City the weekend before the Labor Day weekend, resulting in heavy economic losses during one of the most profitable periods during the summer for that city. The flooding in Queen Anne's County destroyed railroad tracks. I have a photograph. This is, by the way, railroad tracks. They have been knocked out by the hurricane. As you can see, this required emergency attention. Multiple roads were closed and nu- merous homes were flooded in the town of Millington after the Chester River flooded over its banks. In Millington, the wastewater treatment plant was disabled, also affecting the residents in Kent County. The storm in Talbot County caused roads and pipeline dam-age. Let me show you this photograph, if I might, because I think it points out the problem. When that amount of water goes through the storm pipes, it can cause significant damage because these pipes were not able to handle the amount of water that was brought down by the hurricane and tropical storm. As a result, the pipes burst, causing the road which the pipe was under to give way, bringing about a road closure. That was terribly incon-venient, of course, to the people of that area, the businesses, et cetera. I am showing an example in Talbot County, MD, on the Eastern Shore. We could show numerous other examples of the failure of stormwater management pipes as well as roads that had to be closed for public safety. In Caroline County, the towns of Federalsburg and Greensboro experienced major flooding of the Choptank River, including the malfunctioning of a wastewater treat-ment plant. In Cecil and Harford Coun-ties, Irene led to the opening of a sig-nificant number of floodgates at the Conowingo Dam, due to rising water levels feeding in from the Susquehanna River. This was the first time the engi-neers took such measures since Trop-ical Storm Isabel hit Maryland in 2003. Opening the floodgates led to flooding and property damage in many areas, and mandatory evacuation orders were issued for Port Deposit and Havre de Grace, in Maryland. People had to leave their homes. The streets were underwater. When the water receded, there was muck and damage to the towns. In southern Maryland, damage from metal on a roof that was blown into a transformer forced the shutdown of a reactor at Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant. In Calvert County, many of the substations were damaged and rendered inoperable during Irene, resulting in widespread power outages for many customers and that forced businesses to close for several days. You heard about power outages. We had whole counties where everyone was out of power\u2014everyone. In most of our coun-ties the majority of people lost their power, not for a couple hours, for many days, causing major disruptions to our businesses, to our families, to schools that could not open and, therefore, par-ents who could not go to work because they had to deal with the unexpected news that the schools would be closed because there was no power in the schools themselves. In the Washington metro region, Irene and the additional storms caused severe power outages and flooding in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. In Prince George's County, the loss of power caused thousands of basements to flood. As you know, with-out power you cannot use your sump pumps. Without that, there is signifi-cant damage. Frankly, because the water came in from the low level rather than from the roof, these property owners are now being challenged as to whether their insurance will cover this damage. That raises the importance, I might say, of the Federal protections that are avail-able when a disaster is declared an emergency by the President because of the altercations over what insurance does not cover. All the more reason why the Federal Government must be there in its traditional role to help communities when a storm or emer-gency occurs. Hurricane Irene and subsequent storms required governments to incur additional expenses due to overtime needed for first responders who save lives and property after the storm. I must tell you, I saw those first re-sponders. I saw them out there working 24-hour shifts in some cases. They didn't get home to their families be-cause they were there to help us main-tain order and help reduce the loss of life and the loss of property. I thank President Obama for making a timely major disaster declaration for the State of Maryland in advance of the hurricane. Maryland is now eligible for Federal disaster recovery dollars through the Federal Emergency Man-agement Agency. The State budget has already been very much impacted. We all understand our States do not have the flexibility of our country. It is dur-ing emergencies that our State and local leaders look to Washington, look to their Federal Government to be there as a partner to deal with this issue that States cannot deal with. Congress has always acted in a bipar- tisan manner to help Americans and their communities recover from nat-ural disasters. Congress has never in-sisted that disaster fund being offset. Let me explain this issue because it may be confusing to the people who are watching. Yes, the Federal Emergency VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5597 September 14, 2011 Management Agency has a budget. FEMA has a budget. But you cannot predict the number and scope of nat-ural disasters. No one had predicted this storm would be as widespread as it was. Hurricane Irene affected the en-tire east coast of the United States. FEMA did not have in its budget that type of a scenario, along with the tor-nadoes we had, along with what has happened in the Midwest. During this period, we have seen 48 of our States declared eligible for FEMA assistance. This affects our entire country. Now the people on the east coast of the United States are looking to the Fed-eral Government to be there. We have always done this, as I said, in a bipar-tisan manner, without the requirement that if additional moneys are needed, those moneys will be appropriated by Congress. We will not ask other agen-cies to have to contribute toward that because that was not anticipated when we did the budget. I might point out that we had a very contentious fight over the Budget Control Act. That is the bill we passed that allowed us to increase our debt ceiling and set our budget allocations for fiscal year 2012, the year that will start on October 1. As you know, there was an agree- ment in that Budget Control Act that permits the modification of the fiscal year 2012 discretionary cap to be ad-justed to accommodate additional dis-aster relief funding without an offset. That is what we did. We came together as one entity recognizing we cannot predict the next hurricane, storm, earthquake, flood, or tornado. We just cannot predict that. Therefore, Demo-crats and Republicans said adjust the cap. Meet whatever disaster is out there. Whether it was Katrina in Lou-isiana, whether it is a bridge falling down in Minnesota that the Presiding Officer had to deal with, whether it is tornadoes as we had in the Midwest, droughts and floods that occurred in our country, we will be there to help the people of America. We helped re-build countries around the world. We want to make sure we help the commu-nities. I was with my colleagues from Vermont, and they shared with us the number of bridges that had been wiped out, people who have been isolated as a result of Hurricane Irene and then Tropical Storm Lee. We have a respon-sibility, and we recognize that in the budget agreement, that we adjust the caps without setoffs so the Federal Government can be there as a true partner in dealing with these issues. We were there for preparation. It is now time to help restore the commu-nities. In some cases it will take months before we are back to normal. We know that, the people know that, but they have a right to expect that the Federal Government will be there to help. I commend Senator L ANDRIEU , the chair of the Homeland Security Sub-committee of the Appropriations Com-mittee; Senator I NOUYE and the mem-bers of the Senate Appropriations Com- mittee. They recognize that. They have given us a budget that will accommo-date the extra needs so FEMA will have the resources it wants. I thank President Obama. His budget request to us reflects the resources we need so we have the recommendation from our Appropriations Committee. We have the leadership from the White House. Now it is time for us to act. We have the vehicle on the floor of the Senate. It is time for us to give the re-sources to the Federal agencies so they can be there in all parts of this coun-try\u2014including helping the people of Maryland cope with the disaster of Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee and the other natural disasters that have happened in other parts of the country by\u2014taking up this issue now, passing it at this moment so the funds are there and the resources are there. We can live up to the historical mis- sion of the United States to always be there to help any part of our Nation af-fected by a natural disaster. I hope we will be able to bring up this issue quickly. As the vote in the Senate Ap-propriations Committee indicated, it should not be delayed because of offset issues. We should get the needed funds and resources to the agency, working with our State and local governments, working for our local communities so we can try to restore and rebuild those areas that have been devastated by these natural disasters. I would urge us to do that as quickly as possible. Mr. President, I would yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. F RANKEN ). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. TRIBUTE TO TIM O 'KEEFE Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to bid a fond farewell to a man who has been a fixture in the Sen-ate for 33 years. Mr. Tim O'Keefe of the Senate Disbursing Office is retiring today after more than three decades of service to this body and his country. Known to many as a loyal friend and well liked by nearly everyone he has met in these halls\u2014including most of my colleagues and thousands of Senate staffers\u2014he will be greatly missed. Tim began his career with the dis- bursing office, and in the Senate, in 1978. Every Senate employee becomes familiar with that office early in their tenure because that is the office in charge of the Senate payroll as well as everything relating to an employee's compensation, payroll deductions, re-tirement, life and health insurance, and other benefits. The disbursing of-fice used to be located in the Capitol when Tim started. In fact, it was lo-cated in S-233, which is now part of the Republican leader's office. During Tim's early years on the job, staffers and Senators alike would line up in the hallways on payday to receive their paychecks. Maybe that is how Tim be-came legendary for never forgetting a face or a name for so many members of this very large Senate family, and al-ways having a kind word for every one of them. The disbursing office moved in 1980 when my predecessor, Howard Baker, expanded the Republican leader's suite of offices. That is how Tim and his co-workers ended up in their now familiar location on the first floor of the Hart Building. Tim has kidded me about that a few times over the years. So on behalf of the Republican leader's office, let me take this opportunity to apolo-gize to him for being booted from his perch. Tim is a native Washingtonian. He attended St. John's College High School and the University of South Carolina, which has a heck of a good football team this year. Just as Tim is loyal to the Senate, he is a loyal alum-nus of both those institutions. He goes to Columbia, SC, every year to see South Carolina play football. Tim is also a great fan of the Washington Red-skins who, amazingly enough, are off to a good start this year. He has season tickets, and has been attending their games since his boyhood. He loves to talk football, college or pro, with folks in the office, but be careful if you are a Cowboys fan. Tim's father George O'Keefe was a distinguished veteran who fought in World War II. His mother Gisela O'Keefe worked for the District of Co-lumbia school system at Alice Deal Middle School. I know they would both be proud to see how well liked and well respected their son has become. Tim also has a brother, Dennis, who lives in South Carolina, and Tim lives in Alex-andria with his teenaged son Connor. When the disbursing office held a re- tirement party for Tim a few weeks ago, he got quite the sendoff. It was the day of the historic earthquake, felt all along eastern North America from Que-bec City to Atlanta and centered about 90 miles away in central Virginia. As Tim was opening his presents, the ground began to shake and the Capitol complex was soon evacuated. It is al-most as if Washington, DC, itself was protesting that it did not want Tim to go. Indeed, it will be hard for many to imagine the Senate with Tim gone. He has the longest tenure of anyone in the disbursing office today, and thousands of Senate staffers know him as the man who led them in the Federal oath of of-fice they take on their first day on the job\u2014the same oath the Vice President of the United States administers to Senators at the beginning of their 6- year terms. In his retirement, Tim will have time to pursue his many interests, including his love of horse racing. He is particu-larly a fan of Lexington, Kentucky's Keeneland racetrack. And I would be VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun SENATE S5598 September 14, 2011 remiss if I didn't mention that today, the day of his retirement, is also Tim's birthday. I know many on Capitol Hill, after hearing about his retirement, have taken a moment to say thank you and goodbye to Mr. Tim O'Keefe. I wanted to make sure I was one of them. He will be missed here in the Senate, and we are very grateful for his 33 years of service. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. POVERTY IN AMERICA Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, yester- day the Census Bureau released infor-mation about poverty, income, and health insurance in our country, and the news was, in short, devastating. The number of people in poverty is at an all-time high. Income gains over the last decade have been totally wiped out. Americans are struggling more than ever before. I am appalled by these facts and I know my colleagues are too. Today I wish to talk about these numbers, but I wish to talk about what we can do about them and about where our coun-try's priorities must be and how we have to focus on rebuilding the middle class in light of the new census num-bers. Yesterday we learned that 46.2 mil- lion people in America were poor last year. That is more than 15 percent of Americans. Let me remind my col-leagues what this means. The poverty line for a family of four with two adults and two children is $22,000\u2014just slightly over $22,000 a year. Can anyone here in this body\u2014and we all know what we make; every Senator, every Congressman, except leadership who get paid a little bit more, makes $174,000 a year. If we think to ourselves: Could we and our spouses and two chil-dren live on $22,000 a year, $425 a week? But, beyond that, we also learned that deep poverty; that is, families with in-comes less than half the poverty line, is also at the highest rate on record. More than 20 million Americans lived in deep poverty last year. That is just over $11,000 a year for a family of four. That is almost mind-boggling. How do people live like that? Our children are suffering incredibly high levels of poverty. The Census Bu-reau pointed out that 22 percent\u20141 out of every 5 kids in America\u2014were poor last year. When compared to other in-dustrialized nations\u2014the OECD coun-tries\u2014the United States has one of the highest rates of child poverty in the world. That is inexcusable. It is a na-tional crisis. It is something we should be discussing here on the Senate floor daily. In addition to our children, other vulnerable populations are suffering as well. People with disabilities continue to face higher poverty than people without disabilities. About 28 percent\u2014 almost 1 out of 3 individuals with dis-abilities in America\u2014are poor, com-pared with 12.5 percent of those with-out disabilities. That is twice the amount. Minorities also face devastating lev- els of poverty. More than a quarter of Blacks and Hispanics\u2014more than 25 percent or 1 in 4\u2014are in poverty in America. Again, keep in mind, for a family of four, that is just $22,000 a year. So 25 percent of Blacks and His-panics are in poverty, 10 percent of Whites, 13 percent of Asians. These dis-parities are deeply troubling. More than 10 million Black and Hispanic children woke up this morning in a household struggling with poverty. Again, we have to remember, while I talk about these as numbers, there is a real story, there is a real family, a real individual, a real child behind every one of them. There are 46 million stories about families sitting around their kitchen table\u2014if they are even lucky enough to have one\u2014struggling to figure out how to make ends meet, stories of people choosing between whether to pay the rent or pay the utility bills, choosing whether to pay for diapers or medica-tion for their kids, choosing whether to put food on the table or gasoline in the car\u2014so they might get to a minimum wage, part-time job someplace. This should not be happening in America. We have heard a lot of talk and I have heard Senators and Members of the House in speeches recently talking about how we cannot afford this and we cannot afford that because, let's face it, we are broke, we are deeply in debt in this country and we are broke. I beg to differ. The United States of America is today the richest country in the world\u2014the richest country in the his-tory of the world. If we are so rich, why are we so broke? We are not poor. We are the richest country in the world. So what this census report yesterday points out is this is a wake-up call that we are failing. We are failing our most vulner-able citizens. We are failing to provide a ladder of opportunity for people to become part of the middle class. We are destroying futures, destroying hope among our children. First and foremost, I think this re- port yesterday graphically illustrates how dangerous it would be if we as law-makers give in to the current atmos-phere of budget hysteria\u2014budget hysteria\u2014fear, and fatalism that is now going on on Capitol Hill. By giving in to it, we eviscerate the essential economic security programs just be-cause somehow we want to score polit-ical points. Well, people all know that most peo- ple in poverty have a higher rate of not voting than wealthier people. We know that. So I guess, if you want to get votes, you appeal to people who have money. If you want to get elected, you appeal to people who have money be-cause they are the ones who give you money to get elected by, like big cor-porations. So the poor are kind of for-gotten about. So if we give in to this budget hysteria, the first people who are usually hurt are the most vulner-able of our citizens. The Census Bureau's numbers show, again, without question how effective and important these safety net pro-grams are to keeping millions of people out of poverty. Social Security alone\u2014 according to the census numbers, kept 20 million people above the poverty line. Unemployment insurance kept 3.2 million more people out of poverty. We have always known these are cru- cial programs, but now we know just how important they are. And other programs, if they were counted by the official poverty measure, which they are not, would have lifted millions more people out of poverty. For exam-ple, the SNAP program\u2014food stamps\u2014 would have lifted 3.9 million people above poverty. The earned-income tax credit would have lifted 5.4 million peo-ple. Without these crucial safety net programs, the poverty situation would be much worse. Yet, mark my words, with this supercommittee that is meet-ing or whether we go into some kind of a sequestration or whatever that means around here, are we going to cut back on the food stamp program, are we going to cut back on unemployment insurance, maybe cut back on Social Security, as some would want to do, and Social Security benefits? That just means more people will fall below the poverty line. I think the second lesson we can learn from this report is about the crippling effect falling paychecks and rising inequality are having on our economy. Income went down again last year. Real median household income was $49,500. That is down 2.3 percent from the year before and down 6.4 per-cent since the start of the recession. This is not just the effect of the reces-sion; these are long-term economic trends that have caused a dramatic in-crease in the income inequality in this country, and it has been going on for at least the last three decades, little bit by little bit by little bit, to the point now where we have a huge disparity in income equality in this country. Again, paychecks for American work- ers are not falling because they are not working as hard or producing less. Ac-cording to testimony from former Sec-retary of Labor Robert Reich to the HELP Committee, the typical Amer-ican family is working more than 500 hours longer per year now than they were in 1979. Got that. The typical American family is working 500 hours longer per year than they were in 1979. In addition to working longer, their productivity, as measured by the Bu-reau of Labor Statistics, has continued to rise. VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun SENATE S5599 September 14, 2011 So what has happened? People are working longer. There is more produc-tion, more units per person per hour worked, and yet wages have fallen. Why is that? You would think wages and benefits would have gone up with longer hours and more productivity. Well, that is not what happened. It is not that companies cannot afford to pay their workers more. Profit margins of Standard & Poor's 500 companies are at their highest levels since the late 1960s. So what has happened during the last three decades, since 1979, is that the executives have shifted revenues from workers' paychecks to the cor-porate bottom lines and their own pockets\u2014more to profit, more to cap-ital, less to labor. We cannot allow these trends to con- tinue. Economists across the political spectrum agree that a major cause of our current economic stagnation is a chronic lack of demand. For nearly three decades, workers' incomes have been stagnant. Working families lack the purchasing power to drive Amer-ica's consumer economy. Without ade-quate demand, businesses are reluctant to invest and hire. Simply put, until we raise the numbers on people's pay-checks and the number of people work-ing and making a paycheck, the econ-omy will never recover. The final lesson I think we can learn from yesterday's census report is about health care. There is a small silver lin-ing here. While the recession is obvi-ously continuing to impact health care coverage, there are some signs that the early stages of implementation of the affordable care act, that is, the health care reform bill, are making a dif-ference. While the census data shows that the number of uninsured increased from 16.1 percent to 16.3 percent of the population\u2014the Census Bureau deemed this ''not statistically different''\u2014the affordable care act's requirement that health plans provide dependent cov-erage to young adults to stay on their parents' policy until age 26 is making a difference. The data from the Census Bureau shows that the 18-to-24 age group was the only group ''to experience a signifi-cant increase in the percentage with health insurance over the past year,'' up to 72.8 percent from 70.7 percent in 2009. So, again, there is a small silver lining there in terms of health care coverage for our younger population. So it is a modest step forward for young Americans. But the overall picture the census re- port reveals is a nation\u2014the United States of America\u2014on the brink of a crisis. It should be a call to action. I think the President's jobs bill is a good start. We have to create more jobs, not just any job but good-quality jobs that pay decent wages and benefits, a job to lift a family out of poverty and not to keep a family in it. Again, I have been paying attention a little bit to some of the debates that have been going on in the other party. I was looking at the figures from the State of Texas that more jobs have been created in Texas than any other part of the country. Well, when you look closely, Texas had by far the larg-est number of minimum wage jobs than any other state, and the number of minimum wage workers more than doubled between 2007 and 2010. That is our future\u2014minimum wage jobs at $7.25 an hour? That is barely $15,000 a year, under the poverty line for a fam-ily of four. Is that something to brag about, that we are creating more min-imum wage jobs that will just keep families in poverty? As I said, we need jobs to lift families out of poverty, not keep them down, under the poverty level. Lastly, I have said so many times here on the floor that we will not be able to tackle the problem of poverty in this country until we have a strong middle class and a clear path for people to become middle-class citizens. That means we should invest more in edu-cation, more in innovation, more in in-frastructure-building in this country. It means restoring a level playing field with fair taxation\u2014fair taxation. To repeat something the President said the other night\u2014why should Warren Buffett pay less of a percentage of his income than his secretary? You wonder why people get cynical about govern-ment. Of course they are cynical. They have every reason to be cynical when we pass these laws around here and we tax capital at a lower rate than we tax labor. Why should someone who is la-boring and working be taxed at a high-er rate than a wealthy person who maybe invested a lot of money, and they are putting it all into capital gains, and they are paying a lower rate of taxes than someone who is out there working for a living? Why is that fair? Well, we also need vibrant unions, vi- brant unions that can bargain collec-tively for their people for wages, hours, conditions of employment. We need a strong ladder of opportunity to give every American access to the middle class. So, again, yesterday's poverty num- bers told a bleak story about 46 million Americans who cannot make ends meet. I hope that next year at this time, when the new census numbers come out, we can begin to tell a dif-ferent story about how we acted boldly, with imagination and vision, to help these people turn their lives around and build a better future. In a nation as strong and as vibrant and, yes, as rich\u2014as rich\u2014as the United States of America, no one who works hard for a living should have to live in poverty, and we should not rest until that vision becomes a reality. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. U DALL of New Mexico). Without objec- tion, it is so ordered. SPIRIT OF COOPERATION Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, there has been a promising new tone in Con-gress since our return from the sum- mer recess. It has taken some by sur-prise. But even more striking than the new tone is that it has brought with it a few modest signs of a new spirit of cooperation. The House this week sent us the highway extension and an aviation ex-tension that are clean. During August, there were clamors from some corners in the other party to mount a fight over the gas tax or insist on harmful cuts to road and bridge repair, even if these demands risked a shutdown of road construction projects. As recently as last Friday, Republicans were plan-ning to insist on a 5-percent cut to the FAA budget\u2014a move that could well have threatened another shutdown of that agency like we saw in August. But both fears, fortunately, have receded. Barring a setback in the Senate, we should be able to extend both the FAA and highway measures on time and without controversy. This is a very positive sign. There was a sour taste left in everyone's mouth at the end of the debt ceiling de-bate, and that is causing a change in behavior. It is actually bringing us to-gether. That process was made unnec-essarily difficult because of the ex-treme tactics of a bloc within the House. The political process broke down and the public noticed. In the aftermath of that debate, it seems everybody finally realizes there is a premium on reasonableness. The public does not want to see more of the ''my way or the highway'' approach that has been exhibited by some in the House. That is why there was head scratching earlier this week to hear a new rumor in the Capitol that the House Republican leadership might consider seeking to reopen the debt ceiling fight, ignoring the agreed-upon spending level for the 2012 fiscal year. As you know, the deal included a top- line budget number of $1.043 trillion for the fiscal year that begins October 1. This was a significant cut, an actual cut from the fiscal 2011 level of $7 bil-lion. This agreement was ratified by all of those who voted for the final debt ceiling agreement. It was hailed as one of the better aspects of the overall debt ceiling deal because it would mean a lesser likelihood of another budget fight on September 30. However, since this number was agreed to, some extreme Republicans have started looking to cause trouble. They have tried to see the $7 billion in cuts represented by the $1.043 trillion figure as a floor, not a ceiling. This would be a violation not just of the spirit of the debt limit deal but the let-ter of it. The public will not stand for another budget fight. Republicans should un-derstand that more brinkmanship on VerDate Mar 15 2010 \u2014 SENATE S5600 September 14, 2011 the budget at the end of September is not in either side's interest. Some, thankfully, in the House leadership seem to realize this. Majority Leader C ANTOR , in a memo to the House Re- publican caucus sent in August, warned against picking another budget fight on the CR. Leader C ANTOR wrote: While all of us would like to have seen a lower discretionary appropriation ceiling for the upcoming fiscal year, the debt limit agreement set a level of spending that is a real cut from the current year. I believe it is in our interest to enact into law full-year ap-propriation bills at this new lower level. Leader C ANTOR affirmed these re- marks earlier this week: I say to my Republican colleagues, a deal is a deal. It's hard to imagine you would go back on the debt limit agreement, but if you are even considering it, please stop. We already will likely need to take time next week resolving what level of FEMA funding we should appropriate for fiscal year 2012. Earlier indications are that some House Republicans may want to shortchange the level of fund-ing FEMA says it needs for next year. I can't imagine why anyone would want to play games with disaster re-lief. But if they want to debate that, they should not also be tying it to an-other budget fight that we have al-ready resolved and that nearly caused a default for the first time in American history. We should not go back over those pages. We have had enough de-bates on the docket without reopening the ones we have already done. The public is tired of these fights, and the public understands who keeps instigating them. To the House Repub-licans I say: Don't go back on your word on the CR. Leader C ANTOR was right when he said in August you should abide by the level agreed to over the summer. Stick with that decision and let's move on to other issues. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Florida. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. Presi- dent, I am very happy to announce to the Senate that today NASA an-nounced its new, big rocket design, with the President stepping forth to in-dicate that he will request funding for the design and building of this rocket. I want to take the opportunity to share with the Senate what this rocket is going to be. To set the stage, you will recall that we have the Inter-national Space Station up in orbit now. There is a combination of six astro-nauts on board. It is an international crew. The space station itself\u2014people don't realize how big it is. If you think about sitting in a football stadium on the 50-yard line, and looking from one end zone to the other, that is how big the space station is\u2014120 yards long. The space shuttle has been the vehi- cle that we have used now for 30 years, the last 10 of which have been used to build the International Space Station. The Russians have been taking up some components, but the major com-ponents, the heavy components are being taken up in the cargo bay of the space shuttle and assembled over the last decade into the station. We have six astronauts doing research in the zero gravity of orbit. The future rockets going to and from the space station\u2014a space taxi, if you will\u2014are a competition among com-mercial rocket companies, and we think that competition will bring down significantly the cost of those rockets to take cargo and crew, and at the end of this year one version of those rock-ets will in fact launch, rendezvous, and dock with the space station and deliver cargo. To make those human rated, with all of the redundancies and escape systems to save human life, it is going to take another few years. Of course, it is a dis-appointment for so many of us that the new rocket, ready to go to and from the space station, as the space shuttle used to, is not ready for humans, even though we are launching cargo. Thus, in the interim, we have to rely on the Russians with their spacecraft, which we have done before, because when the Space Shuttle Columbia was destroyed on reentry back in 2003, for well over 2 years we were down and not flying the space shuttle, until we could make sure that it was fixed. We relied on the Rus-sian Soyuz to get to and from the space station. All right, that is going to low-Earth orbit. But NASA, with its human space program, has another mission. Now, with the nonmanned space program, we just launched to Jupiter, we just launched a mission to the Moon, next month we are going to launch a mis-sion on Earth observations, and before Thanksgiving we are launching a Volkswagen-size Recovery to Mars, with six wheels powered by a pluto-nium source so it doesn't have to go to sleep in the Martian night. This will rove all over. It has a pole that will stick up, with a laser, and it can zap rocks so we can analyze their chemical content. It has a big scooper that can also get us addi-tional samples. It has two eyes that will pop up as it roams around so we can see in real time the surface of Mars. So we have a vigorous space program. But we still have to do what NASA is supposed to do; that is, leave the orbit of the Earth and venture out into the heavens with humans. That is what was announced today\u2014announced by Senator H UTCHISON and myself, with NASA Administrator General Charlie Bolden making the formal announce-ment. The President has signed off on the specifics. I am going to explain this rocket. But before I do, let me say there have been a lot of critics saying: Oh, it will cost too much. Remember, last year we passed the NASA bill unanimously in the Senate and passed it in the House with an overwhelming three-quarters vote. That set the parameters on the funding for this new rocket, and all of NASA's figures have come in under- neath those levels that we set in the NASA authorization bill. Those are the numbers the Office of Management and Budget and the White House have scrubbed to make sure they are real-istic, and that is what has been an-nounced today. Here it is. This is the rocket. Just to give an idea of the scale of this mon-ster, the space shuttle in the stack, with the external tank and the two sol-ids on either side, the tallest point of that stack is the top of the external tank. From here that would come up to right there. That gives an idea of how much larger this rocket is. This rocket will launch more payload than any rocket in America's space program and probably the Russian/Soviet space pro-gram, certainly, now. Back in the old Soviet days I don't think the Soviets had one that was anywhere near this one. What this rocket has is a core, and this is a core with liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen fuel tank. It is taking the space shuttle engines\u2014so we can keep the cost down, and a lot of this has al-ready been developed\u2014and putting five in the tail of this first stage. So first stage, liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen. But it is boosted on either side by those solid rocket boosters\u2014in this case a new one. Under the space shuttle it was four segments, but this one has five segments. So it is elongated and gives more thrust. These, on future versions, will be competed as to wheth-er it is going to be solid rockets\u2014and, by the way, the consistency of this pencil eraser is what the solid rocket material looks like\u2014or whether those in the competition will be liquid boost-ers. All right, that is the core. That comes up all the way to here. Then there is the second stage. We have sec-ond-stage engines we have been using in the past called the J-2. They are now updated with a new, more powerful version called the J-2X. So we have a lot of history on these engines. That is what is going to be the second stage, which then takes the housing for a lot of the electronics, and then the cap-sule. The tower at the top is an escape tower. We could actually have an ex-plosion right here on the pad, and the crew could survive because they would eject in the full capsule, being thrust away from the explosion, and then the parachutes would deploy and the crew saved; likewise, we could save the crew on this rocket all the way to orbit. So if there was a problem, we could still save the human life of the four to seven astronauts who are going to be in this crew capsule. We could save their lives, and that was one of the mandates after we lost Columbia in the reentry over Texas. The investigation board said: Build a safer rocket, and certainly one that is more economical. This is now on a schedule for its first test\u2014this version. This is the smaller version. This thing can evolve. This is VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5601 September 14, 2011 about 70 to 77 tons. This thing can evolve to 150 tons, and then we are talking about a monster. On this version they will test it on a schedule for 2017. They will have several other tests, and they are on a schedule to put a crew into this rocket in 2021. They are then scheduled to rendezvous, or land, on an asteroid\u2014this will be the first time that has ever been done\u2014as a way of preparing us to then go to Mars. So that is what NASA has announced today. I want to give great credit\u2014 great, great credit\u2014to Senator H UTCHISON . She has been the ranking member and, alternately, chairman of the Subcommittee on Science and Space and is now the ranking member of the full Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. She has been a princess in helping guide, first of all, the NASA authorization bill and the funding. Tomorrow, she and Sen-ator M IKULSKI \u2014the chair of the Sub- committee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies of the Committee on Appropriations\u2014will be taking up NASA's budget as they get ready to come to the floor. This rocket will now allow us to get out of low-Earth orbit, assemble com-ponents\u2014heavy components\u2014that ulti-mately will take us out into the heav-ens exploring in ways we never have even started to design. Remember, 40 years ago we went to the Moon. That was quite an accomplishment. But the Moon is about 250,000 miles from Earth. With rockets like these, we are going to go far out into the heavens to ex-plore the origins of the universe, to ex-plore that which we have never even dreamed of, as we fulfill our destiny as a people who are explorers and adven-turers by nature. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from North Carolina is recognized. Mrs. HAGAN. I ask unanimous con- sent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in imploring Con-gress to provide needed assistance to our families, our communities, and our businesses suffering from the rash of natural disasters that have hit our country hard this year. While many of us who represent States on the east coast planned to spend our final week of our August work period traveling our State, tour-ing factories, stopping by schools, and visiting military bases, Mother Nature had other plans. We still traveled to our States, but we saw a very different scene: whole streets and towns flooded, homes and businesses washed away from their foundations, destroyed crop fields, and constituents worried about the loss of their homes and mourning their loved ones. Over 2 weeks ago, Hurricane Irene barreled down our eastern seaboard, and early estimates suggest it could be one of the top 10 costliest disasters in U.S. history. I am here to tell the story of North Carolina. In the early morning of August 27, Irene first touched down over eastern North Carolina's Outer Banks. Even be-fore it made landfall, the storm brought on several tornadoes along the coast that swept away entire homes. This is a photo of what is left of three homes hit by tornadoes in Tyrrell County. I was there, and it was truly devastating. One elderly man who had one of these homes was there the next day with a rake, forlorn look in his eyes, and said: The only thing I own now are the clothes on my back. By the time Irene finally moved be- yond the State of North Carolina, six North Carolinians had been killed, storm surges 6 to 9 feet high had flood-ed many towns, more than 500,000 were without power, and countless homes, businesses, and schools had been de-stroyed or severely damaged. Fortunately, our State had prepared diligently for days leading up to the storm, boarding up houses and busi-nesses and declaring mandatory evacu-ations for tourists and residents in our most at-risk towns. A lot of pundits woke after Irene hit and started saying: Hey, it wasn't that bad. I wish to invite those individuals to come to eastern North Carolina and see what I saw in the wake of Hurri-cane Irene. I saw small business owners in down- town Manteo emptying stores they have run for decades, tossing their wa-terlogged inventory, moving their fur-niture to the curb, moving out carpet totally destroyed, and these business owners wondering if it was even worth reopening their stores. There was a bookstore, and a resi- dent in the community came up to me and he said: Senator H AGAN , I have raised my children by sitting on this man's knees having books read to him day in and day out. We need this book-store back in Manteo. I wish to be sure it gets there. I also saw crops that had been beaten by wind and rain for 15 hours, and it looked like they had gone through the spin cycle of a washing machine. I saw flooding in the fields so severe that Ag-ricultural Secretary and former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack said it was the worst agricultural flooding he recalled see-ing. I saw families clearing and burning debris, pumping floodwater, tossing aside their soaked possessions that were beyond saving. I also stood along Highway 12, eerily quiet, a highway that is usually busy with traffic, totally still at the point where Irene had left a gaping hole, blocking any vehicle travel to and from Hatteras Island and the towns of Rodanthe, Waves, Salvo, Avon, Buxton, Frisco, and Hatteras. We can clearly see the breach of the highway here. It actually breached in three separate points along Highway 12. The only way to get to the island now is by ferry; and, according to local reports, the line for that ferry was 15 miles long this weekend. That is the picture in North Caro- lina. It is not the only picture. While there were scenes of destruction and loss, I also saw tremendous acts of de-termination and kindness. If winds and rains may have swept away our posses-sions, they also stirred up the best parts of North Carolina spirit. Our in-trinsic devotion to community and to assisting those in need produced count-less heroes across our State the past 2 weeks. Everywhere I went, I saw emergency workers, volunteer organizations, and members of the community reaching out to their neighbors in need. In Cra-ven and Tyrrell Counties, the Amer-ican Red Cross and the North Carolina Baptist Men and Women provided hot meals. The North Carolina Baptist Men and Women were there, distributing 5,000 meals one afternoon when I was with them and also helping shelter and debris removal for those affected by the hurricane. The North Carolina National Guard activated 400 members\u2014including a member of my own staff who serves in the Guard\u2014to provide emergency water, food, and supplies to some of the hardest hit areas. Emergency workers throughout the State continue to help families, businesses, and entire com-munities recover and rebuild. While the people of the great State of North Carolina are committed to get-ting themselves and their neighbors back on their own feet, we have to do the same in Congress. For the North Carolina families, farmers, fishermen, educators, seniors, and small busi-nesses struggling to recover, govern-ment assistance cannot come fast enough. It must not leave too soon. Here is my bottom line: Congress must fully fund Irene recovery efforts now. But we must also fund the emer-gency funding needs in tornado-dev-astated Joplin, MO, and Alabama, and the flooded communities of the Mid-west, also, and in the wildfire disaster currently in Texas. Without a doubt, this year, our coun- try has been ravaged by an unprece-dented series of natural disasters. Since January 1, the President has issued disaster declarations in 48 States, and the hurricane season is far from over. We are aware of this trend all too well in North Carolina. Just about 4 months before Irene hit, 28 tornadoes touched down across central and south-ern North Carolina, the most severe weather to hit our State since 1984. More than 20 North Carolinians were killed, 6,200 homes damaged, and about 440 homes were completely destroyed; VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 \u2014 SENATE S5602 September 14, 2011 21 businesses, including the largest em- ployer in the town of Sanford, were de-molished, with another 92 significantly damaged, leaving at least 2,000 North Carolinians in that one area out of work. Shaw University, located in downtown Raleigh, was forced to close for the remainder of the semester due to the immense damage to its campus. We will never be able to predict the whims of Mother Nature, but we are able to prepare and prepare we must. Right now, FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund is running dangerously low. Even before Hurricane Irene arrived we were using $400 million a month on disaster relief efforts. Today the fund is down to $377 million, not enough for a week of spending before Hurricane Irene hit, and we still have 3 weeks to go in this fiscal year. If we do not act now to fix this short- fall, millions of Americans will be left behind. Already, FEMA is shifting funds away from vitally needed recon-struction projects in previously hard- hit areas to what they call ''immediate needs'' assistance. I do not believe any one of us wants to be in the position of telling one of our constituents\u2014one of our small business owners, one of our school principals\u2014that we can't help because they are not considered an ''immediate need.'' American victims of natural disasters should not be left at the mercy of a rob-Peter-to-pay- Paul system. That is not who we are as Americans. We have a choice right now. In my mind and in the minds of all North Carolinians affected by the storms of Irene and the tornadoes that took place in April, the choice is clear: Con-gress must make these FEMA supple-mental funds available. The Budget Control Act that we passed in early August established strict spending caps to get our fiscal house in order while also allowing for a limited amount of funds to be made available in case disaster struck. Dis-aster struck, and now is the time to make those funds available. Meeting these needs is not just a necessity for the people of my State and many oth-ers, but it is also wholly consistent with the fiscal discipline that we agreed on and voted on in August. But FEMA funding is not enough. Our farmers in North Carolina and across the eastern coast were dev-astated by Irene, and they are in des-perate need of assistance. North Caro-lina is an agricultural State. Agri-culture generates about $78 billion a year in economic activity, and it em-ploys close to one-fifth of the workers in North Carolina. Our agricultural in-dustry, particularly our cotton and to-bacco farmers, are in trouble. At the end of the day, when all of the damage assessments are completed, our farmers could be out more than $400 million from Hurricane Irene, and these crops were just getting ready to be harvested. Our farmers in our State absolutely cannot afford a blow like this one. We in Congress need to work together so assistance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture can be expe-dited and delivered in a timelier man-ner. We need to act soon. I want to end with a story from my State that I believe is particularly rel-evant at this time when communities across the country are in the process of recovery. Back in April, one of the most recognizable scenes from the post-tornado coverage was of a Lowe's store in Sanford, NC. Unlike with Irene, there were few warnings of the tornado's arrival. But when Michael Hollowell, the store manager, saw the storm approaching his store\u2014and it was very fast\u2014he calmly moved every customer to the back corner where he knew\u2014because he had been trained\u2014 they would be the safest. I saw that Lowe's the very next day. This is what that store looked like. It was completely demolished. But every single person in the store when the storm hit was alive. Mike Hollowell is a hero, not just to those people in the Lowe's store but to peo-ple all over North Carolina. Last week, not even 5 months after this devasta-tion, that same Lowe's reopened, and it reopened with 2,000 more square feet than it had before. It just shows that North Carolinians and people across the country are committed to a recov-ery that will leave our communities better than ever. The people of this great country are stronger than any storm. They will re-build and recover. But that process may take many months, it may take many years. As their representatives, we have a responsibility to provide a reliable, comprehensive program of re-lief for that duration. To do any less is a dereliction of duty. I call on all my colleagues to pass this FEMA supplemental bill as soon as possible. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C ARDIN ). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. STIMULUS BILL Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, in re- cent days the President has repeatedly told Congress to pass the stimulus package immediately. This began dur-ing his joint address to Congress last week when he said at one point: I am sending this Congress a plan that you should pass right away. You should pass this jobs plan right away. Pass this jobs bill\u2014 pass this jobs bill. Immediately following the Presi- dent's joint address to the Congress, Press Secretary Jay Carney declared: The President will submit a bill early next week, the American Jobs Act, which will specify how he proposes paying for the Amer-ican Jobs Act. As ranking Republican on the Budget Committee and wrestling with these difficult issues\u2014I know Senator C ARDIN is a member of the committee\u2014we tried to figure out what this means and how much money the spending will be. But the bill that was transmitted to Congress Monday afternoon does not contain any fiscal tables, costs for any of his provisions, actually how those provisions will be paid for and when the pay-for will occur, or even an over-all pricetag for the bill. How can the President call on Con- gress to ''pass this bill immediately'' when no one even knows how much it will cost or where the money is coming from? I sent a letter yesterday to the Presi- dent's Director of the Office of Manage-ment and Budget, Jack Lew, asking that this information be provided to the Congress at once. But so far we have had no response. Part of the rea-son we need this information is that the total cost of the President's bill may be much higher than advertised. That has been the pattern around here. No one should be surprised. When the President said his plan would be ''paid for,'' he did not specify if he meant the total cost\u2014to include increased inter-est resulting from the borrowed money to be spent immediately\u2014or just the cost of the jobs provisions alone, actu-ally how much goes out the door. De-pending on whether the money is spent out and when it is paid back\u2014assuming it is ever paid back\u2014interest costs re-sulting from just this bill's borrowing could top $100 billion. In other words, the interest on the money over the 10- year window, the 10-year budget we are talking about\u2014if we spend $450 billion now, we pay interest on that money. It is borrowed money. People loan us the money and we pay interest. Interest rates alone now\u2014CBO projects them to go up, our Congressional Budget Office. Certainly they will. They are extraor-dinarily low today. But, at any rate, we could easily see the interest on this money over 10 years reaching $100 bil-lion. The problem with looking at it as a 10-year scenario is that the debt is probably not going to be paid off in 10 years. Most of the debts we run up will be part of our deficit. If we want to raise taxes to fund a new program, maybe we ought to raise taxes to pay off the debt we have instead of spend-ing it on a new program. The debt we have distributes American wealth to people who hold our debt all over the world. In my letter to OMB, I request tables showing the year-by-year data for this bill's budgetary impact, including pro-jected changes to the deficit for each of the next 10 years. In other words, how will it play out? If we spend $450 billion in 1, 2, or 3 years, how much does that run up the debt? When does the repay-ment begin? How will it be paid, and at what rate? If the President wants to advocate for a sharp, near-term in-crease in the deficit in exchange for the possibility of some undefined eco-nomic future, with the possibility of a VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5603 September 14, 2011 stimulus, he ought to make that argu- ment clearly to the American people. I believe the President also needs to be honest in admitting that the bill's short-term costs would wipe out\u2014oblit-erate\u2014the $7 billion in savings next year resulting from the debt limit deal. In other words, we went through this long, painful exercise that resulted in an agreement in the eleventh hour and the 59th minute to save $900 billion, and then, hopefully, form a committee that would save another $1.1 trillion to $1.5 trillion, only a fraction of this $2.1 billion in savings, of the $13 trillion the Congressional Budget Office tells us will be added to the debt in the next 10 years. So it would save a little over $2 trillion over 10 years but, at the same time, we are running up over $10 tril-lion in debt. So it is not a big enough step. It is a step. There is progress. I certainly respect that, but it wasn't much. To show us how small it is, next year we are projected, under the agreement Congress ratified, to reduce spending by $7 billion. That is all. That is all it would be reduced from this year to next year in actual spending levels. So I ask my colleagues: Don't we need to be careful? After all the effort we took to achieve that much savings, shouldn't we think very carefully about a new stimulus plan that would spend $450 billion, obliterating that savings? I think we should. But, at any rate, we do need to know precisely how much it is going to cost and precisely how the money would be spent. Let's flash back to February. The Of- fice of Management and Budget Direc-tor, Jack Lew, said this. This was when the President submitted his budget for the next 10 years. It was brought up here on the floor of the Senate. In fact, I brought it up. It was voted down 97 to nothing. But this is what Mr. Lew said about that budget: Our budget will get us, over the next sev- eral years, to the point where we can look the American people in the eye and say we're not adding to the debt anymore; we're spend-ing money that we have each year, and then we can work on bringing down the national debt. We all know there is a certain amount of political license people get to utilize in the political world, and ex-aggeration sometimes is forgiven. But let me tell my colleagues, this is the Office of Management and Budget talk-ing about the President's budget that he had just submitted to Congress. He said: Our budget will get us, over the next sev- eral years, to the point where we can look the American people in the eye and say we're not adding to the debt anymore; we're spend-ing money that we have each year, and then we can work on bringing down our national debt. What is the truth? The Congressional Budget Office scored this budgetary plan and this is what they concluded: that over a 10-year period there would be huge deficits every single year. In about year 6 or 7, the lowest deficit would occur\u2014$750 billion would be the lowest annual deficit that would occur\u2014and by the 10th year we would be back up to $1 trillion. President Bush's largest deficit he ever had was $450 billion and he was criticized for that. So we are going to have the low-est\u2014and he says this is going to pay down the debt and wouldn't be adding more to the debt if we passed his budg-et, when his budget spent more, taxed more, and ran up more debt. I believe this is the most irresponsible budget ever submitted to the Congress of the United States, at a time of national crisis, when all experts are telling us the greatest threat to our national se-curity is our debt. Forgive me if I want to see the fine print on this legislation, when an ad-ministration tells us that\u2014and the President said very similar things; the President himself said very similar things\u2014we would not be adding more to the debt. We in Congress raised the legal debt limit\u2014I did not vote for that particular bill\u2014but we have breached, I am afraid, our economic debt limit. America's $14.5 trillion gross debt is now 100 per-cent of our GDP, our economy. Experts tell us we have already crossed a dan-gerous threshold. Our debt is pulling down growth and putting a damper on job creation right now. We have to ask ourselves: Can we continue to borrow, running up even more debt in the hope that we can spend it today in a sugar-high type stimulus to create jobs in the short run? The Congressional Budget Office scored the first stimulus package 2 years ago that has come nowhere near achieving what was promised for it. They said, OK, if you spend $825 billion now, you will get some short-term eco-nomic benefit, but scored over a dec-ade, we would have an economic de-cline. The net growth of the United States would be less over 10 years than if we didn't pass a stimulus package at all. When we get up to 100 percent of GDP, I submit it is even more dan-gerous to keep running up debt. This is a dilemma. We are in a fix. The economy is not growing the way we wish it to grow. CBO was projecting in January of this year that economic growth for the first 6 months would be about 2.9 percent. We were hoping that would be true. But what happened? The first quarter of this fiscal year it was .4 percent\u2014not 2 percent, not 2.9 per-cent\u2014and the second quarter was ex-tremely low also. We have averaged about 1 percent growth the first half of this year. We want to do something to help this economy grow. I submit we should do everything we can that would help our economy grow now that does not run up the debt. What are some of those things? Producing more energy at home, creating jobs here; pumping more energy supply which could bring down the cost of energy. We can bring down the cost of energy, create jobs, create tax revenue, and create growth that way. We should eliminate every regulation that is not beneficial to this economy, and there are a lot of them. Some regulations are good. Many of them add costs to the entire economy for little or no benefit. We need to have the kind of tax reform of a permanent nature that creates confidence in our economy\u2014the kind of tax reform that advances economic growth rather than increasing taxes to give Washington more money. Those are my suggestions about how to deal with this. First and foremost, we are going to look at this proposal. We certainly are worried about the sta-tus of the economy today. We are deep-ly disappointed in the job numbers that continue to fall and, hopefully, we will find the key to changing that. But fun-damentally the economy will come back and jobs will come back when growth occurs and growth will occur not in the public sector but in the pri-vate sector. We need to ask ourselves what it is we can do to create a better climate for growth and job creation. We need to be rigorous in analyzing the President's proposal, and to look at the details of it and how much it is going to cost and how we plan to pay it back. I think at a very minimum, we are en-titled to that. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as- sistant majority leader. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Alabama who has come to the floor. We see the world differently, but we both acknowl-edge we are at a moment where action is the only alternative. Doing nothing is unacceptable. When President Obama came to speak to us in a joint session of Congress last week, that is what he told us. He basically said, Let's roll up our sleeves, work to-gether, both parties in Congress, for a change, and do something about this economy. There are 14 million Americans out of work. The report now from the Joint Economic Committee and others cites the highest level of poverty in our country in decades; the problems work-ing families are having week to week, month to month, and year to year, fall-ing behind, despite all of their hard work. Their wages aren't rising to keep up with the cost of living. Many are surviving paycheck to paycheck. A survey was taken recently across America asking working families the following question: Could you come up with $2,000 in 30 days if you had to, ei-ther from savings or borrowing it? Fifty-three percent of working families said yes and 47 percent said no. That is how close to the edge almost half of working families are living. A $2,000 medical bill at an emergency room is almost nothing these days\u2014it is for a minor injury\u2014and these families could not come up with it. That is what they are facing. That is why the President said let us focus on doing things that will help these families and equally, if not more importantly, help small busi-nesses create jobs. VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 \u2014 SENATE S5604 September 14, 2011 There is no argument here about cre- ating an army of government jobs. That is not even on the table. The President is not proposing that. Here is what he said: Let's give a tax cut, a payroll tax cut to working individuals so they have more take-home pay. I took a look at what it would mean in the State of Illinois. It would mean that for the average income, which is $53,000 a year, that family would get $1,400 in tax cuts or $120 a month. I think it is worth something to working families to have that much more in their pockets to meet the needs of their families and perhaps make some critical purchases for their children, for their future, whatever it might be. That is a tax cut the President has pro-posed. He also proposed a tax cut for small businesses if they will hire unemployed people, a tax credit of up to $4,000 to hire these folks, take them off the un-employed rolls, and put them to work. I went to several job centers during the August recess. One was in McHenry, IL, and one was in Elgin, IL. I spent the better part of the day sit-ting with unemployed people and talk-ing to them. You ought to go there. If you think unemployed Americans\u2014the 14 million on whom we hear the statis-tics\u2014are living the life of luxury on their unemployment checks, they are not. Most of them are struggling to survive, and many of them come each day to a job center to brush up their re\u00b4sume\u00b4, to find out the latest people asking for new workers and put in new applications day after day. Many of them are discouraged after submitting hundreds of applications with no re-sponse. Some go back to school. I met a few who really made the right life choice by going back to take courses at community college, where they could afford it, or at job-training centers where there would be no charge to them, so they could pick up a new skill in an area in which they could get a job. That is the reality. The President is trying to create tax incentives for small businesses to hire those people. Usually the Republicans who come to the floor applaud tax cuts. My experi-ence is that they are for tax cuts when times are good and bad, but this time they are against these tax cuts. What is the difference between these tax cuts and the ones the Republicans histori-cally support? There are two dif-ferences: The President's tax cuts are focused on middle-income families, not the wealthiest, and they are the Presi-dent's tax cuts. Those are the two dif-ferences. I hope some on the Republican side will reflect on the fact, as the Presi-dent said, that the American people are not going to reward us for our cam-paign rhetoric if this economy does not turn around. They want us to work to-gether to solve the problems facing our economy. They want tax cuts for work-ing families. They want small busi-nesses to have an incentive to hire peo-ple. They want us to focus on creating good-paying jobs here at home. What kinds of jobs? Building America. As the President said, if we are going to succeed in this world, we need to outeducate our competitors, outinnovate our competitors, and outbuild them. I went to China over Easter. What is happening in that country is incred-ible. They are building in every direc-tion\u2014building cranes and construction activity everywhere. They are building the infrastructure in China to become the No. 1 economic power of the world in the 21st century. What are we doing? We are hearing speech after speech say-ing that because of the deficit, we can-not invest in America. Some say we cannot invest in education. They argue that we cannot invest in research, we cannot invest in building America. I think they are wrong. The deficit is a serious challenge. Even the Bowles-Simpson Commission, which I served on and voted for, said: When you get serious about cutting spending, do it when this recession is behind you. They know, we know you can't balance the budget with 14 mil-lion Americans out of work. Let me say a word about the safety net in America. I made a visit in Cham-pagne, IL, to a food-distributing oper-ation. They distribute food to pantries and soup kitchens all around central Il-linois. Unfortunately, their business has never been better. More and more families are showing up in these places for a helping hand. I went in there to hear how they are doing. They are get-ting a lot of help from the private sec-tor that donates food that is near expi-ration, for example, and a lot of con-tributions from churches and chari-table individuals. It is very heart-warming to see it. As I went to tour this place, there was a young woman there. She was an attractive, well-dressed woman. I as-sumed she worked for this food deposi-tory. She said to me that she had a job in a local school district as a teacher's aide. I was a little bit puzzled as to whether she was on the board of direc-tors or what her connection was. She came there to tell me that as a single mom with two little kids, even with a job in the school district, which she was happy to have, she still needed food stamps to put food on the table every day for her kids. I don't think Americans\u2014those of us lucky enough to never have to worry about the next meal\u2014know what fami-lies are going through, working fami-lies struggling with low income, trying to keep their kids well-fed and to do what every parent wants to do. More and more of these families are going to soup kitchens very quietly because that is a meal they don't have to pay for. They are going to the pantries to pick up the groceries. I have seen them in one of the nicest and most pros-perous counties in my State, DuPage County. I went to the pantries there, and I saw the people coming through the door. You would not be able to pick them out, but they are working fami- lies who need a helping hand. That is the reality. That is why the safety net is so important. I am troubled that so many people today are on food stamps. I am not troubled that they are on food stamps; I am troubled because they have to be on food stamps. I hear critics come to the floor who say: There are too darned many people on food stamps. There is something wrong here. What is wrong is not the food stamps; what is wrong is hunger and low-in-come and working families struggling to get by paycheck to paycheck. That is what is wrong. The number of Amer-icans now qualifying for this food stamp assistance is even going up among those who are employed, such as the lady I met in Champagne, IL. That is a reality. Something else is happening too. As more and more people lose their jobs, they lose their health insurance. When I sit down with the unemployed, that is one of the first items that comes up. Once you have lost that health insur-ance premium your employer helps you pay, most folks can't afford it. It is just way beyond them. So they are out there without insurance, and they are vulnerable. Some of them have sick kids, chronically ill children, and they worry about it. They go to the free clinics. We are seeing more and more working families showing up at free clinics across America. That is a re-ality of this economy too. When we talk about cutting spending on Medicaid, keep in mind who receives Medicaid payments in America. In my State of Illinois, 36 percent of Illinois children are covered by Medicaid insur-ance. When it comes to births in the State of Illinois, 52 percent of all births in Illinois are paid for by Medicaid. But the biggest single expense in Medicaid is neither one of those. Mr. President, 20 percent of the Medicaid recipients in my State account for 60 percent of the cost of the program: the elderly\u2014par-ents, grandparents, great-grandparents in nursing homes and convalescent cen-ters, on Medicare and broke and stay there because Medicaid steps in and helps them keep things together, so they have at least some care and some attention in the late years of their lives. When we talk about cutting spending in Medicaid, we are talking about hurting the most vulnerable peo-ple in America: children, such as the kids of that single mom I met; those who need prenatal care so their babies will be healthy; and, of course, the el-derly who are stuck in that situation. The same thing is true with Medi- care. I understand Medicare costs are going up dramatically. I also under-stand the number of people under So-cial Security and Medicare is going to rise as baby boomers reach that age. But we have to take care that at the end of the day we protect the basic pre-miums and benefits that are presently available under Medicare. For a lot of VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5605 September 14, 2011 seniors, it is their only health insur- ance. It is what keeps them inde-pendent and strong. We can't com-promise that basic protection by privatizing Medicare or raising the cost of Medicare beyond the reach of senior citizens. Finally, when it comes to Social Se- curity, let me just say that this is a program which means a lot. For 70 per-cent of Social Security recipients, it is a majority of their retirement. For 25 percent of the Social Security recipi-ents, it is all they get. That is it. So guarding Social Security and pro-tecting its future is important for our parents and grandparents. It is impor-tant for our country and for its future as well. The President came forward, and he said: This is my jobs bill. This is what I think will help move America for-ward, put more spending power in the hands of working families, create in-centives for small businesses to hire people, focus on putting firefighters, cops, and teachers back to work. That is a priority in our country for sure, and investing in building in America. One of the few lines the President had that got a bipartisan standing ova-tion\u2014and there were not many last Thursday\u2014was when he said it is an embarrassment that 10 percent of our returning veterans are unemployed. Let's put our veterans back to work. That is part of our President's plan. When I listened to the Senator from Alabama\u2014he doesn't like the way the President is paying for the plan, but he does pay for it. How does he pay for it? One thing he does is he reduces the Federal subsidy to oil and gas compa-nies. Filled your tank lately? Take a look at what they are charging at the pump. In Illinois and most places, it is over $4. That is translating into the highest reported profits in the history of American business. Oil companies have never ever had it so good. Presi-dent Obama has said\u2014and I agree with him\u2014that if there were ever a moment in time when the Federal subsidies to these oil companies should come to an end, this is it. The money saved should go to small businesses and families across America in this difficult econ-omy. The President also believes\u2014and I agree with him\u2014that the wealthiest among us, those who are most com-fortable, should be asked to share in the sacrifice. There are some on the other side who would not accept one penny more in taxes on the wealthiest people in America. I don't get it. As I travel around Illinois, a lot of families are sacrificing in this tough economy. They know they have to. It is the only way they are going to make it. They know that some of the government pro-grams which have been around in the past are not going to be there in the fu-ture or may be not as generous. If working families and middle-class families across America accept that re-ality, why can't the wealthiest families in America accept it too? Honestly, I think they can. By and large, the peo- ple I know who are blessed with a lot of wealth and a pretty comfortable life have said to me: Senator, I don't need all of this. I don't need all of that So-cial Security payment. I can get by without it. I don't mind paying a little more in taxes. Those are the people I run into. But you hear from the other side that is to-tally unacceptable. Some of them have said the President's plan is going to fall flat on its face because it taxes the wealthy in America. I think the wealthy should pay their fair share, and I think the President's plan is an honest, good plan that moves us for-ward. So for those who are critical of it, give me your alternative. I wrote down here what the Senator from Alabama suggested. He wants more energy produced here at home. I am for that. I think we ought to go to places where it is environmentally re-sponsible and produce more energy here in the United States. But I will say two things to keep in mind: No. 1, all of the known oil and gas re- serves in the United States of America that we could reach onshore and off-shore equal 3 percent of the known oil and gas reserves in the world. Each year, the United States of America consumes 25 percent of the oil and gas consumed in the world. We cannot drill our way into energy independence. We can expand the base and do it in an environmentally re-sponsible way, perhaps find better sources, newer sources for things such as natural gas, but this is not the an-swer to our prayers. Secondly, moving toward energy effi- ciency is not only good for the environ-ment, it is good for the bottom line for a family and for a business, promoting efficiency. My wife and I take a little pride in the fact that we own a car, a Ford Fu-sion Hybrid, and we were kind of pat-ting ourselves on the back a little bit. As we came back from vacation in Michigan, we were getting 36 miles a gallon. We felt pretty good about it. I was bragging to my friends about it, and now I am bragging on the Senate floor. It can be done. We can create more fuel-efficient vehicles. We didn't compromise anything, and we bought American. I think that is what we need to en- courage in this country: cars and other energy-saving equipment made in this country, creating jobs, reducing the need for energy to be imported from overseas and reducing the pollution that, unfortunately, hinders our envi-ronment and our health. I think that is a good thing. So on the Senator's first point, sure, more energy at home, but put it in per-spective. That is not the answer to America's economic needs. The second point he says is to elimi- nate certain regulations. That could be true. I am sure the President agrees there are regulations now that don't make any sense. Get rid of them. I am not sure this is a big ball and chain being dragged around by our economy, but there is no sense in wasting time or money on regulations that really don't serve a good public purpose. The final point he said\u2014and I couldn't agree more\u2014tax reform. We lose $1.2 trillion a year to the Tax Code. Credits and deductions and exclu-sions and special favors written in the Tax Code for businesses and individuals have to come to an end. I actually think that is a good way to raise rev-enue and maybe even reduce marginal tax rates for corporations and individ-uals in the process. That is what Bowles-Simpson said. So even my friend from Alabama who spoke earlier\u2014even he and I can find some common ground. I hope he will agree with me and the President: doing nothing is unacceptable. The President has said: No more games, no more delay, no more politics. Do something. That is the message I got in August, as I returned to Illinois. It is a message I hope my colleagues share as well. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant editor of the Daily Di- gest proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Wyoming is recog- nized. A SECOND OPINION Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I do almost on a weekly basis, to talk about the health care law and, I do that as a physician, someone who has practiced medicine in Wyoming for a quarter of a century, taking care of Wyoming families. I come to the floor because I have great concerns about this health care law. We know\u2014history proves\u2014that land- mark pieces of legislation written in Congress often contain drafting errors at one stage or another during the bill's development. This is one of the main reasons most landmark bills are written and negotiated in an open and transparent manner. Writing and nego-tiating bills in this way helps Members of Congress minimize mistakes. It helps uncover any unintentional con-sequences. It helps fix problems. This is done through rigorous committee and floor debate, as well as House-Senate conference committees, as the bills go through the process. Most importantly, doing something in an open and transparent manner gives the American people, the folks at home, an opportunity to read a bill, to study it, to think about it, to discuss it during townhall meetings with their Members, and ask questions and weigh in. Well, unfortunately, we all know the largest health care law ever enacted did not undergo an open, transparent, or bipartisan process. President Obama VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5606 September 14, 2011 promised the American people they could watch the discussions and the writing process\u2014he said\u2014on C-SPAN. Well, instead, the President and Demo-crat leaders in both the House and the Senate sealed themselves behind closed doors. Their strategy? Pass sweeping health care legislation based on stealth and speed. Use sound bites to sell America about expanding coverage, about cutting costs, about improving quality, and then offer very few details explaining exactly how the bill would impact individual Americans, nor what it would cost the country. Well, while this entire strategy was being played out, the President and Washington Democrats were writing the legislation behind closed doors. Why? Well, to limit the time the bills could be read and reviewed by the American public. Some in Washington thought rushing a health care bill into law before America could read it was the perfect way to avoid public debate and public questioning. Many of us recall when former Speaker of the House N ANCY PELOSI in- famously said: First, you have to pass the bill to find out what is in it. Well, the President passed his health care law, and the American people continue, on a daily basis, to find out what is in it. They do not like it, and it is easy to understand why. As the American people had a chance to read the details, they started asking more questions. The numbers simply were not adding up. Health care costs, they were seeing, were going up, even though the President promised that health care costs would go down. There were costly mandates on small employ-ers, and that was going to discourage hiring. N ANCY PELOSI said they would hire 400,000 people immediately. They have not been hired. She said 4 million new workers would be hired ulti-mately. We have not seen it yet. Mandates we have seen come out of the health care law do nothing to spur economic growth and help the 9.1 per-cent of individuals nationwide\u201414 mil-lion Americans\u2014who are currently un-employed and are looking for work. Then there are even more government orders forcing individuals to buy one- size-fits-all, government-approved in-surance or face a fine. The American people have had 17 months to find out what is in the President's health care law. One news report after another has been uncover-ing a laundry list of so-called glitches in the health care law. Well, former Speaker P ELOSI wanted the American people to find out what was in the law, and 17 months later the American peo-ple are finding out that the President and Washington Democrats did not even write it correctly. On Wednesday, September 7, of this year, Investor's Business Daily printed an article titled, ''Oops! No ObamaCare Tax Credit Via Federal Exchanges?'' The article explains that the way ObamaCare was written, individuals who qualify for a taxpayer-funded sub-sidy to buy government-approved health insurance in the new State ex-changes may not get it. Section 1311 of the health care law requires the States to set up a State-run ''exchange.'' This State-based exchange is a place where individuals can use their government subsidy to buy health insurance. Now, if a State declines to set up their own exchange, then section 1321 mandates that the Federal Government set it up and run it for them. Here is the catch: The health care law, as written, as signed by the Presi-dent, explicitly says the taxpayer-fund-ed subsidies can only go to people who are enrolled in exchanges set up by the State. Nowhere does the health care law mention that the subsidy can be given to people enrolled in the Federal exchange. So the American people are now find- ing out that their family might actu-ally qualify for government help to buy health insurance, but they are not going to receive the help. Instead, indi-viduals enrolled in federally run ex-changes could be forced to buy health insurance that, absolutely, they cannot afford. Not only might this law cause indi- viduals to spend money they do not have, the law may also offer taxpayer- funded subsidies to people who do not actually need it. Let me repeat that. The law may actually offer taxpayer- funded subsidies to people who do not actually need it. At a time when our country can hardly afford to spend money we do not have, Medicare's Chief Actuary, Rich-ard Foster, exposed yet another glitch in the President's health care law. The law allows approximately 3 million middle-class early retirees to qualify for Medicaid. Well, Medicaid is a safety net program designed to help low-in-come Americans. Here is how this one works: The health care law defines how the Fed-eral Government will set an individ-ual's Medicaid eligibility. The calcula-tions are all based on income. Here is the glitch: The health care law ex-cludes a large part of an individual's Social Security income from that cal-culation. Well, today, Federal low-in-come assistance programs are required to count Social Security benefits as part of an individual's income. Thanks to the health care law, early retirees earning up to $58,840 a year could now be eligible for Medicaid. Here is what Mr. Foster said in an Associated Press article. He said: I don't generally comment on the pros or cons of policy, but that just doesn't make sense. This is the Chief Actuary of Medi- care. ''I don't generally comment,'' he says, ''on the pros or cons of policy, but that just doesn't make sense.'' Well, I agree. That is why I cospon- sored legislation introduced by Senator M IKEENZIclosing this loophole. Sen- ator E NZI's bill, S. 1376, changes the health care law subsidy eligibility cal-culation to include all nontaxable So- cial Security income. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation esti-mate if we enacted Senator E NZI's bill, we will save the Federal Government and the American people about $13 bil-lion. The Senate should immediately take up S. 1376 and pass it. This is $13 billion we can save right now, today. Let's show the American people that when we see our country spending money that it shouldn't, we will take a stand, collectively as a Senate, and stop it. These examples\u2014these two exam- ples\u2014inevitably beg the question: What next? Clearly, the self-described ''most transparent Administration in his-tory'' has a lot of explaining to do. I do not believe my friends on the other side of the aisle, who wrote this very flawed health care law\u2014and they did it behind closed doors\u2014I do not think they knew what they were doing when they wrote these provisions. How do I know that? Well, if they understood how devastating their policies would be, I think they might have had second thoughts. How many more disruptive, ticking time bombs are there lurking in this law and in the regulations that still have not been written about this health care law that was signed a year and a half ago? We do not know. We do not know because many of the provi-sions do not even go into effect until the year 2014 or later. As a physician who has practiced medicine a long time, cared for pa-tients all around the State of Wyo-ming, been active in the Wyoming health fairs, bringing low-cost health screenings to people all around the Cowboy State, I intend to fight each and every day in this Senate to make sure the American people will not have to find out what kind of additional ticking time bombs there are in the health care law. That is because I am more committed than ever to repeal the health care law and replace it with patient-centered care, replace it with health care reforms that help Amer-ican families get the care they need, from the doctor they want, at a price they can afford. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant editor of the Daily Di- gest proceeded to call the roll. Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Louisiana is recog- nized. Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know we have had several speeches over the last couple of hours on very important topics\u2014the jobs bill, our ef-forts to stimulate the recovery, a re-sponse from one of our Democratic leaders to Senator S ESSIONS , and the good Senator who was just speaking talking about health care\u2014but I have VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 \u2014 SENATE S5607 September 14, 2011 come to focus our attention, if I could, again this afternoon on a particular issue. We spent most of yesterday talk-ing about a matter that is absolutely right at hand; that is, disaster relief funding and calling on this Senate and the House of Representatives to focus some immediate and comprehensive thought and attention on this subject, which is affecting so many of our con-stituents\u2014Republicans, Democrats, and Independents\u2014in big cities, small towns, and rural areas all over this country. In fact, this is the first year in our memory and in, I think, the recorded recent history, we have had a Presi-dentially declared disaster in 48 of our 50 States. Just a few days ago, we along the eastern seaboard and the gulf coast, where I am from representing Louisiana, suffered from the original hit and then remnants of Tropical Storm Lee and then Hurricane Irene. There are some Senators who joined me in a press conference earlier today. I think it was the Senator from North Carolina who said it has actually been three disasters: an economic disaster, in terms of an economy that is weak and fragile and we are doing our best to lift it and to strengthen it, and then Tropical Storm Lee and then Hurricane Irene. It has been millions and millions of dollars of damage. Unfortunately, we on the gulf coast tragically are getting to be experts in this field because we, as Senators and House Members from the gulf coast, have battled multiple disasters over this last decade. Katrina and Rita, which broke all records, sur-passed any planning this government has ever done. We had a FEMA that showed up not ready, not comprehensive enough in its view. Our people have suffered. But we have made a lot of changes since then, and here we are today with actually a better FEMA, from all accounts. I wish to give a lot of credit to this adminis-tration, particularly, and not just Homeland Security. But the Cabinet of this President has been extraordinary in their reasonableness when it comes to this subject. I have seen the opposite. So I think I am in a position to see the difference. It is a big difference in this Obama ad-ministration in terms of the Cabinet. They want to say yes to disaster vic-tims. They did not want to say no. That is very important. They cannot always say yes to everything, to re-build every building, repave every street, elevate every home. But they are trying to say yes. Most impor-tantly, the lawyers have been in-structed to find a way forward, as op-posed to instruction that came from the last administration which was to find a way to say no. So let me give credit where credit is due, to the Obama administration and their willingness to be flexible, to be forward leaning, to have attorneys who are trying to be on the side of the tax-payer, on the side of the victims, and not shortchanging people in times of desperate need. Having said that, the administration cannot do it all on its own. They need Congress, as the Constitution says, to provide the funding so the executive branch can do its job. The executive branch, by all accounts, even Repub-licans have come to the floor from States that have been hard hit and said: It is a more muscular FEMA, it is a more dynamic FEMA, it is a more flexible FEMA. I wish to thank Senators L IEBERMAN and C OLLINS . They are the authorizers. Yes, I have had a part of it\u2014others have, but they have worked tirelessly after Katrina and the disaster that happened on the gulf coast, where we were all shamed when we saw what did not happen that should have. We fixed a lot of it, and that is some- thing to be happy and proud about. When government does set its mind to improve things, it can. But we cannot do anything without the funding. Right now, FEMA is empty. The pot of money is empty. Projects, millions, hundreds of millions of dollars today, not just in my State but in California, in Tennessee, in Iowa, in Texas, and in North Dakota\u2014and I could go on and on\u2014but for the Record let me say a couple. In Tennessee, mitigation of private residences from the 2010 floods has been halted. For those who might not be fa-miliar with the word ''mitigation,'' which most people are, it means one could be elevating their house, one could be putting shutters or storm win-dows on their windows. Let's see what else. A person could be potentially strengthening the frame of their house if they are trying to mitigate against high winds from a tornado. There are rules that allow people to try to im-prove their home so the next time it happens not only are they not home-less, but taxpayers are not paying again for the same sort of incident. The Federal Government, under good policy, requires a certain portion of all disaster funding to be specific, to go to mitigation because taxpayers think, when we are trying to rebuild from a flood or a storm or a tornado or a bridge collapse, do not just build the same old thing, try to mitigate so it does not happen again. That is smart because then we are not double, triple spending taxpayer money. But in Tennessee this family, let's say, is in the middle of elevating their home. Let's say they have gotten it off the ground by 2 feet, and the con-tractor showed up on Monday. They were sent home because this project has been stopped. So somewhere there are homes in Tennessee\u2014I am not sure in what particular community\u2014where private sector contractors, many small business owners and their employees, showed up to work and were told: Go home. FEMA is out of money. We have to fix this this week before we leave and, if not, at the latest by next week. In Iowa, repairs for an electric util- ity\u2014I am not sure who provides utili-ties in Iowa. Potentially, it may be, as in my State in rural areas, the local rural co-op. Everybody knows what a rural co-op is. Their project has been shut down. Potentially, people are still receiving electricity. I do not think people are sitting in the dark. I am hoping not. But whatever they were planning to repair and fix in Iowa has been halted because we have run out of money. In Texas, repairs to the University of Texas medical facility have been stopped. In Louisiana, roadway con-struction has been stopped. In fact, there was an article in our paper, the Times-Picayune, just this week that said $100 million for Jefferson Parish\u2014 $100 million\u2014that is just 1 of my par-ishes, 1 of 64, the suburban parish that sits right beside Orleans that was very hard hit by these storms, not as hard as Orleans Parish but received billions of dollars of damage\u2014those projects have been put on hold while we move that money to help the victims in the Northeast. That should not be the case. We need to act quickly to refill the FEMA funds. In addition, I understand in North Dakota and in other places there are problems. It is not just the DRF. The Corps of Engineers in its budget last year did not have enough money for emergencies. I slipped out of the Chamber a few minutes ago to go actually meet with the mayor of Grand Isle, who was here, as he is quite often, advocating on behalf of the only bar-rier island that is inhabited in the State of Louisiana, and he brought up pictures. Again, they are too small to see, but I am going to have them blown up for tomorrow. But I have in my hand pictures of the levees that were just ripped up and destroyed again from Tropical Storm Lee. These were levees on the gulf that we just com-pleted. But because the Corps of Engineers, when they rebuild levees, in their au-thorizing legislation are prohibited\u2014 which makes no sense whatsoever, it is a complete waste of taxpayer money\u2014 they are prohibited from betterment. They can build back what was there, but they cannot build it better or high-er, unless they are directed to do so. I am about ready to direct them be- cause I am tired, on behalf of my peo-ple and the people of this country and the taxpayers, from rebuilding levees 10 times in a matter of 5 years. It is a waste of money\u2014it is aggravating to the people whose homes are behind these levees\u2014because we do not even have a policy, when we are building levees, to be ordered to build them stronger, higher, except, of course, in the case of some levee systems in Katrina. That was specifically directed, and it is being done. We are building around the city of New Orleans a much stronger, much better system. One would think that would be being done all over the coun-try. It is not. Why? Because we are VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 \u2014 SENATE S5608 September 14, 2011 short on funding, short on political will, and short on imagination and cre-ativity when it comes to building infra-structure in this country. I, for one, am tired of it. So are the people I rep-resent. I am asking the other side of the aisle to step up and to provide funding, funding that is not offset in the middle of a disaster. We will figure out how to pay for these later\u2014these disaster funds later. But as I think Senator L EAHY said so eloquently in our press conference today: Do the Republicans, some people in the Republican Party, actually believe we want fire depart-ments all over the United States, when someone's house is on fire and they show up with the engines, to debate in the middle of the street how they are going to pay for the extra overtime to put out the fire? I do not think so. Even if the fire department is broke, even if the funding has run out, we do not want to have a debate over how they are going to pay for overtime when the fire is burning. Put the fire out. Bring the people to safety. Put the families in shelter. Then go back to the city council meeting next week and they can debate for as long as they want how they are going to ultimately pay for it. We paid for World War II, obviously. It was a long time ago. It is completely paid for. We paid for World War I. We are paying for Afghanistan. We are paying for Iraq, which, by the way, not one, single, solitary Republican\u2014and not many Democrats, for that matter, but not one Republican whom I can re-call stood and asked or debated for 5 seconds how we were going to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But when the people of Vermont stand in front of their bridges col-lapsed, their homes collapsed, their schools collapsed, and say: We need help, we have to have now a month- long debate on how we are going to pay for it. We have not done this since the 1800s. We will eventually pay for it. Amer- ica has to pay for everything. We will pay for it. We do not have to have that debate now. What we do have to have a debate about is how do we repair levees and what is the best way to mitigate it. What are the new technologies that can be used to make our communities stronger and smarter? How can we streamline the process? How can we eliminate the redtape? How can we get help to people faster? That is what we should be debating. Instead, I have C ANTOR and B OEHNER making us argue about what offsets there are. So I have to go to the State of Maryland and say: Senator, what can you give up this year in your State? I have to go to Michigan: What can you up in Michigan? I have to go to California: What can you give up in California, so we can pay for people who are underwater in Vermont and North Carolina? What kind of government is this? I do not want to be a part of that and I am not going to be. So we have to fund these disasters now. The saddest thing about all this\u2014it is sad and it is also puzzling and it is perplexing and it is aggravating is that we already sort of made this deal 1 month ago, when we negotiated that big agreement we all came to, about how the levels of fund-ing would be for 2012. Everybody remembers that, before we left for August, and we had this big knock-down, drag-out\u2014in that agree-ment, our leadership, Republicans and Democrats, already agreed to do some-thing that I think is very smart. I want to show what they agreed to. They agreed\u2014because it is a puzzlement\u2014 how do we fund in advance disasters, how do we know how much to set aside. It is a problem because every year is different. I wish to show what our problem is, so people listening can give me their own suggestions about how to solve it. In 2003, we set aside, in the whole budg-et of the United States\u2014we can see this a little bit\u2014$800 million for disas-ters. But we had $1.7 billion. So we were short $984 million. We funded it. That went on our books. The next year we said: Well, this year we had $1.7 billion in disasters. So the next year we put $1.8 in our bill, think-ing we would cover it because last year was $1.7. But, lo and behold, we had an additional $3 billion worth of disaster funding. We did not know these disas-ters were going to happen. So the next year we increased the amount of money in our base budget. Then, lo and behold, in that year, we put in $2 billion dollars. Katrina hit. The levees broke. Do you know what the bill came in for? It was $43 billion. We had budgeted $2 billion because in the history of the past that is all we needed to cover disasters. It went from $2 billion to $43 billion. Who would have had a crystal ball to know that? Did we sit and debate? Some people tried to, until I said there was no way I was going to have to find a $43 billion offset before we can let the people of the gulf coast know that help was on the way. We spent what was required to help the gulf coast. You can see the next year here. These numbers are very erratic, unpre-dictable. So what our leadership did, looking back on these 10 years and lis-tening to the debate and argument, was come up with a pretty good plan. They said, OK, we will throw out the high number, we will throw out the low number\u2014in 2009 we didn't have any emergencies. Can you imagine 1 year that you have no declared emergencies, and the next year you have one in al-most every State? That is how erratic this is. It is not as though we are not trying to plan. It is just impossible by the nature of what an emergency or disaster is. You can plan for them, but you cannot always predict how many you are going to have and where they will be. Of course, everybody under-stands that. What our leaders did is they threw out the top one and the bottom one and came up with an average. That average is about $11 billion\u2014a very reasonable approach. So they put in our agree-ment that we made 30 days ago\u2014we said, OK, next year, this is what the Federal Government can spend and, in addition to that, you can go up to the average. You can spend an additional $11 billion, which is a very small amount of money compared to the whole Federal budget. You would think we would not be having this debate. Why? The need is very evident, the history would dictate that we don't have debate over disas-ters, and the Republican and Demo-cratic leadership has already provided a way, over and above our 2012 num-bers, to pay for these disasters. I ask this: Why are we having to fight for this? That is a very good ques-tion. I think it is because some people on the other side of the aisle think this is a good thing to fight about. They think they have to find a pay-for for everything we do even, as I have de-scribed, when you cannot predict. Even if you do plan responsibly, you never know, as in the cases of Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. But our leadership nego-tiated a way forward. Yet we have people all over the coun- try looking to the Republican leader-ship and listening to Representative C ANTOR and to Speaker B OEHNER say- ing: I want to help you, ladies and gen-tlemen, but we have to find an offset. I think people might say: Why didn't we hear that when they sent troops into Afghanistan or Iraq? Why didn't we hear that when they are rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan? The same people are not yelling and screaming\u2014or didn't do it when we went in there. I think we have a good point. I am saying I am proud of the Senate for last night, with Democrats most-ly\u2014and, yes, about 8 Republicans\u2014who voted to move this debate forward. I thank particularly Senator B LUNT from Missouri, who is an outspoken leader on the Appropriations Committee, for the need to act now, act quickly, to fund the DRF, the Corps of Engineers. Of course, Missouri has had terrible tornadoes and flooding. Not only did they have Joplin, but they had the great flood of the Mississippi River, which was the highest in 50 years. It was so high along our capital city when I visited our mayor a couple months ago\u2014that is Baton Rouge, which is our largest city, since 100,000 people left New Orleans to literally live on higher ground, although it has broken their hearts and divided their families. They have moved to Baton Rouge, as we are rebuilding levees and our flood control is stronger in the southeastern part of our State. People spend time walking on levees and riding bikes on the lev-ees. Of course, mechanical vehicles are not allowed. You cannot have cars, trucks, and four-wheelers because that would be destructive to our levees. Our levees are quite huge. They are almost like linear parks. For the first time in the history of anybody who can re-member, the mayor had to declare that VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5609 September 14, 2011 everyone stay off the levees because the water was so high and seeping through. We literally thought maybe some of these great levee systems would breach. Happily, they did not. It was a frightening situation for millions and millions. In some parts of Missouri, and other parts north of us, the levees did breach. Sometimes the levees will blow to pro-tect other areas. It is frightening if your business is behind one of those levees, as North Dakota residents know all too well. Nonetheless, we should not be debat- ing this. I hope our bill will pass this week and get over to the House for a quick vote. If the House decides to send us a continuing resolution, please, I want the leadership to hear clearly what I am saying\u2014and I will send them a message by letter in the next few minutes\u2014please do not think you can nickel and dime recovery efforts, that you can fund it 6 weeks at a time, or 4 weeks at a time. Disaster recovery doesn't operate that way. Our mayors, Governors, the Republican Governor of New Jersey, the Republican Governor of Virginia, the mayor of Patterson, who was with us today, and mayors up along the east coast who are with their people every day\u2014the mayor of Joplin, MO, who has to be able to know that he can plan a year out or 2 years out\u2014 having to rebuild an entire town is overwhelming even if you have the money and the plan. Can you imagine if you sort of have a plan, but you don't know if the Federal Government will provide you money? Do you know the frustrating council meetings and school board meetings that will be had, and they will say, well, the Republican party in Washington cannot figure out if we should get funding, but it is 6 weeks at a time? I will not allow that to happen. I am going to draw the line in the sand right now. You may get around me on it, but it will take a huge effort to get around this desk on that subject\u2014a huge ef-fort. If I have to shut the Senate down\u2014and I have done it before\u2014I will do it again, because I can tell you, as much as my name is M ARY LANDRIEU , you cannot rebuild communities with 6-week plans. It took us 2 years to put together the Road Home Program\u20142 years after we got the funding. The reason we could not put it together be-fore was\u2014even though Mississippi had their money because President Bush gave it to them right away but made the people of Louisiana wait\u2014because Congress would not decide how much money to give us. No mayor, no Gov-ernor, no matter how great they are, no matter how smart they are, no mat-ter how many engineers they have, no matter how many Rotary Clubs are helping, no matter what the chamber of commerce is doing, I am telling you that it cannot be done without a reli-able source of funding, so the planners can say something like this: We lost eight schools in this flood. They bring the community together\u2014and these are how these discussions go\u2014and say we might not have money to build all eight, but we have money to build six. Which six do you want to build, and where, what materials do you want to use, and which kids should go to which schools? I have been in these meetings. I am not going to allow the mayors and Gov-ernors to call their people together and say we lost six schools and we don't know when the money is coming to build them, and we cannot make any plans because the Republican leader-ship has decided that every 6 weeks they are going to let us know how much money we are going to get. That is not going to happen. I want Speaker B OEHNER to think about this, and I want M ITCH MCCON- NELL to think about this, and I want the Republican leadership to think about it. I will negotiate on the top number. I will talk about maybe FEMA doesn't need quite this much. I will talk about maybe the Corps of Engi-neers doesn't need that much. But I will not, under any circumstances, agree to a 6-week or 4-week continuing resolution. You may run the Govern-ment of the United States that way. We have, unfortunately, gotten used to it. That is a sad commentary, I might say, that we run the greatest govern-ment ever created in the eyes and vi-sion and hearts of mankind, but we op-erate it on a 6-week basis. That might be the game we play with the govern-ment, but I am not going to allow that game to be played with people who have lost their homes, lost their busi-nesses, and who look up from a storm and say, my gosh, what happened to me? Then they don't know what is going to happen because we cannot make a decision that lasts more than 6 months or a year. So the minimum will be 6 months. I hope we can find the will to do a whole year, because without that you are going to shut down recov-ery operations at a time when it is heartbreaking to think of small busi-ness owners who have lost their print shop or their dress store or their shoe store, and they see everybody talking about creating jobs. They used to have three of them last week\u2014selling print-ing material or selling shoes or what-ever\u2014and they are trying to get their business back, and we cannot decide\u2014 even though we have the money, even though we already budgeted the money, and although we already made an agreement about how we would do this\u2014we are going to still argue. I will tell you, if this is on the tea party's agenda, I suggest they take it off. If it is somebody else's agenda, please speak up. I have not had one sin-gle Republican Senator come down and defend this position, because it is inde-fensible. I hope when the leadership is negotiating\u2014and they are doing so now\u2014they will hear me in summary very quickly: The FEMA pot is empty. The Corps of Engineers is always run-ning on fumes. Levees are breaking and flooding, and it is occurring in places that haven't flooded in a hundred years. When we wake up and realize that we have to put more money in emergency funding and be there when our people are hurting, as they are now\u2014and we will eventually pay for this; we don't have to figure that out in the next 30 days. We have to give them a green light and the billions of dollars they need to operate for a year. Every-thing else is negotiable. But this is not going to be negotiated. We are not going to rebuild pieces of 48 States 4 weeks at a time. That will not happen. Whatever amount of money we give, let it be for as long as we can make it, let it be as robust as it can possibly be, and let's give a green light to our Re-publican Governors, Republican may-ors, Independents, and Democrats out there, who are shellshocked about the work before them. The people in neighborhoods are still crying and in shock about what they have to do in making decisions. Should we come back? Should we not come back? What should our neighborhood or community do? Maybe we should all move to higher ground. These decisions are being made right now. The last thing they should worry about is Con-gress debating whether there is money there to turn that hose on. Let's do our job the way we have done it for 150 years. Let's continue to do it and let our people know we are there for them, as we try to be there for other people in the world who are caught in situations such as this. We most certainly need to be here for our people in America. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. M ERKLEY ). The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to call the roll. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about a site of particular historic significance to the Commonwealth of Virginia and an action we in Virginia are requesting the President make. But before I get to that subject, I want to take a moment to echo what I know the Presiding Offi- cer said, and my colleague, the distin-guished Senator from Louisiana, and so many other of my colleagues who have come to the floor over the last few days to express concern and talk about the series of natural disasters and calami-ties our various States have experi-enced over the last few weeks and months. We have had, in effect, the trifecta in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the last month, where, about a month ago, we had an earthquake hit\u2014something that was a bit unprecedented in Vir-ginia\u2014which shut down schools in Lou-isa County. That earthquake also caused damage at the Washington Monument and at the National Cathe-dral, but in central Virginia\u2014in Louisa VerDate Mar 15 \u2014 SENATE S5610 September 14, 2011 County, in Mineral, and Culpeper, and other places around Virginia\u2014it caused enormous damage. We had Hurricane Irene, which\u2014 again, through central Virginia and down into Hampton Roads\u2014caused enormous damage. Then, most re-cently, we had Tropical Storm Lee, where I had the opportunity to visit a community not far from where I know some of the distinguished folks who work in the Clerk and Parliamentar-ian's Offices live\u2014in Alexandria. Not too far away from there is a neighbor- hood named Huntington, VA. This community I walked through has been flooded out three times in the last dec-ade. So we have a 100-year floodplain. Yet three times in the last decade they have been flooded out. So all these folks\u2014whether in Hamp- ton Roads in Richmond or the folks in Louisa County and central Virginia with the earthquake or the folks in Huntington\u2014are saying: We just need that assistance that other commu-nities have when they have been met by natural disasters. What purpose do we have for government other than to make sure there is an emergency re-sponse, and then after that response that there is an ability to get people back on their feet? So I thank my colleagues again, par- ticularly the Senator from Louisiana, who has been tireless on this issue of making sure FEMA has the resources it needs to address these disasters, and that we do so in a meaningful way. We recognize, of course, we can't just put these on a credit card forever; that we have to have a rational way to pay it back and figuring out a 10-year rolling cycle to budget for emergencies ought to be part of our discussions going for-ward. But trying to say that must be done at this moment, with the eco-nomic downturn and the recession, while communities are in need\u2014wheth-er they are in Oregon or in Virginia or one of the other 48 States that have had a disaster declaration issued over the last year\u2014is not the way we ought to be doing business. FORT MONROE Mr. President, in addition, I rise today to encourage President Obama to use his authority under an act that probably most in this Chamber are not that familiar with\u2014called the 1906 An-tiquities Act\u2014to designate Hampton, VA, Fort Monroe, as a national monu-ment, which would make it an official part of the National Park Service. Our hope is that the President will consider designating this in the coming days as this historic fort is turned back over to the State of Virginia, having gone through the BRAC process, with the Federal Government disposing of it. Let me take a moment on the Senate floor this afternoon to tell you a bit about this special place. This fort was built in the early 1800s, but, actually, the fortifications go back much earlier than that. It is an area called Point Comfort. As early as 1608 Captain John Smith recognized the importance of building a fort at Point Comfort, as the English colonists called this land. From its very beginnings, Fort Mon- roe has been associated with many key figures in American history. Robert E. Lee supervised work on the fortress as a young U.S. Army lieutenant. Edgar Allan Poe, the famous poet\u2014and I am sure our pages, at one point, hopefully, had to memorize ''The Raven'' in high school\u2014was a soldier at Fort Monroe. Abraham Lincoln, during the midst of the Civil War, paid a critical visit to Fort Monroe. And Harriet Tubman, an incredibly important American\u2014who was only recently, in the last 50 or so years appropriately recognized\u2014nursed wounded soldiers there in 1865. Another historic American figure had maybe mixed feelings about his visits to Fort Monroe. Jefferson Davis was at Fort Monroe on two very different oc-casions: First, as the U.S. Secretary of War, and later, as the former President of the Confederacy, he was imprisoned at Fort Monroe for 2 years. By World War II, Fort Monroe was the headquarters of our military's suc-cessful efforts to protect the mid-At-lantic coast. After World War II and to the current day it has been home of the Army Command responsible for train-ing our warfighters. For all of these various events alone, I would argue, as a Virginian, that would warrant the designation of Fort Monroe as part of the National Park Service. But its true historic signifi-cance goes back, actually, to a night in May of 1861. During the Civil War, Fort Monroe had an important strategic role as one of the very few Union military installa-tions located in the South that was never occupied by Confederate forces. For the folks who have traveled down to Norfolk and Virginia Beach, they know that Fort Monroe is the point that sticks out right before they go through the bridge-tunnel that takes them over to Norfolk and Virginia Beach. It has a commanding view of the whole gateway into what we call Hampton Roads. On May 23, 1861, three slaves\u2014Frank Baker, Shepard Mallory, and James Townsend\u2014got into a small boat in Hampton, crossed the James River, and presented themselves at the front gate of Fort Monroe seeking safety and sanctuary. For the previous many weeks, Baker, Mallory, and Townsend had been forced by their owners to help construct a Confederate artillery post aimed directly at Fort Monroe. Obvi-ously, that was not something these in-dividuals wanted to be part of. I want you to think a moment about the choices that were being made by these three men\u2014these three slaves\u2014 Frank Baker, Shepard Mallory, and James Townsend. They left behind the community where they had spent most, if not all, of their lives. At least two of the three left behind wives and chil-dren. It was entirely possible that once these three men reached Fort Monroe, the Union soldiers would simply turn them around and send them back to their owners. One of the things I think even stu- dents of American history sometimes forget is that it was the official U.S. Government policy, even in the so- called Confederate States, after the Civil War had begun in April of 1861, to still turn slaves back over to their owners. Baker, Mallory, and Townsend had to know if they were returned as run-aways, they could expect the most Dra-conian of punishments. But they fig-ured the choice should be theirs to make, so they made it. They soon found themselves standing before the new commander of Fort Monroe, MG Benjamin Franklin Butler. Deciding it might be easier to apolo- gize later rather than seek permission beforehand, General Butler made a huge and historically courageous deci-sion. He classified the three slaves as ''contraband of war,'' a policy that was later adopted across the Union to pro-tect any slaves who managed to reach Union lines. As a result, Virginia's Fort Monroe ultimately became a bea-con of hope for thousands of enslaved people seeking freedom. In fact, Fort Monroe became known as the Freedom Fort. The day after General Butler's edict, eight more slaves showed up at Fort Monroe. The day after that, 47 more appeared. By the war's end, thou-sands\u2014literally thousands\u2014had ap-pealed for contraband status at Fort Monroe. General Butler's declaration of this decision of ''contraband of war'' helped change the course of the Civil War and our Nation's history. This Thursday, September 15, the U.S. Army will officially hand over Fort Monroe to the city of Hampton and the Commonwealth of Virginia as part of the 2005 BRAC process. I proud-ly join with my colleague Senator W EBB, the bipartisan Virginia House delegation, Virginia's Governor Bob McDonnell, local residents, and the Na-tional Trust for Historic Preservation in urging the President to take this op-portunity to declare Fort Monroe a na-tional historic treasure. By using the Antiquities Act to grant this designa-tion, it also will allow us to begin the work to create a national park at Fort Monroe. For more than 100 years, Presidents have used the Antiquities Act to pro-tect some of America's most important and beloved historic places. As a mat-ter of fact, it was use of the Antiquities Act that first designated the Grand Canyon as well as the Statue of Lib-erty. So there is obviously enormous historical precedent. And there is no dispute over the historical significance of Fort Monroe. Over the last few years, I have spent a considerable amount of time, both as Governor and then subsequently during the BRAC process and now as a Sen-ator, working with State and local residents and officials to explore the VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5611 September 14, 2011 opportunities to partner with the Na- tional Park Service to preserve this in-credible piece of American history. I spoke as recently as last Friday with the White House about Fort Monroe. I am hopeful we will have promising news in short order. It would certainly be timely if the President's decision could be an-nounced this week, as the Army pre-pares to exit Fort Monroe, as our Na-tion marks the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, and as many Virginians focus anew on the future of this very special place. I feel this is an especially appro- priate time for the President to recog-nize the crucial role Fort Monroe has played in our Nation's history, and I again urge him to use his long-estab-lished power under the Antiquities Act to keep this process on track. Mr. President, I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. the clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Presi- dent, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. H AGAN ). Without objection, it is so or- dered. Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Presi- dent, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. TRADE Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Last week, new trade figures were released. I know the Presiding Officer from North Carolina is very concerned about what has hap-pened with these trade figures and what it means for jobs in her State and in my State. The trade deficit with China widened from $26.7 billion in June to $27 billion in July. That is one country in one month. Granted, it is the country we have the biggest trade deficit with, but it is 1 month. President Bush, Sr., some years ago, said that a $1 billion trade surplus or trade deficit trans-lated into some 13,000 jobs. Whether that number is precise or quantifiable or measurable is not the point. The point is that when we have persistently large trade deficits month after month, year after year, now decade after dec-ade, we know what it means to the in-dustrial base in our country. I spent much of August in places such as Belmont County, St. Clairsville, Cleveland, Dayton, Mans-field, and Springfield, OH, where, in my State alone, these cities and commu-nities had proud industrial heritages. They are places where people had real opportunity to join the middle class. After they graduated from high school, they could go and be trained and work in manufacturing and usually buy a home, a car, and send their child to college. My wife is the daughter of a utility worker, since deceased, in northeast Ohio, and she and her two younger sisters and brother were able to go to, in her case, Kent State, and other universities, in part paid for by her father's work in manufacturing\u2014if you will, his union card\u2014and assist-ance from government Pell grants and all they were able to do so the kids didn't graduate with huge debt the way they too often do now. The trade deficit with China through July 2011 totaled $160 billion, up from $145 billion over the same period in 2010. We debate the budget deficit, as we should. But too many politicians in this city, too many editorial writers, too many pundits and economists ig-nore the trade deficit. They are too fo-cused on things such as pay-fors. They ignore how the trade deficit has a dan-gerous effect on American jobs. The best way to get our fiscal house in order is to get America working again, and one way to do that is by cracking down on unfair trade prac-tices of some of our so-called trading partners. When the President steps up and enforces trade rules\u2014and while I do not agree with the President send-ing the Korea, Panama, and Colombia trade agreements to the Congress for votes because I don't think they serve America's interests, I do believe this President, more than his predecessors, has been, relatively\u2014I say ''relatively'' but blessedly so, and in some cases ag-gressive at enforcing trade rules. I have seen that in Youngstown in creating jobs. I have seen it in Loraine, where it has created jobs, and in Fenway, where it has created jobs, and it has helped our industry in Butler County in steel, in paper, and in tires. It is clear that part of this problem is currency manipulation from the Chi-nese, which undermines American manufacturing and our very own job- creating efforts. In June, the Economic Policy Institute released a new report showing that addressing Chinese cur-rency manipulation could support the creation of 2.25 million jobs. Put that in contrast to what they say\u2014the ''free traders at any cost'' sort of free mar-ket, free-trade fundamentalists who preach: Pass NAFTA. It will mean hun-dreds of thousands of jobs. Pass CAFTA. Pass PNTR with China. It will mean millions of jobs. It never does. It means job growth, but the job growth usually takes place\u2014with NAFTA, it was in Mexico; CAFTA, in Central America; and PNTR, in China, which is East Asia. There is job growth, but there is noth-ing close to net job growth in our coun-try. Even that, the President is saying, with this new agreement with South Korea, that it will sustain or keep or contribute to sustaining or keeping 100,000 jobs or so. So even the promises aren't that great on this new trade agreement, and we know they never live up to their promises. But we do also know if we stood up to currency manipulation, it could create 2.25 mil-lion American jobs. My friends on the other side of the aisle don't ever want to do any kind of direct spending on in- frastructure in terms of job creation; that costs tax money. I think it is a good investment; they don't. But standing up on currency we know doesn't cost American taxpayers and it will, in fact, mean American jobs. A paper mill in Butler County, down near Dayton and Cincinnati, someone who worked at that paper mill told me they are now competing with China for coated paper, which is a higher tech manufacturing of paper\u2014the kind of magazine paper we all touch and use\u2014 that the pulp comes from Brazil, it is shipped to China, it is milled in China and shipped back to the United States and they undercut American prices. Yet only 10 percent of the cost of paper production is labor. What does that mean? It means they are gaming the currency system. They are subsidizing water and capital and land and they are paying low wages. How do we com-pete when they are not playing fair? Forget the low wages even for a minute. How do we compete when they are playing these currency games? By continuing the currency manipulation, we lose far too many jobs. By com-bating it, we help level the playing field for our manufacturers, we help our workers, we help spur our eco-nomic recovery. That is why I introduced the Cur- rency Reform for Fair Trade Act. It would strengthen countervailing duty laws to consider undervalued currency as an unfair subsidy in determining duty rates. So when we contest on a trade agree- ment, all we are saying when we con-test is that undervalued currency is considered an unfair subsidy, because it is. It is not hard to convince people of that. It is not hard to illustrate or prove that. So when an industry such as the coated paper company in Ham-ilton or the oil country tubular steel used in drilling in Lorain or in Youngs-town, where there is a new steel mill because of a trade decision the Presi-dent made\u2014thank you\u2014or aluminum in Sidney\u2014when an industry petitions the International Trade Commission for relief against unfair subsidies, cur-rency manipulation under this new bill and amendment we are going to offer on the floor will be part of that inves-tigation. This is a designation that would en- sure the government has the tools to respond on behalf of American manu-facturers and workers by imposing countervailing duties on subsidized ex-ports from China. We have broad support here. Senator S CHUMER from New York, a Democrat, has been very involved. Senator S NOWE from Maine, a Republican, has been very involved. Senator S TABENOW , a Democrat from Michigan, and Senator G RAHAM from South Carolina, a Repub- lican, have been very involved in un-derstanding that these kinds of cur-rency manipulations cost us American jobs and undermine our economy. This designation would ensure the govern-ment has the tools to respond on behalf VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5612 September 14, 2011 of American manufacturers and work- ers by imposing these countervailing duties on subsidized exports from China. It is simple, straightforward, and achievable. Addressing currency manipulation would decrease our budget deficit up to $70 billion a year and somewhere be-tween $500 billion and $800 billion over 10 years if sustained. Addressing our trade deficit should be part of the de-bate in reducing our budget deficit. If we are going to create jobs, we have to ensure that our trading partners don't stack the deck. We want trade, and we want more of it, but we want fair trade, not this kind of phony free trade. Almost every country in the world practices trade according to their na-tional interests. The United States in this body and the President of the United States\u2014typically, Presidents in both parties\u2014have practiced trade ac-cording to some economics textbook that is 20 years out of date. If we are serious about standing for American workers and companies that continue to play by the rules, we need to pass this legislation. With each passing week, more com- panies and workers are faced with the harsh realities of unfair competition and unwanted cutbacks due to Chinese currency manipulation. In towns and cities across our country\u2014go anywhere in this country, including Texas, where Senator H UTCHISON is from and who is awaiting a chance to speak on the floor, or North Carolina, the Presiding Officer's State, or my State, and we see that companies and workers are faced with the harsh realities of that unfair competition. Workers have the proud tradition of making products that matter to Amer-ica. From the tanks made in Lima, OH, supporting our troops abroad, to steel tubes created in Lorain, equipping our energy markets, Ohio manufacturers are vital to our Nation's security and economy. Our national security, our economic security, our family security, all those are dependent on making things in the United States of America. My State is the third largest manu- facturing State in the country. We are seventh in population, but we are third in manufacturing. We have lost far too many jobs in Zanesville and Jackson and Columbus and Akron because of this undermining of currency, because of this gaming of the system by China, its gaming of the system on currency. It is time to take bold action. It is time to stand up to China. It is time to practice trade according to our com-munities and our national interests. It is time to do that. It is time to pass this legislation. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Texas. NASA 'S VISION Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I wish to mark today, September 14 of 2011, as the day that NASA announced our vision for the future. Since the shuttle was retired earlier this year and we saw the last people go into space on an American flight, many of us have worried that there wasn't going to be another heavy launch vehi-cle that would take our astronauts to beyond low earth orbit. Today, after much study and a lot of going back and forth with NASA, I was encouraged to see the design approved by both NASA and the OMB, and I think it is going\u2014 well, it will be the heaviest, biggest, strongest, most robust vehicle we have seen since we put men on the Moon. I was very concerned because of the long timeframe. Congress asked that this design be delivered by January of this year. We kept getting delays and delays and delays. Finally, Senator B ILLNELSON and I just got frustrated about that timeline, so we had meet-ings. As recently as yesterday, I met with the director of OMB, Mr. Jack Lew, who did come to my office to meet with Senator N ELSON and myself and Gen- eral Bolden, who is the NASA Adminis-trator, to get his commitment that we would be on a robust timeline and that it would be as much a priority of NASA to go beyond low earth orbit as the ferry to the space station would be for NASA. We got those assurances from Mr. Lew and the NASA Administrator. Senator N ELSON and myself, Senator ROCKEFELLER was represented, Senator BOOZMAN \u2014we had all the relevant peo- ple in the loop on this issue because we want to make sure Congress and the administration are on the same goal with a timeline to achieve that goal. What worried us about the delays were the loss of cost efficiencies and the loss of experienced personnel to de-sign that new heavy launch vehicle. We want to have the most experi- enced engineers who will use the prov-en technology that has been time test-ed and add to that proven technology the added boosters, the added capabili-ties that we know we must have to go to Mars, to an asteroid, and to make sure we do it in a safe manner. I am very encouraged by the commit- ments that were made and the time-tables we are seeing. I am told by the NASA personnel that we are now going to look, in 1 week or 2, to have the con-tract modifications in place that will tell the workers that they are going to have those jobs, that we are going to have that expedience, that they have a project to work on. I think it is essen-tial we have that kind of experienced personnel to do this. I am very pleased we now have this way forward. It is the most powerful vehicle we will have seen in many years. I think the announcement today is going to set us on a path. If we can see those contract modifications going out from NASA in the next week\u2014or a little more, but no more than 2 weeks from now\u2014then we will know there is progress and that we are going toward the time when we will have the build-ing of that rocket, that we will have the design, followed by the building, and then, of course, testing, and then the launch. I think when we saw that last flight come down this summer, so many peo-ple had very mixed feelings because space exploration has been a part of America's drive and spirit for all these years we have watched more and more things be accomplished. From Presi-dent Kennedy's first challenge that we would put men on the Moon, Ameri-cans have been excited about that op-portunity. They have not just been ex-cited, though, about the exploration and the pushing of the envelope, they have also been excited with the quality of life that has been produced by what came from the research: the advance-ments we have had in medical treat-ment, MRIs, the advancements in prod-ucts we have been able to discover. I fully expect that with the space sta- tion we are going to be able to do the research on cancers that will grow in the microgravity conditions in space that will not grow the same way on Earth, and that maybe we will be able to test antidotes and medicines for those. That is why I was pleased the President did announce we would ex-tend the space station until 2020. We have international partners as well. So we want to make sure we are a good partner, that we are a reliable partner, and that we do some things for man-kind that might make a difference in our lives. National security. We have gained so much in satellite-guided missiles for our national security. And being able to put a missile into a window from 1 mile out is because we have been able to discover in space the use of sat-ellites. Earlier this summer the space shuttle carried the magnetic spectrom-eter that Dr. Ting, the Nobel laureate from MIT, built and insisted on putting on the space station, it will help us un-derstand the nature of dark energy and its relationship to the origins and func-tion of the universe. We are looking at how matter was formed. We are looking at the cosmic rays. I went to the Johnson Space Cen-ter in Houston and saw from the space station the magnetic spectrometer that was getting the hits from cosmic rays. There were 60 scientists in the room who were tracking these hits, trying to determine what was hap-pening when those cosmic rays hit the magnetic spectrometer because they want to see if we can understand the nature of dark energy. There are things we have not even thought of that we hope to find by using the space station, and then going to an asteroid or going to the Moon. We have taken a first step today. I think many people in America were waiting for the blueprint for the fu-ture. Now I think we have one. As long as we stay on a regular timetable and with the funding levels that have been approved already in the authorization bill passed by Congress and signed by the President\u2014if we can stick with those, this has the potential to bring us energy, health, possibly curing breast VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5613 September 14, 2011 cancer, things that will make a dif- ference in the lives not only of Ameri-cans but of our fellow citizens all over the world. That is what the investment can be in NASA if we go forward as we have made this blueprint to do. We are in a time where we must be more efficient. We must fund the prior-ities and not fund the lesser priorities. In today's markup of our committee, our Appropriations subcommittee that does fund NASA, we have found the pri-orities. We also cut programs. Senator M IKULSKI said in her whole time in the Senate she has never been an appropri-ator who actually cut programs. But we did today. We cut programs that were lesser priorities in different areas of our jurisdiction. But we funded NASA so we would have this heavy launch vehicle. We would fund the commercial vehicle that is going to take our astronauts to the space sta-tion. That is going to be done in the private sector. That was the balance we did in our authorization bill last year. Then we fund the Webb Space Telescope because that is part of the scientific advances we must make if we are going to know what is out there in space that we might be able to utilize or utilize the knowledge for better life on Earth. I am very pleased we have the Appro- priations Committee that will, hope-fully, approve the bill tomorrow and that we have made those tough deci-sions. We came in under the 2011 con-tinuing resolution on our overall bill. We came in under the President's re-quest. But we have fully funded the pri-orities which have the possibility to reap the benefits from exploration and assure that America remains the No. 1 country in the world in space explo-ration. Our economy has benefitted, our national security has benefitted, and now we are going to be looking at health care possibilities, energy possi-bilities, and living in space, and seeing how we can do that in a better way. I think we have a plan that will ex- cite the American people again about what we can do in space if we put our minds to it, if we prioritize, if we are efficient with the taxpayer dollars, and we do not lose sight of the vision that is the spirit of America. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant editor of the Daily Di- gest proceeded to call the roll. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oklahoma. Mr. COBURN. I would ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I would like to spend a few minutes dis-cussing some things in general. In making a couple points today, I was referred to by one of our colleagues as a dictator. I am not offended at that; I understand the frustration of what is going on. But I think there are some significant points that the Amer-ican people ought to hear about where we are and what we are doing. Quite frankly, if we look at our fi- nancial situation and we look at the history of the world, no country has ever recovered from the situation in which we find ourselves in terms of our debt-to-GDP ratio and our debt-to-ex-port ratio. In August, before we left, we passed a piece of legislation that goes\u2014a small amount\u2014toward fixing the very real problems that are in front of our coun-try in terms of spending money we don't have on things we don't abso-lutely need. But we have before us, and coming before us, two different pieces of legislation: One is a shell piece of legislation, and the assumption is the majority leader will utilize it to fund supplementation for disaster relief for the many areas in our country that need that funding. There is not a dis-pute that we should be doing that. There is a dispute about how much that should be. But the greatest dis-pute is, when we are running $1.3 tril-lion and $1.4 trillion deficits, and we know we have significant waste, dupli-cation, and fraud in the Federal Gov-ernment, whether we ought to spend another $6 billion or $7 billion by bor-rowing or we ought to actually reduce spending somewhere else to pay for a much more important and proper need in which the Federal Government has a role. That is the real debate. I think we have worked a way to have appropriate amendments to try to pay for that, and we should probably go forward. There are, however, two other programs that are precarious in their funding: One is FAA\u2014and we have coming to us the 22nd temporary reau-thorization\u2014and the Transportation bill, which is, I believe, its sixth tem-porary reauthorization. Now, there are some real questions the American people ought to be ask-ing about why 22 times we have tempo-rarily reauthorized the FAA for a short period of time, and why now we are on our sixth temporary\u2014or fifth; I may be wrong on one of those numbers but close\u2014temporary reauthorization. That is because we are not prioritizing what is important for the country in terms of our legislative agenda. We don't control that, but there are some things that the American people are in-terested in that we do control. The highway trust fund has received a supplementation over the last 4 years of $35 billion from the American tax-payer outside of the taxes they collect for that trust fund. Out of that amount of money billions of dollars have been spent on things other than highways and bridges. We now have 146,000 deficient bridges in our country, some in every State in the country. We have more now after the floods in the Northeast. We have significant problems and we have a limited amount of money, and what is in front of us is another short-term ex-tension of 6 months for the transpor- tation funding which continues to spend money on items that are a low priority. I am not saying we couldn't spend the money on it. But when we are short of money, and we are borrowing money to put money into the trust fund, and our No. 1 priority ought to be safety and quality roads and bridges, to spend significant funds on things that are not a priority now\u2014not when we are head over heels in debt, not when the trust fund is precarious\u2014then we ought to not force States to spend money they don't want to spend. Yet in this bill 10 percent of the surface transportation moneys have to be spent on enhance-ment. So that tells Oklahoma, or any other State: If you have an excess number of bridges, it doesn't matter that that is a safety problem for your citizens; we are still going to make you spend this 10 percent money over here that doesn't have anything to do with safety or true transportation, but we are going to re-quire it because we can\u2014except, the problem is, the people in your State pay the taxes in the first place for their highways and their bridges, not for the museums, not for all the hun-dreds of other things that are spent that are low priority. So I thought I might give us a little flavor of what some of those things are. If we were at a different time where we had an excess of funds, I am not saying they are necessarily bad. But when we have bridges falling down in this coun-try, and concrete\u2014like the summer be-fore last in Oklahoma\u2014falling out of an interstate highway bridge injuring somebody, falling onto their car as they drove under it, I would think that we would want to repair these 146,000 bridges rather than spend money re-decorating a sign. So I will not go through all of them\u2014 I will put all of them into the R ECORD \u2014 but let me go through a few of them just to see. If the American people ac-tually believe we should not fix bridges or roads and we ought to spend money, I am fine. If the Senate believes we ought to not fix bridges, we ought not concentrate on safety, we ought not concentrate on the quality of our roads and bridges and they vote it down, I am fine too. But the fact is, we ought not to be spending money when we have the hundreds of thousands of bridges that are dangerous to people in this country. All we are saying is, if a State wants to continue to spend money on some-thing other than safety and bridges and roads, fine, it can, but don't make those of us who already have a big problem with safety have to spend money on something that doesn't pro-tect our citizens, doesn't enhance their highways by spending money on some-thing that is called an enhancement but doesn't enhance their safety or their ability to commute. So what are some of them? Lincoln Highway 200-Mile Roadside Museum in VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 S5614 September 14, 2011 Pennsylvania\u2014it received $300,000 in enhancement funding to commemorate the historic highway along the 200-mile route. Interpretive signage, colorful, repainted vintage gas pumps, engaging murals, refurbishing a large coffee pot. Notably, Pennsylvania ranks No. 1 in the country in terms of bridge defi-ciency levels. Forty-six percent of the bridges in Pennsylvania are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Mr. President, $300,000 would have fixed two of them. So we chose to not fix two but spend the money else-where. At a different time, sure, or if Pennsylvania wants to spend it, let them. But don't force them to spend money on something that does not pro-tect the quality of transportation for their citizens. How about Chinatown Gateway, a $250,000 enhancement to supplement the construction of the Twin Dragons Gateway to the Chinatown area? Cali-fornia has over 7,000 bridges that are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. One out of every three bridges in California is in trouble, and we are doing aesthetics instead of fixing bridges. How about the White Squirrel Sanc- tuary in Tennessee? Kenton, TN, lo-cated in Gibson County, calls itself ''the Home of the White Squirrel.'' They received $110,000 in transpor-tation enhancement funding to con-struct a white squirrel sanctuary with walking trails, brick crosswalks, a footbridge, and a parking lot. There are 3,856 bridges that are structurally defi-cient in the State of Tennessee. They didn't necessarily want to do this. They did not have any choice. They had to spend 10 percent of their surface transportation money on things such as this. Tuscumbia Landing in Sheffield, AL\u2014$104,000 to investigate Tuscumbia Landing's archaeological features. The only problem is, 23 percent of Ala-bama's bridges are structurally defi-cient. That could have fixed two of them. How about the National Corvette Mu- seum Simulator Theater in Warren County, KY\u2014$200,000 to build a grand simulator theater. Mr. President, 31 percent of the bridges they cross in Kentucky are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. The Pennsylvania Trolley Museum\u2014 $400,000 to construct the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum. It is a great idea if we are in the black and have a good cashflow. But when Pennsylvania leads the Nation in deficient bridges and dangerous bridges, why would we spend that money? Why would we force them to spend that money? I can go on. I will add to the record many other examples, all the way up to 40 separate examples of where we are spending money but we are not fixing bridges. I ask unanimous consent that those examples be printed in the R ECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibit 1.) Mr. COBURN. We are not pouring as- phalt, we are not laying concrete, we are not decreasing congestion, and we are not increasing safety. What we are doing is we are following the rules of Washington when we have greater needs. We are in trouble as a nation be-cause Congress does not set priorities, and when they do set priorities, there is no connection to the reality of our financial situation. We have some options on how to go forward. One of the options would be to take the FAA bill, split it out, approve it, send it back to the House, and FAA is taken care of. The second option would be to pass the highway extension for 6 months with the elimination of enhancements and send it back to the House. But I will not give a unanimous consent, as is my right as a Senator of the United States, for us to continue to spend billions of dollars on things that are not a priority when the country is struggling to survive. Its very survival depends on us changing the way we do business. If that means the highway transportation bill does not get ap-proved, so be it. But there has to be a point in time in this country when we change direction and we start meeting the obligations that are put before us. The No. 1 obligation is to start spending money where it does the most good and quit spending money we do not have on things we do not abso-lutely need. With a 35-percent deficit\u2014 and we are going to run another $1.3 trillion deficit next year, which will cost a significant amount of funds for our kids and our grandkids just to repay what we are going to waste next year\u2014there ought to be a time at which we say enough is enough. I know there will be several, includ- ing my own senior Senator, who will be unhappy with my position, but I be-lieve it is time to draw a line in the sand for the American people, for our future. It is not popular. It is certainly not expedient. But it is absolutely the right thing to do. If the Senate wants to solve the prob- lem of these two bills, we can split them or we can keep them together, but we need to end the enhancements right now until we get the highway trust fund healthy again, No. 1, and, No. 2, until we get our country healthy again. When we do, I will be happy to defer. Remember, we are not saying you cannot do it. We are just saying you ought to have the option to not do it. EXHIBIT 1 Kalanianaole Highway, Ka'lwi Scenic Shoreline Trail\u2014Federal Transportation en-hancement funds were used to intervene in a local land use dispute in Hawaii. A decades long dispute over the preservation of Hawai-ian shoreline versus local developmental in-terests was assisted by the Department of Transportation, which used $11 million in en-hancement funds to acquire land for con-servation purposes, effectively meddling in the local land use. In the mean time, 45 per-cent of Hawaii's bridges are either struc-turally deficient or functionally obsolete. Antique bike collections\u2014The University of California Davis received a transportation enhancement grant of $440,000 to purchase 60 unique antique bikes for its Bicycle Museum Collection. Shrine to Tennessee state history costs federal government $23 million\u2014 Nashville, Tennessee received $23 million in federal en-hancement funding to construct its bicenten-nial ode to Tennessee state history. The project included the building of ''a 1,400-foot Wall of History etched with historic events from the state's first two centuries, 31 foun-tains that each represent one of the state's rivers, and a 200-foot granite state map.'' The only thing more egregious than federal funds used for a clearly state interest, is that 20 percent of Tennessee Bridges are ei-ther structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. ARTwalk\u2014ARTwalk is tagged as a unique outdoor experience that constructs pathways between shopping areas, galleries, and muse-ums in Rochester, Vermont. The project used $234,000 in federal enhancement dollars to build the artsy outdoor museum, while 861 of Vermont's bridges remain either struc-turally deficient or functionally obsolete. Old Roman Bath House Renovation\u2014 $160,000 worth of enhancement funding was used in Berkeley, West Virginia for the ren-ovation of the oldest building in town, an Old Roman Bath House. While local residents may be interested in visiting a bath house where George Washington used to frequent, federal taxpayers may find the connection to critical infrastructure more puzzling. More-over, 36 percent of West Virginia's bridges re-main structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Saddletree Factory Renovation\u2014The Ben Schroeder Saddle Tree Factory, a historical factory in Madison, Indiana, received trans-portation enhancement funding for histor-ical preservation purposes because the fac-tory used to make Saddletrees, the founda-tion of a saddle. 21.5 percent of Indiana's bridges are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Toledo Harbor Lighthouse\u2014The Toledo Harbor Lighthouse in Toledo, Ohio, pro-tected by the ''phantom'' officer Frank, will receive a $500,000 enhancement grant to re-store windows, doors, bricks, and shutters. This grant will not only help to restore the facade of the historical lighthouse, but also carry on the legendary ghosts of the haunted lighthouse. Unfortunately, ''phantom'' offi-cer Frank will not be able to protect Ohio drivers from the 6,598 bridges that are either structurally deficient or functionally obso-lete. Critter Crossing\u2014The Monkton, Vermont Conservation Commission received $150,000 in federal grant money to build a\u2014critter crossing, to save the lives of thousands of migrating salamanders and other amphib-ians that would otherwise be slaughtered by vehicle traffic on a major roadway. Thou-sands of blue- and yellow-spotted salaman-ders, frogs, and other amphibians spend the winter months in the rocky uplands near Monkton, but must return to low-lying wet-lands in order to reproduce. To travel be-tween these two areas, the salamanders must cross the heavily-traveled Monkton- Vergennes Road. While some conservation-ists have celebrated the project, others re-main skeptical. ''I certainly respect all spe-cies. However, I don't see the need to pay $150,000 for a salamander crossing'', read one email reportedly sent to the Burlington [Vermont] Free Press newspaper. ''I realize there are a lot of other stupid things my tax dollars go toward, but this one is near the top of the list.'' Maybe the local commu-nities will prevent the critters from crossing one of the 861 bridges that are either struc-turally deficient or functionally obsolete. VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 \u2014 SENATE S5615 September 14, 2011 North Carolina Transportation Museum Spencer, North Carolina\u2014The North Caro-lina Transportation Museum has received over 11 million to renovate and showcase steam locomotive artifacts. As of 2010, North Carolina has nearly 5000 bridges that are ei-ther structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Massachusetts bike and pedestrian allotted millions, but remain unspent\u2014Massachu-setts has received $135 million in federal funds for bike and pedestrian projects since 1991, of which it has spent little more than $51 million, according to The Boston Globe. That means nearly two-thirds of the funds provided in the last two decades by Congress to the state for such projects remain unspent. Perhaps Massachusetts would like to use their unspent funds to work on their 2,548 bridges that are either structurally de-ficient or functionally obsolete. Nevada spending millions of federal trans- portation dollars to make Vegas highways beautiful\u2014In 2008, Nevada received its trans-portation enhancement allotment of $6,287,466. They decided to spend it in a vari-ety of ways, a few million went to biking fa-cilities and trails, a few million went to wel-come centers and interpretive centers. $498,750 even went for ''decorative rocks, na-tive plants, some pavement graphics, a few walls, and some great big granite boulders'' to beautify an interchange to Las Vegas' 215 Beltway. A couple miles down the highway, N-DOT beautified another interchange with ''strip-ing in the rocks and some native plants.'' That project has cost $319,163 so far this year. The people of Nevada might have been able to think of some better things to spend that money on. One local who uses the inter-change frequently was not impressed by the expensive beautification project. ''I'm busy watching where I'm going. I'm not looking at landscape improvements and stamped concrete.'' Unfortunately, there is little that local of- ficials can do to re-direct the money to bet-ter uses. ''We applied for the federal en-hancement dollars and those federal en-hancement dollars can only be used for land-scaping and pedestrian type improvements,'' explains the top civil engineer at the Clark County Public Works Traffic Management Division. The N-DOT deputy director for southern Nevada is just as frustrated as many citizens that federal restrictions prohibit states from directing money where it is really needed. ''It's really getting out of hand to where these pots of money have these constraints associated with them and you can't spend money where you want to.'' These restric-tions sometimes leave states no choice but to spend money on frivolous projects or lose it entirely. The deputy director notes, ''if N- DOT doesn't spend that money and employ workers in Nevada, another state is gonna have that money up for grabs.'' Washington, DC receives Transportation Enhancement grants for murals and valet bikes\u2014Washington, DC received nearly $2 million in transportation enhancement grants in Fiscal Year 2010, ranging from $50,000 to $579,000. These grants include items such as the stabilization of historic murals and a grant for bicycle parking and valet services, along with the creation of a ''Room to Breathe'' poster. The $2 million allotment would be much better used for bridge repair, as 158 of the 244 bridges in the District are ei-ther structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Railroad Caboose Relocation and Renova- tion\u2014The Princeton Railroad Museum re-ceived a $78,280 transportation enhancement grant to help pay for the relocation of a his-toric train caboose to be displayed and re- stored. Texas Highway Rest Stops\u2014The Texas De- partment of Transportation uses a substan-tial amount of their required transportation enhancement spending to build highway rest areas. Texas plans to spend $262 million to build or overhaul roadside stops along its highways, with a majority of the funds com-ing from enhancement grants. However, some residents question the construction of rest stops in such close proximity to other commercial areas, leading one local resident to surmise about the $10 million Salado rest area, ''I think $10 million would have made a nice third lane in a lot of spots . . . It's pret-ty spectacular for a rest area, guess, $2 million worth . . . $10 million? That's a lot of money.'' Additionally, the Texas Depart-ment of Transportation spent $16.2 million in enhancement funding on a Battleship Texas restoration project. California Sculpture Competition\u2014Federal transportation enhancement dollars were used as prize money for an art competition to find a sculpture fitting to place in a park-ing lot for a Laguna Beach, California Friday Film Series event. Merchant and Drovers Tavern Museum\u2014 The Merchants and Drovers Tavern Museum in Union County, New Jersey received a $210,790 transportation enhancement grant to create a museum on the second floor of the recently renovated building. The Merchants and Drovers Tavern Museum touts its amen-ities by letting visitors ''experience the hos-pitality of the 1820s'' and ''quench his thirst in the taproom, sit for a while in the parlor or, perhaps, try a bed for size at this 'hands- on' museum.'' Meanwhile, visitors should also be wary of driving over any New Jersey bridges on the way to the museum, as 35 per-cent of them are either structurally defi-cient or functionally obsolete. Museum uses transportation funds for its Heating and Air Conditioning system\u2014The Sayre Historical Society Museum in Brad-ford County, Pennsylvania received a trans-portation enhancement grant of $74,704 for the ''Sayre Historical Society RR Museum Heating and AC project.'' You read that cor-rectly, American gas taxes are being di-rected towards heating and air installation. War of 1812, Bladensburg, Maryland exca- vation\u2014Enhancement funding was used to excavate several historical buildings in Bladensburg, Maryland to study the ''trans-portation history'' of the area. Bladensburg was used for troop movements during the War of 1812, as well as being a transportation hub during early America. Funding for a Transportation Exhibit\u2014 $300,000 in federal money will pay for a new exhibit on the history of transportation at a local museum in Missouri. The fresh display at the St. Charles County Heritage museum will explain the influence of rivers, railroads, roads, and trails in the region over the years. The grant application highlights how ''The County and its residents have had to rely on multiple forms of transportation and as technology changed, the area had to adapt to the changing transportation methods/pat-terns.'' Not everyone in the community agrees the federal government should fund this type of project. A county executive said, ''It's the kind of thing the federal government can't afford to do.'' Other officials however have a different perspective on the federal funding. The county parks director explained how ''the $300,000 grant is 'a pretty insignificant amount of money compared to that total pool' of federal transportation spending.'' Maybe a more significant number should be 7,021, the number of Missouri bridges that are either structurally deficient or function-ally obsolete. Iowa town receives new entrance sign\u2014 Fairfield, Iowa used $40,800 in transportation enhancement funds to upgrade its ''Welcome to Fairfield'' sign. It is likely that Iowans would welcome their transportation funds upgrading their bridges, as Iowa ranks 3rd in bridge deficiency rates in America. Michigan Receives Transportation funds to plant flowers and rehabilitate an engine house\u2014In 2010, the Michigan awarded $5 mil-lion in federal transportation enhancement grants to various projects including recon-structing cobblestone roads, purchasing and installing bicycle racks, and ''streetscaping'' a downtown street in Bridgetown, Michigan with ''decorative sidewalk treatments, street trees, perennial flowers and other decorative plantings, planters, and ornamental street lighting.'' One grant awarded $336,490 to re-habilitate the historic Quincy and Torch Lake Railroad Engine House while another grant awarded $1,490,280 to the Detroit Science Center to construct an exhibit de-picting ''how roads, tunnels and bridges are constructed.'' Transportation Funding used to replace unaesthetic fencing around Oklahoma Cap-itol Oil Derricks\u2014The Oklahoma Depart-ment of Central Services, the controller of Capitol Grounds, received $216,000 in trans-portation enhancement funding to replace fencing around active oil wells on Lincoln Boulevard with a more aesthetically pleas-ing form of fencing. Unfortunately while Capitol Complex may look better, Oklahoma bridge deficiency rates remain 2nd in the United States. Over $150,000 in Gasoline Taxes directed to- wards making brochures\u2014Over the last 10 years, federal transportation enhancement grants have been used to produce brochures for various purposes including monuments paths, scenic trails, and bicycle safety. The State of Kansas even received a federal grant to install and replace their brochure display cases at SRA. Enhancement funds used to help construct replica of historical schooner\u2014In 2001, Bur-lington, Vermont received a $20,000 grant to subsidize the building a full scale replica of the 1862-class sailing canal boat, the Louis McClure. Crandall Farm Restoration project\u2014Wash- ington County, Rhode Island received a $120,000 transportation enhancement grant for renovation of Crandall Farm. The project consisted of renovating the 1870 house on the farm into a welcome center and educational tool for the traveling public. South Carolina uses gas taxes to purchase $15,000 ''Welcome Signs''\u2014Orangeburg Coun-ty, South Carolina received a $34,965 trans-portation enhancement grant o help pur-chase three signs at a cost of $44,500, or $14,833 per sign. Unfortunately, South Caro-lina bridges are not as welcoming, as 22 per-cent of them are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. The State of Michigan receives nearly $100,000 to celebrate mysterious centennial\u2014 In 2004, Michigan received a $99,540 transpor-tation enhancement grant for publications, historical commemorative items, and dis-plays for a ''centennial celebration.'' The only thing more puzzling than how these ac-tivities are related to transportation is that the centennial for Michigan Statehood oc-curred in 1937. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi- dent, today I rise to offer my support for the President's request for imme-diate supplemental assistance for the Federal Emergency Management Agen-cy. This funding will enable FEMA to continue to provide critical aid to vic-tims left in the wake of Irene's deadly VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 \u2014 SENATE S5616 September 14, 2011 path, and victims of other natural dis- asters that have struck throughout the country. My home State of Rhode Island has experienced two major disasters in the last couple of years, so I know first-hand how hard homeowners, busi-nesses, and municipalities have strug-gled to recover, even with Federal as-sistance programs. This is not the time to play politics. If Congress fails to provide this emer-gency funding between now and Sep-tember 30, we run the risk of com-pletely running out of disaster funds. Our fellow Americans need this funding to recover from catastrophic disasters. Mother Nature does not distinguish be-tween blue and reds States, and both Democratic and Republican Gov-ernors\u2014and in Rhode Island's case an Independent Governor\u2014have asked for immediate disaster aid. This supplemental funding will help replenish FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, which pays for Federal disaster response and recovery activities. The fund has been running dangerously low as a result of the devastating tornado in Missouri, tornados in Alabama, major flooding in the Midwest and South, wildfires in Texas, and the his-toric flooding caused by Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. This year's disasters have been par- ticularly destructive and I urge my col-leagues to remain committed to all the victims as they struggle to become whole again. We should approve this disaster aid to ensure that commu-nities aren't left in ruins. The shortfall in funding has already forced the administration to put cer-tain disaster recovery activities on hold. My State, like many others, sus-tained a federally declared disaster last month as a result of Hurricane and Tropical Storm Irene. In order for FEMA to ensure it had the resources to provide immediate relief for new disas-ters such as Hurricane Irene, the agen-cy had to freeze long-term recovery and mitigation projects. This funding conundrum really hits home because in Rhode Island commu-nities are still reeling from the historic flooding that occurred in the spring of 2010. Rhode Island saw more rain dur-ing that disaster than any month on record, and the devastation wrought by those storms exceeded anything in liv-ing memory. I was on the ground during the flood- ing last year and have been intimately involved in the recovery process. I know how important FEMA's long- term recovery and mitigation pro-grams are for revitalizing damaged communities, especially in States like mine that were already hurting from the difficult economic environment. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to let us pass this critical legislation to provide supplemental funding for FEMA. Not only will it go a long way toward providing peace of mind should another disaster strike, it will also en-sure that communities across the coun-try that are still recovering from past disasters can continue to move forward in their recovery. This will make us a stronger and more resilient nation. Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, Nel- son Mandela once said, ''There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere.'' The walk to freedom for the Burmese people has certainly not been easy, and it is far from complete. The military-controlled government that rules Burma continues to main-tain its tight grip over the Burmese people through fear, intimidation, and violence. According to the State Department, over the last year the Burmese regime has ''severely restricted and frequently violated freedoms of assembly, expres-sion, association, movement, and reli-gion.'' And in furthering its hold over Bur- mese society, the regime has com-mitted crimes of murder, abduction, rape, torture, recruitment of child sol-diers, and forced labor\u2014all with impu-nity. In recent months however, we have seen some encouraging steps. Last November, the Burmese regime released Aung San Suu Kyi, the Bur-mese democracy leader and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, after a long and unjustified incarceration. And the re-gime has made some modest movement towards dialogue with the opposition. But it is far too soon to think that the walk to freedom has succeeded. Just 2 months after releasing Aung San Suu Kyi, the regime dissolved the Na-tional League for Democracy, which has sought to bring democracy to Burma for more than 20 years. And the regime keeps more than 2,000 political prisoners in detention. As Aung San Suu Kyi herself has said, ''If my people are not free, how can you say I'm free? We are none of us free.'' In order to help the Burmese people on their march to freedom, I urge my colleagues to extend our sanctions against Burmese imports for another year. Several of our trading partners\u2014in- cluding the European Union, Canada, and Australia\u2014have joined us in im-posing trade and investment sanctions against Burma. And these sanctions have put significant pressure on the Burmese leadership. So let us extend the import sanctions on Burma for another year. Let us do our part to help the Burmese people complete their long walk to freedom. Madam President, I suggest the ab- sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to call the roll. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. W HITEHOUSE ). The Senator from Wyo- ming. Mr. ENZI. I would ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. REMEMBERING MALCOLM WALLOP Mr. ENZI. It is with a great deal of sadness I have to tell you that Senator Malcolm Wallop, the 18th Senator for the State of Wyoming, passed away this afternoon. He had been ill for some time but had had a very active life and made a great deal of difference to this body. We were very fortunate to have Malcolm Wallop represent us in the Senate for 18 years. For all of his three terms he was a powerful and effective presence in the Congress, assuring the people of Wyoming they were heard and that their concerns were being ad-dressed. Although there are many ac-complishments I could mention\u2014and tomorrow I will probably mention quite a few more\u2014I want to mention two of them today, as they were very significant efforts. The first was the establishment of the Republican Steering Committee. He and two other Senators considered themselves to be the conservatives of the Senate and formed a special caucus that today has grown to include almost all the Republicans. It was for a small-er government and constitutional prin-ciples and spending constraints, and he stuck to those principles throughout his entire Senate career. His other accomplishment\u2014and I can think of none that would make him more proud than the mention that he started the Congressional Awards Pro-gram. This is a program for young Americans where they can do service for their community and receive an award from Congress. Congress puts no dollars into this, which would be part of the philosophy of Malcolm Wallop. He helped to provide for a number of people through the years to be able to come to Washington and receive the Gold Award. It is set up so when you do 100 hours of community service, you can get a bronze medal. When you do another 100 hours of service, you can get a silver medal. When you do 200 or more hours of service, you get a gold medal. He helped to promote the community spirit and his community service has made a huge difference to Wyoming and has spread across the Nation. Of course, we are always very proud in Wyoming that more kids from Wyo-ming have gotten the gold medal than from any other State. It partly has to with his founding of it and the time and effort he put into it, and that suc-ceeding Senators have. Over the years it has served to inspire countless young Americans to believe in themselves and their ability to change the world begin-ning in their own backyard and to start some good habits. Thanks to his initia-tive, the young people of our Nation will continue to dare to do great serv-ice in their neighborhoods and commu-nities, and I cannot think of a better way to have Senator Malcolm Wallop be remembered. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. B EN- NET). The Senator from Wyoming. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Wyoming because VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5617 September 14, 2011 today Wyoming and America lost an extraordinary man. Senator Malcolm Wallop was a dedicated public servant and great legislator. He leaves a proud legacy of a Wyoming Senator who solved problems and initiated great so-lutions. He set a high bar for public service, and all of Wyoming is grateful. Whether he was serving in the Army, the Wyoming legislature, or in the U.S. Senate, Malcolm Wallop always stood for freedom. For decades he worked to strengthen America's national security and to protect States rights. His com-mon sense and his commitment helped break down Washington's barriers to American energy development. Our Na-tion continues to benefit from his lead-ership. There will be much more to say about Malcolm in these coming days and in the weeks ahead as we seek to honor his legacy. I will miss Malcolm's friendship and his support. My wife Bobbi and I send our very heartfelt condolences to his family and to his friends throughout this great country. We will continue to keep the entire Wallop family in our thoughts and in our prayers. I yield the floor and suggest the ab- sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived for the two cloture motions just filed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REID. Mr. President, sadly, in just 2 days, about 80,000 people will be out of work because of the obstruc-tionism of one man. This Senator, the junior Senator from Oklahoma, is put-ting his own petty priorities ahead of the thousands of safety inspectors, con-struction workers, and contractors who are about to lose their health care and their livelihoods for the second time in the last few months. These workers will be furloughed or laid off on Friday if we don't reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. The same Senator is holding up emergency funding for thousands of Americans\u2014hundreds of thousands, ac-tually\u2014whose homes have been de-stroyed by tornadoes, floods, and wildfires. Keep in mind what I just said. We have a bill that came from the House of Representatives that funded for 4 months the Federal Aviation Ad-ministration. We have a bill that came from the House\u2014they put them to-gether\u2014to fund the highway bill for 6 months. With those two bills together, almost 2 million jobs will be elimi-nated if we don't pass the highway bill by the end of the month but FEMA by Friday. The Senator from Oklahoma, to whom I referred, doesn't like a provi-sion in the highway bill. Stopping that is one thing. But now he is stopping us from doing something about people who are in desperate need of help, who have been hit hard by fires\u2014in Texas alone, we have had 2,000 homes burned to the ground. So he is holding up emergency aid for Americans whose homes have been destroyed by torna-does, floods, wildfires, and millions of acres of farmland are underwater, and he is jeopardizing almost 2 million jobs by blocking the highway bill. How he gets these together is something I can-not logically understand. He is stop-ping us from doing something on the FAA bill but also FEMA. On Friday, as I said, it is going to cause 80,000 workers, thousands of whom are responsible for the millions of air travelers' safety every day. We have just been through this. A short time ago, we had the same issue, where the safety inspectors were paying for their own lunches when they would go out inspecting airplanes, and buying their own plane tickets, paying for their own hotel and motel rooms, and not being reimbursed. It is interesting to note this same Senator voted for the highway bill in 2005\u2014we do a major highway bill about every 5 years. He voted for that when his party held the White House, al-though the bill included the same issue he has objected to today. I have been told his big concern is over bike trails, bike paths. But the interesting part is that he can have a vote on this. He wants a vote to get rid of bike paths. He is willing to do that. In fact, we have given him the same vote on an amendment before. In 2009, the Senate voted down the very same amendment. He has had this vote before, and it has failed before. He is not willing to even take a vote anymore. This is how far afield this is. He doesn't want a vote. He wants to put whatever he thinks is the right thing for the world and the country as it relates to highways in this bill and say: Just do it; I am a dic-tator, and I am going to put it in the bill, and you are not going to do any-thing around here. We are willing to vote on this again, but we cannot get to a vote because he is blocking us from doing so. So one Senator out of 100 is holding up the im-portant work of this body, demanding that we make this amendment law or else put 80,000 people out of work. This kind of obstruction should end. This is not logical, not rational. I have strong feelings about this part of the highway bill. But this is a bill that has billions of dollars in it. About 1.7 or 1.8 million jobs will be eliminated if we don't get this bill passed. So I urge my Repub-lican colleague to reconsider how this gridlock harms real people in this country. It is hard for me to explain. In Las Vegas we have a new tower that is being built for the air traffic controllers. It is needed very much. Air traffic into Las Vegas is heavy\u2014about 60 million people a year arrive, and so we need a new tower. We started con-struction on it a few months ago. It was held up once because of this prob-lem we have with this bill. Now it is to be held up again. But this isn't just a Nevada issue, it is all over the country. About 75,000 construction workers are working on essential parts of our airports, and these jobs are badly needed. It is just the wrong thing for my friend to do. I hope he will allow us to move forward on FEMA and allow us to move forward on the Federal Aviation Administra-tion legislation. Of course, on the high-way bill, we will give him his vote. If he wants another vote, we will give him another vote if there is another part of the bill he doesn't like. But it is something we need to get done as quickly as possible\u2014like in the next 24 hours. f MORNING BUSINESS Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the Senate proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. RECOGNIZING THE HAZARD HERALD Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of Ken-tucky's oldest and most respected local newspapers, the Hazard Herald of Haz-ard, KY. In July of this year, The Haz-ard Herald celebrated over a century's worth of news coverage by publishing a 100th-anniversary edition of its morn-ing paper. The Herald is, and has been, the most trusted source of local and national news to the people of Hazard and Perry County for decades. Founder and prominent lawyer and statesman Bailey P. Wootton, who eventually served one term as Ken-tucky attorney general in the 1930s, en-visioned that the Herald would serve as the primary medium for progress and information for the local community when he began publishing the paper in 1911. Over the years, the Herald became the heart of the community, sharing in both the triumphs and sorrows of citi-zens of the county as it grew alongside them. From the arrival of the first train to Hazard Depot in 1912, which a year later would pave the way for boosting the region's coal industry, to the dec-ade-defining flood of 1927 that dev-astated the county, the Herald was front and center. In the 1930s the Her-ald followed Bailey during his cam-paign to be elected Kentucky attorney general, as well as the Hazard High School boys' basketball team as they were eventually crowned state cham-pions. World War II in the 1940s forced the Herald to begin printing daily to keep people informed with the war efforts in Europe, and it remained so until the mid-1950s when it then alternated to a biweekly publication. The paper mourned President Kennedy's death with the nation in the 1960s, and pro-vided an in-depth account of President Bill Clinton's visit to Hazard in 1999\u2014 which was printed in color after the paper adopted color printing tech-nology in the middle of the decade. Most recently, the Herald has adopted online publications and social media to keep pace with the technological ad-vancements that define news and media today. Perry County is fortunate to have such an established and trusted news source to inform the great people of Kentucky. In the 100th anniversary edi-tion of the Herald, printed July 27, 2011, there is an article that highlights the paper's founding and first decade of printing. To help celebrate this land-mark occasion, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: [From the Hazard Herald, Centennial Edition, July 27, 2011] The first decade 1911-1919: The Hazard Her- ald publishes first issue, begins a tradition still alive a century later. The first edition of The Hazard Herald was hand set and came off the gasoline powered VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5619 September 14, 2011 printing press on June 22, 1911. Though we can't find a copy of that first edition, the ef-fect the Herald had on the local community during its first decade is certainly on record. The Herald was operated by its founder and president at the time, Bailey P. Wootton, along with officers George W. Humphries, James B. Hoge, and W.C. Trosper. During that first year, a one-year subscrip- tion to the Herald could be purchased for one dollar as the paper's staff covered the growth of Hazard, which at the time was still look-ing forward to the coming of the railroad a year later, a move that would open up a town that in the years prior was a remote hamlet nearly cut off by the rough and tumble foot-hills of the Appalachian Mountains. The first two years of the Herald's publica- tion were certainly not easy ones, as noted in Perry County Kentucky: A History, pub-lished by the Hazard Chapter of the Daugh-ters of the American Revolution during the 1950s. A publisher in Hazard at that time cer-tainly lacked some of the modern conven-iences that newspaper staff today may take for granted: ''With power still not available in 1911, a two H.P. gasoline engine was in-stalled to run the press. After 1912, elec-tricity was available and the changeover was made.'' In those first years the Herald also served as a chronicler of Hazard's history (as it still does today). One of the most important events in that history was the arrival of the railroad. In the July 20, 1911 edition, the pa-per's fifth that first year, a story details work being completed by the Jones-Davis Company regarding construction of a section of the L&E Railroad which extended ''from below Yerkes to the head of the river of the mouth of Buckeye Creek, about 18 miles.'' The first train arrived at the Hazard Depot in 1912, and it not only opened avenues of travel in and out of the county, but it also paved the way for a more robust coal indus-try, as noted in the Herald's October 7, 1912 edition: ''It will not be long before the coal from this city will be counted by the train-loads instead of the carload.'' Other notable events during the decade in- clude a fire in December 1913 that ravaged the business section of town, destroying $50,000 worth of property, according to a headline of the day. Consumed in the fire was the D.Y. Combs Hotel as well as the of-fices of Dr. Gross and Dr. Hurst. On August 17, 1914, the Herald reported on the first automobile to arrive in Perry Coun-ty: ''Last Thursday, Hazard and Perry Coun-ty (sic) were honored by the first automobile ever inside the county limits. We have had the railroad trains upward of two years, and that has ceased to be a wonder; we have had one autocycle, which remained for a few days and departed from whence it came. But the crowning glory of all was the advent of the Ford touring car which passed through our city last Thursday. Now we are on the qui vive for the first aeroplane.'' By 1916, Wootton was still listed as the president, with James B. Hoge and W.C. Trosper as secretary and manager respec-tively, and a weekly editorial appeared in the newspaper as well. In the January 27, 1916 edition, the Herald took to task the City of Hazard for allowing the city's sidewalks to fall in disrepair, writing: ''In any case, there has been no excuse on the part of either Big Bottom residents or the City government for leaving the walks up that way in the shape it has been for such a long time.'' While the Herald maintained a local flavor during its first decade, in this age before the Internet and instant news delivery, the paper also made note of issues of national impor-tance. By 1918, World War I ended with the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II on November 9. The Herald carried the story with the headline: ''War Is Ended; Kaiser Abdicates.'' By the end of the decade, the paper's year- ly subscription rate had increased to $1.50 while Bailey Wootton remained the presi-dent of the Herald Publishing Company, and John B. Horton had been serving as the edi-tor. f FOREIGN POLICY Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my friend and colleague, Senator M ARCO RUBIO of Florida, on the outstanding speech he delivered yesterday at the Jesse Helms Center in Wingate, NC. I share Senator R UBIO's conviction that America is at our best in the world when we put our values at the center of our foreign pol-icy, beginning with a commitment to the cause of freedom. Senator R UBIO's thoughtful warning against the danger of withdrawing behind our borders is especially timely and important. He is absolutely right that, when we do not confront monsters like al-Qaida abroad, they will sooner or later come to threaten us here at home. I thank Senator R UBIO for delivering such a lucid and visionary speech. His remarks reaffirm for me the critical leadership role that I am convinced he will play in this chamber, and in our country, in the years to come. His voice is an important one. I ask unani-mous consent to have printed in the R ECORD Senator R UBIO's remarks as prepared for delivery. There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: SENATOR MARCO RUBIO'SREMARKS AS DELIVERED TUESDAY , SEPTEMBER 13, 2011 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. First of all, thank you all for coming. I am honored and privileged to be here. I'm impressed by the good work, by the way, that the Helms Center is doing in teaching young people the foreign policy principles that Senator Helms stood for. And I'm honored by this opportunity to speak to you for a few moments eight and a half months into my Senate career on what I think is a historic and important moment in American history. And I hope by the end of our time here together tonight we'll all share that belief irrespective of where we fall on the individual issues. I have come to deeply appreciate Jesse Helms' willingness to fight for his views\u2014 particularly in foreign policy\u2014and his un-willingness to compromise on matters of basic principle. That made him rare in Wash-ington, and it also made him influential. I want to read what a distinguished journalist once wrote that it was ''his relentless, un-swerving application of conservative prin-ciples to practically every issue'' is what ''made him a major player in Washington and [in] national politics.'' Jesse Helms was, in particular, an un- swerving champion of freedom fighters. When he was still a junior Senator, he and a former governor of California\u2014a fellow named Ronald Reagan\u2014they worked to-gether to introduce a ''morality in foreign policy'' plank to the 1976 Republican plat-form. Here is what it said, it said: ''The goal of Republican foreign policy is the achievement of liberty under law and a just and lasting peace in the world. The principles by which we act to achieve peace and to protect the interests of the United States must merit the restored confidence of our people.'' It also said that ''we must face the world with no illusions about the nature of tyr-anny.'' And it pledged that: ''Ours will be a foreign policy that keeps this ever in mind.'' Now, remarkably, this was controversial in the 1970s\u2014the era of de \u00b4tente, of defeat and of retreat. The idea of placing morality at the center of our dealings with other nations was derided by supposed sophisticates as unreal-istic and uninformed. But then Ronald Reagan took these words to heart and he made them the center of his foreign policy\u2014a foreign policy that even his critics now admit was remarkably success-ful. President Reagan challenged the ''evil em- pire.'' ''Tear down this wall,'' he demanded\u2014and it came down. He won the Cold War not by coddling dictators but by confronting them\u2014 and by standing up for the principles that have defined us since the formation of our great Republic. As I think about the challenges of the 21st century\u2014challenges that range from upheav-als in the Middle East to the fiscal crisis back home\u2014I am mindful of Ronald Rea-gan's example and of Jesse Helms'. I am guided by their understanding that America's strength lies in its ideals, and that if we are to make this century another American century, we must be prepared to fight for those ideals. Now, fundamentally, I believe that the world is a better place when the United States of America is strong and prosperous. Now, I don't believe that America has the power or means to solve every issue in the world. But I do believe there are some criti-cally important issues where America does have a meaningful role to play in resolving crises that are tied to our national interests. If we refuse to play our rightful role and shrink from the world, America and the en-tire world will pay a terrible price. And it is our responsibility to clearly outline to the American people what our proper role in the world is and what American interests are at stake when we engage abroad. At the core of our strength are the ''self- evident'' truths of the Declaration of Inde-pendence: ''that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,'' that government exists to ''se-cure these rights'' and that it derives its ''just powers from the consent of the gov-erned.'' These are not just our rights as Americans. These are the rights of all human beings. Nurtured in thirteen embattled colonies along the Eastern seaboard more than two centuries ago, the blessings of liberties have since spread to more than 100 countries around the world. Freedom's domain now stretches from Mexico to Mongolia. Some of the world's de-mocracies are ancient nations. Others are more recent in origin. Some are poor. Others are rich. Some are Christian. Others Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu. All are united by their respect for certain funda-mental human rights\u2014even if they do not al-ways achieve in practice the ideals they seek to honor. America should take pride in knowing that so many of the freedom move-ments we have seen around the world since 1776 draw their inspiration from the courage and the words of our own Founding Fathers. The honor roll of free countries does not yet include the land of my parents or grand-parents\u2014Cuba\u2014but that I believe is only a matter of time. Because sooner or later, the tides of freedom will wash against the shores of this island nation that has been trapped for too long in a prison constructed by Fidel and Raul Castro. VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5620 September 14, 2011 Why am I so confident about the future? Because in our time, we have seen how dicta-torships have fallen and democracies risen\u2014 even in the most unpromising surroundings. Just in the past year, in the Middle East\u2014 the region whose governments have been most resistant to freedom\u2014we have seen the first stirrings of democratic upheavals. We do not know how the Arab Spring will ulti-mately turn out, but it has already proven one thing: that no faith, no ethnicity, no re-gion, and no people are immune to the funda-mental desire to control their own destiny. As dissidents and freedom fighters battle dictators around the world, they look for support to the greatest democracy in the world. And America must answer their call. We do not seek to impose our vision of gov- ernment. We do not insist that every nation must have a presidency, a supreme court or a bicameral legislature. Nor do we have any intention of using force to depose every des-potic regime on the planet. But we must do what we can to champion the cause of freedom\u2014not only with the power of our example but also with our money and our resources, our ingenuity and our diplomacy, and on rare occasion, when there is no good alternative and when our national interest is clearly at stake, our armed might. Without our commitment to the rights of man enunciated by our forefathers, what are we? Just another big, rich country. But when we champion our ideals, we gain moral au-thority\u2014and we gain physical security. You see, we may not always agree with our fellow democracies, but seldom, if ever, do we fight them. The more functioning democ-racies there are\u2014''functioning'' being the important quality\u2014the easier we can breathe. States that do not respect the rights of their citizens seldom respect the rights of their neighbors. They become breeding grounds for all sorts of ills\u2014from the traf-ficking of humans and drugs to contagious diseases and famine, from nuclear prolifera-tion to terrorism\u2014that threaten our own se-curity. Now some suggest that America should heed the famous words of John Quincy Adams and go ''not abroad, in search of mon-sters to destroy.'' The problem is if America turns inward and ignores the monsters abroad, they are likely to come here. It happened in 1917 when German U-boats torpedoed American merchant ships. It happened in 1941 when Japanese aircraft bombed Pearl Harbor. And it happened ten years ago when Al Qaeda carried off the deadliest terrorist at-tack in history from a base in the Hindu Kush. If we do not have the luxury of ignor-ing developments in lands as remote as Af-ghanistan, then there is no corner of the world from which we can safely turn our backs. The fanatics who orchestrated the attacks of 9/11 were nurtured in lands that knew no freedom, in countries where, for too long, the people's pursuit of happiness had been subor-dinated to the rulers' pursuit of power. A lack of economic, social and political oppor-tunity helped to create the conditions that enabled a radical few\u2014deluded by demented doctrines of hate\u2014to commit mass murder simply to make a statement. The form of the threat was relatively novel: We were attacked not by another na-tion-state but by a band of terrorists who took shelter in a failed state. But this threat\u2014like the threats of Nazism, fascism, and communism\u2014comes from a sick and failed ideology. With Osama bin Laden's recent demise, the founder of Al Qaeda joined a long list of ty-rants\u2014Adolf Hitler to Saddam Hussein\u2014who have experienced for themselves the right- eous wrath of a democracy bestirred from its peaceful pursuits. I applaud President Obama for ordering the raid that finally brought Osama bin Laden to his just fate. I applaud the President, too, for his stirring words in support of reformers in the Middle East. I only wish that he had shown more commitment to the cause of freedom. He has been slow and hesitant, and we have missed some significant opportuni-ties to alter the strategic landscape in Amer-ica's favor. And the President's failure to lead has served to magnify the damage done to U.S. interests. For example, in the summer of 2009, the young people of Iran took to the streets to protest against mullahs that had consigned them to poverty, while squandering oil riches to build nuclear weapons and support foreign terrorist groups. The President was so intent on negotiating with Iran's tyrants that he did little to help its people. As the Green Revolution fizzled, protesters de-manded to know, ''Obama, are you with us or against us?'' This year, the Administration did come to the aid of the people of Libya, but only after weeks of hesitation that allowed Moammar Qaddafi\u2014an anti-American criminal\u2014to get back on his feet and resume slaughtering his own people. Then it took another four months before the President was willing to recognize the Transitional National Council as the rightful government of Libya. And even then, the Ad-ministration refused to commit the re-sources and make the tactical decisions that could have shortened this conflict. The regime was so lacking in popular sup- port that it finally fell, but the fact that the war dragged on so long has, at a minimum, raised the costs of reconstruction and lengthened the toll of the dead and wounded. An anonymous presidential adviser justi- fied this by claiming that it was part of a de-liberate strategy to ''lead from behind''. We could see the same doctrine in effect in Syria where the President waited a full six months after the start of a popular upris-ing\u2014six months that Bashar Assad and his goons spent indiscriminately slaughtering their own people\u2014before calling for Assad's removal. And even then, the Administration refused to recall our ambassador or impose the entire list of sanctions that some of us in Congress had been pressing for. Now the President's defenders suggest that it was right not to get more involved because they worry about the consequences of tur-moil in the Middle East. I've often hear it said that: ''Better the devil you know.'' We should be concerned about what will come next in places like Egypt that have been American allies. I can understand why President Obama hesitated before finally withdrawing our sup-port from Hosni Mubarak, which I believe, under the circumstances, was the right thing to do. But it is hard to see why we would hesitate in the case of Iran, Syria or Libya\u2014 all avowed enemies of America. It is hard to imagine a ruler worse than Ahmadinejad, Assad or Qaddafi, and easy to imagine that their successors might be much more ame-nable to our interests. Even in countries such as Egypt, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, we simply do not have the luxury of endorsing the status quo. Instead of tying our fate to discredited dic- tators, we would be better advised to build constructive alternatives. That's what Ron-ald Reagan did when he pushed Ferdinand Marcos out of power in the Philippines in 1986. The following year he did the same thing when he helped push a military ruler out of power in South Korea and supported the transition to civilian rule. Today, South Korea is one of the world's freest countries\u2014 and one of the richest. Yet only forty years ago, it was poorer than North Korea and nearly as poor as Syria. Its transformation shows what is possible when free people are allowed to harness their full potential. This is the change that we must encourage in the Middle East. Now unfortunately the views of some of the protestors distasteful. I certainly condemn the anti-Israel senti-ments uttered by protest leaders, and I can understand why many Israelis are alarmed by the recent turn of events. Israel is one of America's closest allies in the world, and our closest and most reliable friend in the Middle East. It is a shining bas-tion of democracy, liberty, and opportunity in one of the most blighted parts of the world. But the na \u00a8ve strategy of trying to ap- pease Islamist extremists like Iran, and turning our back on Israel, will only em-bolden our common enemies and weaken the prospects for peace\u2014and for democracy itself. For the sake of peace, and out of principle, the United States must strongly affirm its commitment to Israel, not just in words but in deeds. At the same time, the people of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and other Mid-dle Eastern lands are in the streets because they want a better life for themselves and their children. They aren't asking for the imposition of a Taliban-style rule. They are asking for the ballot box and for economic opportunity. And if their desires are ful-filled, they will move closer to Thomas Jef-ferson's vision of the world than Osama bin Laden's. That is why I am so concerned that the Ad- ministration may let this historic oppor-tunity pass. I am glad that the President is trying to bring along our allies. But our al-lies would be the first to tell you that noth-ing important or difficult happens without American leadership. Unfortunately, that leadership has been missing at a critical juncture during the last few years. Most recently, for example, it has been suggested that the advice of military com-manders in Iraq be completely ignored in favor of a dramatic troop drawdown that even Iraqis say is too drastic. It's a reminder that, in our republic, elec- tions have consequences not just at home, but all over the world. Because while pre-vious generations of leaders\u2014and even some I serve with today\u2014have stood up for un-popular but necessary measures, even at the risk of losing elections, others are simply too willing to do what is politically self-serv-ing. America, and the entire world for that matter, needs resolute leadership in this era of historic but volatile transformation, par-ticularly in the Middle East\u2014and particu-larly in Iraq. Beyond the Middle East, in our own hemi- sphere, a combination of narco-trafficking networks, anti-American strongmen, and the increasing penetration of Iranian influence is raising dangers of a special kind. Individ-uals like Hugo Chavez, who have no business running anything in the first place much less a country, have worked strenuously to build a bloc of countries to work against U.S. in-terests\u2014and at great risk to great friends like Colombia. Again, the Administration has missed easy opportunities to stand with our allies, for in-stance, through free trade agreements. We cannot continue to ignore or be complacent about Latin America, nor can we relegate our friends in the region to anything less than high priority partnerships for us to con-tinue nurturing. After all, the security of our democratic society depends on the success of liberty in our own hemisphere. The fight against drug VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5621 September 14, 2011 and human trafficking, and the infiltration of Islamist terrorists requires the success of economic and political freedoms\u2014and of the rule of law\u2014in Latin America. We must be more vigilant\u2014and more decisive\u2014in defend-ing our interests in our own hemisphere. And by the way, the notion that we should ''lead from behind'' would have been incom-prehensible even to the Democrat who pre-ceded President Obama. In his second inau-gural address, President Bill Clinton said that ''America stands alone as the world's indispensable nation.'' That is as true today as it was in 1997. If America refuses to lead, who will combat international outlaws? Who will stop terror-ists and weapons proliferators? Who will deal with the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs? The rising disorder in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia? The growing challenge from China which seeks to dominate East Asia, but won't even let its own people use Google? The world counts on America. And whether we like it or not, there is virtually no aspect of our daily lives that is not directly im-pacted by what happens in the world around us. We can choose to ignore global problems, but global problems will not ignore us. Yet our ability to lead is threatened. It's threatened not by any external foe, but rath-er by our own fiscal woes. This year, the national debt surpassed the size of our economy and it will continue to grow unless we get it under control. Now, I am a strong advocate of cutting un- necessary and wasteful spending, but the de-fense budget is not the biggest driver of our debt\u2014it accounts for roughly twenty percent of our annual federal spending. By contrast, entitlement programs swallow more than half the budget and they are the main driv-ers of our debt. The Pentagon already faced sharp cuts. During his last two years in office, Secretary of Defense Gates cut or curtailed procure-ment programs that, if taken to completion, would have cost $300 billion. This summer, the President and congressional leaders agreed to cut another $350 billion from the defense budget over the next ten years. Those cuts by themselves alone are worri- some enough but what is more worrisome is what's looming: In the worst case scenario, if the so-called Debt Super Committee doesn't reach any deal at all, the Pentagon could stand to be slashed by more than $1 trillion over ten years. Our new secretary of defense\u2014himself is a well-known budget hawk\u2014has warned that cutbacks of this scale would have a ''dev-astating effect on our national defense.'' I can but echo Leon Panetta's words. The American armed forces have been one of the greatest forces of good in the world during the past century. They stopped Na-zism and Communism and other evils such as Serbian ethnic-cleansing. They have helped birthed democracies from Germany to Iraq. They have delivered relief supplies, and per-formed countless tasks in service to our na-tion. All they have ever asked for in return is that we provide them the tools to get the job done\u2014and that we look after them and their families. They have never failed us in our time of need. We must not fail them now. We must main- tain a strong national defense. Foreign aid is also an important part of America's foreign policy leadership. While we certainly must be careful about spending money on foreign aid, the reality is that it is not the reason we have a growing debt prob-lem. If it is done right, and when done in part- nership with the private sector and faith- based community, foreign aid spreads Amer-ica's influence around the world in a positive way. Let me give you an example: the Bush Administration's program to provide HIV medicine to Africa has not only saved lives, it has increased America's influence across the continent. These are allies in the future that can be our partners, not just in our po-litical struggles on the world stage, but in economic trade. And a world where people are prosperous and free to grow their econo-mies and pursue their own dreams is a better world for all of us. I began by quoting the words of Jesse Helms and Ronald Reagan. In closing, let me recall the great words of one of the most im-portant Democrat leaders of the 20th Cen-tury\u2014Harry S. Truman. In 1951, speaking to the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., this is what he said: ''I have the feeling that God has created us and brought us to our present position of power and strength for some great purpose. It is not given to us to know fully what that purpose is. But I think we may be sure of one thing. And that is that our country is in-tended to do all it can in cooperating with other nations to help create peace and pre-serve peace in the world. It is given to us to defend the spiritual values\u2014the moral code\u2014 against the vast forces of evil that seek to destroy them.'' There are still vast forces of evil seeking to destroy us. The form of the threat has changed since Truman's time. But evil re-mains potent\u2014and America remains the strongest line of defense, often the only line of defense. I pray that we will continue to find the wisdom and courage\u2014and resources\u2014to act effectively in the defense of our moral code\u2014 the same code that we share with all civ-ilized people. The world needed a strong America in Truman's time. And if this is to be another American Century, the world needs a strong America now. Because freedom cannot survive without us. Thank you so much for having me. May God bless all of you and may God bless our country. Thank you. f REMEMBERING COMPTROLLER GENERAL ELMER B. STAATS Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the memory of Elmer B. Staats, one of the great civil servants of the post-World War II era. A former Comptroller General of the United States and head of the General Accounting Office, as GAO was then called, Mr. Staats died July 23 in Wash-ington at the age of 97. Elmer Staats had the distinction of serving under every U.S. President from Franklin Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan. But more important than the longevity of his career was his record of professional achievement. A leading figure in the world of public adminis-tration and government account-ability, Elmer Staats was renowned for his dedication to constructive change and good government principles. Appointed Comptroller General in 1966, Elmer Staats helped lay the foun-dation for the modern-day GAO. He transformed it from an agency pri-marily known for financial audit work to one that evaluates the effectiveness of virtually every Federal activity at home and abroad, from antipoverty programs to military spending to in-vestments in infrastructure. At the start of Staats' tenure at GAO, accountants comprised more than 95 percent of the agency's profes-sional staff. By the time he retired in 1981, the agency's workforce included such diverse professionals as econo-mists, social scientists, attorneys, and computer experts\u2014all career employ-ees hired on the basis of their knowl-edge, skills, and ability. Under Elmer Staats, GAO took a lead role in issuing auditing guidance. In 1972, the Comptroller General issued the first edition of what has come to be known as the ''Yellow Book''\u2014the final word on government auditing stand-ards. He also directed GAO to issue guidance to help state and local audi-tors and was instrumental in estab-lishing intergovernmental audit fo-rums in the 1970s. In addition, Elmer Staats sought to strengthen ties with the international auditing community through his active involvement and leadership in the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions. He founded GAO's International Auditor Fellowship Pro-gram in 1979, which enables auditors from other countries to meet with GAO staff and acquire new knowledge and perspectives. His is a living legacy that is still de- livering results, both for Congress and the American people. Just name a Fed-eral program or policy, GAO has prob-ably reviewed it and made suggestions for improvement. Last year, measur-able financial benefits from GAO work totaled nearly $50 billion, an $87 return on every dollar invested in GAO. Elmer Boyd Staats was born in Rich- field, KS, in 1914. His family were wheat farmers. The only one of his eight siblings to attend college, Elmer Staats graduated Phi Beta Kappa from McPherson College in 1935, and later earned a master's degree in political science and economics from the Uni-versity of Kansas and a doctorate in political economy at the University of Minnesota, where he wrote his dis-sertation on the new Social Security Administration. Elmer Staats' career in the Federal Government began in 1939, when he joined the Bureau of the Budget, now the Office of Management and Budget. His talents were recognized early on, and he served in high-level posts at the Bureau under Presidents Truman, Ei-senhower, Kennedy, and Johnson. Eventually, he became the Bureau's Deputy Director before President John-son appointed him to a 15-year term as the fifth Comptroller General of the United States. He held that post through the administrations of Presi-dents Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter, and into the early months of the Reagan administration. After leaving GAO, Elmer Staats be- came the president and later chairman of the board of trustees of the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation. He was a member of the Governmental Ac-counting Standards Board from 1984 to 1990. During the 1990s, he served as the VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun \u2014 SENATE S5622 September 14, 2011 first chairman of the Federal Account- ing Standards Advisory Board. Elmer Staats helped found the Amer- ican Society for Public Administration in 1939 and later served as its national president and vice president. He was also a founding member in 1967 of the National Academy of Public Adminis-tration and remained a trusted advisor on many Academy projects over the years. He received numerous awards for distinguished public service, along with honorary degrees from eight univer-sities. He was elected to the Account-ing Hall of Fame in 1981. When asked whether he was a Repub- lican or a Democrat, Elmer always po-litely but firmly declined to answer. In fact, he was famous for having a nee-dlepoint pillow in his office that fea-tured an elephant on one side and a donkey on the other. The message about his and GAO's nonpartisan role in government was clear. As Bob Schieffer observed in a recent commentary on ''Face the Nation,'' Elmer Staats' reputation in Wash-ington was such that you ''knew you could take what his agency reported to the bank\u2014its facts were seldom dis-puted, its neutrality never challenged, his political affiliation never known.'' I want to express my gratitude for Elmer Staat's many years of exem-plary service to our Nation. His intel-ligence, dedication, and integrity will be missed. At the same time, Elmer Staats set an example for the type of men and women who will be needed to help lead our government in the fu-ture\u2014individuals of outstanding abil-ity, sound character, and a genuine commitment to the greater good. My thoughts and prayers go to his three children\u2014David Staats, Deborah Sanders, and Catharine Taubman\u2014and to his three grandchildren and great- granddaughter. f CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this Sat- urday, the Nation marks the 224th an-niversary of the day when the Found-ers signed the fundamental charter for our democracy\u2014the Constitution of the United States. During the Con-stitutional Convention, the delegates debated hundreds of issues and pro-posals before crafting the final charter. Thankfully, the Founders had the fore-sight to know that their debate would not be the final word on the subject. The work of defining our Nation\u2014en-suring protection of rights for all Americans\u2014would continue, as we strive to create ''a more perfect union.'' It was through the leadership of the late Senator Robert C. Byrd that the Congress began to officially celebrate the signing of the Constitution, calling the September 17 anniversary Constitu-tion Day. Senator Byrd understood the importance of ensuring that future generations value our Nation's found-ing charter. This week, in schools across the country, students will learn about the Constitutional Convention and the meaning of Constitution Day. For well over two centuries, the Con- stitution has allowed America to flour-ish and, importantly, adapt to new challenges. Since the inclusion of the Bill of Rights in 1791, the Constitution has been amended just 17 times. There has been much discussion of late about amending our Nation's fundamental charter. As chairman of the Senate Ju-diciary Committee, that is not some-thing that I take lightly. Proposing amendments to the Constitution should not be a reflexive response to political threats. Each Member of Con-gress swears to support and defend the Constitution; it should be treated with the reverence it deserves, not as lever-age in heated political debate. While I certainly believe that the Constitution has been improved over time in our ef-fort to create a more perfect union, those amendments were thoroughly considered and debated over time. Be-fore we alter our national charter, we must openly consider whether such amendment would hamstring future generations. Pressure groups may demand that elected representatives sign pledges about what they will and will not do if elected to office. The pledge I follow\u2014 the one I was honored to make again at the beginning of this Congress\u2014is to uphold the Constitution. I take that pledge seriously. ''We the People'' owe a great debt to the Framers of our Con-stitution. And as we commemorate the signing of the Constitution of the United States of American 224 years ago, I hope all Americans will take this opportunity to read the words of our founding charter and learn about how it protects us all. f TRIBUTE TO KEEGAN BRADLEY Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with the Senate now back in session, as a Vermonter I would like to call the Sen-ate's attention to Mr. Keegan Bradley's first-place finish in the 93rd Profes-sional Golf Association's Championship Tournament on Sunday, August 14. Mr. Bradley is the first male golfer born in Vermont to win a major PGA Cham-pionship. Keegan Bradley has earned a perma- nent place for himself, and Vermont, in the record books. As a rookie golfer, his participation in the 2011 PGA Championship is his first major tour-nament, making him one of only three rookie golfers ever to place first in a major tournament debut. This win also marks the end of a six-major tour-nament dry spell for American golfers. In order to win this year's PGA Cham-pionship, Bradley needed to dem-onstrate tenacity and determination. Keegan successfully came back from a four-shot deficit in the last three holes of the tournament, proving his ability to focus and overcome obstacles. His PGA Championship win extends Mr. Bradley's successful start to his professional golf career. Most notably, he placed first in another PGA tour- nament earlier this year, the HP Byron Nelson Championship in Texas. In 2011 he has also finished in the top 10 in 4 PGA tournaments, as well as having finished within the top 25 in 10 others. Even more impressively, Keegan Bradley has spent many of his younger years living in the New England area, with seasonal weather that did not al-ways afford him the luxury of training year-round. This resulted in much time-sensitive dedication and focus, as winter weather inhibits year-round outside practice in our part of the country. Keegan Bradley was born in Wood- stock, VT, in 1986 and attended Wood-stock High School. He is the son of Mr. Mark Bradley, golf professional at Crown Point Golf Club, and Mrs. Kay Bradley. Keegan is also the nephew of Ms. Pat Bradley, a Ladies Professional Golf Association Hall-of-Famer. I am proud to recognize Keegan Bradley for his accomplishment, both as a Vermonter and a professional golfer. I join all Vermonters in wishing him many more years of success. f MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to the Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his sec-retaries. f EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate messages from the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand per-sonal savings and retirement savings coverage by allowing employees not covered by qualified retirement plans to save for retirement through auto-matic IRAs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Automatic IRA Act of 2011. When fully phased in, this bill will give nearly 42 million Ameri-cans nationwide an easy, effective way to take responsibility for their finan-cial futures and plan for a secure re-tirement. The Act incorporates the President's call, in his Proposed fiscal year 2010, 2011, and 2012 Budgets, for Congress to enact Automatic IRA leg-islation. Currently, about half of American workers have no opportunity to save for retirement at work. In my home State of New Mexico, that share is nearly 60 percent. Among those lacking coverage at work, only one in ten con-tributes annually to an individual re-tirement account, IRA; the rest gen-erally make no dedicated savings for retirement. The result? An alarming number of American workers are woe-fully unprepared for a financially se-cure retirement. According to Boston College's Center for Retirement Re-search, ''in 2009 half of today's house-holds will not have enough retirement income to maintain their pre-retire-ment standard of living, even if they work to age 65, which is above the cur-rent average retirement age.'' Espe-cially in this period of economic uncer-tainty, it is imperative that Congress focus on this retirement savings crisis. My bill takes a common-sense ap- proach to doing so. Under this bill, most private-sector employees working in establishments of 10 or more employees who are not currently covered by a workplace re-tirement plan would be given the op-portunity to save through regular pay-roll deposits that continue automati-cally, unless they elect out. The sav-ings will be deposited into the worker's own IRA, which will be subject to the laws already in place governing IRA accounts. Employers' administrative functions will be minimal. And the ar-rangement is market-oriented; other than the smallest of accounts, auto-matic IRAs will be provided by the same banks, mutual funds, insurance carriers, and other institutions that currently provide them. The automatic IRA approach is in- tended to help these households over-come the barrier of inertia. It builds on the successful use\u2014encouraged by re-forms I strongly supported the Pension Protection Act of 2006\u2014of automatic features in 401(k) plans that encourage employees toward sensible decisions, while allowing them to make alter-native choices. We have already seen evidence that automatic 401(k) enroll-ment can dramatically boost employee participation rates, from seven in ten eligible workers to 9 in 10. In the 401(k) context, the gains are even more strik-ing for population groups least likely to save, including women, Latino, and low-income workers. Of the 75 million American workers who now are not covered by employ-ment-based retirement plans, an esti-mated 42 million would be eligible to save and enroll under Automatic IRA legislation. This includes more than 250,000 in my home state of New Mex-ico. Many of these individuals are fa-miliar with IRAs. But when asked why they haven't used the existing pro-gram, about half point to issues relat-ing to setup and decision-making as the key barriers. The automatic IRA would eliminate these barriers, and the Retirement Security Project estimates that automatic IRA legislation could increase net national saving by nearly $15 billion annually. This is the fourth consecutive Con- gress in which I have introduced Auto-matic IRA legislation. The concept was initially developed by scholars at the Brookings Institution and Heritage Foundation. Indeed, the Automatic IRA concept has long enjoyed broad support across the political spectrum. For instance, Martin Feldstein, chief economic advisor to President Reagan, has described himself as ''a great en-thusiast of automatic enrollment IRAs'' who thinks ''as a policy, it's a no-brainer'' and ''can't imagine why there would be any significant opposi-tion from political players on either side of the aisle.'' Finally, this bill seeks to send a strong signal of preference for employ-ers to offer qualified retirement plans, VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun SENATE S5626 September 14, 2011 like 401(k)s. Among other features, it doubles the credit for employers that newly establish qualified plans and it directs the Secretaries of the Treasury and Labor to implement final regula-tions and establish a model plan for Multiple Employer Plans. I am grateful that my colleague on the Senate Finance Committee, Sen-ator K ERRY , is joining me in intro- ducing this bill. I am also pleased to note the broad range of stakeholders supporting the Automatic IRA concept, including AARP; the American Society of Pension Professionals & Actuaries; Aspen Institute's Initiative on Finan-cial Security; for Women; the United States Black Chamber; the United States Women's Chamber of Commerce; Women Impact-ing Public Policy; and the Women's In-stitute for a Secure Retirement. Ensuring easy access to a retirement account and the ability to have part of their wages go directly from their pay-check into this account are proven strategies to encourage retirement sav-ings. I call on the Senate to take up this bill and give it full consideration. By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mrs. M URRAY ): S. 1559. A bill to establish the San Juan Islands National Conservation Area in the San Juan Islands, Wash-ington, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Re-sources. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the San Juan Islands National Conservation Area Act. The San Juan Islands in northwest Washington host some of the most beautiful, serene spots in the world. The San Juans are made up of 172 is-lands with over 300 miles of shoreline, some little more than rocks, others home to towns, farms, and forests. The coastlines are a mix of sandy and rocky beaches, shallow and deep harbors, and placid and reef-studded bays. And be-tween the many islands run channels of water that support many of Washing-ton's most important marine species, including abundant salmon runs and our majestic regional icon, the orca whale. Included in the San Juan Islands are nearly 1,000 acres of land owned by the Federal Government, spread out over 60 separate locations and managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, BLM. These parcels, which range from pine forests to lighthouses, provide rec-reational, ecological, historical, cul-tural, and scientific benefits to island residents and around 70,000 tourists that visit each year. Despite their value, no long-term comprehensive management plan ex-ists for these Federal parcels, threat-ening continued preservation and pub-lic access to these sites. Many of these areas are fragile, increasing the chal-lenge of accommodating increasing numbers of visitors. In addition, San Juan Island resi- dents have seen the possibility of pub-lic lands they treasure being trans- ferred to private ownership. In 2005, the Washington State Department of Nat-ural Resources made a unilateral deci-sion to divest itself of all its properties in San Juan County, including Mitchell Hill, a popular and scenic hiking trail on San Juan Island. While these lands were actively pursued by a private, out-of-state, real-estate developer, I was proud to work with the San Juan Island community to help secure Fed-eral funding to keep these lands in the public domain. Unfortunately, the Bureau of Land Management lands in the San Juan Is-lands are not permanently protected or preserved in public ownership. Last July, Congressman L ARSEN , the Bureau of Land Management, and I visited with residents and businesses that have been working for years to permanently protect these special places. The legislation I introduce today is a direct result of our efforts and rep-resents a consensus between the San Juan Island community, Congressman L ARSEN , and the Department of the In- terior. If enacted, the San Juan Islands National Conservation Area Act will designate all 1,000 acres of BLM lands in the San Juans as a National Con-servation Area, ensuring that these natural treasures remain protected, ac-cessible to the public, and better man-aged to accommodate visitor use. National Conservation Area des- ignated lands are considered some of the most important Bureau of Land Management properties and are there-fore a higher priority for management funding than non-designated lands they manage. Specifically, National Con-servation Area status would ensure the San Juan Island properties are appro-priately managed to protect their unique qualities and not grouped in with other BLM lands where activities such as mining, oil and gas explo-ration, off road vehicle use, and grazing are allowed. Importantly, my legisla-tion requires that the management plan drafting process allows for local input into how these properties are to be managed for the long-term. A National Conservation Area des- ignation will also foster a stronger working relationship with other agen-cy partners such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and provide increased opportunities for sharing resources. I am looking forward to working to advance this legislation through the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and through the full Sen-ate. Through our efforts we will work to ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy these special parts of the San Juan Islands. I would also like to thank my col- league Senator M URRAY for agreeing to cosponsor this legislation, and Con-gressman L ARSEN for his leadership and introducing companion legislation today in the House of Representatives. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the text of the bill be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 1559 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance access to controlled substances for residents of institutional long-term care facilities, and for other purposes; to the Com-mittee on the Judiciary. Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nursing Home Resident Pain Relief Act of 2011. This legislation will help ensure that nurs-ing home residents have timely access to pain medication as needed in emer-gency situations. By streamlining processes that can now cause delays in administering these vital drugs, the bill will also allow designated health care professionals to administer con-trolled substances to residents whose medical conditions warrant quick pain relief. To accomplish these ends, the legis- lation amends the Controlled Sub-stances Act, CSA, in several ways. First, it allows nurses and other appro-priately licensed health professionals, designated by the nursing home and with approval from the physician, to order and administer pain medication to residents upon a physician's oral prescription. The bill also establishes a clear chain of accountability for these licensed health professionals, physi-cians, as well as for nursing homes and long-term care pharmacies. Last year, the Special Committee on Aging, which I Chair, held a listening session where we heard about a recent Drug Enforcement Agency, DEA, en-forcement initiative that has kept nursing home residents from receiving much-needed medication to manage their pain. For many years, nurses had been able to call urgently-needed pre-scriptions into pharmacies upon a phy-sician's order over the phone. Phar-macies would fill the order, residents would get their pain medication, and physicians would follow up with writ-ten confirmation of the prescription. Now, DEA requires physicians to di-rectly issue prescriptions in writing for Schedule II pain medications before they can be dispensed, including in emergency circumstances. This poses a problem for nursing home residents be-cause facilities often do not have phy-sicians on site to fill out the necessary paper work in time to provide criti-cally needed pain medicine. The DEA's enforcement initiative has created an unintended consequence where nursing home residents often have to suffer for several hours or even days before they receive pain medication. These delays have serious con- sequences. Here is an all-too-common scenario: an elderly resident that re-turns to a nursing home after surgery may be in more pain than his physician anticipated and need more medication than the physician prescribed to man-age the pain. In order to access the medication he needs, the nursing home employees must first have his physi-cian send a written prescription to a pharmacy. If the physician is difficult to locate or slow to respond, this can take hours or even days. The resident's VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 \u2014 SENATE S5628 September 14, 2011 pain may become so unmanageable while he waits that he must be trans-ported by ambulance to a hospital emergency room. The ambulance ride and emergency room admission are not only expensive; they can set back the fragile resident's recovery from sur-gery. Our legislation would make these situations entirely avoidable. DEA's enforcement initiative effec- tively put nursing home providers in a difficult position: If they follow the letter of the law, they are in danger of violating Health and Human Services regulations requiring them to admin-ister medications in a timely manner. Failure to do so can result in monetary penalties. In addition, pharmacies could face fines under the CSA if they respond to the nursing home's order\u2014 which is almost always transmitted by a nurse\u2014if they fill the order. As a re-sult, a number of pharmacies, includ-ing several in the Midwest, are facing tens of millions of dollars in fines im-posed by DEA. Last year DEA issued a policy state- ment to provide a way for nursing home residents to access some kinds of medication more quickly. Under this new policy, a nursing home's licensed health care professionals may, on a physician's behalf, transcribe the phy-sician's oral prescription for Schedule III, IV or V medications to a pharmacy to be filled. While we appreciated DEA's efforts, without amending the CSA the agency does not have the stat-utory authority to allow licensed health care professionals to transmit prescriptions for Schedule II controlled substances, the category under which nearly all pain medications fall. Legis-lation is required in order to provide nursing home residents prompt, reli-able pain relief when they are suffering from severe injury or illness. Our bill would provide a remedy by modifying the CSA to permit pain medication to be dispensed in emer-gency situations by nursing home pro-fessionals without a direct written order by a physician prior to its dis-pensing. Let me explain how this would work. A physician, if he or she chooses, would be able to authorize the adminis-trator of a long-term care facility to designate one or more licensed health care professionals employed by the fa-cility to act as a ''facility designee.'' In emergency situations only, and upon receiving an oral prescription from the physician, a facility designee would be permitted to contact a pharmacy to have the prescription filled and then dispense Schedule II medications to long-term care facility residents. This would allow a physician to pro- vide the prescription information to the facility designee via phone when a resident urgently needs pain medica-tion and the physician is unavailable to transmit a written prescription to a pharmacy for a Schedule II controlled substance. The facility designee must document the physician's prescription in writing and transmit the written document to a pharmacy so that the prescription can be filled. After the pharmacy fills the prescription, it must send a copy of the written docu-ment memorializing the prescription to the physician for his or her endorse-ment. The physician must then send the endorsed document, confirming the oral prescription, to the pharmacy within five business days. Diversion of controlled substances for illicit purposes is of great concern to me. That is why we have included numerous provisions to protect against diversion in nursing homes. For exam-ple, the bill requires careful record-keeping by facilities and pharmacies, which can then be reviewed by DEA as necessary. It requires each actor\u2014the physician, facility designee, and phar-macist\u2014to make a record of his or her role in the process. Long-term care fa-cilities are asked to maintain a written or electronic logbook that memorial-izes prescriptions and their administra-tion. Additionally, the legislation en- hances criminal and civil penalties for long-term care facility administrators and facility designees who divert drugs, or who violate recordkeeping require-ments. These steps will help to ensure that pain medications get to those nursing home residents who need them. I appreciate the great interest of the stakeholders, including long-term care facility, physician and pharmacy orga-nizations, in solving this problem and I look forward to working with them to finally end the needless delay in pain relief. I would like to thank Attorney General Holder, DEA Administrator Michelle Leonhardt, and their staff for working with me on this legislation, and I look forward to continuing our work together to assure rapid approval by Congress. Nursing home residents cannot wait for pain medication when they are in debilitating pain and our straight-forward bill can help provide some needed relief. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. f SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS SENATE RESOLUTION 266\u2014SUP- PORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF ''NATIONAL SAVE FOR RETIREMENT WEEK'', IN-CLUDING RAISING PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE VARIOUS TAX-PREFERRED RETIREMENT VEHICLES AND INCREASING PER-SONAL FINANCIAL LITERACY Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. E NZI, and Mr. C ARDIN ) submitted the fol- lowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance: S. R ES. 266 Whereas people in the United States are living longer, and the cost of retirement is increasing significantly; Whereas Social Security remains the bed- rock of retirement income for the great ma-jority of the people of the United States but was never intended by Congress to be the sole source of retirement income for fami- lies; Whereas recent data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute indicates that, in the United States, less than 23of workers or their spouses are currently saving for retire-ment, and the actual amount of retirement savings of workers is much less than the amount needed to adequately fund their re-tirement years; Whereas the financial literacy of workers in the United States is an important factor to workers understanding the true need to save for retirement; Whereas saving for retirement is a key component to overall financial health and security during retirement years, and the importance of financial literacy in planning for retirement must be advocated; Whereas many workers may not be aware of their options in saving for retirement or may not have focused on the importance of, and need for, saving for retirement; Whereas many employees have available to them, through their employers, access to de-fined benefit and defined contribution plans to assist them in preparing for retirement, yet many of those employees may not be taking advantage of those plans at all or to the full extent allowed by Federal law; Whereas the need to save for retirement is important even during economic downturns or market declines, which make continued contributions all the more important; Whereas all workers, including public and private sector employees, employees of tax- exempt organizations, and self-employed in-dividuals, can benefit from increased aware-ness of the need to develop personal budgets and financial plans that include retirement savings strategies and to take advantage of the availability of tax-preferred savings ve-hicles to assist workers in saving for retire-ment; and Whereas October 16 through October 22, 2011, has been designated as ''National Save for Retirement Week'': Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate\u2014 (1) supports the goals and ideals of ''Na- tional Save for Retirement Week'', including raising public awareness of the various tax- preferred retirement vehicles as important tools for personal savings and retirement fi-nancial security; (2) supports the need to raise public aware- ness of the availability of a variety of ways to save for retirement which are favored under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and are utilized by many people in the United States, but which should be utilized by more; (3) supports the need to raise public aware- ness of the importance of saving adequately for retirement and the continued existence of tax-preferred employer-sponsored retire-ment savings vehicles; and (4) calls on the States, localities, schools, universities, nonprofit organizations, busi-nesses, other entities, and the people of the United States to observe National Save for Retirement Week with appropriate programs and activities, with the goal of increasing re-tirement savings for all people in the United States. f SENATE RESOLUTION 267\u2014RECOG- NIZING THE HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH AND CELEBRATING THE HERITAGE AND CULTURE OF LATINOS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE IMMENSE CONTRIBU-TIONS OF LATINOS TO THE UNITED STATES Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. C ORNYN , Mr. R EID of Nevada, Mr. VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:35 Jun September 14, 2011 WHITEHOUSE , Mr. U DALL of New Mex- ico, Mrs. B OXER , Mr. B EGICH , Mr. L AU- TENBERG , Mr. N ELSON of Florida, Mr. SCHUMER , Ms. M IKULSKI , Mr. B I NOUYE , Mr. R EEDof Rhode Island, Mr. B ROWN of Ohio, Mr. DURBIN , Mr. U DALL of Colorado, Mr. WYDEN , sub- mitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to: S.

MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to recognize the township of Warminster, Pennsylvania, upon the celebration of its 300th anniversary. The township derives its name from the town of Warminster, in Wiltshire, England. Warminster is the twin township of South-ampton, Pennsylvania, which lies immediately southeast and adjoining. It is also bounded by the townships of Northampton, Warwick, and Warrington, all of which lie in my Congres-sional district, the 8th District of Pennsylvania. To this day, Warminster has the same limits as when originally laid out, with an area of over six thousand and ninety-nine acres. Warminster was one of the earliest town- ships settled in America, with roots tracing all the way back to the 17th century. John Hart and John Rush were among the most promi-nent early settlers in Warminster, both arriving shortly after William Penn in the latter part of the 17th century. Combined, Hart and Rush owned over one thousand acres of land in the Warminster area. They, along with many other early settlers and statesman, helped to foster growth in Warminster by aiding in road and church construction, and farm development, thus laying the groundwork for the beautiful township of Warminster. Many years later, Warminster became a ref- uge for American soldiers during the Revolu-tionary War, at the battle of Crooked Billet. In the skirmish action, British forces launched a surprise attack against Brigadier General John Lacey and three regiments of Pennsylvania militia, forcing them to retreat into the farms in Warminster. During the wake of WWII, Warminster also became the home of one of the largest naval modification units in the area. At the Naval Air Development Center in Johnsville, large quan-tities of aircraft parts were modified for use in the war, and progress was made on the devel-opment of guided missiles. The NADC also played a critical role in training mercury astro-nauts and establishing the United States as the world leader in technology and space ex-ploration. During the cold war era, the NADC employed over 2600 people, including 1600 scientists and engineers, and 300 members of the military. With such a rich history, it is clear that War- minster Township deserves much recognition and praise. I am honored to represent the people of Warminster Township, and wish them all the best on this momentous occasion. LETTER FROM AMBASSADOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN, YASHAR ALIYEV HON. DAN BOREN OF OKLAHOMA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. BOREN. Mr. Speaker, as co-chairmen of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, Con-gressman B ILLSHUSTER of Pennsylvania and I would like to bring a letter to the attention of our House colleagues that we received from the Ambassador of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Yashar Aliyev. EMBASSY OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZER- BAIJAN TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , Washington, DC. Hon. D ANBOREN , Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. D EARREPRESENTATIVE BOREN , I am writing to express my concerns of the reports that on September 13, 2011 the so-called ''Office of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in the USA'', the Embassy of Armenia to the United States and major Armenian-Amer-ican organizations are organizing event on the premises of the U.S. Congress, dedicated to the so-called ''20th Anniversary of Inde-pendence of the Nagorno-Karabakh Repub-lic''. According to the news reports Mr. Ashot Ghulian, who presents himself as the ''Chairman of the NKR Parliament'', will be visiting Washington D.C. and will be the keynote speaker at the event. In this regard, I draw your attention to the fact that so-called ''Nagorno-Karabakh Re-public'' is a self-proclaimed entity created on the occupied territories of Azerbaijan, supported by Armenia and essentially is under its direction and control. It is entirely unrecognized as such, even by Armenia. As a result of the Armenia-Azerbaijan con- flict hundreds of thousands of the Azerbaijanis were expelled from the Nagorno-Karabakh region and surrounding territories of Azerbaijan. Four UN Security Council resolutions adopted in 1993 following the armed seizure of Azerbaijani territory re-affirm the sovereignty and territorial integ-rity of the Republic of Azerbaijan, demand immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces from all occupied regions. By engaging in public campaigns using the Congress premises the agents of the sepa-ratist regime pursue the goal of distracting the attention of the Members of Congress and broad American public from the contin-ued occupation of the territories of Azer-baijan by the Armenian armed forces, ac-companied by gross violation of human rights of hundreds of thousands of the Azer-baijani IDPs. Their ultimate goal is to con-solidate the occupation of these territories and to prevent return of the displaced Azer-baijani population to their homes and prop-erties from which they were forcibly ex-pelled. Allowing organization of such activities on American soil encourages the Government of Armenia to hold on to its uncompromised position in peace negotiations and com-plicates the already difficult settlement process. Participation of Members of Con- gress in these events may be qualified as sup-port for the separatist regime and negatively affects the honest broker image of the United States as a Co-Chair of the OSCE Minsk Group tasked to find just and peaceful solution to the conflict. Azerbaijan is an important strategic part- ner of the United States. Azerbaijan provides multi-faceted support for U.S. operations in Afghanistan and remains a steadfast sup-porter of Israel. Our two countries cooperate on counterterrorism and nonproliferation issues. Moreover, Azerbaijan greatly contrib-utes to the energy security of the United States and Europe. I ask you to refrain from participating in this event that is directed against the sov-ereignty and territorial integrity of the Re-public of Azerbaijan, a key ally of the United States in the strategic Caspian region and to voice your opposition to using Capitol grounds for such activities. Sincerely, Y ASHAR ALIYEV , Ambassador of the Republic of Azerbaijan. f IN RECOGNITION OF NICHOLAS CARL GOTTUSO HON. JACKIE SPEIER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Police Captain Nicholas Carl Gottuso, ''Nick,'' for his 32 years of service with the Hillsborough Police Department. Captain Gottuso began his career in law en- forcement in 1976 as a Dispatcher for San Mateo County Communication. In 1980 he was hired by the Pacifica Police Department as a Patrol Officer, where he served for two years. In January 1983 he was hired by the Town of Hillsborough as a Police Office, pro-moted to Corporal in 1990, Inspector in 1992, Sergeant in 1993, Lieutenant in 1999, Police Commander in 2002 and achieved the rank of Police Captain that same year. During Captain Gottuso's employment with the Hillsborough Police Department, he trained as a Field Training Officer, a Background Investigator, and a Traffic Investigator; and he served as the Head Range master and was responsible for the selection and designation of a stand-ardized firearm, the Beretta 92F. Captain Gottuso proved to be invaluable to his community as both a field agent and an administrator. He was one of the Founding Commanders of the North Central Regional SWAT Team, served as a Sniper Team Com-mander and led and participated in dozens of successful operations, many of which led to the capture of criminals and the saving of in-nocent lives. As a police captain, Captain Gottuso re- sponded to numerous bank robberies and other active shooter incidents. Time and again, Captain Gottuso put his life on the line for the residents of Hillsborough, and the com-munity will forever be indebted to him for his bravery, selflessness, and competence. VerDate Mar 15 2010 04:04 Sep 15, \u2014 Extensions of Remarks E1620 September 14, 2011 Even when Captain Gottuso wasn't on the front lines, he worked tirelessly to improve the lives of Hillsborough's residents, as well as the lives of the men and women serving our coun-try abroad. Gottuso worked with overseas Unit Commanders during his time as the adminis-trator of the Adopt-a-Troop program, a non- profit organization that sends much-needed care packages to our troops fighting overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2004, I worked closely with Captain Gottuso to redesignate the Eugene A. Doran Memorial Bridge which spans the scenic Crys-tal Springs Dam on I-280 in San Mateo Coun-ty. The bridge was named after the slain Hillsborough police officer and we passed a California Senate Resolution to include Officer Doran's son who died in the line of duty in Vietnam. The Bridge was renamed the Officer Eugene and Marine Lance Corporal Patrick M. Doran Memorial Bridge. Despite Captain Gottuso's extensive service on the front lines of law enforcement, he never lost his sense of humor or desire to entertain. Captain Gottuso's ability to lighten the mood delighted generations of schoolchildren during police presentations. His yearly narration of the K-9 squad demonstration made it a truly enjoyable and memorable event for anyone who witnessed it. Nicholas Carl Gotusso was born in Ft. Car- son, Colorado in 1954 and attended Mills High School in Millbrae, California. In his spare time he enjoys boating, karate, flying, coaching soccer and he is an avid Marksmanship advo-cate. In 1991 he married his wonderful wife Pau- lette and they are the proud parents of Dominic, Marisa, Nicolette and Samantha. Captain Gottuso's dedication to public safe- ty, effective enforcement of the law, record of bringing criminals to justice and protecting in-nocent life and property while maintaining the highest level of professionalism and an infec-tious sense of humor all warrant special grati-tude and recognition. Mr. Speaker, I ask the members of this body to join me in honoring Nicholas Gottuso upon his retirement for his dedication to public service at the Hillsborough Police Department. f EMPOWERING PARENTS THROUGH QUALITY CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT SPEECH OF HON. RUSH D. HOLT OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, September 13, 2011 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2218) to amend the charter school program under the Ele-mentary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the Empowering Parents through Quality Charter Schools Act, H.R. 2218, which is a bi-partisan bill to reform and strengthen the char-ter school program. I recently gave the graduation speech at the Princeton Charter School, a high quality char-ter that opened its doors more than a decade ago and was recognized as a blue ribbon school by the U.S. Department of Education in 2004. And I was pleased to see the success there. But I urged them to make sure they are well-integrated in the public school system in their community. We need to reinvigorate America's edu- cation system and give each and every child the opportunity to learn and thrive. I am an ad-vocate of alternative forms of education includ-ing charter schools. I think these institutions can be viable and beneficial in promoting aca-demic achievement and diversity. It is important to remember that charter schools are part of the public school system, and we must hold them to the same standards of broad educational access and same stand-ards of accountability\u2014which means we have to be willing to shut down charter schools that fail to meet expectations. Otherwise, charter schools are not true to their reason for being: to inject innovation and experimentation into the public school system. I am pleased that this bill increases accountability for charter schools and ensures states use a schools per-formance as a primary factor for charter re-newal. I have long believed that charter school in- novations and best practices must be shared with other school districts\u2014urban, rural, and suburban school districts alike. This requires work on both sides: outreach by the charter schools and acceptance by the traditional pub-lic school system to learn what there is to be learned. I worked with Rep. P OLIS to include such language in his ALL-STAR Act. That is why I am pleased that the bipartisan legislation before us today includes provisions to require charter schools to disseminate best practices with other public schools. This legislation also ensures that States work with charter school authorizers to put in place the quality controls necessary for hold-ing charter schools accountable, including an-nual performance data and financial audits. These provisions will lead to more replication of high-quality charter schools nationwide. I share the concerns of some that more can be done to improve the accountability, equity and transparency of charter school, and as we continue to move this bill through the process, I hope additional improvements can be made. But we should all recognize that this bill makes a great deal of progress from the exist-ing program and deserves our support today. f IN RECOGNITION OF JOHN AND MARY ANNE COX, AND JIM AND PAULETTE PHILLIPS, FOR THEIR ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HE-ROES RUN/WALK HON. MARK S. CRITZ OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. CRITZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec- ognize the extraordinary fortitude and abiding generosity of two sets of parents of fallen he-roes. John and Mary Anne Cox lost their son, Army Specialist Gregory Cox, in Iraq in Sep-tember of 2004. Less than 2 years later, in February of 2006, Jim and Paulette Phillips lost their son, Marine Lance Corporal Steven Phillips, in the same war. In the face of such horrific personal loss, the parents of Army Specialist Cox and Lance Corporal Phillips chose neither to languish in their own sadness, nor make their own emo- tional convalescence the focus of their lives. Instead, in the spirit of the selflessness of their courageous sons, they chose to create an event devoted to enriching the lives of others. The event, the annual Heroes Run/Walk, will take place for the fifth time this Saturday, September 17, 2011, at Green Cove Yacht Club in Millsboro, Pennsylvania. The majority of the proceeds from the event will benefit the memorial funds that have been established to honor the sacrifices of Specialist Cox and Lance Corporal Phillips. Specialist Cox's fund provides support to graduates of Greene County High Schools entering the Army Re-serve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) or in-tending to pursue a field of study that will lead to a career in public service. Lance Corporal Phillips' fund provides support to the com-puter-aided technology drafting program at Greene County Career and Technology Cen-ter. Part of the proceeds from the Heroes Run/ Walk will also be used to fund the transpor-tation of veterans living in Greene County who are receiving treatment at the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System. Last year, the race's over 400 registrants raised in excess of $15,000. Sponsors and or-ganizers of the event expect a strong turnout again this Saturday, and are eager to once more honor the memory of Specialist Cox and Lance Corporal Phillips. The Heroes Run/Walk is a testament to its founders, John and Mary Anne Cox, and Jim and Paulette Phillips, and demonstrates their capacity to turn tragedy into an amazing gift for others. They deserve both our support and appreciation. f IN RECOGNITION OF ANN BARLOW HON. JACKIE SPEIER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Ann Barlow who served as president and chairperson of the board for the Professional Businesswomen of California for the last four years. Ann has been an inspirational and ef-fective leader of PBWC which I founded 23 years ago to help women advance profes-sionally. The board of directors is very fortu-nate to retain her as a member, but will cer-tainly miss her gracious leadership. Ann became involved with PBWC as soon as she moved from New York to the Bay Area in 2005. She happened to move in next door to the former president, Debra Boblitt, who im-mediately recognized Ann as a perfect can-didate for the board. She was voted in as president two years later. Ann possesses all the qualities and quali- fications it takes to be a successful business woman; she is smart, creative, professional, funny, warm, beautiful and generous. She has lent her talents to Peppercom for the last ten years. She is a partner and the president of its West Coast operations and led the founding of GreenPepper, Peppercom's environmental sustainability services. Before she joined Peppercom, Ann led the New York office of Interpublic Group-Owned Mindstorm Communications. Ann is a master communicator and has writ- ten numerous articles and given many VerDate Mar 15 2010 04:04 Sep 15, \u2014 Extensions of Remarks E1621 September 14, 2011 speeches on environmental issues and digital communication. In 2009, Ann was named one of the Bay Area's most influential women by the San Francisco Business Times. This year she was chosen to participate in the pres-tigious Tedwoman conference. Ann was born in Davenport, Iowa on August 15, 1960. She went to Freeport High School in Freeport, Illinois and received her B.A. in Jour-nalism from the University of Illinois. She lives in San Ramon, California with her husband Bob, two children Chris and Vivian and her two spoiled beagles Kipper and Osgood. In her spare time she enjoys reading, cooking, playing golf, talking politics and walk-ing with Kipper and Osgood. Mr. Speaker, I ask this body to join me in honoring Ann Barlow for her extraordinary contributions to improve the lives and careers of thousands of women in California and all over the world. f COMMENDING RANDY BURGESS FOR 33 YEARS OF OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO THE U.S. FOREST SERVICE HON. HEATH SHULER OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. SHULER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Randy Burgess who recently retired from the Pisgah National Forest with 33 years of outstanding service to the U.S. Forest Serv-ice. Mr. Burgess began his work in forests dur- ing summers while in college at Eldorado and Stanislaus National Forests in California. After he graduated from Virginia Tech with a bach-elor's degree in wildlife and forest manage-ment, he worked as a ranger at several na-tional forests such as those in Sumter, South Carolina, and Rio Grande, Colorado. He began work at the Pisgah National Forest in 2003. During his 8 year tenure as head of the Pis- gah District Operations, Mr. Burgess was in-strumental in the upkeep and renovations in and around the forest. Mr. Burgess helped im-prove water quality through stream stabiliza-tion projects, supported various volunteer cor-porations, implemented upgrades at the Cra-dle of Forestry, provided public restrooms in the forest, and built a connector trail from the city of Brevard to the Pisgah National Forest. The 5.5-mile-long Estatoe Trail opened to the public on October 15, 2010, and has been a tremendous benefit to the citizens of that area. Mr. Burgess also served as a Forest Service Liaison to my office, lending his expertise in conservation to positively impact national pol-icy. Mr. Burgess' leadership over the last few years has left a great mark on the Pisgah Na-tional Forest and provided positive influence on Congressional policy. Mr. Burgess has shown extraordinary dedi- cation to our community and has had an indel-ible impact on the Pisgah National Forest. The service that Mr. Burgess has contributed to Western North Carolina and the U.S. Forest Service is truly inspiring and I am proud to represent him. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the exceptional career and service of Mr. Randy Burgess. HONORING LEO J. HULSEMAN HON. HENRY C. ''HANK'' JOHNSON, JR. OF GEORGIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I submit the following proclamation. Whereas, seventy-five (75) years ago Leo J. Hulseman established the Paper Container Manufacturing Company in Chicago, Illinois, and by the 1940s began manufacturing a paper cone cup known as the ''Solo Cup'' which provides unparalleled hygiene and con-venience to consumers; and Whereas, the ''Solo Cup'' was such an in- spiration that the company itself was renamed Solo in the 1940s and become a brand that would become ubiquitous across America and the world; and Whereas, Solo Cup has grown to be a $1.6 billion company and has demonstrated its con-cern for the environment by introducing many product lines relying on compostable and re-newable sources; and Whereas, Solo Cup is a recognized industry leader in the areas of sustainability and beau-tification receiving the 2010 Keep America Beautiful Corporate Leadership Award; and Whereas, The Solo plant in Conyers, Geor- gia is a place where 400 of our citizens are employed and is an enthusiastic participant in Georgia's Work Ready Program; and Whereas, The Solo Company has proven to be a great corporate citizen supporting com-munity outreach and educational initiatives by working closely with public officials, the Con-yers-Rockdale Economic Development Council and the Rockdale Chamber of Commerce; and Whereas, the U.S. Representative of the Fourth District of Georgia has set aside this day to honor and recognize the Solo Com-pany, it's management and employees for leadership and service to our district; Now Therefore, I, H ENRY C. ''H ANK'' JOHN- SON, JR., do hereby proclaim September 13, 2011, as Solo Cup Company Day in the 4th Congressional District of Georgia. Proclaimed, This 13th day of September, 2011. f HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. WIL- LIAM SANDERS, EDUCATOR, COMMUNITY LEADER AND BUSI-NESSMAN HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON OF MISSISSIPPI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak- er, I rise today to recognize the life of educa-tor and community leader, William Sanders. Mr. Sanders was born March 27, 1928, in Monticello, Mississippi. Upon graduation from McCullough High School in Lawrence County, Mr. Sanders con-tinued his education at Alcorn College, where he played basketball. While attending Alcorn, Mr. Sanders was called to fulfill his military du-ties and later completed his degree in Agri-culture Research. Mr. Sanders served in the Army in the 31st Artillery Brigade and was sta-tioned in Alaska during his tour. Additionally, he was assigned to the Special Services. He was honorably discharged from the Army at the rank of Sergeant. Mr. Sanders's first professional job was as an educator in the Jefferson County School District, where he also served as principal, as-sistant principal and football and basketball coach. He would go on to teach in the Hatties-burg and Brookhaven School District, and con-cluded his career in education with the Hinds County School District. Mr. Sanders worked towards a master's degree during the sum-mers in Boston and Indiana Universities. Mr. Sanders was the Chief Financial Officer for the first Head Start Program in the state of Mississippi, the Child Development Group of Mississippi (CDGM). Mr. Sanders did not limit his education to the classroom; he remained active in his com-munity, socially and politically, as well as entrepreneurially. Upon leaving CDGM, Mr. Sanders successfully, owned and operated the Delta Drive Texaco service station in Jackson, Mississippi, where his greatest satisfaction was employing others in his community. He was an industry pioneer and received several awards in recognition of his shrewd business sense. Mr. Sanders married Emma Dunbar Sand- ers and had six children. He and his family were actively involved in the Civil Rights movement and made enormous sacrifices in an effort to amplify the voice of oppressed blacks in the segregated south. His actions helped shape future civil rights policy in the segregated south and advance the rights and freedoms of African Americans. Mr. Sanders, a loyal Democrat, was actively involved in local, state and national politics. He attended the Democratic National Conven-tions in New York, Boston, Chicago, Los An-geles and most recently the 2008 Democratic Convention in Denver where Senator Barack Obama received the Democratic Party's nomi-nation. He took great pride in the election of the first African American president and viewed this as a logical result of the Civil Rights Movement. Again, I ask that my colleagues please join me in saluting the life and legacy of educator, community leader and businessman Mr. Wil-liam Sanders. f HONORING THE 40TH ANNIVER- SARY OF COMMUNITY SHARES OF WISCONSIN HON. TAMMY BALDWIN OF WISCONSIN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 40th anniversary of Community Shares of Wisconsin and to recognize the commitment of its participants to serving their communities. In 1971, amidst a deep societal divide over civil rights issues and the Vietnam War, a number of area volunteers created the Madi-son Sustaining Fund, America's first social ac-tion fund. Today, the fund now known as Community Shares of Wisconsin (CSW) part-ners with donors and non-profit member groups to address social, economic, and envi-ronmental challenges through grassroots ac-tivities, advocacy, research, and public edu-cation. VerDate Mar 15 2010 04:04 Sep Extensions of Remarks E1622 September 14, 2011 CSW continues to effect change in all as- pects of our society by supporting the work of its non-profit member groups. The sixty-three non-profit member groups currently supported by Community Shares of Wisconsin are groups independently involved in tackling so-cial and environmental issues both locally and nationwide. By working with CSW, each mem-ber non-profit group gains access to a larger network of supporters and more abundant re-sources with which to advance its mission. For 40 years, CSW has utilized this pooled resource model to devise innovative solutions and ideas that generate lasting changes in so-cial justice across the United States. It is due to the hard work of CSW member organiza-tions like the Fair Housing Center of Greater Madison that more Wisconsinites can live in affordable housing complexes that offer per-manent shelter and community safety. Other members of the CSW, like the Wisconsin Women's Network, are committed to the bet-terment of women's health, safety, and work-place protections. Although these are just a few examples, it is without a doubt that the civil rights and liberties of our family, friends, and neighbors stand better protected today thanks to the dedication and commitment of CSW member groups. In addition to advancing social justice, the pursuit for environmental preservation is one of CSW's highest priorities. By supporting non- profit groups such as Clean Wisconsin, Friends of Wisconsin State Parks, and the River Alliance of Wisconsin, CSW works to im-prove the condition of Wisconsin's waters and its air quality. The great State of Wisconsin now thrives as a haven for residents and tour-ists who take pleasure in the outdoors and de-pend on the State's natural resources on a daily basis. Today, CSW continues to bring together thousands of donors to benefit a multiplicity of causes through its non-profit member groups. I extend my sincerest congratulations to Com-munity Shares of Wisconsin on its 40 years of forward thinking and its steadfast pursuit of justice and environmental protection for our community, both here in Wisconsin and across this great Nation. f IN RECOGNITION OF MICHAEL J. CRILLY HON. JACKIE SPEIER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I rise today to pay tribute to Superintendent Michael J. Crilly, who retires this month from the Jefferson Union High School District. Superintendent Crilly came up through the ranks, spending 39 years in the Jefferson Union High School District as teacher, vice principal, principal, associate superintendent and, for the past 17 years, superintendent. During his tenure at the helm, Mike led the district through two successful bond cam-paigns, allowing school buildings and fields to be upgraded and modernized to better serve a growing and changing student body. He partnered with the City of Daly City to develop the Challenge Leadership Program, bringing students from various schools together to find ways to improve their education and learn im- portant leadership skills. Mike also formed a partnership with San Francisco State Univer-sity, the South San Francisco Unified School District and Serramonte Shopping Center to conduct an annual college fair, providing stu-dents access to representatives from nearly 70 colleges and universities. In 2007, he was named Regional Super- intendent of the Year by the Association of California School Administrators, a recognition justly deserved. Mr. Speaker, Mike Crilly is not an adminis- trator who feels that public service ends at the close of business. He gives tirelessly to his community, having served as President or Chairperson of the San Mateo County Super-intendents' Association, Daly City\u2014Colma Chamber of Commerce and Western Associa-tion of Schools and Colleges Accrediting Com-mittee. Mike has also served on the Associa-tion of California School Administrators, Daly City Economic Development Advisory Com-mittee, Daly City\u2014Quezon City Sister City Committee, Pacifica Library Task Force, Sky-line College President's Council and the Seton Medical Center Board of Directors. A native San Franciscan, Mike Crilly was educated in local schools. He received his Bachelor of Arts from St. Patrick's University and his Secondary Teaching Credential and Administrative Services Credential from the University of San Francisco. Mike and his in-credible wife, Patricia, raised three inspiring daughters\u2014Jennifer, Megan and Erin\u2014and Mike's retirement will leave even more time to enjoy his family, especially grandchildren Brayden and Ellie. If I know Mike, retirement will also encour- age more home remodeling and gardening projects but I'm sure there'll be plenty of base-ball squeezed in as well. Mr. Speaker, Superintendent Crilly has served his students and his community with the greatest honor and distinction. I am privi-leged to call him a friend and fellow public servant. I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in thanking Super-intendent Michael J. Crilly for his service to our nation and to the students and taxpayers of the Jefferson Union High School District. f EMPOWERING PARENTS THROUGH QUALITY CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT SPEECH OF HON. EARL BLUMENAUER OF OREGON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, September 13, 2011 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2218) to amend the charter school program under the Ele-mentary and Secondary Education Act of 1965: Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I voted in favor of House Resolution 2218, the Empow-ering Parents Through Quality Charter Schools Act. While I support most of the legis-lation, I have a few concerns which I would like to highlight. I welcome the additional accountability re- quirements and the increased access meas-ures incorporated into this legislation, as well as the specific encouragement for public char-ter schools and traditional public schools to share best practices. However, I am worried about the authority given to the Secretary to dispense charter planning grant money. We have often seen this discretionary authority used to coerce school districts or states into adopting policies that do not fit within the state's education framework. While I appreciate the bipartisan nature of this legislation, and the important advances it makes for accountability and access issues, I hope that the discretionary authority given to the Secretary is used judiciously. f IN RECOGNITION OF KAREN PHILIP HON. JACKIE SPEIER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, it is with im- mense appreciation and a tinge of regret that I rise today in honor of Karen K. Philip, who retires at the end of this month as Deputy Su-perintendent of the San Mateo County Office of Education. There is no doubt that she has earned her retirement, after thirty-eight years educating the children\u2014and impressing the parents\u2014of California's 12th Congressional District. Mr. Speaker, I doubt that anyone has ever met Karen Philip where they did not learn something. She is the consummate educator, beginning in 1973 in the South San Francisco Unified School District, where she served for seventeen years as a teacher, speech thera-pist, special education administrator and prin-cipal, Karen has dedicated her life to the chil-dren of San Mateo County. From there, she was recruited by the Millbrae School District to serve as Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction and, after just two years, was appointed Su-perintendent of the District, a post she held for fifteen years. During her tenure in Millbrae, the schools in her charge received many pres-tigious awards, including three California Dis-tinguished School Awards and the National Blue Ribbon, awarded in Washington D.C. to Taylor Middle School. Throughout her career, Deputy Super- intendent Philip has been tapped for numer-ous leadership positions, including serving as President of the San Mateo County Super-intendents Association, the Special Education Local Plan Area Board, and Soroptomist Inter-national of Millbrae/San Bruno. She has also been named a ''Woman of Distinction'' by Soroptomist International, received the Cali-fornia ''Schoolmasters Award'' in 2011 and was inducted into the San Mateo County ''Women's Hall of Fame''. Mr. Speaker, as with all true educators, Karen's greatest achievement is in the many thousands of children\u2014most who are now adults\u2014who have benefitted from her passion and extraordinary talent for teaching. No doubt, our county's loss is Karen's grand-children's gain. Now they get to spend even more time soaking in all the incredible lessons their brilliant grandmother has to offer. Karen was born and raised in Michigan and attended Detroit's Wayne State University, where she received a Bachelor of Arts in Speech and English and her Master Degree in Communication Disorders and Sciences. VerDate Mar 15 2010 04:04 Sep 15, \u2014 Extensions of Remarks E1623 September 14, 2011 Mr. Speaker, I have been honored to work with this incredible woman on promoting sound education policy for more than two dec-ades. I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in thanking Deputy Superintendent Karen Philip for her remark-able service to our nation's children and wish she and her husband, Lou, a phenomenal re-tirement filled with exciting travel, good health and the love of their amazing family: Kimberly and her husband Keith, Jeff, and his wife Jenn, and grandchildren Lydia, Mark, Caitlin, John, Emma and Amelia. f RECOGNIZING DR. GEORGE R. CARRUTHERS HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Dr. George R. Carruthers, a world-renowned scientist, an innovative leader in astronomy and engineering, and a resident of the District of Columbia. Through the guidance and encouragement of his father, Dr. Carruthers discovered his in-terest in engineering. After graduating from Englewood High School in Chicago, Dr. Car-ruthers earned a bachelor's of science degree in aeronautical engineering, a master's degree in nuclear engineering, and a doctorate de-gree in aeronautical and astronomical engi-neering at the University of Illinois. Though born in Ohio and raised in Illinois, Dr. Carruthers has spent most of his distin-guished career as a resident of the nation's capital. Since joining the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in 1964, Dr. Carruthers has co-in-vented the far-ultra violet electrographic cam-era, which was first used in sounding rockets in 1966 and was used during the Apollo 16 mission to the moon in 1972, giving scientists fresh, revealing images of Earth and space. He was also the first to detect molecular hy-drogen in deep space in 1970. Dr. Carruthers has been a driving force in the use of ultra-violet astronomy. Not only was he involved in the review of the early design of the Hubble Space Telescope, which was carried into orbit in 1990, where it remains and continues to op-erate, he has refurbished the telescope in the Observatory on the campus of Howard Univer-sity, enabling students, educators, families, and the general public to use the telescope to view special astronomical events. Dr. Carruthers was inducted into the Na- tional Inventor's Hall of Fame in 2003, and has received numerous awards, including the Black Engineer of the Year in 1987, the Arthur S. Fleming Award in 1971, the Exceptional Achievement Scientific Award from the Na-tional Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1972 and the Warner Prize from the American Astronomical Society in 1973. The District of Columbia and its residents are particularly grateful for Dr. Carruthers' work in helping to develop the next generation of engineers by creating the Science and En-gineering Apprentice Program, a summer pro-gram in which D.C. Public Schools high school students work side-by-side with professional scientists. Dr. Carruthers has also edited and co-authored several publications and co-pro-duced a series of instructional videos on Earth and space science for high school students. For more than two decades, Dr. Carruthers has been an active member of Science, Math-ematics, Aerospace, Research, and Tech-nology (S.M.A.R.T.), Inc., where he has shared his knowledge through presentations and hands-on activities with students, edu-cators, families, and the general public. Dr. Carruthers spent six years coordinating work-shops in aerospace, science and technology for African-American students in the D.C. met-ropolitan area for S.M.A.R.T. and the National Air and Space Museum. Dr. Carruthers is the editor of the National Technical Association (NTA) Journal and newsletter, is the President of the D.C. Chap-ter of NTA, and was a secretary of the Devel-opment Fund for Black Students in Science and Technology for more than two decades. For a lifetime of achievements and for con- tinuing contributions to science, engineering, and astronomy, as recognized throughout the nation and the world, I ask the House to join me in celebrating the uniquely distinctive place of Dr. George R. Carruthers in science. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. JAMES A. HIMES OF CONNECTICUT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to be present to cast my vote on Mr. H OLT's amend- ment to H.R. 2218\u2014Empowering Parents through Quality Charter Schools Act. I wish the record to reflect my intentions had I been able to vote. Had I been present for rollcall No. 702, I would have voted ''yes.'' f IN RECOGNITION OF RICHARD BOITANO HON. JACKIE SPEIER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise this today to ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-resentatives to join me in recognizing Richard Boitano as he retires as Associate Super-intendent of Education for the Jefferson Union High School District. Rick Boitano has served his community for 38 years as a teacher, Vice-Principal, District Director of Pupil-Personnel Services and As-sociate Superintendent. In addition, he has been active in numerous organizations dedi-cated to helping young people and the com-munity at large, including the San Mateo County Juvenile Justice Planning Council, San Mateo County TANF Planning Council, San Mateo County Community Schools Task Force, Board of Directors of Youth Empow-ering Systems, Inc., San Mateo County Juve-nile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Com-mission, Pacifica Youth Service Bureau, Every 15 Minutes Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program and the Association of California School Ad-ministrators. In addition, Rick has been a presenter at the California State Juvenile Officers' Associa-tion Annual Training Conference, the San Mateo County Prevention Coordinators Meet-ing, and the National School Transportation Association Convention on Gang Awareness, School Safety and Gang Intervention. Rick has also served as Chairperson of the WASC School Accreditation Process and the San Mateo County Gang Task Force Schools Division. In addition, Rick is a member and past-president of St. Pius Catholic Church Mens' Club. Rick Boitano was born and raised in San Francisco, having received his Bachelor of Arts, Secondary Teaching Credential and Ad-ministrative Services Credential from the Uni-versity of San Francisco. He and Beverly, his lovely wife of 35 years, have raised four boys\u2014Tim, Jonathan, Matt and Andrew\u2014and his retirement will provide extra time for his grandson, Jude. Mr. Speaker, I commend Rick for his dec- ades of service to the young people of Califor-nia's 12th Congressional District. He has earned his retirement and I wish him nothing but the best, which is exactly what he gave the students and parents of the Jefferson Union High School District every day for thirty- eight years. f RECOGNIZING AZERBAIJAN AND THE AZERI PEOPLE HON. BILL SHUSTER OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, as the Co- Chairman of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Azerbaijan and the Azeri people for their ongoing support of the United States and our allies in the Global War on Terror. Azer-baijan has been a consistent supporter of U.S. efforts in the fight against terrorism, and the Azeris have worked with us to strengthen eco-nomic and political stability in the Caspian re-gion. It is important that we recognize the sac-rifices made by our allies and continue to thank them for their support. As we reflect back on the recently passed 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, we must remember that the fight against terrorism is not a fight against Islam. On September 11, 2001, Americans of all faiths and citizens from around the world tragically lost their lives. Today, uniformed and civilian men and women around the world work shoulder to shoulder to combat the ongoing threat of ter-rorist attacks that don't just affect the United States, but virtually every nation. This effort is not one of faith; rather it is an effort to keep citizens of all nations safe from barbaric acts of terrorism. Immediately after 9/11, Azerbaijan, a major- ity Muslim nation, was among the first to offer strong support and assistance to the United States. Azerbaijan participated in operations Iraq and is actively engaged in Afghanistan, having recently doubled its military presence there. Azerbaijan has extended important over-flight clearances for U.S. and NATO flights to support ISAF and has regularly pro-vided landing and refueling operations at its airports for U.S. and NATO forces. Also, Azer-baijan plays an important role in the Northern VerDate Mar 15 2010 04:04 Sep 15, \u2014 Extensions of Remarks E1624 September 14, 2011 Distribution Network, a supply route to Afghan- istan by making available its ground and Cas-pian naval transportation facilities. Additionally, Azerbaijan provides specialized training for Afghan police, border guard offi-cers and de-miners, education and training of Afghan civilian and military medical doctors, and medical treatment of Afghan citizens at Azeri hospitals. Azerbaijan has provided med-ical equipment and supplies to Afghanistan as well as assisting in the construction of schools and hospitals there. Azerbaijan remains a reliable partner of NATO and the EU in the South Caucuses through its consistent and effective contribu-tion to common goals and objectives. Azer-baijan is also an active partner of the United States in efforts regarding the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction through its participation in programs such as Caspian Guard and Cooperative Threat Reduction. On July 5, 2011, an Azerbaijani aircraft fly- ing a support mission for NATO troops crashed as it descended into Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. While it is my understanding that investigations are ongoing, it has come to my attention that one leading theory is that Taliban fighters may have shot down the air-craft as it made its final approach. While we await further information on exactly what hap-pened that night in Afghanistan, it is important that we recognize the loss of life of the nine crew members on board that flight who made the ultimate sacrifice. While we can take comfort knowing that we are not alone in this fight, we must also make sure we comfort those who make sacrifices alongside us. It is with a heavy heart that I offer my thanks and appreciation to the family, friends, and countrymen to those crew mem-bers of Silk Way Airlines IL-76. The world is a safer place due to their commitment to sup-port and supply our troops and allies in their hunt for those seeking to harm peace-loving people around the world. f ENDING CONGRESSIONAL PENSIONS HON. MIKE COFFMAN OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to put an end to the defined-benefit retirement plan cur-rently available to Members of Congress. These are extremely difficult economic times. We are in a debt crisis that will require sacrifices on the part of all Americans. I served in both the U.S. Army and the Marine Corps, and I was taught that leaders should never ask others to do anything that they themselves would be unwilling to do. Con-gress needs to set an example and lead the way for the country. I think this is a good start. The defined benefit retirement plan gives Members of Congress an averaged percent-age of their annual salary (currently $174,000) for every year they serve in Congress. To be eligible for the retirement plan they must first serve at least five years. They will then re-ceive 1.7% for every year up to 20 that they serve in Congress, and 1% for every year after 20. For example, if a Member of Con-gress served for 20 years, and they were at least 62, he or she would receive 34% of their salary, or $59,160 per year, based on the cur-rent salary. Members of Congress pay 1.3% of their salary into the pension plan and are re-quired to pay into Social Security at the same rate as everyone else. They may contribute to a Thrift Savings Plan that has a match similar to many private sector 401(k) plans. My legislation will honor any retirement ben- efits accrued prior to the passage of this bill, and will keep the Social Security and Thrift Savings Plan in place. I believe that Members of Congress should feel the same economic pressures the rest of society does, and I firmly believe that the cur-rent effort to reduce spending and constrain the size and scope of government requires that all possible solutions be taken, including cuts to the Congressional budget. I urge the passage of this bill. f IN RECOGNITION OF THE BUILD- ING OWNERS AND MANAGERS ASSOCIATION OF SAN FRAN-CISCO HON. JACKIE SPEIER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Building Owners and Managers Associa-tion of San Francisco on the historic occasion of its 100th anniversary. BOMA San Francisco has been advocating for commercial real estate interests, training future leaders and promoting sustainable prac-tices. I have partnered with BOMA since my days on the San Mateo Board of Supervisors and in the California Legislature and have wit-nessed its effective work that supports busi-ness growth which in turn creates tax dollars for important public services. Healthy commercial real estate provides homes for countless businesses that employ our workforce. BOMA always strives to create better work environments for our future gen-erations. It has been honored for its progres-sive environmental policies to help promote energy conservation and sustainable practices in office buildings. BOMA is also a tireless ad-vocate of emergency preparedness. For 20 years BOMA has partnered with the San Francisco Fire Department and put big smiles on children's faces. The San Francisco Firefighter Toy Program is the oldest program of its kind in the country and has donated over a million toys to disadvantaged children. Mr. Speaker, the Building Owners and Man- agers Association of San Francisco has left its mark on San Francisco and made it a more beautiful, healthy and happier city for a cen-tury. I ask this body to honor BOMA on May 19, its 100th anniversary. f MASS GRAVES HOLD THOUSANDS, KASHMIR INQUIRY FINDS HON. DAN BURTON OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, to- night I wish to call the attention of my col-leagues to the most recent developments in India-controlled Kashmir. In late August, the Jammu and Kashmir State Human Rights Commission stated that it had found evidence of 2,156 unidentified bodies buried in approxi-mately 40 mass graves, officially recognized for the first time, that pock mark the landscape of this long troubled region. This disturbing revelation, while horrific in scale and heart-breaking in scope, has the potential to serve as a catalyst to propel Kashmir forward, away from its violent past. For the first time, every-one in Kashmir, as well as the rest of the world, will be forced to acknowledge the wan-ton violence and unrest that have torn their communities apart. History has taught us that in conflicts like the one propagated on Kashmir and its peo-ple, the first casualty is always the truth. The findings in this inquiry have now irrefutably confirmed the very worst fears people like my-self who have been concerned about this issue since 1989. It is my sincerest hope that when finally faced with the sum of their ac-tions to this point, those responsible for these crimes will see the error of their ways and summarily be brought to justice; I also hope that all of the well intentioned people of the re-gion, whether they are Kashmiri, Pakistani, or Indian, can use this tragic circumstance to begin to work towards reconciliation, and fi-nally move towards a peaceful resolution for everyone living in Kashmir. I am submitting an article from the August 23, 2011 edition of the New York Times and strongly urge my col-leagues to read it. MASSGRAVES HOLDTHOUSANDS , KASHMIR INQUIRY FINDS (By Lydia Polgreen) NEWDELHI.\u2014Thousands of bullet-riddled bodies are buried in dozens of unmarked graves across Kashmir, a state human rights commission inquiry has concluded, many of them likely to be those of civilians who dis-appeared more than a decade ago in a brutal insurgency. The inquiry, the result of three years of in- vestigative work by senior police officers working for the Jammu and Kashmir State Human Rights Commission, brings the first official acknowledgment that civilians might have been buried in mass graves in Kashmir, a region claimed by both India and Pakistan where insurgents waged a bloody battle for independence in the early 1990s. The report sheds new light on a grim chapter in the history of the troubled region and con-firms a 2008 report by a Kashmiri human rights organization that found hundreds of bodies buried in the Kashmir Valley. Tens of thousands of people died in the in- surgency, which began in 1989 and was partly fueled by weapons, cash and training from Pakistan. According to the report, the bodies of hun- dreds of men described as unidentified mili-tants were buried in unmarked graves. But of the more than 2,000 bodies, 574 were identi-fied as local residents. ''There is every probability that these un- identified dead bodies buried in various un-marked graves at 38 places of North Kashmir may contain the dead bodies of enforced dis-appearances,'' the report said. The report catalogs 2,156 bodies found in graves in four districts of Kashmir that had been at the heart of the insurgency. It called for a thorough inquiry and a collection of DNA evidence to identify the dead, and, for the future, proper identification of anyone killed by security forces in Kashmir to avoid abuse of special laws shielding the military VerDate Mar 15 2010 04:04 Sep 15, \u2014 Extensions of Remarks E1625 September 14, 2011 from prosecution there. Thousands of people, mostly young men, have disappeared in Kashmir. Some went to be trained as mili-tants in the Pakistan-controlled portion of Kashmir and were killed in the fighting. Many others were detained by Indian secu-rity forces. The wives they left behind are known as half-widows, because the fates of their husbands are unknown. Parents keep vigil for sons who were arrested two decades ago. Parveena Ahanger's son Javed was taken away by the police on Aug. 18, 1990, and never seen again. An investigation found that he had been killed by security forces, but they have not been prosecuted, she said. ''I never got any response from the govern- ment,'' she said. ''I never got his dead body.'' After years of fighting in the courts to find out what happened to Javed, Ms. Ahanger was skeptical that the human rights report would get her son's body back, or bring her justice. ''If the high court doesn't give any justice on this issue, what will the state human rights commission do?'' she said. Zahoor Wani, an activist who works with the families of people who disappeared dur-ing the insurgency, said that the report was a welcome first step but that the govern-ment must identify the dead and allow fami-lies to bury their relatives. ''It is a very good thing that they acknowl- edge it,'' Mr. Wani said. ''These families have been living in a hope to see these people again. ''They are neither dead nor alive,'' he said. ''We need to move them to one pole or the other.'' Hari Kumar contributed reporting. f IN RECOGNITION OF MATTEO RIZZO HON. JACKIE SPEIER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to pay tribute to Matteo Rizzo, a life-long educator who is retiring as Super-intendent of the Jefferson Elementary School District, serving the communities of Daly City and Colma, California. In his tenure as Superintendent, Mr. Rizzo has been known for his personal involvement with all the stakeholders in his district, from teachers, to parents, to administrators and, most importantly, the students themselves. He served as the District's representative in staff contract negotiations, oversaw budget deci-sions, coordinated the recruitment, selection and assignment of teachers, principals and other personnel and put his imprint on every aspect of life and learning in the Jefferson Ele-mentary School District. As is the case in school districts across our country, Superintendent Rizzo was asked to do the impossible\u2014educate a diverse student population in an environment of dwindling fi-nancial resources, all the while staying fo-cused on preparing them to achieve to their utmost ability in an increasingly competitive world. To do this, Matteo relied heavily on the skills he gained as an Assistant Super-intendent, Principal, Vice-Principal and teach-er\u2014all within the Jefferson Elementary School District. His unsurpassed institutional knowl-edge and commitment to bettering the lives of young people will be sorely missed and not easily replaced. Fortunately, he leaves his successor with a legacy of excellence and community involvement that can be built upon in future years. Mr. Speaker, Matteo Rizzo is a living exam- ple of the benefits of public education and the fruits of hard work. A product of local schools, he is a graduate of San Francisco State Uni-versity, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics, his California Teaching Cre-dential and two Masters of Arts\u2014one in Edu-cation and another in Educational Administra-tion. He has been honored at every step of his career, including earning a ''California Distin-guished School'' award for Fernando Rivera Middle School in 2001, while serving as the school's principal. Mr. Speaker, Superintendent Rizzo has cer- tainly earned his retirement. On behalf of the Congress of the United States of America, I wish to thank him for his exceptional service to our nation and wish him only the best as he now has time to travel with his amazing wife, Clydie, play a lot more golf, do a little more duck hunting and, as rumor has it, learn to play the guitar. Matteo Rizzo, simply put, is a good man who spent his entire professional career doing good for his community. There's no need to tell that to the thousands of children he edu-cated, or his son, Matthew, and daughter-in- law, Jill, but the rest of America can benefit from knowing that extremely capable and committed professionals like Matteo Rizzo show up at school districts across this country every day with no other goal than to move our country forward, one student at a time. It is for these reasons and more that I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Super-intendent Matteo Rizzo for his service. f SURFACE AND AIR TRANSPOR- TATION PROGRAMS EXTENSION ACT OF 2011 SPEECH OF HON. MICK MULVANEY OF SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, September 13, 2011 Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I have seri- ous concerns about the policies of H.R. 2887, Transportation Extension, and the procedures the House used to pass it. First, I applaud the House Leadership's nu- merous statements and actions on working to-wards fiscally responsible policies that begin to close our deficit and balance our budget. Achieving those two goals will certainly help create an environment for the private sector to create jobs. H. Con. Res. 34, the House Budget for Fiscal Year 2012, laid a solid blue-print for leaders in this Congress to follow to-wards that end. Unfortunately, the actions taken yesterday fail to follow the spending plan that 235 mem-bers of the House agreed upon earlier this year. The House Budget calls for a transpor-tation policy that puts the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund and the insolvent Airport Improve-ment Program back operating within their means. Unfortunately, the bill we passed today sacrifices fiscal sanity for continued chaos. Unlike the House Budget, the policies of this Transportation Extension would continue cur-rent spending levels that, without the aid of previous bailouts, would leave the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport Improvement Pro-gram completely bankrupt. In fact, the Con-gressional Budget Office estimates the current policy embraced by this ''clean'' Transportation Extension would require future billion dollar bailouts in 2013 and every year thereafter over the next decade. Unlike the FY2012 plan called for in the House Budget, the action we took yesterday simply avoids the necessary dirty work associated with making sound fiscal decisions. Second, I was appalled by the procedure the House used in passing this bill. While I recognize the need to quickly move this bill by the start of Fiscal Year 2012, October 1, 2011, I do not believe that justifies suspending the House rules to move a bill that will cost tens of billions of dollars over six months without any opportunity to offer amendments either in the Rules committee or on the House floor. While such action does not technically violate our House or Conference rules, it certainly flies in the face of the higher standards those rules and protocols promote. Most notably, this multi-billion dollar Transportation Exten-sion was only available for no more than a 24- hour review period, as opposed to the three- day review standard. Also, the bill failed to in-clude a Congressional Budget Office cost esti-mate. Finally, it was unexpectedly voice voted without the opportunity for Representatives to record the collective voice of their constitu-ents. As a result, we are left to less desirable means to record their vote. Ultimately, yesterday's action is a missed opportunity to ''advance policies that promote greater liberty, wider opportunity, . . , and na-tional economic prosperity,'' as well as, ''to make government more transparent in its ac-tions, careful in its stewardship, and honest in its dealings.'' Had I the chance yesterday to vote, I would have voted against this Trans-portation Extension. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. ADAM SMITH OF WASHINGTON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, on the afternoon of Tuesday, September 13, 2011, I recorded an erroneous vote on Final Passage of the bill H.R. 2218. I intended to vote ''no'' on rollcall vote No. 705, on passage of H.R. 2218, the Empowering Parents through Quality Charter Schools Act. f IN RECOGNITION OF THOMAS MOHR HON. JACKIE SPEIER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to recognize the tireless public service of Thomas Mohr, who is retiring as President of Can ada College in Redwood City, California. VerDate Mar 15 2010 04:04 Sep \u2014 Extensions of Remarks E1626 September 14, 2011 I have had the privilege of knowing and working with Tom for many years. He is with-out peer and his calm demeanor and inspired leadership will be sorely missed. While serving as President, Tom revamped Canada College's planning process and turned it into a state leader in the accreditation process. He helped establish new four-year degrees in art, psychology, human services and business administration by forging new re-lationships with nearby Notre Dame de Namur University. Under Tom's watch, Can ada start- ed the Center for Teacher Efficacy to provide professional development opportunities for San Mateo County high school teachers. He also developed an Honors Transfer Program designed to support highly motivated students as they pursue their educational goals. Tom attracted more than $3 million in grants for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education at the college, estab-lished the Veterans Resource and Opportunity Center, and expanded the school's study abroad program. For these and other accom-plishments, President Mohr received the 2010 Shirley B. Gordon Award of Distinction from Phi Theta Kappa, the national honor society for two year colleges. Tom holds a Bachelor of Science from St. Louis University and a Master of Arts from the University of San Francisco. He has been an educator on the San Francisco Peninsula since working as a Chemistry teacher in the Jefferson Union High School District in 1961. Since then, Tom has served in nearly every capacity an educator can\u2014teacher, principal, assistant superintendent, superintendent and most recently, college president. Ironically, Tom thought he had retired six years ago when he left the San Mateo Union High School District. But, ever the public serv-ant, when his community came calling, Tom answered. He agreed to serve as Can ada's President on an interim basis, not knowing that it would stretch into a six-year commit-ment. Mr. Speaker, everyone in this body knows that there are no easy solutions to improving education in America. Were it only possible to clone a thousand or so Tom Mohrs, our na-tion's students would, indeed, be in capable hands. Since we can't do that, we are best served to simply follow his example and learn from the many lessons this lifelong educator has taught us. f PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE BOOKER T. WASHINGTON LEARNING CEN-TER ON THEIR 25TH ANNIVER-SARY HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is with great enthusiasm that I rise to congratulate The Booker T. Washington Learning Center as they reach their 25th milestone. This accom-plishment has been achieved through dedica-tion and committed service to the most vulner-able children and their families in my Congres-sional District. Since 1986, thousands of families have found support, opportunity and resources that have made a life-changing difference through the Booker T. Washington Learning Center. They have made it possible for people in my community to not only survive, but thrive. The center was originally founded under the parent organization, East Harlem Churches and Com-munity Urban Center by Reverend Leroy Ricksy who decided to help four children being raised by their grandmother. Today, the learn-ing center led by Executive Director, Reverend Kimberly Wright, has expanded its services to include an after school program, Saturday readings, adult education, summer camp, col-lege preparation and support, and art therapy. There is a very personal approach taken at Booker T. They offer children, teens, and adults the extra that they need in order to find success. The Learning Center is able to look back over these 25 years and feel proud of the in-vestment that they have made in so many lives. They have watched their children grow up to be extremely responsible, hard working, and productive citizens. There are so many who have overcome learning disabilities, achieved academic success\u2014even in a failing school system, graduated high school and gone on to college. It continues to be a cor-nerstone in my beloved East Harlem Commu-nity for families who would otherwise not be able to afford quality services for their children and have no place to turn. Their programs meet the needs of many who are in desperate need of guidance and academic support. The small group of young people the learning cen-ter started with are all enjoying their careers, their families, and their lives. They have over-come poverty and beaten the odds. Booker T. could not exist if it were not for people who believe in our youngsters and their work. They are most fortunate in having the most dedicated group of staff and volun-teers that continue to ensure that Booker T. offers quality enrichment programs that move people from poverty and despair to independ-ence and hope. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my col- leagues join me in celebrating with the staff and wonderful volunteers at the Booker T. Washington Learning Center on their mile-stone. Let's encourage others to help pro-grams like these to ensure that they continue to offer a helping hand to our fragile families and make certain that each child in our great nation find a second home, a second family, and a second school in our learning institu-tions. f INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION RE- GARDING THE USE OF LIBYA'S FROZEN ASSETS HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that Libya's frozen assets be used to pay for humanitarian relief and mili-tary operations associated with the current conflict in that country. Since Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi re- sponded to peaceful demonstrations by attack-ing Libya's own citizens, the United States has been actively engaged with our international allies in thwarting the ability of the Qaddafi re-gime to visit violence, murder, and destruction on the people of Libya. This past February, the United States imposed economic sanc-tions on Libya and froze the assets of its lead-ership, promising to hold Qaddafi, his family, and the government of Libya accountable for its human rights abuses. It is estimated that the value of these assets exceed $30 billion. On March 19, with the authority of the United Nations, the United States Armed Forces and our coalition partners launched Operation Odyssey Dawn in an effort to en-force the Security Council resolution. That mission has since come under NATO com-mand and is now called Operation Unified Protector. Our Armed Forces have assisted in combat operations including providing intel-ligence, aerial refueling, targeting, and other aspects of NATO's daily bombardment of Liby-an forces loyal to Qaddafi. We have already spent over one billion taxpayer dollars on this effort, with operations costing millions more every day. When the United States recognized the Transitional National Council as the legitimate governing authority of Libya on July 15, it paved the way for the Council to access some of the frozen assets to be used for humani-tarian relief and reconstruction efforts. With the Qaddafi regime at an end and the dictator himself on the run and in hiding, the United States will be moving into a posture that puts less emphasis on military operations and more focus on supporting the Transitional National Council's efforts to establish a working govern-ment. The United States should pursue with the Council the viability of using some of those as-sets to reimburse NATO members for the cost of their military operations in support of the Libyan people. I urge my colleagues to sup-port this resolution. f IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BRISBANE HON. JACKIE SPEIER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to cele- brate the 50th anniversary of the city of Bris-bane, California. Nestled in the lower slopes of San Bruno Mountain, ''the City of Stars'' stands as a symbol of light in the Bay Area. Back in the sixth century the Ohlone Indians enjoyed the abundance of resources the land offered. They thrived as hunters and gatherers until the Spanish conquistadores claimed the land in the early 16th century. The deed to the land changed hands sev- eral times before any significant development occurred. The need for real estate triggered by the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake brought new focus to the valley. Developers immersed themselves in the area with new vigor, naming their new hope for future growth ''Visitacion City.'' It wasn't until the arrival of Arthur Annis that the town finally got off the ground. The ''Daddy of Brisbane'' came to the area in 1929, bringing hope to an area that des-perately needed it. During the worst years of the Great Depression, Annis encouraged set-tlement and development through extremely cheap land prices. Between 1929 and 1933, over 400 homes were built. VerDate Mar 15 2010 04:04 Sep 15, Extensions of Remarks E1627 September 14, 2011 Annis' signature contribution was the re- christening of Visitacion City as Brisbane. There are two competing theories about how Annis chose the name Brisbane. His daughter insists he named it after the city in Australia, while others believe he named it after the American journalist Arthur Brisbane. Whatever its origins, the name Brisbane has come to mean a city that draws its strength from hope, even in the darkest times. This strong spirit can be seen in the tradi- tion from which Brisbane draws its nickname, the ''City of Stars.'' In 1940, Brisbane pre-pared to employ its citizens in the ongoing war efforts and the future was once again uncer-tain. Resident Arthur Kennedy struck out against the doubt by placing a simple star above his house for the holiday season. Soon, this symbol of brightness could be found above many a house, and the tradition lives on today during every Christmas. The city was incorporated in 1961. Since in- corporation, Brisbane has had twenty-five mayors, including John Turner, James Wil-liams, Jess Salmon, Ed Schwenderlauf, John Bell, Robert McLennan, S.J. Guardino, Julius Stern, Anja Miller, Art Montenegro, Paul Goercke, Jeannine Hodge, Don Bradshaw, Fred Smith, Bill Lawrence, Ray Miller, Lou Graham, Steve Waldo, Brad Kerwin, Lee Panza, Clara Johnson, W. Clarke Conway, Cyril Bologoff, Michael Barnes, and Sepi Rich-ardson. Brisbane also holds the distinction of being the first community in the United States in which a habitat conservation plan (HCP) was developed. This historic plan, developed in the 1980s, helped to save the Mission Blue but-terfly and the Callippe Silverspot butterfly. The HCP served as a model for an amendment to the Endangered Species Act. In addition to legal protections related to land use, Bris-bane's fog and ample rains succor the flora needed to create an environment in which these and other species of butterflies may roam largely unmolested over 3,000 acres of undeveloped land. Brisbane's reputation as a can-do commu- nity received national attention in 1990 when residents came together to rescue Humphrey, a disoriented humpback whale who regularly became stranded at various locations around San Francisco Bay. When Humphrey found himself stuck on an embayment very close to Brisbane's Sierra Point, hundreds of Brisbane citizens gathered to cheer the Coast Guard and Humphrey onward towards the whale's successful extraction. Brisbane hosts a thriving economy including a booming biotechnology sector, a popular harbor for private boats, and other more tradi-tional businesses such as a 100-year-old man-ufacturer of fruit juices, A.C. Calderoni. Even-tually, Brisbane will likely also be the site of a booming clean tech energy sector as the city redevelops vast parcels of unused lands near the bay. Brisbane's economy is so vibrant that the population of the city doubles during the workday. While not every step in its history has been easy, its residents have always pressed to-wards the future. Even as it has grown from its decidedly humble origins to its current pop-ulation of 4,282 residents, the sense of family and community that spurred its development has never diminished. Mr. Speaker, I ask this body to join me in celebrating the history and future of the city of Brisbane as it celebrates its 50th anniversary on September 10, 2011. f TRIBUTE TO MRS. MARGARET FUENTES GONZALEZ ZEPEDA OF SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS HON. CHARLES A. GONZALEZ OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask my col- leagues to join me in recognizing Margaret Fuentes Gonzalez Zepeda on the occasion of her 96th birthday and tribute at the Guadalupe Community Center in San Antonio, Texas. Born in 1915 Margaret ''Margarita'' Gon- zalez was the daughter of Simon Gonzalez and Maria Fuentes Gonzalez. Margaret and her family grew up in San Antonio, and in April 1931, she married Manuel Zepeda, a union that would last 44 years, produce three girls and one boy. Margaret worked for the San Antonio Hous- ing Authority for over 20 years and rose to the position of Assistant Manager. Additionally, Margaret was extremely active in the commu-nity, and she used sports as a method to mentor San Antonio youth. Through sports Margaret developed a strong sense of dis-cipline that she took to the Guadalupe Com-munity Center and to the City of San Antonio as a recreation leader. After retirement Margaret accelerated her own participation in sports, and in the late 1980s began her journey into the Senior Olympics. Since 1990 Margaret has partici-pated in Senior Olympics in a variety of sports including: bowling; walking; horse shoes; soft-ball and football for accuracy and distance; and each year has qualified for the National Games. At the age of 96, Margaret has won over 100 gold and silver medals. She has been to the National Games in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (twice); San Antonio, Texas; Tuc-son, Arizona; Orlando, Florida and has brought home the Gold or Silver (Tucson) every time. Margaret Zepeda has a ''never give up'' spirit that impacted the self worth of each child she mentored. She instilled in them pride and discipline, and an understanding that love and command of sports was the great equalizer. For her half century of community work and leadership to the children of San Antonio, I join in celebrating the tribute hosted at the Guadalupe Community Center by the cadre of successful women who began their lives under the tutorage of Margaret Fuentes Gonzalez Zepeda. f TRIBUTE TO SHERRI WINDER HON. JASON CHAFFETZ OF UTAH IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, today I honor Sherri Winder, a beautiful and devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and excellent member of my staff. Sherri passed away on Sunday, September 11th, 2011 in a tragic car accident in southern Utah. We are all stunned by the sudden and devastating loss of this wonderful woman. As a faithful employee, Sherri brought grace and style to everything that she did. She was an elegant lady. She was an extremely kind, caring, and selfless person. She was a faithful volunteer in her community and church. She made an immediate and profound impact in my office. My staff and I are each deeply af-fected by her loss. I am honored to have been one of the many people touched by Sherri's kindness and gen-erosity. Sherri lived the principle of gratitude\u2014 always expressing her appreciation to others and making them feel valued. Sherri was per-petually positive and instantly brought a smile to all those with whom she came in contact. Her love of life and sincere caring was con-tagious and welcomed by all. Sherri was involved in politics for all the right reasons. She was the first volunteer in Jon Huntsman's 2004 gubernatorial campaign, she was a prolific grass roots organizer, orga-nizing the efforts to incorporate Taylorsville as a city, and she was a stalwart employee serv-ing all who needed assistance. Sherri simply wanted to help people and strengthen our community. She was known and loved by peo-ple all across the Salt Lake Valley. But no more so than by the five loving children she and her husband Kent raised together. Sherri Winder leaves behind a legacy of service and gratitude. She is survived by her husband, Kent, and their five adult children, Mike and Karyn Winder, Aimee and Matt New-ton, Tami and Tom Larsen, Nathan Winder, and Isaac and Candalyn Winder, as well as 11 grandchildren with one on the way. On behalf of both my staff and the constitu- ents of the Third Congressional District who were served so well by Sherri, I extend my deepest sympathies to Kent and his family. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them dur-ing this most difficult time. And although we mourn the loss of Sherri at this time, we will always celebrate her brilliant life, cherish her wonderful friendship, strive to emulate her amazing qualities, and work as she did to improve the world and community around us. She will be sincerely missed, but her profound legacy will never be forgotten. f SURFACE AND AIR TRANSPOR- TATION PROGRAMS EXTENSION ACT OF 2011 SPEECH OF HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN OF MARYLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, September 13, 2011 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the Surface and Air Transportation Programs Extension Act, which would author-ize surface transportation programs through March and the Federal Aviation Administration through January. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the construction sector faced 13.5 percent un-employment in August. The programs we au-thorize in this bill create the projects to help put this industry back to work\u2014to rebuild roads and bridges, renovate airports, and ex-pand mass transit options. These are good jobs, here at home, that improve efficiency and economic competitiveness. But this bill is not enough. We cannot con- tinue short-term extensions and stop-gap VerDate Mar 15 2010 \u2014 Extensions of Remarks E1628 September 14, 2011 measures to make these critical investments. States need more certainty to plan their projects and industry needs to know that we are committed to rebuilding our infrastructure so they have the confidence to hire back em-ployees who have been laid off. Additionally, this bill does not include relief for those FAA employees who were fur-loughed through no fault of their own when Congress failed to extend authorization this summer. It is important to make these workers whole, and we should work quickly to provide retroactive pay. Mr. Speaker, we need an ambitious agenda of investment that will put Americans back to work, repair our crumbling infrastructure, and jumpstart our economy. We need a long-term reauthorization of these critical programs. The American people are waiting\u2014it's time to get the job done. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. JACKIE SPEIER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to state for the record that my vote against the Holt amendment to the Empowering Parents through Quality Charter Schools Act was made in error. I strongly support this amend-ment that requires the Secretary of Education to give priority to schools that make invest-ments in green building improvements. We must ensure that Federal investments in our schools set the highest standard for green school building practices. I remain a staunch supporter of green building innovation and I look forward to advancing this important cause in Congress. f HONORING J. CONRAD (JC) SENECA ON HIS NEW RESTAURANT, THE ARMOR INN TAP ROOM HON. BRIAN HIGGINS OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise today to honor J. Conrad (JC) Seneca upon the occasion of the opening of his new res-taurant, the Armor Inn Tap Room, in Western New York. An entrepreneur with a diversified portfolio of business interests, JC recently purchased the former Hoak's Armor Inn, located in the town of Hamburg. That establishment has un-dergone a tremendous rehabilitation, and will feature upscale dining in an historical atmos-phere. Located where it is, it is certain to draw the attention of Buffalo Bills fans, tourists and the local community. None of this comes as much of a surprise, however, because JC has been a substantial member of our community throughout his life. A native of the Cattaraugus Reservation in Ir-ving, JC was a multi-sport star athlete while at Silver Creek High School. After graduation, JC served with honor and distinction with the United States Air Force, eventually studying at Bryant and Stratton and at Buffalo State Col-lege. After a stint as a radio disc jockey, JC be- came incredibly active within the Seneca Na-tion and on behalf of Native Americans throughout the United States. JC currently serves as a Seneca Tribal Councilor, and has served in a number of business and govern-ment capacities on behalf of his nation. JC was a member of President-elect Bill Clinton's Transition Team and has led efforts to ensure cooperative working relationships between other governments and the Seneca people. You know, Mr. Speaker, we all are a prod- uct of our upbringing, and JC is no different. JC's father, William Seneca, an ironworker and World War II Marine veteran, served hon-orably as President of the Seneca Nation, and later served as Special Liaison Officer for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. JC's mom practiced nursing, and was later elected Clerk of the Seneca Nation. Without question, JC's parents served as a strong example for the value of public service and instilled in him a dedication to make contributions back to his own commu-nity. As a result, all of those who comprise all of his communities\u2014on a large or small scale\u2014are better for the contributions he con-tinues to make. JC's new enterprise will add dozens of addi- tional names to the list of employees\u2014native and non-native\u2014for whom he has helped cre-ate jobs in Western New York. That is why, Mr. Speaker, I urge you to join with me and with all Western New Yorkers in wishing the very best of luck to JC Seneca upon the open-ing of the new Armor Inn Tap Room, and to thank JC and his family for the many signifi-cant contributions that they make to life here in Western New York. f A TRIBUTE TO CHARITY CAMPBELL HON. TOM LATHAM OF IOWA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. LATHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Charity Campbell, a Norwalk physical education teacher known for her lead-ership and high expectations, in receiving the 2012 Iowa Teacher of the Year Award from Governor Terry Branstad. Along with teaching sixth and seventh grade physical education at Norwalk Middle School, Ms. Campbell is the Norwalk Middle School girls' track coach and girls' varsity track coach at Norwalk High School. It's her outstanding leadership qualities in addition to skills in physical education that make her special to the Norwalk community. For example, Ms. Campbell helped her craft and create a mentoring program for first-year teachers at Norwalk schools. She instructs teachers how to use activities that will in-crease the student's hands-on learning di-rected at helping them focus and succeed in the classroom. In 2010, Ms. Campbell's physical education program was named as a top observation pro-gram through PE4Life, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improve children's health and wellness in their everyday lives. I am honored to represent Ms. Campbell in the United States Congress, and I wish her the best in her continuing service to the Nor-walk community. I know my colleagues in the U.S. Congress will join me in congratulating and honoring Ms. Charity Campbell and her 15 years of teaching young Iowans. f TRIBUTE TO MR. R. CATER LEE HON. JO BONNER OF ALABAMA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. BONNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the life of a truly great American, Mr. R. Cater Lee, of Gulf Shores, Alabama, who passed away on August 13, 2011, at the age of 90. Mr. Lee was a veteran of World War II and a member of America's ''Greatest Generation'' who helped to liberate Europe from Nazi tyr-anny. He flew 31 missions with the 448th Bomb Group, Second Air Division, of the Eighth Air Force in the European Theatre. He proudly served as a bombardier and navigator aboard the B-24 Liberator. For his courage and service he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters. Mr. Lee so loved his country that he continued to serve in the U.S. Air Force Reserves during the Korean War, at-taining the rank of Major. After his service to his country, Mr. Lee came home to Alabama, eventually settling in Birmingham, where in 1966 he was one of the co-founders of Vulcan, Inc. He would serve as president of the company for twenty years. At the time of his death, he was chairman of the board of Vulcan Inc., in Foley. Not only a pa-triot and successful businessman, Mr. Lee was also a leader in his community. He was a past chairman of the South Bald- win Chamber of Commerce and of the Gulf Shores Water Board. He was a former mem-ber of the Gulf Shores City Council and recipi-ent of the Free Enterprise Person of the Year Award. Mr. Lee's love of country was only ri-valed by his love of family, community, and golf. He served as president of Gulf Shores Golf Club for many years. Mr. Lee cherished all four generations of his family. The loss of Mr. Lee is one that should be mourned throughout the state and nation, as he was the embodiment of American ideals of patriotism, hard work and giving back to one's community. On behalf of the people of South Alabama, I offer condolences to his daughter, Linda Lee Koniar and her husband, John, and his two sons, Bubba and his wife, Cheryl, and Tommy and his wife, Sandra. Mr. Lee had eight grand-children and seven great-grandchildren, all of whom he loved with all his heart. My thoughts and prayers go out to all his family. f VOTE ON H.R. 2587, PROTECTING JOBS FROM GOVERNMENT IN-TERFERENCE ACT HON. DANIEL WEBSTER OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. WEBSTER. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, September 15, 2011, I will be absent and un-able to cast my vote in favor of H.R. 2587, the Protecting Jobs from Government Interference VerDate Mar 15 2010 04:04 Sep 15, \u2014 Extensions of Remarks E1629 September 14, 2011 Act, because I will be in Florida attending the memorial service for my friend, David I. ''Dave'' Bitner. David Bitner was a great Flor-ida statesman, my esteemed colleague in the Florida legislature, and my personal friend for over 20 years. I was saddened by Dave's death on September 8, 2011, which came soon after his diagnosis with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). Although I wish to cast my vote in favor of H.R. 2587, my long-time friendship with Dave and his wife, Wendy, re-quires me to attend the memorial service in Dave's honor. I support the Protecting Jobs from Govern- ment Interference Act, and I voted in favor of H. Res. 372, the rule for H.R. 2587, in the Rules Committee hearing held on July 26, 2011. (Rules Committee Record Vote No. 121.) I strongly believe in the right of Amer-ican business owners to make decisions re-garding where and when to conduct business, and the right of states to determine the best labor policies for their citizens. I oppose ex-cessive governmental regulation and inter-ference by federal executive agencies that do not have the authority to supplant the best operational judgment of businesses in their employment, production, location, and other investment decisions. Recently, the National Labor Relations Board has taken unprece-dented, protectionist actions on behalf of labor unions that fly in the face of federalism, and this cannot be allowed to continue. I am proud to represent the constituents of the 8th Con-gressional District of Florida, which is a right- to-work state, and I will continue to oppose ef-forts to impede American private enterprise, capitalism, and economic freedom. Mr. Speaker, I would have voted ''yea'' in favor of H.R. 2587, had I been present, rather than in Florida for the memorial service for my friend, David Bitner, in support of his wife, Wendy. f HONORING LT. COL. ANTHONY SHAFFER, SENIOR INTEL-LIGENCE OFFICER, UNITED STATES ARMY RESERVE (RE-TIRED) HON. WALTER B. JONES OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to honor Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer, Military Intelligence Corps, for his twenty-five years of service as a field intelligence operative aid more than three decades of service to the na-tion in both the Army National Guard and Army Reserve. Col. Shaffer's extensive career started in January 1981, while still in high school, when he enlisted in the Ohio Army National Guard. He went on to graduate from Wright State University in 1986. And this year, 2011, Col. Shaffer was chosen as their College of Liberal Arts Alumnus of the Year. Col. Shaffer's storied career has been dis- tinguished by his willingness and ability to work at the cutting edge of our nation's intel-ligence community. He has successfully en-deavored to adapt new technology and use these capabilities to ensure the protection of the American people. It is likely that most of Lt. Col. Shaffer's work will never be fully rec-ognized\u2014but I can assure you it is appre- ciated by me and the American people. During his initial years of service, he de- ployed to Germany during REFORGER 85 to conduct anti-terrorism operations against the Red Army Faction, RAF, and other German based terrorism groups. He was also assigned to the Army's New York City Resident Office during a critical period when foreign terrorists were targeting the United States. In 1988 he attended training at ''The Farm'' where he graduated first in his class of the Military Operations Training Course, MOTC, at Camp Perry, VA. He was promoted to Captain in 1990 and was brought to active duty by the Army for the first Gulf War in 1991 where he worked to de-velop a key classified program named STARWATCHER B. After the conclusion of the first Gulf War, he was appointed to serve as the chief of the Army's global clandestine HUMINT collection program, and ran specific the Special Access Program, SAP, operation, unclassified nickname: CAROLINA MORNING, which netted highly significant information that was critical to the national leadership during the 1990s. He was the senior HUMINT advisor to the J2/Senior Intelligence Officer of Joint Inter-agency Task Force East, JIATF-E. JIATF-E conducted counter-drug operations in the Transit Zone between Columbia and the United States southern border. During this tour he was successful in integrating highly spe-cialized hybrid technology/human intelligence operations to obtain high value intelligence in-formation to support the operational forces. In 1995, Tony transitioned to Defense Intel- ligence Agency, DIA, as part of the consolida-tion of all Service, Army, Navy, Air Force, and USMC, controlled HUMINT into the Depart-ment of Defense. He created and directed Task Force STRA- TUS IVY\u2014a one-of-a-kind special mission task force that harnessed the skills of officers from the National Security Agency, NSA, Army Intelligence and Defense Intelligence Agency that conducted direct support to Department of Defense, Special Operations Command and other non-DoD agencies. After his promotion to Major, due to his highly sought after skills, he was assigned to serve at both the HUMINT Support Element, HSE, at both Special Operations Command, SOCOM, and the Joint Special Operations Command, JSOC. He also served as a team leader of classified element that provided di-rect support to the Director of Operations of Defense HUMINT Service, DHS. During this period of his career he partici- pated in multiple highly classified operations\u2014 the most notable, a project known as ABLE DANGER\u2014the controversial counterterrorism operation that was designed to detect, de-grade and counter Al Qaeda capabilities that was successful in detecting Al Qaeda cells op-erating within the United States before the 9/11 attacks. He had two peacetime overseas deploy- ments\u2014the first to Thailand where he was at-tached to the III Marine Expeditionary Force, MEF, to attend Exercise COBRA GOLD 1991; the second to New Zealand with attachment to the New Zealand Defense Force for Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration in mid 2001. Just after the 9/11 attacks, in December 2001, he was returned to active duty for a 30- month period, during which he commanded a DIA operating base and had two successful combat tours to Afghanistan. He commanded Field Operating Base, FOB, Alpha, a joint DIA/CIA brigade equivalent unit conducting classified collection and special op-erations support regarding terrorists just after the 9/11 attacks. During his two undercover combat tours in Afghanistan, he participated in the search for senior Al Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan and is credited for helping to break the back of the Taliban's first attempt to return to power in Af-ghanistan. Col. Shaffer received the Bronze Star Medal, BSM, for performance as an Oper-ations Officer of the HUMINT Support Detach-ment in Afghanistan supporting CJTF 180 and CJFT 121. After promotion to lieutenant colonel in 2005, he was attached to Navy's premier counterterrorism think-tank, DEEP BLUE at the Pentagon where he worked on key situa-tional awareness and counterterrorism tech-nology and tools. In 2005 to 2006, Tony worked with the U.S. Congress and testified on multiple issues that relate to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and intel-ligence failures. In 2006 he was assigned to and com- manded the Special Troops Battalion, STB, of the 9th Theater Support Command, Ft. Belvoir, VA. He was then, in 2007, selected to serve as the G6/Senior Information Officer, Anti-Ter-rorism Officer and Public Affairs Officer of the 94th Division, Force Sustainment, Ft Lee, VA\u2014the 94th Division was re-activated in 2008 and was one of Gen George Patton's key divisions that participated in the Battle of the Bulge, Ardennes, in 1944-45. He re-mained with the 94th Division until he reached his mandatory retirement date, MRD, in July of 2011. He continues to serve this great nation through his work at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies where, as a Senior Fellow, he continues to influence national defense strategy and policy through research and ad-vocacy of critical national security issues. Over these three decades Lt. Col. Shaffer has served with distinction and unmatched willingness to conduct high risk operations, while always recognizing the ethical and moral responsibly of his office. Lt. Col. Shaffer's keen operational judgment and dynamic leadership has contributed sub-stantially to the development of critical national level intelligence capabilities\u2014many of which remain in operation today. His influence over national defense and security is indelible and significant\u2014his service has constantly worked to identify threats and then develop capability to protect the American people. He consist-ently worked to influence national intelligence policy and capabilities to insure the security of the American people and has done so in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Army. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I would like to recognize Col. Shaffer's outstanding accomplishments, coura-geous attitude and past and present devotion to this nation. I wish to congratulate him, his wife Rina, and sons Alexander and Ryan on the completion of long and distinguished ca-reer. VerDate Mar 15 2010 04:04 Sep \u2014 Extensions of Remarks E1630 September 14, 2011 HONORING MACK STRONG AND ZOE HIGHEAGLE-STRONG HON. DAVID G. REICHERT OF WASHINGTON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a husband-and-wife team filled with love, faith, and determination. I'm proud to call them constituents and friends and I'm honored to be able to recognize their efforts on this floor today. Mack Strong and Zoe Higheagle-Strong will be honored on Saturday evening, September 17 by the Association of Washington Generals as the Washingtonians of the Year. Mack and Zoe earned the honor by founding and leading the TEAM-WORKS Academy, a program that ''develops strong minds, strong bodies, and strong character in underserved youth.'' Founded in 2002 by Mack and Zoe, TEAM- WORKS Academy grew out of many years of dedicated community service and a strong be-lief in the validity of their vision for the future. I am thankful that Mack, a graduate of the University of Georgia and a longtime fullback of the Seattle Seahawks, put down roots in the community. His selfless and tireless work on behalf of at-risk youth in my District and beyond is an inspiration. And his wonderful wife Zoe, a member of the Nez Perce tribe and the Executive Director of TEAM-WORKS, is an inspiration to us all. The tandem of Mack and Zoe in the Puget Sound region represent an unstoppable force in the betterment of our communities, schools, and families. It is clear that TEAM-WORKS is having a positive effect on the young people it directly serves. Over and over again, I hear stories and see the results of improved performance in the classroom and on the field of play. Mack, an accomplished athlete, believes that the link between consistent physical activity and school performance in our young people is a strong one. I couldn't agree more. I think the tactics of TEAM-WORKS should be rep-licated across this Nation. Mack and Zoe are doing remarkable things. Reading and math scores are up. Relationships at home have never been better. TEAM-WORKS is a god-send and Mack and Zoe show no signs of slowing down. Again, Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Mack and Zoe for their efforts and congratulate them on their well deserved honor. They truly represent the best of the State of Washington. In addition, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Association of Washington Generals for recognizing their efforts and pro-viding Mack and Zoe with the kind of official recognition too many of our best community leaders go without. f IN SUPPORT OF THE WORKERS OF THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE HON. LAURA RICHARDSON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 685,000 workers of the United States Postal Service (USPS), who face a devastating future which may close thousands of post offices, eliminate hundreds of mail processing facilities, lay off 120,000 of their colleagues, cut their pay, and end their collec-tive bargaining rights. Each day, the USPS processes an average of 584 million pieces of mail and delivers to 146 million addresses. In my home State of California alone, there are a total of 38,000 active and retired letter carriers. These employees are fixtures within their communities and are some of the most dedi-cated, hardworking people out there. That is why I have been a strong advocate for letter carriers throughout my career in public serv-ice. The United States Postal Service offers the most affordable postage in the industrialized world, while being able to sustain efficient de-livery schedules at no expense to the tax-payer. Established in 1775, the Postal Service and the thousands of families who depend on it now face an unprecedented crisis. Since 2006, an unsustainable retiree healthcare system has saddled the USPS with a $5.5 billion overcharge to be paid in full at the beginning of every year. Based on longterm projections which are routinely called into question, this fund has established an enormous, unused surplus, estimated by the Postal Regulatory Commission and the In-spector General of the Postal Service to be between $55-75 billion. No other Federal agency or private business is forced to pre-fund retiree health benefits in this manner. Since it is not funded by tax-payers, this requirement puts the USPS at a distinct competitive disadvantage. Fixing this problem would allow the Postal Service to compete more effectively with the private sec-tor and return to profitability. Without this mandate, the USPS would have actually been profitable to the tune of $611 million over the last 4 years, saving its $15 bil-lion line of credit from the U.S. Treasury to ride out the bad economy. Instead, the entire agency, which has not taken taxpayer funds for 30 years, is facing default. Its line of credit is nearly exhausted. Mr. Speaker, the real financial struggles at USPS do not stem from the cost of labor, but from the 2006 congressional mandate requir-ing the USPS to pre-fund future retiree bene-fits. Unfortunately, House Republicans are bent on destroying the Postal Service as we know it and using this crisis as an opportunity to weaken collective bargaining rights. The House Oversight and Government Re- form Committee conducted a hearing in April entitled: ''Are Postal Workforce Costs Sustain-able?'' Led by Committee Chairman D ARRELL ISSA, this hearing was held to investigate a re- cent agreement between the USPS and the American Postal Workers Union. Chairman I SSA's decision to hold a hearing to scrutinize and interfere with the collective bargaining process represents a dangerous precedent that could lead to more GOP inter-ference in labor-management agreements. In June, Chairman I SSA proposed H.R. 2309, the Postal Reform Act of 2011, which would establish a ''solvency authority'' with the power to unilaterally cut wages, abolish bene-fits, and end protection against unfair layoffs. It orders $1 billion worth of post office closures in the first year and another $1 billion worth of facility closures in the second year. It also ends Saturday deliveries. Mr. Speaker, 6-day delivery is an important service that the USPS provides to the Amer-ican people and is vital to its long-term sus-tainability. Ending Saturday deliveries reduces incentive for the American people to send mail through USPS and would lead to more jobs lost and larger reductions in service. If Saturday delivery ends, it is possible that 80,000 full- and part-time jobs could be elimi-nated. At a time when we are still recovering from the worst economic recession since the Great Depression, now is not the time to put thousands of jobs in jeopardy. The USPS estimates that cutting deliveries on Saturday will cut costs by 5 percent, but will slash mail delivery by 17 percent. Clearly the money saved by eliminating Saturday de-livery is negligible and does not justify the lapse in efficiency and the loss of jobs that would certainly follow. Reducing mail delivery service to 5 days a week would cause delays in the delivery of mail and would inevitably lead to increased costs due to the overtime Postal Service work-ers will be forced to endure in order to handle the backlog of mail. It is also vital for seniors who depend on mail-order prescription drugs and small businesses that need Saturday de-livery to meet payroll. Most importantly, ending Saturday service will remove the Postal Service's key strategic advantage over its competitors and result in a massive loss of revenue for the program. We can't allow House Republicans to pur- sue an agenda that threatens the wellbeing of thousands of working families in California and across the Nation. They want to turn back the clock on the progress that has been made over the last century to ensure that American workers have the right to organize and de-mand fair wages and benefits. We cannot stand by while thousands of American workers lose their jobs, and House Democrats are putting forth solutions that will take immediate steps to end this crisis without cutting jobs or resorting to taxpayer funded bailouts. Take for instance H.R. 1351, the United States Postal Service Obligation Recalculation and Restoration Act of 2011, which would re-align the Postal Service's retiree health prefunding schedule to a larger time period consistent with what the Postal Service can af-ford. It would do this by first establishing the exact size of the surplus and then transferring it to the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund where it belongs. Furthermore, when the Post Office Depart- ment became the Postal Service in 1971, em-ployees who belonged to the Federal pension fund started contributing to the new Postal Service. For employees who worked for both the Post Office Department and the Postal Service, the Federal and the postal pension funds shared responsibility. However, the Fed-eral fund paid for retirements based on 1971 salaries, not final salaries. In essence, the Federal fund collected full contributions, but paid only partial benefits. The USPS was shortchanged $75 billion as a result of this error. H.R. 1351 takes necessary steps to correct this by altering the methodology used to deter-mine the allocation of costs for retirement ben-efits between the Federal government and the USPS. By making these changes, Congress VerDate Mar 15 2010 04:27 Sep 15, \u2014 Extensions of Remarks E1631 September 14, 2011 has the ability to significantly help the USPS cover its expected $238 billion shortfall for the next decade. Now more than ever we must fight to pre- serve the legacy of the letter carrier and pro-mote the value of the services that the work-ers of the United States Postal Service pro-vide to millions of Americans every day. H.R. 1351 is supported by the National As- sociation of Letter Carriers, the National Asso-ciation of Postal Supervisors, the American Postal Workers Union, the National Rural Let-ter Carriers' Association and the National Postal Mail Handlers Union. Advocating for working people is very personal and important to me. You see, you are looking at a Member of Congress who had the opportunity to have a mother who was part of a bargaining unit, who was a member of a union. She had an opportunity to have someone advocate on behalf of not only herself, but her two daughters as well. And because my moth-er had that support, she was able to send her daughters to good schools, she was able to put braces on our teeth, and she was able to ensure that, yes, that little girl back in Los An-geles, California, would have an opportunity to one day become a Member of Congress. Now more than ever, postal workers, teach- ers, firefighters, police officers and all other public employees must stand together to pro-tect their jobs and their families, in California and across America. Mr. Speaker, the alternative to H.R. 1351 is a violent downgrade of Postal Service oper-ations which would cost tens of thousands of jobs immediately. Between their recent willing-ness to hold the nation's economy hostage for spending cuts and their attacks on worker's rights in Wisconsin, it appears that House Re-publicans would risk a total shutdown of the Postal Service if it meant further weakening the rights of public sector unions. That is why I stand with 192 of my col- leagues in our support for the thousands who play an essential role in connecting our people and building our communities. We cannot af-ford to lose so many jobs and hard-won bene-fits by failing to act on a common sense fix to an immediate crisis. f TRIBUTE TO MR. MELVIN E. PIERCE HON. JO BONNER OF ALABAMA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. BONNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of a truly wonderful man, Mr. Melvin E. Pierce, a longtime resident of Semmes, Alabama, who passed away Au-gust 19, 2011, at the age of 73. Mr. Pierce was a husband, father, friend, an entrepreneur and community leader. He wore many hats over his professional career, and is perhaps best known for his successful painting business. He began a career in painting as an apprentice and used his knowledge to later found and develop the Melvin Pierce Painting Company. He subsequently established Melvin Pierce Marine Coatings, Melvin Pierce Sand-blasting, Highway Maintenance, Inc., and Dothan, Inc. of Semmes. His community involvement ranged from president and founding member of ''Friends of Semmes,'' which pioneered the incorporation of Semmes, to recipient of the 2005 Woodman of the World Outstanding Citizen Award. He was one of the founding members of the Dixie Youth Baseball Program in Semmes. And, in 2003, he was honored with the Award of Grat-itude from the Semmes Community Park. Professionally, he was an active member of the Associated General Contractors (AGC) and the Associated Builders & Contractors. He was a board member of the Mobile Water and Sewer Board, the Abba Shrine Temple, Trade Builder's Association and Woodman of the World. His considerable involvement with con-tracting gave him the opportunity to play a major role in numerous construction and ren-ovation projects like the Mobile Convention Center and Mobile Government Plaza, the res-toration of the historic Alabama Capitol in Montgomery, and the Beau Rivage Resort and Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi. Melvin Pierce was the epitome of a commu- nity-minded businessman and volunteer and his involvement in so many different aspects of South Alabama will be hard to replace. In addition to possessing a charitable heart and an unequalled love of community, he helped found the Christmas parade, Azalea Festival, Easter Egg Hunt and a food pantry in Semmes. On behalf of the people of South Alabama, I would like to extend my deepest condo-lences to his wife of 50 years, Evelyn, as well as his surviving children, George, David, Deborah, Jay, Regina and Rebecca, as well as his grandchildren, and his family and friends. You are all in our thoughts and pray-ers. f HONORING REVEREND CARL GILLIARD FOR TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF SERVICE HON. JACK KINGSTON OF GEORGIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Reverend Carl Scott Gilliard for twenty-eight years of service to the Savannah, Georgia community. Reverend Gilliard, a na-tive of Savannah, has been diligently working to make Georgia a better place through his leadership, community service and passion. Reverend Gilliard has dedicated his life to helping others and serving his community. A graduate of Alfred Ely Beach High School and Morris Brown College, he first became ac-tive in civic affairs in 1984 when he served as the youth coordinator for the presidential cam-paign of Reverend Jesse Jackson. After work-ing with Reverend Jackson, Pastor Gilliard began his public affairs talk show, ''Tell It Like It Is,'' which became the number-one rated radio program for ten consecutive years. In 1995, Reverend Gilliard was ordained and served as pastor of the Miracle Christian Life Center for six years until he was appointed President of the Georgia Coastal Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Throughout Reverend Gilliard's years as a community activist, he has led a variety of successful efforts to improve the lives of his fellow citizens, including founding the Chat-ham County Youth Commission, chairing Unity in Our Community, starting the Savannah Out Marching Against Drugs movement, and orga- nizing prayer vigils throughout Savannah. Currently, Reverend Gilliard is the Host of ''The Urban Journal.'' In addition, Reverend Gilliard is the CEO of Savannah Feed the Hungry where twice a week he offers a short message of encouragement and prayers to the hundreds who come seeking food at the newly opened Life Center. I congratulate Reverend Gilliard on his many years of service. He has devoted his life and time to helping others and continues to make invaluable contributions to the city of Savannah and the state of Georgia, and I wish him many more years to come. f CONGRESS NEEDS A FRESH, BIPARTISAN START HON. DALE E. KILDEE OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I submit for the RECORD , a thoughtful, clear and eloquent opin- ion piece written for The Washington Post by my friend Congressman J OHN DINGELL . As the Dean of the House and one of the hardest working members of this body, Congressman D INGELL has seen many Congresses come and go and has witnessed countless suc-cesses and failures. His wisdom and experi-ence is unmatched. Every member of Con-gress, and those who aspire to be, will benefit from reading this and historians will find this article valuable in understanding the changes that have take place in Congress throughout the 20th century. It certainly is an important document that will continue to be a source of information about Congress for years to come. [From the Washington Post, Sept. 9, 2011] CONGRESS NEEDS A FRESH , BIPARTISAN START (By John D. Dingell) I am saddened by what I heard when I was home for the August congressional recess. The American people are fed up with finger- pointing, blame games and infighting by all of us in Washington\u2014the president, Congress and the media. They are angry and frustrated, and they want Congress to do its constitutional duty. Only 12 percent think we are doing a proper job. It is easy to see why the public is losing confidence in the federal government. In our debates over the fiscal 2011 spending bill and the debt limit, Congress put off its duties until the eleventh hour in favor of partisan squabbling and stubborn political games. I am ashamed of our performance\u2014of us all, on both sides of the aisle. As a mem-ber of Congress who takes pride in this insti-tution and holds its history and procedures in high regard, I am deeply disappointed by the unwillingness of members of all parties to come together for the common good. Our Founding Fathers intended no parties when they created this institution. And until recently, members took the time to stay in Washington and learn the substance of issues, as well as the rules laid out by our forefathers in the Constitution and by pre-vious generations in Congress. We learned how to draft good, bipartisan bills. Most members of Congress wouldn't remember, and for many Americans this may seem hard to believe, but there was a time not so very long ago when Republicans and Democrats worked well together. We worked long hours, typically five days a week or more for VerDate Mar 15 2010 04:04 Sep 15, \u2014 Extensions of Remarks E1632 September 14, 2011 months at a time. Members of both parties came to the table ready to work, debate and negotiate. For many years, legislation was drafted from the middle, and we passed bipartisan bills frequently. It wasn't uncommon for an important bill to get 400-plus votes; we didn't stop just because we had 218. Members didn't engage in partisan misbehavior for the sake of a good Twitter hit or the opportunity to call out the other side on cable news. Rather, members had respect for one another and for the political spectrum. They man-aged to limit outside parties from disrupting the legislative process for political gain. We in Congress are tearing our country apart and weakening the foundation estab-lished by great leaders before us. Is anyone in Congress truly proud that we have not produced a budget? That we caused the downgrading of U.S. government securities, as well as appalling disorder and confusion in financial markets? Or that this situation caused the lack of job creation and economic growth that has contributed to the hopeless-ness and misfortune of millions of Ameri-cans? Wrangling by all parties, from the top down, cripples our work, and media that en-courage confrontation instead of negotiation fuel the fire. Being locked into this system of starting from the far left or the far right and then doing just enough for passage may get a single bill done, but it's not a system that produces the best law that does the most good for all Americans. This partisan viciousness needs to stop. I am ashamed of our recent record. I am disgusted with our performance, Republican and Democratic alike. There has been failed leadership and, worse, failed following with-in the ranks\u2014and we owe the country far better. My daddy taught me that if God had wanted us to talk more and listen less, he would have given us two mouths and one ear. In our most combative moments, we must remember that no cause is greater than this institution and the ideals on which it was founded; no single man or woman is greater than this body and the collective wisdom we are capable of exhibiting. If we hold on to that core principle, we can make changes that will be better for Congress as an institu-tion and for the American people. We must all help this body improve and call upon our colleagues to join in doing bet-ter. It is our duty. If we do not, the people, in their righteous and justified outrage, will get rid of us all\u2014as well they should. I beg my friends in Congress and the administra-tion to put the interests of this great nation before partisan political interests and not let the rivalries of the past prevent us from act-ing in ways that will better the future of our nation.

ADAM SMITH OF WASHINGTON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, September 12, 2011, I was unable to be present for recorded votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ''yes'' on rollcall vote No. 699 (on the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 2076, as amended), ''yes'' on rollcall vote No. 700 (on the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 2633, as amended) and ''yes'' on rollcall vote No. 701 (on the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 1059). f OUR UNCONSCIONABLE NATIONAL DEBT HON. MIKE COFFMAN OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, today our national debt is $14,717,868,058,346.24. On January 6, 2009, the start of the 111th Congress, the national debt was $10,638,425,746,293.80. This means the national debt has increased by $4,079,442,312,052.44 since then. This debt and its interest payments we are passing to our children and all future Americans. f ''CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITIES'' PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT AWARD WINNERS HON. BILL SHUSTER OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the winners of the ''Consider the Possibilities'' Personal Achievement award from the HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital of Altoona, given to encourage and reward personal achievement within its community. HealthSouth has presented rehabilitation awards to members of their community who have remained steadfast in overcoming an ill-ness or disability. This year I congratulate: Danielle Gibbons and Frank Germino, winners of the ''Consider the Possibilities'' Personal Achievement Award; and Shelly Beaver, Sherri McGregor, and Joe Reed, winners of the Advocate Award. Danielle Gibbons is the winner of the HealthSouth ''Consider the Possibilities'' Per-sonal Achievement Award. On June 18, 2010, Danielle, 37 years old at the time and a single mother of two, was involved in a motor vehicle accident. Danielle was driving when another vehicle crossed the center line and hit her head on. The other driver was killed and Danielle was left with life threatening injuries. Danielle had to be cut out of the car, and was transported to the hospital where surgeons were ready to amputate her right leg. Instead, she insisted that she be flown to Pittsburgh where she underwent nine surgeries in order to keep her right leg. In October 2010, Danielle began physical therapy and she made remarkable progress. In less than one year, she was ambulating independently. Danielle has returned to work full time as a nurse practitioner. I commend her for her per-severance and good attitude. Frank Germino is also the recipient of the HealthSouth ''Consider the Possibilities'' Per-sonal Achievement Award. On October 9, 2010, Frank's life was changed forever when he fell 12 feet from a tree stand while hunting. Frank broke his back in five places. After a five hour surgery, he was told that he would never walk again due to the extensive damage that was incurred. Frank was determined to walk again and after months of rehab and therapy, Frank did just that. His courageous spirit is an inspiration to everyone around him. Shelly Beaver and Sherri McGregor are the recipients of the HealthSouth Advocate Award. Through the efforts of Shelly Beaver, Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialist, and Sherri McGregor, Education and Training Specialist at Penn State Altoona, ''Sense-ational En-deavors'' was developed. The program cre-ates a combination of sensory activities, phys-ical movement, and social skill development. In addition to therapeutic programs, campers engage in recreational activities and exercise tailored to their ability. Both Shelly and Sherri have dedicated their lives to enriching the lives of countless children. Joe Reed is also the recipient of the HealthSouth Advocate Award. Joe is respon-sible for bringing a Miracle League to Blair County. The Miracle League provides baseball for all children with special needs. The field is constructed using a cushioned rubber surface with everything flat and level so there is noth- ing to trip over. Joe first heard about the Mir-acle League during a trip to Moody, Alabama while visiting friends in the fall of 2003. About two weeks later he read about it in the Kiwanis Magazine and knew this was some-thing that Blair County needed. He returned to the Moody field, and then went to see the original Miracle League field in Conyers, Geor-gia. There, he met with the Executive Director of the Miracle League Association, Diane Alford. After getting permission to use the land owned by the Kiwanis Club of Eldorado, he assembled a Board of Directors in early 2004 and began fundraising and promotion. Joe raised over $150,000. Construction began in the fall of 2006. The total cost of the project was $497,000. Opening day was July 21, 2007 with 24 children. Today they have 125 players and over 175 volunteers. Congratulations to Danielle, Frank, Shelly, Sherri, and Joe. Their accomplishments are a testament to us all that with hard work, per-sistence, and a big heart, we can overcome any hardship. I congratulate each of them on their perseverance, and I wish them the best as they continue to overcome illnesses and disabilities while setting an example for the rest of the community. f TRIBUTE TO LANCE CPL. TRAVIS MICHAEL NELSON HON. JO BONNER OF ALABAMA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. BONNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Lance Cpl. Travis Michael Nelson who recently lost his life in the service of his country. We will always be indebted to his sacrifice for our freedom and we join his family and many friends in mourning his loss. Lance Cpl. Nelson was assigned as a rifle- man with the 1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regi-ment, 2d Marine Division from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. He lost his life during combat operations in Helmand Province, Afghanistan on August 18, 2011, one month after his unit's arrival. He was a dedicated Marine who loved his country and loved the Marine Corps. He al-ways wanted to be a Marine and beginning at VerDate Mar 15 2010 04:04 Sep 15, \u2014 Extensions of Remarks E1633 September 14, 2011 the age of 14 he devoted his youth to pre- paring for his eventual role as a defender of America. Prior to his active duty service, he was a member of the Young Marines of Pen-sacola, Florida and the Pace High School Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps program. A native of Pace, and a resident of Bratt, Lance Cpl. Nelson, also had relatives in the nearby South Alabama towns of Atmore, Brewton, East Brewton and Daphne. On behalf of the people of Alabama, I wish to extend condolences to his parents, Scott and Beckie Nelson; his brother, Daniel Nelson; his half brother, Chandler Case; sisters, Jenna Nelson, and Anna Nelson; and grandmothers, Anna Sanspree and Louise Nelson; as well as his fiance, Madeline Cates. You are all in our thoughts and prayers. Mr. Speaker, I would like to add to this trib- ute the words of Sherry Digmon, publisher of Atmore magazine made in honor of Lance Cpl. Nelson. ''In tragedy, we come together. Atmore and the surrounding area came together in August as we all mourned the death of Marine Lance Cpl. Travis Nelson who was killed while on duty in Afghanistan. He was 19. Most of us didn't know LCpl. Nelson, but we all knew him. His was the face of the young man who always wanted to be a Marine, who loved the flag and country, and who enlisted to preserve our freedoms. On Friday, August 26, as we waited for the funeral procession to make its way down Main Street from the First Baptist Church to Oak Hill Cemetery, we looked at the people around us, almost all holding flags\u2014the veterans lined up on the sidewalk in front of the American Le-gion building; the kids and the older folks; people who came out of their businesses and stood in the mid afternoon sun. The Patriot Guard Riders came to Atmore to accompany the body of LCpl. Nelson and his family from Petty Eastside Chapel Funeral Home to First Baptist Church, then from the church to Oak Hill Cemetery. My hat is off to this fine group of men and women on motor-cycles who show their respect to the fallen soldier by honoring and protecting the sanctity of his funeral and burial. Someone in our group said, ''That's Amer- ica.'' We agreed. And then I said, ''That's Atmore.'' This was one event I hope never to witness again\u2014the funeral of a young soldier. I hope never again to think about how a mama feels when she sees the officers standing at her front door. How a fiance \u00b4e feels when she finds out her intended has been killed. How the men in his unit felt when they heard he didn't make it.'' f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, on Sep- tember 13, 2011, I was absent from the House and missed rollcall votes 702 and 703. Had I been present for rollcall 702, on agreeing to the amendment, Holt of New Jer-sey Amendment No. 7 to H.R. 2218, the Em-powering Parents through Quality Charter Schools Act, I would have voted ''Aye.'' Had I been present for rollcall 703, on agreeing to the amendment, King of Iowa Amendment No. 8 to H.R. 2218, the Empow-ering Parents through Quality Charter Schools Act, I would have voted ''no.'' f CELEBRATING ALYCE L. DIXON ON HER 104TH BIRTHDAY HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in celebrating Alyce L. Dixon on her 104th birthday on September 11, 2011. As the nation and the city recalled a tragic day ten years ago that changed the lives of many and altered American history, the Dis-trict of Columbia celebrated Alyce's birthday and applauded her for her support to the country and to the city. Alyce Dixon has spent most of her life as a resident of the District of Columbia. After grad-uating from Paul Lawrence Dunbar Senior High School, she attended Howard University in the District. Ms. Dixon worked at the Lincoln Theatre, at an insurance company, and was one of the first civilian employees at the Pen-tagon, from which she retired after 35 years of service to the federal government. Alyce Dixon was one of the first women to join the military and one of the first African- American women to become a member of the Women's Army Corps. While in the Army dur-ing World War II, Ms. Dixon served as part of the 6888th Postal Battalion in France, Scot-land, and England, where she and other Afri-can-American women sorted mail for soldiers. Before retiring from the military, Ms. Dixon re-ceived the Good Conduct Medal to commemo-rate her service to the Army. She continued to serve the public by volunteering at Wash-ington Hospital Center and Howard University Hospital for 12 years. As a resident of the Washington, DC VA Medical Center, Alyce is loved by the hospital staff, personnel, and residents alike. She has the unique ability to bring joy to others, and is known especially for her bubbly personality and comedic storytelling. Ms. Dixon is a member of Jones Memorial United Methodist Church, where she has graced the congregation with inspirations for a long life, filled with joy and laughter. She has also supported D.C. students in their pursuit of higher education through generous donations to church scholarships and youth programs. In celebrating this significant milestone, we acknowledge the extraordinary personal quali-ties and contributions of Alyce Dixon to her family and to our community. Her birthday gives me, her family, and friends, as well as the residents of the District of Columbia, an opportunity to thank her for her many gifts of love, friendship, and consideration for others. I ask the House to join me in celebrating the 104th birthday of Alyce L. Dixon, a special woman whose service to this country and community is greatly appreciated. RECOGNIZING THE YOUNG AMERICA'S FOUNDATION HON. TOM McCLINTOCK OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the attack against our nation ten years ago today was our generation's Pearl Harbor. Indeed, in many ways it was far more infamous. More Americans died on September 11th than in the attack on Pearl Harbor. It was an attack not upon some distant outpost but upon our na-tion's greatest city and our nation's capital city. It was an attack not upon heavily armed war-ships, but upon defenseless Americans peace-fully going about their business. This atrocity set new records for its ruthless- ness and barbarity and depravity. Benjamin Netanyahu called it a ''wake-up call from hell,'' and that's exactly what it was. It is appro-priate, though, to note one constant that de-fines us as a people and that guarantees us that all will come right. I speak of something that can only be described as the Spirit of America. The attack on our nation ten years ago re- minded us that the American spirit is still very much alive, and that this generation is more than capable of rising to great acts of heroism. The attack ten years ago produced a pan- theon of heroes\u2014Americans who had gone about their business one peaceful morning, and in a few brief moments found themselves facing well prepared, intractable and barbaric adversaries. At that fateful moment, they rose to the oc- casion. They resisted with everything they had. On December 7th, cooks became gun-ners and nurses passed the ammunition. On September 11th, office workers became res-cue workers and businessmen laid down their cell phones and took up hand-to-hand combat in the skies over Pennsylvania. Centuries from now, Americans will proudly remember the story of the young men and women aboard Flight 93 as it headed for our nation's Capitol: how they responded instantly to their country's peril \u2014 and armed only with their bare hands stopped cold those who would destroy our nation. In his last words heard over his cell phone, Todd Beamer asked\u2014not just of his fellow passengers, but of all of his fellow countrymen: ''Are you guys ready''? His answer on behalf of us all was, ''Then let's roll.'' The memory of firefighters and police offi- cers rushing into the burning buildings as ev-eryone else rushed out personified duty and honor for an entire generation. For those young people in our nation who were not alive to experience, or were too young to remember that day just over ten years ago, we have an obligation as a society to pass on our memories and the lessons we learned, purchased at the high price of inno-cent life and years of conflict. I rise today in recognition of the ongoing work of the Young America's Foundation to preserve our history for future generations. Each year Young America's Foundation helps students\u2014many of whom comprise the ''9/11 generation''\u2014to properly remember the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist at-tacks through their 9/11: Never Forget Project. Young America's Foundation began this pro-gram in 2003. VerDate Mar 15 2010 04:04 Sep Extensions of Remarks E1634 September 14, 2011 Young America's Foundation works with stu- dents to establish American flag memorials\u2014 displays consisting of 2,977 American flags representing each person tragically killed in the terrorist attacks. This year, students at more than 280 schools erected such memo-rials on their school grounds. Students held campus-wide moments of silence or prayer on September 11, at 9:11 a.m., hosted patriotic speakers and first responders at their schools, and provided 9/11: Never Forget posters and other materials to distribute on the anniver-sary. Young America's Foundation is making sure that future generations understand the events of that horrific day, remember its vic-tims and remember the many examples of courage, patriotism and dedication which have, and will continue to inspire so many. This tenth anniversary year is not just a time to memorialize the fallen\u2014as important as that is. This upcoming September 11, we humbly celebrate America's endurance, strength, and goodness. In doing so, we will ensure that fu-ture generations will never forget. While we can erect grand edifices and give speeches about 9/11, it is this simple and poignant tribute in remembrance of those we have lost and all those who serve that speaks loudest across the years. It is my privilege to rise today and thank the Young America's Foundation for its ongoing service to our na-tion and our posterity. f EMPOWERING PARENTS THROUGH QUALITY CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT SPEECH OF HON. JUDY BIGGERT OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, September 8, 2011 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2218) to amend the charter school program under the Ele-mentary and Secondary Education Act of 1965: Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 2218, the Empowering Par-ents through Quality Charter Schools Act. While there is no silver bullet to resolve all the problems facing our nation's education system, this bill represents a critical step to-ward better preparing our children to meet the challenges of a 21st century economy. It is also the first major element of reform to be acted on this year by either chamber of Con-gress. We all want our kids to be able to attend a great school. It's like my father told me, ''If you have a good education, you can accomplish anything.'' That's why transparent and accountable charter schools are so important. They ensure greater access among our children to the high-quality education they deserve. Moreover, charter schools often operate in flexible and innovative ways that promote student success. Unfortunately, demand for these opportuni- ties continues to outpace supply. Over 400,000 U.S. students remain on waiting lists for enrollment in charter schools. That's why I support H.R. 2218, which con- tains provisions that will remove barriers to the establishment of charter schools, improve aca-demic performance, and reduce the number of students waiting for admission. This legislation also establishes commonsense quality con-trols that will protect students and taxpayers alike. The bill requires accurate assessments of schools though independent financial au-dits, and establishes clear academic and per-formance standards. Following passage in the House, this bill will be sent to the Senate, where I hope it re-ceives the consideration it deserves. And, should it be signed into law, I will continue to work with my colleagues to monitor its impact and ensure that our nation's charter school system continues to reflect the transparency and accountability required by this legislation. HONORING SERGEANT KEVIN GLASER HON. JO ANN EMERSON OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 14, 2011 Mrs. EMERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Sergeant Kevin Glaser of Sikeston, Missouri, for his 28 years of dedicated law en-forcement with the Missouri State Highway Patrol. The people of my congressional district and the state of Missouri are grateful for Kevin's commitment to ridding our commu-nities of illegal drug activity. For 22 years Kevin has been on the front lines of drug enforcement in Missouri as the leader of the Southeast Missouri, SEMO, Drug Task Force. The SEMO Drug Task Force's main objective is to crack down drug creation, distribution and use through the southern Mis-souri. Kevin commanded the task force for over 16 years. Kevin displayed courageous leadership in the face of great challenges in the name of safer Missouri communities. As methamphet-amine use spread across rural America, Kevin and his squad made record arrests and sei-zures. In fact, over 75 percent of their efforts in drug enforcement were fighting the scourge of meth use in southern Missouri. In a 1997 L.A. Times article, Kevin was quoted as saying: ''It's hard to imagine a drug controlling you the way it does . . . They see their family falling apart, their bodies falling apart, but the only thing that matters to them is the dope.'' This drug was Kevin's enemy and the SEMO Drug Task Force's enemy, and they fought the enemy tirelessly. I am thankful for Kevin's dedicated service with the Missouri State Highway Patrol. I am excited for his retirement, although I hear he is still playing an advisory role with the offi-cers' training. Kevin, I wish you the very best on this new venture.
