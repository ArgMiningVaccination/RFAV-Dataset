We provide care to men, women, infants, children and adolescents, and seniors from all walks of life. Our clinic provides treatment for almost any acute or chronic medical condition that can be taken care of in an outpatient setting. However, in truth we treat individuals, not diseases. Diseases are groups of symptoms, and symptoms are the body's way of signaling that something is out of balance. We use these signals as part of a broad assessment of each individual's unique physical, biochemical, genetic, psychological, and spiritual state of being. Within this person-centered context, we focus on building health by removing the causative disturbances preventing the body from being in a state of balance and by supporting, through natural therapeutics, the incredible self-healing capability of the human body. By individually building health and improving function, disease states improve and symptoms resolve on their own.
